          the second Number for this year of the Zeitschrift <U+FB01>ir Ma
  IN thematik       und Physilc there is a paper by Bauschinger, chie<U+FB02>y
 relating to the integral               which occurs in the second funda
                                 71,-,
 mental theorem of the mechanical theory of heat, where dQ
 denotes an element of the quantity of heat which a body takes
 up in the course of any reversible change of condition, and T
 the absolute temperature of the body at the moment of absorb
 ing this element of heat. Bauschinger developes an expression
 which represents the value of the integral for <U+FB01>nite changes of
 condition under certain simplifying circumstances, and which,
for the case where the <U+FB01>nal condition is the same as the initial
condition, and the body accordingly goes through acircular pro
cess, becomes equal to nothing.               In consequence of this last
circumstance, Bauschinger supposes that the equation he has
developed expresses a general principle, which includes, as a
special case, my principle of the equivalence of transformations
in circular processes.
     I cannot say that—I agree with this view of the import of his
developments.

contained a principle applicable to reversible processes in which
the initial and <U+FB01>nal conditions are not identical, a principle which
not only have I tacitly regarded as implied therein, but have
several times explicitly stated.
      If,   indeed, the integral                    £19
                                                          becomes equal            to nought every
time that the body, after having passed through various changes,
comes back to its initial                       condition, the expression                             1,1,9   must be
the complete differential of  magnitude which   adetermined by                     is
the existing condition of the body at any given time, without
reference to the way in which   came into this condition—that
                                                     it
is to say, to the intermediate conditions which     has succes                              it
sively assumed between its initial and its actual conditions.
Accordingly, in the case of the condition of the body being
determined             by
                 any two independent variables, the expression
          must be the complete differential of                            function of these vari

sion having reference to these variables,   must satisfy the known  it
conditions of integrability.
   The difference between differential expressions which satisfy
these conditions, and-such as do not satisfy them,           so often                             is
mentioned in my papers, that in the collection of my memoirs                                                       I

Far as am from denying that such developments may be of
great use to the theory of heat,                   I
                                   nevertheless do not think that
it can be said of an equation so obtained, that it expresses a new
general principle wherein mine is included as a special case.     In
my opinion, developments of this kind are only to be regarded
as the more complete working out of algebraic calculations       for
which the data were already furnished by the preexisting       fun
damental equations.
   Bauschinger compares his development with those which                           I
have given in my paper “ On the Application of the Principle of
the Equivalence of Transformations to Internal Work” *, and
contends that          I
                 have availed myself of a newly introduced mag
nitude, which           I
                 call Disgregation, and of the hypothesis “that
the mechanical work which heat is capable of producing through
any change of arrangement is proportional to the absolute tem
perature at which that change takes place,” while he has worked
out his development on purely mathematical principles without
any such help.    He here seems to have overlooked the fact that
in this paper          I
                had something quite different in view from what
he has treated in his.   My object was to determine not only the
quantitative value, but much more, the physical signi<U+FB01>cation of
the                 and as a matter of fact I have established
     integralde-Q;
that it may be decomposed into two essentially distinct factors,‘
of which one depends solely on the temperature, and the other
solely on the arrangement of the constituents of the body.
   When Bauschinger’s paper appeared, I had recently completed
                                                         ‘

other matters, Ihave discussed the determination of the integral

                                    a
has done; but nevertheless all the equations which there occur
are deduced simply as consequences from the two fundamental
equations already named.
      may perhaps be not without interest
     It                                            communicate  ifI

      a passage
   At page 1l4 of the paper, the following equation, likewise
relating to the second fundamental theorem of the mechanical
theory of heat, is discussed:

                t

        is   same  quantity that has been previously denoted                                       by   T;
lastly,    denotes
           A        the thermal equivalent of the unit of work.
This equation      referred to               by     “ the equation
                     is             Bauschinger as

                                             §    1.
     We will in this
                   development again take as our starting-point
the two fundamental equations already mentioned,       means of                      by

quantity of heat absorbed during an in<U+FB01>nitely small change of
the body’s condition.    dW further expresses the external work
simultaneously performed by the body, and (ill the alteration
which is thereby produced in the magnitude, denoted in the title
of this paper by the word ENERGY. When                       I
                                                  introduced the
magnitude U into the theory of heat for the <U+FB01>rst time*, I gave
it no particular name, but contented myself with de<U+FB01>ning its
signi<U+FB01>cation by a de<U+FB01>nition which amounted to saying that this
magnitude was the sum of the actual heat gained by a body and
of that consumed in internal work, starting from any given initial
condition.    Since, however, W. Thomson, who subsequently in
troduced this same magnitude into his equations, has proposed
for it the convenient name of Energy, I have adopted this ex
press10n.
   The peculiarity of the magnitude U, whereby it is distin
guished from the other variable quantities occurring in the above
equation, is this, that the initial condition of the body being sup
posed given, it is completely de<U+FB01>ned by the actual condition of
the body at any time, without reference to the way in which the
body arrived at that condition, whereas the magnitudes W and Q
depend not only on the actual condition of the body, but also on
the manner of its transition to that condition from its initial state.
   A slight simpli<U+FB01>cation can still be introduced into the above
equation. In one of the Additions to be found in my Collec
                                                              ‘

when it is expressed not in the usual measure, but in heat
measure (that    is,when we adopt for        as unit the quantity of
                                               it

Accordingly,   since  W   denotes   the external   work expressed in
mechanical units, the product AW denotes the external work
expressed in thermal units. We will express this                 by

mental equations (Ia) and (Ila), other equations which may serve
for the determination of energy and entropy, and make the pro

   Equation (Ia) applies to non-reversible as well as to reversible
alterations. But in order to be able to -bring this equation into
conjunction with equation (Ila) ,we will assume that the alteration
to which equation (Ia) relates    the same as that to which equa

     We willnow assume that the condition of the body    de<U+FB01>ned              is
by   any two variables, which we will provisionally denote quite,

condition of the body, independently of the way in which the
body came into this condition, must be capable of being expressed
by functions of these variables, in which the variables themselves
may be regarded as independent of each other.              Accordingly
the magnitudes S and U must likewise be regarded as functions
of the independent variables a: and y.
   This, however, does not hold good respecting the magnitude w,
since, even if it is agreed that only reversible processes are to occur,
the external work (Werk), which is performed during the passage
of the body from a given initial to a given <U+FB01>nal condition, depends
not only on what the initial and <U+FB01>nal conditions are, but also
upon the succession of intermediate conditions through which it
passes, or upon the way in which the change takes place.            The
differential coe<U+FB02>icients                              are indeed de<U+FB01>nite functions

foregoing magnitudes are functions of .2- and y.     But if now one

magnitudes. For this reason I have not called En, simply the

By   aid of this equation we can immediately refer either of the
equations (24) and (25) t0 the other.
    By integration of the complete differential equations (22) and
 (23), each of the two magnitudes S and U can be determined
except as to a constant that still remains unknown.
    Of course any other variable y might be substituted for the
variable T in these complete differential equations, if it appeared
appropriate for special purposes to make the substitution, as
might be done without any dif<U+FB01>culty if T is supposed known as
a function of w and y, and therefore does not require to be further
dwelt upon.

    All the foregoing equations a‘l‘e developed in such a way that
no limiting conditions. are set up in relation to the external
 forces which act upon the body, and to which the external Work
has reference.       We will now consider a particular case, which
 is of specially frequent occurrence, rather more closely.            1 refer
 to the case where the only extraneous force which acts either to
 hinder or promote the change of condition in the body, and so
 occasions a positive or negative expenditure of work, is a pres
 sure uniformly distributed over the whole surface of the body, and
 everywhere directed perpendicularly to the surface of the body.
    In this case external Work will be performed only in the case
 of changes of volume, and the expression for it is very simple.
 Thus if p is the pressure referred to a unit of surface, the exter~
 nal work (Arbeit) expressed in mechanical units, accompanying
 a change of volume represented by do, is dW =pdv, and hence

    Remarks on his Determination            of       the Figure of the Earth from
    Geodetic Data *.
I         HAVE
             read the remarks of Captain Clarke, in your Num
      ber for March, on my method of determining the mean
<U+FB01>gure of the earth from geodetic data, as set forth in the third
edition of my ‘Figure of the Earth,’ with the care which any
thing proceeding from such an authority on such a subject
                             I
justly demands 3 but see nothing in them to convince me that
Bessel’ s method is not erroneous.     In the present communica
tion   hopeI to make  this matter  clear.                    I
                                             propose, <U+FB01>rst, to point
out in what Bessel’s method is erroneous; secondly, to explain
my own method, as already published; thirdly, to suggest an
improvement of my method.
            I. To point out in what       Bessel’s method is erroneous.
      2.   In obtaining by geodesy
                                the <U+FB01>gure_of the earth, there are
two classes of errors which we have to diminish as much as pos
sible—those arising from observation and measurement, and
those arising from the irregularities of the actual surface and
mass of the earth, as far as it differs from being a perfect sphe
roid of equilibrium.    The latter clas        as all now acknow
                                                             is,
ledge, much the most important.        Captain Clarke says of these
errors, that they “ are in their average magnitude very much
larger than the probable errors of astronomical determinations of
latitude, and indeed overwhelm the errors of the geodetical ope
rations.” Bessel’s method for diminishing both classes of errors,
which he attempts to do              by
                              one process, Captain Clarke explains
with great perspicuity.   Each arc      subdivided into subordinate

    It is in this that think that he is wrong.        will now show                      I
    why. Assuming a: to be an independent variable amounts, as
    the process shows, to making the sum of all the corrections of
    latitude of the several stations of the are equal to zero.   Hence
    by this process a- (the correction of the reference-stati0n* of the
    arc), with its sign changed, is equal to the sum of the relative
    corrections of the other stations of the are divided by the whole
    number of the stations.       No account whatever is taken of the
    error which may be produced at the reference-station       by local
    attraction, which may be very large, so much so as to “_ over
    whelm” other errors.      Let t,         . .. be the de<U+FB02>ections

A    to the mean ellipse;     rAa a normal through A to the vari
able  ellipse; sA0 a line through A making a small angle 2‘
with r A a.
   Now, if the earth had its mean form, the plumbline at A would
hang in the line nAa, the normal to the mean ellipse.                  (NB.
As A does not coincide with a this would not be true, unless
Aa were a small quantity; but as it is small, the error in sup
posing the direction of gravity at A to coincide with the normal
from A to the ellipse is of the second order, and may therefore
be neglected.)      But it actually hangs in the line mA. Hence
the angle or A n is the de<U+FB02>ection produced by local attraction at
A, and equals t. The angle n Ar, between the normals through
A to the two ellipses, =n(v——V), where n is a known quantity,
and V the value of v for the mean ellipse (see ‘Figure of the
Earth,’ p. 129).      Hence by applying to the observed latitude of

    5.    I
          intend now to propose           an improvement of my method
 which [think will correct, not          only the larger defect of Bessel’s,
 but also the smaller error which            I
                                       have hitherto left uncorrected
 in my own.            I
                   will retain the correction 2.   It is necessary to
 frame an hypothesis regarding it in order to apply the principle
 of least squares.    The hypothesis that z is an independent vari
 able breaks down, as I have shown, and leads us into error. The
 hypothesis that 2: should have that particular form assigned to it
which the principle of least squares suggests, viz. the average
value, with its sign changed, of all the corrections of the several
stations of the are relatively to the reference-station     and mea
sured along the variable ellipse, also breaks down for the same
cause; tis swept away from the equations when reduced; the
measured arc, in fact, is allowed to shift away, as before, to a
part of the ellipse to which it may not belong. It is necessary,
therefore, to make some other hypothesis.        I will give to 2 that
particular value of the form above referred to which appertains
to the mean ellipse; in short, 2 shall equal
                                _   (m)+ <¢>U+       (8W,
                                                 1
a constant quantity.    This hypothesis is free from the objec
tions to the other two, and suits the problem.
   This leaves the elaborate calculation in my paper in the Pro
ceedings of the Royal Society, No. 64, untouched, except that
2+t, a constant quantity, must be substituted for t in the for
mulae.

           lowing Note,        which   forms  an appendix to the translation

             To the Editor       of the  Revue des Cours Scienti<U+FB01>ques.
     In reply         to your question whether it is my desire to make
  any   remarks        on the new and ingenious experiments of Professor
  Tyndall,       I  would    state that the results obtained with the swim
  ming     ice    certainly   show that, by very feeble pressure, pieces of
  ice may be caused rapidly to cling together.              The pressures that
’
  come into play in this case are partly the difference in speci<U+FB01>c
  gravity between ice and water, and partly the capillary attrac

                The Rev. S. Haughton on Hanging.                     23
tion exerted between two pieces of <U+FB02>oating ice.       It is to be borne
in mind that, when in water, much more delicate ice-bridges suf
 <U+FB01>ce to connect two pieces‘ of ice than when they are surrounded
 by air, where it is dif<U+FB01>cult to render the equilibrium so perfect as
in  water.
    That radiant heat passing through ice melts the substance at
points deep in the interior may be explained by assuming that
at such places the ice-crystals have so crowded upon each other
as to cause a pressure.       If the water produced at such places he
refrozen, the local pressure will be restored, and a. new stream of
heat will effect liquefaction at the same places, even when no free
surface exists there.
    According to Professor Tyndall’s theory, the latent heat ren~
dered free when two pieces of ice freeze together is conducted
away through the adjacent ice.        And as the difference between
the freezing-points of the interior and super<U+FB01>cial ice is certainly
very small, the heat rendered sensible must diffuse itself through
a comparatively large mass of ice if internal liquefaction is to be
avoided.    In view of the low conductive power of ice, and the
extremely small differences of temperature, this seems to me im
probable in cases where by a strong pressure, even by the stroke
of a hammer, pieces of ice are welded together. I confess, how
ever, that the time necessary for conducting away the heat can
not be subjected to exact calculation, and that therefore the
question under discussion cannot yet be regarded as decided.
 For my own part I gave the theory of Mr. James Thomson the
preference, because it bases itself exclusively upon well-known
facts.

   F.R.S., Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin*.
                    as a mode of public execution of criminals, must
HANGING, be regarded    as to a great extent an Anglo-Saxon       mode
of execution ; and although occasionally practised by the nations
of antiquity, it seems among them to have been used chie<U+FB02>y by
suicides, or in cases in which especial ignominy was intended
to be attached to the criminal.
   Among the Hebrews, the national punishment was unques,
tionably that of stoning to death by stones thrown with the
hand; and it is     clear,  from many passages     in the Old Testa
                   '*
                      Communicated by the Author.

241      The Rev; S. Hanghton on Hanging, considered from
ment, that the       hanging so often spoken of was the exposure of
the body of the      criminal, after death, to the birds of the air and
to the beasts of      the <U+FB01>eld, either by suspension from a tree, or by
cruci<U+FB01>xion on a       gallows.
    In Dent. xxi. 22, 23, it is provided that the criminal already
executed shall be lifted up on a tree, and that his body shall be
taken down before nightfall; it is also proved, by the story of
the Hebrew thief in Herodotus, that the Jews, even before they
left Egypt, had a special horror of the exposure of the dead at
night to the birds of prey ; for he relates that the King of
Egypt exposed on a cross the headless body of the thief caught
in the trap laid in the treasure-house, in the hope that his rela
tions might be induced to attempt the removal of the body before
nightfall.
    From Gen. xl. 19, we may infer that the Egyptian practice
was to execute the criminal by decapitation, and a<U+FB01>erwards ex
pose the body nailed on a cross to the birds of prey.
    Among the Persians, also, exposure on a cross was a custo
mary punishment, as appears from Esther vii. 9 ; but I do not
know whether this cruci<U+FB01>xion was post mortem or not; among
the Hebrews, the “suspension ” or “cruci<U+FB01>xion” was always
that of the dead body, and they were not guilty of the terrible
atrocity of suspending or nailing up by the handsa living man:
this re<U+FB01>nement of cruelty was reserved for the Romans.
    I have not succeeded in <U+FB01>nding a case of execution by hanging
in the Old Testament, although there are cases of suicidal stran
gulation -(as that of Ahithophel, 2 Sam. xvii. 23), which may
have been effected simply by tying a cord round the neck, and
have been unaccompanied by any “ suspension,” in the Anglo
Saxon use of the term.
   The most ancient account of a formal execution by hanging
that I can <U+FB01>nd is the hanging of the twelve faithless handmaids
of Penelope at the suggestion of Telemachus, in the twenty
second book of the Odyssey.            The passage is so remarkable for
many     reasons,  that   no   apology is needed for offering some sug
gestions respecting       it.    Igive the translation of Cowper, for the
bene<U+FB01>t    of English    readers.
       “     .       .   .    _.        leading forth
                _.
      The    women next, they shut them close between
      The lofty wall and scullery, narrow, straight,
      And dreadful, whence no prisoner might escape.
      Then, prudent, thus Telemachus advised:
          The death of honour would         I never grant
      To criminals like these, who poured contempt
      On mine and on my mother’s head, and lay
      By night enfolded in the suitors’ arms.

                a Mechanical and Physiological point                              of view.                25.
          He said, and noosing a strong galley rope
        To a huge column, led the cord around
        The spacious dome, suspended so aloft,
        That none with quivering feet might reach the <U+FB02>oor.
        As when a <U+FB02>ight of doves entering the copse,
        Or broad-winged thrushes, strike against the net
        Within; ill rest, entangled, there they <U+FB01>nd;
        So they, suspended by the neck, expired
        All in one line together. Death abhorredl
        With restless feet awhile they beat the air,
        Then ceased.”

    There are two ways in which we may conceive the execution
to have been effected.
   ].  Telemachus, with the aid of Eumaeus and Philcetius, having
fastened one end of the rope to one of the main pillars of the
hall, made slipknots (Bpéxot) upon        which were placed round  it,
the necks of the twelve women, and having passed the other, or
free end of the rope, round the top of the vaulted kitchen, they
then all pulled together, in sailor fashion, on the rope, and
hoisted the women into the air, so as to form       funicular poly                a
gon, in which some of them necessarily hung nearer to the
ground than others—mine woo-iv 0175a; (norm.
    2. The ship-rope, with one end fastened to the pillar, was
carried round the vaulted dome of the kitchen ('n'epl<U+FB02>aMts
967tow) and made fast upon itself; from this rope 'were then
suspended smaller ropes with slipknots or nooses (Bpéxot) which                                   ,
were passed round the necks of the women, who must have been
lifted up one             by
                  one for the purpose, .so as to swing clear of the
ground.    The simile of <U+FB01>eldfares* and wood-pigeons caught in

   26      The Rev. S. Haughton          on Hanging, covwidered from
   nooses hanging from a rope stretched from tree to tree, and
   placed in the passage to their roost, seems rather to favour the
   second interpretation, which is also aided by the words (he ai’y'
   e'fetns sedan.de é'xov, as if the women hung, like Bluebeard’s
   wives, “tit tat toe, all in a row l”
       It can be shown, from mechanical considerations, that the
   <U+FB01>rst interpretation of this remarkable passage is not admissible ;
   for, on the most favourable arrangement of the rope allowable, it
   would not have been possible for Telemachus, Eumaeus, and
   Philmtius, even if aided by the “man that bent the bow,” and
   by the willing Euryclea, to have exerted the force necessary to
   lift all the women into the air together.             The mechanical pro
   blem isalso worth investigating for its own sake.
       I shall assume, in order to simplify the conditions, that the
   women are hung at equal distances along the rope, and that the
   part of the rope joining the two lowest women is horizontal.
   These suppositions are very natural, and have the advantage of
   rendering the solution more elegant, without interfering seriously
   with its generality.
       Let a1, a9, . . . us denote the angles made by the several por
   tions of the rope (reckoned from the top) with the horizon.
       Let T1, T9,. ..T6 denote the strain on each portion of the
   rope.
       Let T   =X be     the strain on the lowest or horizontal portion
   of  the rope.
       Let W denote      the weight of one of the women.
       As the second      half of the rope is supposed to be symmetrical
0  for the present,      there are thirteen unknown quantities to be
   found, viz. the six angles and seven tensions.                From the well
   known principles of equilibrium of the funicular polygon, we
   Obtain the following twelve equations, which are all mechanical:—

  <U+FB01>eldfares (m'xkat 'ravum'1r1'spm), in trying to <U+FB02>y at the berries, are stopped

  the neck, or occasionally by the foot, but most frequently by the neck ; and
  the stratagem is so successful with this bird, that they are often found
  hanging in a row from the stick, each suspended by the noose that passes
 round his neck.

chus and his assistants must have used in order to hold up the

of     will always be greater than the weight of six of the hand

maids, and will be considerably greater, unless the heights of the
points of suspension be very great compared with the span of the
polygon. We are therefore forced to the conclusion that the
hanging of Penelope’s handmaids in         funicular polygon was
                                                       a
mechanically impossible, unless pulley-blocks or some other con
trivances   were employed, which are not mentioned        the text.»    in
We must therefore suppose that in this, the earliest execution
 by hanging on record, the rope was passed around the vaulted
dome, and that separate nooses suspended from this rope were
attached to the necks of the women.
   In modern times hanging was favourite mode of execution
                                                   a
among the Anglo-Saxons; and          am indebted to Dr. Ingram,

Professor of English Literature in the University of Dublin, and
toJ.  E. Walshe, Q.C., for the following brief notice of its history
in connexion with England, which will serve as suitable intro   a
duction to my proposal for its improvement and perfection,
founded on mechanical and physiological principles.
   Hanging was only one of the capital punishments in use
among our ancestors—women being often burned for offences
for which men were hanged, and both were burned for holding
heretical opinions.  Marrying Jew or committing sodomy was
                                              a
at one time punishable     burying both parties alive
                                    by                   and be         ;
heading with an axe was, and theoretically still    allowable in is,
some cases.     The punishment for high treason, and at one
time extended to certain cases of murder, was the elaborate and
brutal process of hanging, drawing, and quartering.
   In “Beowulf,” which Kcmble believed to be         modernized     a
form of poem which the invaders of Britain had brought with
                  a
them from their continental homes, the gallows (galya) <U+FB01>gures
as an old-established institution of the Teutonic races of North
ern Europe.

    “ It is clear,”  says Blackstone, “that if upon judgment to be
hanged by the neck till he is dead the criminal be not thoroughly
killed, but revives, the sheriff must hang him again.”             But,
                                        ‘
strangely enough, we <U+FB01>nd in the           Vision of Piers Plowman,’ a
passage which seems to show that the opposite of this either was,
or was believed to be, the established rule in his time :—
                   “ It is noght used on Earthe
                     To  hangen a felon
                      Ofter than ones,
                     Though he were a tretour.”
    From some cause or other, not easy to explain, it has been the
custom to use a longer drop in Ireland than in England or Scot
land ; and there can be no doubt that it is a more humane mode
of execution than the English, and also more instructive as a
solemn warning to the spectators, whose feelings are not likely to
be enlisted on the side 'of the criminal by witnessing his convulsive
struggles, which are an unnecessary accompaniment of death by
hanging if properly conducted.         ()n a recent occasion in the
north of England, the criminal had undergone tracheotomy some
years previous to his execution ; and such was the ignorance of
those who conducted the hanging, that he was dropped through
a short height quite insuf<U+FB01>cient to injure the spinal cord, and
breathed with ease through the aperture in the trachea, su<U+FB02>'ering
horrible tortures, until relieved by the humanity of the surgeon
of the jail, who closed with his <U+FB01>nger the aperture through which
he breathed, and so completed the clumsy work of the hangman.
   In using the long drop, also, mistakes may occur, either through
the weakness of the rope, or through miscalculation of the length
of the drop. Both these errors were exempli<U+FB01>ed at Castlebar in
 Ireland in 1786, at the execution of the notorious George Robert
 Fitzgerald, who, when he jumped off the ladder, broke the rope;
 and when he was hanged the second time the rope was too long
and his toes touched the ground, until at length a humane by
 stander raised him up while the hangman shortened the cord.
    Death is produced by hanging in one or other of the three
 following ways :—
     1. By apoplexy, caused by pressure on the jugular veins;
     2. By asphyxia, caused by stoppage of the windpipe ;
     3. By shock of the medulla oblongata, caused by fracture of
 the vertebral column.
     In the <U+FB01>rst two cases death is preceded by convulsions, lasting
 from <U+FB01>ve to forty-<U+FB01>ve minutes, which are caused by the cessation
 of the supply of arterial blood to the muscles.       In the third case
 death is instantaneous and painless, and is unaccompanied by
any convulsive movement whatever.

  \
30       The Rev. S. Haughton on Hanging, considered <U+FB01>om
    According to the original form of death-punishment for treason
in England,    the hanging was used as an anaesthetic, preparatory
to the disembowelling (or drawing) that always preceded the
quartering of the criminal ; and the present slow process of hang
ing practised by Calcraft and others in England and Scotland,
which consists in dropping the patient through three or four feet
and allowing him to hang until dead, is the faithful representa
tion of the original process of hanging, which was intended to
ful<U+FB01>l a purpose quite distinct from that of speedy execution of
the criminal.
    It seems to me unworthy of the present state of science to con
tinue a mode of execution which, as at present used, is extremely
clumsy and also painful to the criminal.       Instead of the “ short
       ”
drop generally used, we ought to employ the “long drop,”
which causes instantaneous death.       It has been ascertained by
me that the shock of a ton dropped through one foot is just suf
<U+FB01>cient to fracture the anterior articulating surfaces of the second
vertebra at their contact with the atlas; and that this fracture
allows the shock to fall upon the medulla oblongata so as to pro
duce instantaneous      death.   As the result of some consideration
bestowed upon this subject,     I would recommend the adoption of
the following rule :—
     Rule I. “Divide the weight of the patient in pounds into
2240, and the quotient will give the length of the long drop in
feet.”
     For example, a criminal weighing 160 lbs. should be allowed
 14 feet drop.    If local circumstances will not allow of the long
drop being employed, the requisite shock should be produced by
strapping a shot to the feet, so as to secure the shock of 2240
foot-pounds to the medulla.
     E<U+FB01>'orts have been made in the United States to give to hang
 ing all the rapidity of death by the guillotine without the painful
 spectacle of bloodshed.      This method, which is borrowed from
 the mode of execution practised on board ship, consists in sud
 denly lifting the criminal into the air by'means of a great weight
 attached to the other end of the rope fastened round his neck ;
 the rope passes over a pulley placed vertically over the patient,
 and at a given signal the weight falls through a regulated height,
 lifting him suddenly into the air. Suf<U+FB01>cient attention, however,
 has not been paid, even in that enlightened country,’t0 the con
 ditions necessary to be ful<U+FB01>lled in this mode of suspension; for
in many of their executions, the only care that seems to have
been taken was to make the falling weight heavier than the cri
minal, so as to ensure his permanent suspension by the neck
until death terminated his sufferings.
    The American method of hanging, if properly applied, seems

                a Mechanical and Physiological point                                   of view.               31
to me to be capable of producing death by shock with even less
su<U+FB01>'ering than the “long drop ;” for although by the latter me
thod death is instantaneous when the shock actually occurs, yet
the mental su<U+FB01>'erings of the criminal during the second occupied
by his fall may be very considerable.       This painful interval is
altogether avoided in the American method, provided the initial
shock be suf<U+FB01>cient to destroy the medulla oblongata. This im
portant condition may be effected by the following calculations,
which lead to an easy Rule.
    The falling weight, acting through the intervention of the
rope, produces its effect in a manner similar to that of the shock
or collision of imperfectly elastic bodies.
    Let m and m' denote the masses of the two bodies, and let 1)

is  expended in causing shock to the neck, and should therefore
be equal to at least 2240 foot-pounds.
    In case of hanging that came under my own observation,
      a
 the criminal weighed 160 lbs., and was allowed to fall through
 14 feet  6inches, which, allowing for some elasticity in the rope,
 would correspond with 2240 foot-pounds of shock; in this
 case the superior articulating surfaces of the second vertebra
 were fractured near their posterior border (the fracture of the
bone extending to the foramina for the vertebral arteries), but
 the odontoid process and its transverse ligament were so strong
that neither of them was injured.         Death in this case was as
instantaneous as   itwould have been had the transverse ligament
given way instead of the bone for the shock reached the me
                                             ;
 dulla, and its consequence was immediate and painless death.
In   hanging, the rope supports the atlas and presses         against                     it
the occipital articulations, while the second vertebra tends to
fall with the body; and        follows from this, that either the
                                        it
odontoid process and its transverse ligament must give way, or
the second vertebra be broken across at its superior articulating
surfaces; in either case death will be immediate.          The height
of the criminal just mentioned       few days before execution was
                                                 a
5  feet 9% inches, and after death he was found to measure        feet                                 5
11 inches; having been elongated                 inch      the “long

    From the foregoing      therefore appears that
                               it                        shock to the        a

fall through the height h, suf<U+FB01>cient to cause death instanta
neously by the “long drop,” it would require an in<U+FB01>nite weight
to cause immediate death ; for in this case
                                  Qh—2240=0,
and therefore P is in<U+FB01>nite.
   2nd. In the American mode of hanging, if the weight be let
fall through twice the height of the “long drop,” a. weight equal
to that of the criminal will be suf<U+FB01>cient to cause immediate death;
for in this case

and therefore, by equation (18),

                              between h and 2h, the weight P
    For all heights intermediate
must be found from equation (18), and it will always lie between
Q   and    in<U+FB01>nity;

of the rope, and, on the noose being tightened by the execu

34:             Mr. D. D. Heath   on the   Problem of Sea-levels.
      In this
           case, as Dr. King remarks,
                                       “ there was no dislocation
or fracture of the vertebral column, or injury of the ligaments
or of the spinal cord.”
   Case II.* On the 11th of May, 1858, Patrick Lydon was hanged
in Galway for the murder of his wife.   Lydon was a small man,
only 5 feet 5 inches in height; the diameter of the rope was 10
lines; his weight was 91; stone, and the drop 11 feet.    Hence
we <U+FB01>nd
           work done = 133 X 11 = 1463 foot-pounds.
      In this
            case, “that portion of the anterior common ligament
of the spine which passes from the body of the second to that of
the third cervical vertebra was ruptured, so that the left halves
of the bodies of the above-mentioned vertebrae were separated
from each other by an interval of one-eighth of an inch, but
there was no displacement.”
   These criminals were executed with the same rope, and death
in the second case was not preceded by violent muscular convul
sions, as in the <U+FB01>rst case—a fact which is readily accounted for
by the excess of shock in the proportion of 1463 to 1102.

 lay in arguing that, when the agency keeping them apart is a
 solid connexion between the cap and the nucleus, this nucleus
 will, to the <U+FB01>rst order of small quantities, lie centrically within
 the envelope.
    This error I corrected in April, and explained that the centre
 of the solid sphere will be, as it were, depressed by the superin
 cumbent weight of the cap, and lie away from the centre of <U+FB01>gure
 in the opposite direction by a distance of the same order of mag_

nitude, generally speaking, as that of the ellipticity of the sur
face.     Taking my former illustration, the yelk of the egg will lie
on the big-end side of its centre of gravity.
    In applying this theory to facts, we must conceive our conti
nents and islands as so many excrescences from the spherical
nucleus which will shift their positions along with it; so that the
change of level, as measured on a cliff or mountain, will be that
calculated in my <U+FB01>rst paper, due to the change of contour, in
creased in one hemisphere and diminished in the other by an
amount proportional to the sine of the latitude, the change at
the equator being due to the former cause only.               To complete
the theory, each of these excrescences must be treated as exerting
a disturbing force of the same kind as the supposed ice-cap, and
all the effects must be added togther.
    In the same April Number there was a paper by Mr. Croll, in
which he criticised my uncorrected paper, and also developed his
own theory; and he appended a note by Professor W. Thomson,
expressing a marked approval and acceptance of this theory, as
 including all that is relevant to “the great physical question.”
    As to the <U+FB01>rst part of Mr. Croll’s paper, I have only to say
that, were I rewriting my own, Ishould leave out my illustration
 of his axiom by reference to the moon, but should retain that by
 the sun.      But      asif, imagine, he thinks that, were the moon
                                 I
 stayed in her motion and rigidly connected with the earth, the
 water would tend to gather spherically round the common centre
 of gravity, he       wrong.
                         is     The sea would keep the elliptic shape
 assigned to       by the common statical theory of the tides, but the
                    it
 nucleus would be removed some 85 feet from the centre of the
ellipse*; whereas the common centre              3000 miles off.

    As to Mr. Croll’s own theory, perhaps the fault              mine, but        is
 certainly      and Professor Thomson read

     For Professor Thomson concludes with the very just remark—
obvious     I  should have thought                   it,
                                            but that Archdeacon Pratt
 seems    to  include   <U+FB02>oating  ice in his disturbing force (p.
 “ that transference of <U+FB02>oating ice goes for nothing; and 174)—
            a                                                       that in
 estimating the effect of grounded icebergs, the excess of the mass
 of ice above that of the water displaced                        by

  36         Mr. D. D. Heath     on the Problem  of Sea-levels.
     This explains,    perhaps, how he came by the proposition to
  which   I  have objected.    For one of Laplace’s theorems is that,
  when a nearly spherical nucleus is everywhere covered by a <U+FB02>uid
  envelope, the centres of gravity must coincide.
     But not only is this hypothesis quite irrelevant to the physical
  facts, but it utterly vitiates the whole reasoning.       If we neglect
  the difference of density between ice and water, it is perfectly
  indifferent to equilibrium how much of the sea becomes ground
  ice; and if we take it into account, the ground-ice gives buoy
  ancy instead of weight to the attached nucleus, and will dis
  turb equilibrium in the sense opposite to that assumed by Mr.
  Croll.    In his imaginary case, introduced for illustration, of a
  nucleus of the same density as ice, no position will be stable but
  with the solid partly out of water.      I need not say that this is
  not the theory which Professor Thomson has really adopted in
  his own solution of the problem. And in truth be only throws
'a student 06' the scent by directing him to “ work according to
  Mr. Croll’s directions.” What he really does, in substance, is
  this.
   ‘
     He borrows from Mr. Croll the conception of an ice-cap ex
  tending down to the equator, and substituting (as I and other
 followers of Laplace have done) density for thickness, he supposes
 the density to vary as the cosine of the polar distance; which re
 presents the law of thickness in Mr. Croll’s meniscus when in
 its vanishing state.     This being so, if we start with a southern
 glacial epoch, and suppose the hemispherical shell to represent
 the excess of southern over any then existing northern ice, then
 a northern epoch, or the exact reversal of this state of things,
 may be represented by the superposition upon it of a complete
 spherical shell, following the above law with reversed pole; i. e.
 having a negative density southward, which will neutralize the
 southern cap, and a positive density at the north.
     Such a shell will be found to exert on all points within it equal
 and parallel forces directed northward.       It will therefore produce
 no effect on the contour, but will displace the moveable <U+FB02>uid
 until the excess of matter in the nucleus balances the northerly,
 as it formerly balanced the southerly attraction of the hemisphe
 rical shell at the centre of <U+FB01>gure.
     This  gives in my notation a displacement       —
                                                          , which in Pro

 deration    of the supports of the ice-cap as islands equably      distri

 This makes the average thickness of ice covering any zone         of lati

      It does not belong to me to praise the neatness of Professor
    Thomson’s work ; but                    I
                               must remark upon his observation that
    the <U+FB01>rst term in Laplace’ s series “always expresses the essence of
    the result,” and also upon the applicability of his solution to
    the actual geological question.
       He cannot mean that in every case where Laplace’s methods
    can be used the <U+FB01>rst term is of a higher order of magnitude than
    the sum of all the subsequent terms.     suppose, therefore, that        I
    he must mean to lay it down that in the passage from one set
_   of disturbing forces to an approximately equal and opposite state
    -—as from a southerly to a northerly epoch—this will be the case.
       I appeal to my calculation of a special case to show that this
    is not so.   With a uniform cap extending to N.P.D. 30°, [<U+FB01>nd
    the total displacement at the pole is lO78+206, or 1284, of
    which the part due to the shifting ofthe centre is 750.
       And if we look to the rationale of the thing, it is evident that
    the peculiar result he has come to implies that, with that special
    law of thickness and extension of the capping, the form assumed
    by the surface is symmetrical in the two hemispheres, or, which
    is the same thing, that its equation, referred to an origin near
    the centre of <U+FB01>gure (such as the centre of the nucleus), is of the
    form r—a=a{a,Q1+a2Q.,-l~a4Q4+         8am}, with no odd terms
    after the <U+FB01>rst: and this is easily veri<U+FB01>ed*.   But when the form
    is unsymmetrical and other odd terms appear in the equation,
    then the change of level, referred to the same origin, in passing
    from this state to its opposite, is due to the shifting both of the
    contour-line and of the centre of <U+FB01>gure ; and the relative amounts
    at the pole are as the sum of the coef<U+FB01>cients of all the odd terms
    after the <U+FB01>rst to that of the <U+FB01>rst.

38           Mr. D. D. Heath      on the Problem  of Sea-levels.
    But even if this were otherwise, I apprehend the question
which geologists are now putting is not to be answered by merely
calculating the difference between two approximately similar and
opposite states.         They want to know whether any conceivable
 glaciation in the northern hemisphere would raise the sea in the
latitude of North Wales by 1000 or 2000 feet above its now ex
 isting level. Surely, with the excentricity of our orbit, I believe,
 near its minimum, we are not now in a state of extreme southern
glaciation I If we are, the whole astronomical theory of glacial
epochs falls to the ground; and, moreover, though I suppose
 there may be sensibly more ice now in the south than in the
north, no one can imagine that the di<U+FB02>'erence is enough to pro
 duce any sensible change of level.
     My investigation has the disadvantage of resulting in a series,
 whence it is not easy to deduce general propositions; but it is
 addressed to the actual question.
    Archdeacon Pratt has also given a solution of the problem in
the March Number of the Magazine.               If it could be accepted
 as it stands, or if it admits of correction, it possesses the advan
tage of being expressed in few terms, though it is liable to the
 objection that, like Professor Thomson’s, it supposes the cap
ping to reach to the equator.
           I
    But must confess, with some di<U+FB01>idence, that it appears to
me radically erroneous.
     It is a corollary from his ‘ Figure of the Earth,’ with which I
have only become acquainted in consequence of the paper’s refer~
ences; and I must admit that the objections I have to urge
against the paper are equally applicable to a large section of the
more permanent work. I will, however, endeavour to make them
intelligible to those who have only the Magazine before them.
    The fundamental equation (1), p. 173, is an empirical for
mula, the coef<U+FB01>cients being determined by making it approxi
mately represent the attractions on points in four latitudes, (1°
and 30°, 45° and 60° outh, which four attractions are to be
                            “
previously computed           by the reader” with the help of certain
Tables. I have not had the courage to verify the calculations;
but taking them as data, I <U+FB01>nd that the formula (1) is made to
represent three of them exactly; and then the remaining one
comes out '422 instead of '412, which is perhaps near enough
to give us con<U+FB01>dence in applying it to other southern latitudes.
    But it fails in the northern hemisphere.            The Archdeacon
has,   if 1  am  not  mistaken,  exaggerated  the divergence.    For the
expression      0'6  sin  2¢. g. (p. 173)
                              e.             seems   to  be that for the
attraction of a homogeneous spheroid of the same density with
the earth; whereas he uses it for one of the density 2'75, or
about half that of the earth.

             Mr. D. D. Heath    on the Problem    of   Sea-levels.      39
     Still, even when corrected, we are thus presented with a dis
 continuous expression of the attraction exerted by the disturbing
 force on points of the ocean’s surface.        And this seems to me a
 formidable obstacle to dealing with the problem in the only way
 I  think admissible, and which the Archdeacon himself at <U+FB01>rst
 propounds (Figure of the Earth, p. 155), viz. by endeavouring
 to satisfy the equation (in which I leave out the term for the
 centrifugal force as immaterial)

 where V is the internal potential,       and; Udu that     due to the dis
 turbing force.
     I conceive it would be necessary to assume a form of surface,
 with indeterminate coef<U+FB01>cients, having the same discontinuous
 passage from one hemisphere to the other, thence to calculate V
 to the same order of small magnitudes as             Udu, then to deter
 mine the coef<U+FB01>cients so as to satisfy the equation at all parts of
 the surface, and <U+FB01>nally to determine the constant of integra
 tion so as to ensure the permanence of the mass of water in the
 disturbed and undisturbed spheroid.
     But Archdeacon Pratt proceeds to assumefor V its value in
the undisturbed spheroid,——a liberty which may be justi<U+FB01>able in
the case of an isolated sea like the Caspian, in which any sensible
effect of an overhanging table-land or mountain-range would
probably overwhelm that due to any possible change of surface
of the sea, but which seems to me wholly illegitimate when we
are dealing with an ocean covering three-fourths of the globe,
which can and will adapt itself to the new forces.
     But having thus obtained, however wrongly, his equation to
the disturbed surface, viz.

And from this        he infers  that the   “ whole elevation of     the sea
level,” i.    e. the  value of r—R, is    the integral            “ between
                                                        ngdu
the proper limits.” (Phil. Mag. p. 174.)
     But for these “ proper limits ” be, without reason or warrant,
takes the equator and the latitude where he wants to ascertain
the submergence ; whereas he ought to take it from the point
where the disturbed and undisturbed surfaces coincide, which
he has never determined.
     If I  may venture on a conjecture, it is from mistrust of the
                 “
assumption that the attraction of an elementary prism of the
super<U+FB01>cial matter may be treated as concentrated in one point
of its length "—the same, approximately, whether the attracted
particle is under, near, or distant from it—that Archdeacon
 Pratt has adopted his peculiar method and got hold of his dis
continuous formulas. This may require a closer investigation;
but    I  believe the objection is unfounded as applying to the de
termination of the general <U+FB01>gure of the ocean.            It may be valid
as regards a small margin on either side of the latitude at which
 the capping terminates abruptly;           but not, I think, as regards
 points fairly under the capping or fairly away from it. I will
not attempt‘here to go further into the question. If that as
 sumption (which I have distinctly made) must be abandoned,
we must hope that Archdeacon Pratt will be able to remove ob
jections and complete his own theory.
     I  will conclude with an observation of a physical character,
though I have hitherto kept entirely to the mathematical theory
of attractions.
     I have taken a uniform thickness of ice: others have supposed
it to thin out in lower latitudes, according to whatever law they
found convenient for their calculations. I think it essential that
those calculations should not depend for their validity on the
 cap reaching down tp the equator.            But, this once secured, it
may     at  <U+FB01>rst   sight appear   that  a law  of thinning out must be
nearer to the case of nature than that of uniform thickness.
 But I doubt whether it is so. Within certain limits of climate,
 I apprehend the real cause determining the thickness will be the
distribution of land and shallow seas; and that you cannot have
more than a certain depth of ice heaped up on a given area, island
or shoal.       It will crack away, or ultimately be crushed by its
own weight, and <U+FB02>oat away in powder, <U+FB02>akes, or icebergs, into
seas of lower latitudes.

 and Baxendell “On the Relative Chemical Intensities of direct
 Sunlight and diffused Daylight at different Altitudes of the Sun,”
in which my theoretical investigations on the dispersion of light
in the atmosphere are mentioned.               May I be permitted to com
municate a few observations to which this paper have led me?
    From calculations made partly by themselves and partly by
M. Wolko<U+FB02> in Heidelberg, the authors have deduced the ratio
between the chemical intensities of direct sunlight and of diffused
 daylight.       The values thus obtained they have collated in the
following Table, with the results of a calculation which                 I made
under the supposition that the re<U+FB02>ection of light in the atmo
 sphere is occasioned by vesicles of water*.

with the numbers-deduced from experimentsi', they conclude
hence “ that the effect of the atmosphere upon the highly refran
gible and chemically active solar rays is regulated by totally dif
ferent laws from those founded upon the hypothesis of the
re<U+FB02>ection by means of hollow vesicles of water.”

vol. lxxii. p. 294.
  .T I must here remark that an error occurs in this Table. I have deter
mined the position of the sun by giving its zenith-distance; and in'the
Table the numbers which refer to the zenith-distances 80°, 75°, 70", .&c.,
are given as if they referred to the sun’s heights 20°, 25°, 30°, &c., instead of
to the heights 10°, 15°, 20°, &c. If this confusion had not arisen, the dif
ferences between the calculated       and observed values would have been
greater than the Table shows.

   42                Prof. Clausius on the Re<U+FB02>ection      of
      I cannot admit    that this conclusion is correct; for the numbers
  resulting   from  my calculation cannot be used in the sense in which
  they    have  here  been taken, but the comparison         of observation
  with theory must be made in a totally different manner.
      In addueing my numbers I have expressly stated* that they
  do not simply depend upon the hypothesis that the re<U+FB02>ection is
  occasioned by the vesicles of water, but that in calculating them,
  several other assumptions have been made, of which            I may men
  tion the following as the most important.             In my general for
  mulae a coef<U+FB01>cient occurs which depends on the degree of trans
  parency of the atmosphere.           This coef<U+FB01>cient may at different
  times and in different places have very different values, since
  even when the sky is supposed to be cloudless (which is the case
 in    the formulae) the degree of transparency may vary consider
 ably.     Hence the coe<U+FB02>icient must be especially determined for
 each series of observations which is to be compared with the
 results of theory. At the conclusion of my paper               I have even
 said that this coe<U+FB02>icient must be different for different kinds of
 rays, since the atmosphere does not transmit rays of all colours
 with equal facility.      It is well known that the blue rays of the
 atmosphere are less readily transmitted by the atmosphere than
 the red ones; and it must therefore be assumed that the chemi
 cally active rays, which are even more refrangible than the blue
 ones, must be still less readily transmitted than these.             In the
                                  I
 numerical calculation which have carried out, to give an example
 of the application of the general formula,          I have chosen a. value
 for the coef<U+FB01>cient which has been obtained from observations on
radiant heat as an approximate mean; but this value is not to be
regarded as universally applicable.
     If in a theoretical determination of the luminous intensities in
 the atmosphere all cooperating circumstances             are to be taken
into account, the calculation becomes very tedious, and              I  shall
therefore restrict myself to an approximation.
     The quantity of light which a horizontal unit of surface of the
earth would receive from the sun, if the sun were in the zenith
and there were no atmosphere, may serve as unit. Taking, then,
the sun at any given height 3, and again assuming that there
is no atmosphere, the quantity of light which the unit of surface
would receive under these circumstances is represented by
                                   sin $1.
    Assuming, <U+FB01>nally, that the atmosphere            is present, the sun’s
light in passing through it will         be weakened, and the unit of
surface will therefore receive less light from the sun.              If, for
the sake of simplicity, it be assumed that the light of the sun is

represents the loss which the direct solar light has experienced
by the action of the atmosphere.    Assuming now that this quan
tity of light is withdrawn from  the direct solar light by the cir
cumstance that it is re<U+FB02>ected from any constituents of the atmo
sphere, it must (either directly or after experiencing several
re<U+FB02>ections in the atmosphere) partially reach the earth as di<U+FB02>'used
light, and partly be radiated into space. The question        what                                   is,
fraction of this quantity      light reaches the earth? and in an

    These values we will here apply.
    We will now     compare the most complete of the above three
series of observations, those made at Heidelberg, with the theo
retical formulae.        ,For this purpose the coef<U+FB01>cient a must be
determined from one of the observed               values    of      We will
take the value which corresponds               to the solar height 40°,

is 1, and from this we get

    Introducing    this value for a into the equation (3), we can cal
culate      for other solar heights, and thus obtain the following

values, which may be again collated with the observed values :—

    If it be considered that in this calculation several cooperating
circumstances have been disregarded, and that no perfect accu
racy is to be ascribed to the observations, the agreement between
the calculated and the observed values will be found to be suf<U+FB01>
ciently close.     There is therefore no reason for saying that by
these observations the hypothesis that the re<U+FB02>ection is effected by
the waterwesicles in the atmosphere is refuted.
    I  think, moreover, that comparisons of this kind are little
<U+FB01>tted to decide on the accuracy or inaccuracy of the hypothesis;
for the other cooperating circumstances, which can be but im
perfectly taken into‘ account in the calculation, have partly a far

VII.    On an Elztension of the Principles of the Calculus of Varia
   tions.    By Professor CHALLIS, M.A., F.R.S., F.R.A.S.*
                            I
          considerations am about to offer relative to the prin
THEciples       of the Calculus of Variations have arisen out of
attempts to solve the problem of the maximum solid of revolution
of given surface and given length of axis. That a solid exists,
the largest of all solids of revolution whose surfaces are of given
area'and extend continuously from one extremity of the axis to the
other, there can, I think, be no reason to doubt; and it will be a
reproach to mathematical science if it remains undiscovered.          I
discussed this problem in the Philosophical Magazine for August
1861, and again in that for September 1862; and after full con
sideration of the reasoning there employed, I do not see how,
according to the principles of the Calculus of Variations as usu
ally understood, the line which by its revolution generates the
surface of the required solid can be any other than the one which
that reasoning gives, viz. a composite but continuous line con
sisting of equal ordinates at the extremities of the axis, connected
by a portion of the curve generated by the focus of an hyperbola.
rolling on a straight line. But, as I have remarked at the be
ginning of another communication on the same problem in the
Philosophical Magazine for March of this year, the solid enclosed
by this surface does not possess the character of a maximum.
The aforesaid reasoning can therefore only be regarded as a
reductio ad absurdum, proving that the principles on which it
rests require to be corrected or supplemented.      This I consider
that I have in e'<U+FB02>'ect done in the paper just cited; but as I <U+FB01>nd
that the principles which the new method involves may be more
distinctly stated, and the reasoning itself be put more logically
than I have there succeeded in doing, I propose new to resume
the subject.
   The argument may commence with assuming the usual expres
sion for the function u that is to be a maximum or minimum, viz.
                        u=B+     j (3y—p5x)Adz',
B being   the part extricated from the sign of integration, and
 containing the values of 8x and       3;]
                                       at the limits, and  A being    a
 given function of a", y, and the differential coef<U+FB01>cients 1), g,&c.
 It may here be remarked that the substitution of w+5m and
 y+    8y
        for a," andy  in the calculus of variations for the purpose
 of investigating rules for obtaining functions that satisfy the
fconditions of maxima and minima,          analogous to substituting
                                             is
 in the differential calculus w+h and y+k for .2' and      yin order
                    *   Communicated   by    the Author.

46               Prof. Challis on an Extension of the
to obtain rules for <U+FB01>nding maximum and minimum values of
given functions.      And as h and k are small inde<U+FB01>nite quantities
 having no relation to each other, such also is the case with
 respect to 8x and <U+FB01>g.      The former substitution is supposed to
 change the form as well as the value of the function in which it
 is made; the latter only changes the value of the given function.
 This being understood, the maximum or minimum condition
requires that the two parts of which u is composed should sepa
 rately vanish.    With respect to B, this is effected by the values
of 8y and 3.24-at the limits of the integration, or given conditions
to which those values are subjected.       But since the other part
contains the indeterminate and independent quantities 5g and
3x, it can vanish only by making the coef<U+FB01>cients of these quanti
ties vanish.     Hence we have the two equations
                            A=0,     Ap==0.
    These are differential equations the integration of which fur
nishes the function or functions by means of which the required
maximum or minimum is calculated.            I now make a remark
 which has an essential bearing on what follows. It has been
usual to argue that because the second equation is satis<U+FB01>ed if
 A=O, the two equations are always equivalent to each other, and
 that it suf<U+FB01>ces to take account of only one of them. This, however,
as I am about to show, is a false conclusion ; and to this error the
 dif<U+FB01>culty of solving the before-named problem may be traced.
The second differential equation is not of the same degree as the
<U+FB01>rst; and it might happen that one is immediately integrable
and not the other,—an analytical circumstance which of itself
would make a distinction between them.               To illustrate this
point, let us <U+FB01>rst take an instance in which the two equations are
equivalent, and then proceed with the discussion of the problem
in hand, which will be found to be an instance of the contrary
case.
    Let it be required to <U+FB01>nd the line of given length which ter
minates at two given points, and encloses, with the straight line
joining the points, a maximum area. By the usual process we
obtain for this case
                  Adx = dw- d    l—Z'
                                    M1
                                  \/l +11e
Hence
                                       M1
                  AP dw=d3/ — 1’ d.————=d        1/
                                                    —   W.
                                                       7W1]
                                   V1 +1);            x/l +1),
Here each of the equations Adw=0 and Apdz=0 is at once in
tegrable ; and each gives for the equation of the line,

Thus the second equation conveys the same information as the
<U+FB01>rst; and as it is satis<U+FB01>ed by A=O, there is no need in this in                    i

                          ye-l-             =0.
 But as the <U+FB01>rst equation is not in like manner integrable, this
analytical circumstance indicates that the factor p is signi<U+FB01>cant,
and that we cannot, as in the former problem, dispense with the
 separate consideration of the equation Ap=O.                 It will therefore
 be proper to begin with inquiring what information this equation
 gives, before proceeding to the equation A=O.
     The expression for A being

 let us suppose that the required line is symmetrical with respect
 to the axis of .x', or that for every positive value of y there is an
 equal negative value corresponding to the same abscissa. Then,

  radius of curvature, which has the same sign for the positive as
  for the negative value of y, it follows that A changes sign with
  the change of sign of y.       Hence, as the factor p changes sign
  in the same case, Ap has the same sign on the opposite sides of
  the axis.   Clearly also it has the same value.            Consequently the
  integration of Ady=0 may be considered to embrace the two
  values of y corresponding to each value of x, and thus to satisfy
  the supposed condition of symmetry with respect to the axis of a“.

sign nor magnitude           by
                          the change of sign of .12. Consequently
the integral of Ady=0 embraces the two values of .z' correspond
ing to each value of y, and thus satis<U+FB01>es the hypothesis of sym
metry with regard to the axis of y.
   But the integral of Azte=0 does not satisfy the supposition of
symmetry with regard to the axis of 1‘, because on that supposi
tion   A would change sign with the change of sign of y.
   The above considerations enable us to draw             distinction be   a

answer could not be given          the equation A=O, but might be
                                        by
given     byAp=0.     In  fact   the   solid deduced from the latter
equation   ful<U+FB01>ls, as   Iam  about    to  show, those conditions, and
may   therefore be regarded   as  the  solution  of case of the general

 signi<U+FB01>cation of the factor 3/.       Since, after putting C=0, the
 equation    is  satis<U+FB01>ed by y=0, it is requisite to ascertain the
.meaning     of this result. - Considered by itself, it means that a
 straight  line   coincident with the axis of x is an answer in part
 to the proposed question. Now as the equation y=0 is not in-i

 that solution of the problem which is maintained by Mr. Tod
 hunter in the June Number (p. 426) is one which the analysis
 includes.     As, however, it gives a broken line—namely, a semi
 circle having its diameter coincident with the axis, and its extre~
 mities connected with the points P and Q, by straight lines—it
 does not supersede the inquiry on which                         I

drawn   by  making one of the circles pass through          and the       P,
other, with its concavity turned in the opposite direction, through
Q, and connecting them with the straight line parallel to the
axis of a: given by the third equation. But this would be no
 answer to the question unless the analysis indicated the mode of
junction, and the positions of the points of junction, of the three
lines. . To ascertain whether     does so, recourse must be had to

  the same equation is obtained as that which, it has already been
  shown, indicates that the curve is a circle. In the case of the
  function Ap, there were not two equations corresponding to two
  sets of values, because by the condition of symmetry the two or
  dinates to the same abscissa were equal with opposite signs, and
 the same form of the function consequently included both sets of
 values.
     When    I  made the communication contained in the March
 Number,     I had not recognized the-distinction which     I have now
 drawn between the conditional and the absolute maximum, and
 in consequence supposed the <U+FB01>rst part of the solution to apply
 to the case in which the given surface 119 is less than 4arce, the
 surface of the sphere whose diameter =PQ, and the latter part
 to apply when It2 is greater than 47m“.      But the present reason
 ing has shown that the determination of the absolute maximum
 is not subject to restriction, and that the line which generates
 the surface of the maximum solid is a segment of a circle of
 which the line joining the given points is the chord, whether if2
 be greater or less than 47m”.      The other conclusions arrived at
 in the former paper, especially the interesting one respecting the
 form of the maximum ring of given super<U+FB01>cies, I have not seen
 reason to retract or modify.
     It has already been stated in the MarchNumber that the
 maximum solid obtained in the <U+FB01>rst part of this investigation,
 namely, the cylinder with hemispherical ends, is found by ana
 lytical calculation to be greater than a solid of the form of a
prolate spheroid, whether the eccentricity be very small or nearly
 equal to unity.     I have since ascertained that it is also greater
than the solid which has for the generating line of its surface a
circular are connected with the given points by two tangents at
its extremities of equal length. If, however, the generating line
he a circular are at right angles to the axis at one of the given
 points, and connected with the other by a tangent at its extre
 mity, the solid will be found to be greater than the cylindrical
 one.    For, in fact, this line, though continuous, does not, like
 the preceding one, satisfy the condition of symmetry with respect
 to a perpendicular axis.     Moreover,   I have ascertained that this
unsymmetrical solid is less than that the generating line of
whose surface is the segment of a circle passing through the
given points; which, according to the foregoing solution, is the
absolute maximum of the solids of continuous form.
    It may be further remarked that as a sphere is the greatest
solid of given super<U+FB01>cies, there may be all sorts of solids of revo
lution of discontinuous form intermediate in magnitude between
the sphere and the solid which        I call the absolute maximum.
For instance, let the generating line be a semicircle connected

    at its extremities with the given p'oints by two straight lines in
    clined at small angles to the axis PQ.             It is evident that by
    varying the angles of inclination, solids of different degrees of
    magnitude will be obtained, and so much the greater as those
    angles are less, the   maximum of all being that for which the
    angles of inclination are inde<U+FB01>nitely small.          This maximum is
    the same as that which results when the equation           9:0     is taken
    into account, which Mr. Todhunter regards as the only solution
   which our problem admits of.          It satis<U+FB01>es the equation Ap=0,‘
    but not the equation A=O.          I assent to the opinion expressed
    by M. Lindele (Lecons de Calcul des Variations, p. 225), that
    this is not properly a solution of the proposed problem.             I  can
    not perceive that it differs essentially from the solution of the
    unconditioned problem ofcthe maximum solid of given surface;
   and, at least, it does not possess the same interest as the deter
   mination of the form of the maximum solid which has a conti
   nuous surface passing through the given points.
          I
       If have at length succeeded in elfecting a solution of this per-
   plexing problem, I have at the same time pointed out the rea
   sons of the failure of previous attempts.         One reason appears to
   have been an imperfect knowledge of the rules of application of
   the integrals of differential equations whose degree is higher than
   the <U+FB01>rst. Instances of such application have been rarely handled
   by analysts, and the principle of discontinuity which they gene-_
   rally involve is hardly yet fully admitted. As far as am aware, I
   the <U+FB01>rst case of an integral of this class in the calculus of varia
   tions leading to a discontinuous solution is that which occurs in
   the solution of the problem of the shortest course of a ship,
  which is given in the September Number of 1862 (p. 197), but
  was originally published so long since as 1834 in vol. i. of they
  Philosophical Magazine for that year (p. 33). But the chief
  cause of failure, which, however, is connected with the other, was
  the cenfounding of two differential equations, A=O and Ap=O,
  of different degrees, and regarding them as identical. On the
  general principles of analysis it might be argued that, while there
  are cases in which the equations lead to identical results, the
  very fact of there being two equations is evidence that there are
  also cases in which the results are not identical.            For no sym
  bolical di<U+FB02>'erence can be entirely without meaning.                The fore-t
  going investigation has,     I  think, shown that in the present in
  stance one equation points to a relative or conditional maximum,
  and the other to an absolute maximum.                     I
                                                        As am not aware
-
  that the   two  equations have   been  similarly  treated  in any previous
  researches,   I have ventured to call the use I have made of them
  an extension of the principles of the Calculus of Variations.

           and Wislicenus “On the Origin of Muscular Power,” and“
the further interest excited in the subject byProfessor Frankland’s'
recent lecture at the Royal Institution, seem to render it oppor
tune that the important question of the connexion between certain
Constituents of food and certain exigencies of the animal body
should receive a little further consideration at the present time.
 Professor Frankland truly said that, since the appearance of Baron
 Liebig’s masterly and highly suggestive work ‘ On Organic Che
                                                          ” in 1842,
 mistry in its applications to Physiology and Pathology
his'yiews'of the relation of the nitrogenous and the non-nitro-w’
 genous constituents of food to certain requirements of the ani
mal organism have been pretty generally adopted by text-book
writers.    It is also true that authorities on the subject of the
chemistry of f00d have, even so recently as last year and this,
either directly maintained or taken for granted the correctness
of Baron Liebig’s views. It                is,
                                     however, not the case, as was
also assumed        by
                   Professor Frankland, that these views have re
mained unquestioned excepting in the one or two instances of
criticism to which he referred.
    This question, in various aspects, has occupied       great deal   a
of our own attention for many years past; and so long ago as
1852 we advocated substantially the views now adopted           Pro:           by
fessors Fick, Wislicenus, and Frankland       and we have on various
                                                               ;
occasions since that date expressed them with greater de<U+FB01>niteness,
and urged them the more emphatically, as new experimental evi
dence either of others or ourselves seemed to lend them support
or con<U+FB01>rmation.      It may be well, therefore, to state very brie<U+FB02>y
the course of our own investigations bearing upon the subject,
and also the conclusions that we have based upon them.
    In Baron Liebig’s work above alluded to, and also in subse
quent publications, he treated of the food requirements of the
animal body generally—that          under different conditions; and
                                          is,
starting from the fundamental assumptions, on the one hand, of
the direct connexion of the nitrogenous or, as he designated
them, the “plastic” constituents of food, not only with the for
mation in the animal body of the compounds containing nitrogen,
but also with the development          muscular power, and, on-the
                                                 of
Other, of the general relationship of the non-nitrogenous con-'
stitu'ents of food with respiration, the development of heat, and
                     " Communicated     the Authors. by

 56       Messrs.  J. B. Lawes   and J. H. Gilbert on Food in its
 the deposition of animal fat, he concluded that the relative
 value of different foods, as such, was to a great extent depend
 ent on, and even measurable by, the proportion of nitrogenous
 constituents which they contained.
      It was upon the assumption of the broad and fundamental
 ’classi<U+FB01>cation of the constituents of food according to their various
  of<U+FB01>ces in the animal economy, as above stated, that numerous
  analyses of food were undertaken, and, founded upon the results
  obtained, Tables constructed professing to arrange current articles
  of food, both of man and other animals, according to their com
  parative values as such; and whether the object were the feeding
  of animals for the production of milk, the so-called fattening of
  them for the production of meat, or the support of the body for
  the exercise of muscular power, the proportion of nitrogenous
  constituents was generally taken as the measure of that value.
      Omitting, for the sake of brevity, any special reference to 'thc
  labours or views of others, it will suf<U+FB01>ce here to make a few such
  quotations from Baron Liebig‘s works as will best convey shortly
  in his own words a pretty clear indication of his own views,
  and at the same time pretty fairly represent those of a large pro~
  portion both- of systematic writers and experimenters,        on the
  points in question.      Speaking of the nitrogenous constituents of
  food, he said   :—
      “ It is found that animals require for their support less of any
  vegetable food in proportion as it is richer in these peculiar mat
  ters, and cannot be nourished by vegetables in which these mat
  ters are absent.” (Chemical Letters, 3rd edition, p. 349.)
      Again :—
      “The admirable experiments of Boussingault prove, that the
  increase in the weight of the body in the fattening or feeding of
  stock ( just as is the case with the supply of milk obtained from
  milch cows), is in proportion to the amount of plastic constituents
  in the daily supply of fodder.” (Chemical Letters,3rdedit.p.369).
      In regard to the exercise of force, he said :—
       “As an immediate effect of the manifestation of mechanical
  force, we see, that apart of the muscular substance loses its vital
   properties, its character of life; that this portion separates from
   the living part, and loses its capacity of growth and its power of
   resistance. We <U+FB01>nd that this change of properties is accompanied
   by the entrance of a foreign body (oxygen) into the composition
   of the muscular <U+FB01>bre (just as the acid lost its chemical character
   by combining with zinc); and all experience proves, that this
.conversion of living muscular <U+FB01>bre into compounds destitute of
   vitality is accelerated or retarded according to the amount of force
   employed to produce motion.         Nay, it may safely be af<U+FB01>rmed,
   that they are mutually proportional; that a rapid transformation

        rclations    to various exigencies   of   the Animal Body.   .        57
of muscular <U+FB01>bre, or,  as it may be called, a rapid change of mat
ter, determines a greater amount of mechanical force; and con
versely, that a greater amount of mechanical motion (of mecha
nical force expended in motion) determines a more rapid change
of matter.” (Organic Chemistry in its applications to Physio
logy and Pathology, 1842, pp. 220 8t 22]
   And again :—
   “The amount of       azotized food necessary to restore the equili
brium between waste and supply is directly proportional to the
amount of tissues metamorphosed.
   “ The amount of living matter, which in the body loses the con;
dition of life, is,  in equal temperatures, directly proportional to
the mechanical effects produced in       a given time.
    “ The amount of tissue metamorphosed in            given time may
                                                        a
be measured     by  the quantity of nitrogen in the urine.
    “ The sum of the mechanical effects produced in two indivi
duals, in the same temperature,         proportional to the amount of
                                       is
nitrogen   in  their  urine;  whether  the   mechanical force has been
employed     in  voluntary    or involuntary motions, whether       has  it
been   consumed       by
                       the limbs   or  bythe heart and  other viscera.”
(Ibid. p. 245.)
   Our own direct     experiments have had reference chie<U+FB02>y to the
feeding   of fattening animals; but the characteristic food require
ments of the body, when fed with the view to the exercise of
muscular power, have also been made the subjects of inquiry.
    Referring to the feeding of fattening animals, the question
arises, whether in the use of the currently adopted food-stu<U+FB01>'s
                                   by
the amount    of food consumed     a given weight     animal within
                                                         of                    a
given time, and the amount        increase produced are more in<U+FB02>u
                                  of
enced   by  the amount of the nitrogenous or of the non-nitroge
nous constituents which the food supplies; that                to say,
                                                                is
whether the sum of the requirements of the animal system
under these circumstances          such that, in the use of the ordi
                                  is
 nary articles of food, the amount taken or increase produced will
be more regulated, or measurable,            by
                                         the supplies of the nitroge
nous or “<U+FB02>esh-forming” constituents,or             by
                                               those' of the more spe
 cially respiratory and fat-forming non-nitrogenous constituents.
    To acquire the data necessary for the satisfactory solution of
 this question, some hundreds of animals—oxen, sheep, and pigs-—
 have been egrperimented upon. Comparative lots being selected,
 the general plan of the feeding-experiments was to give to some
 a. <U+FB01>xed and limited amount of food of known composition in
 regard to its contents of nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous con
 stituents, to others    <U+FB01>xed and limited amount of food of differ
                           a

 as they chose to eat of some other food, also of known compo

   sition, the quantity consumed being weighed.                    In some cases a
   single description of food only, or a mixture of several descrip
   tions in known proportions, was given ad libitum, but weighed ,'
   and in others, several descriptions of food were allowed, each
   separately, ad libitum, but weighed.              It will be seen that in this
   way great     variation    in the  amount     and    proportion of the nitro<
   genous     and non-nitrogenous        constituents      supplied was attained,
   whilst the animals, according to the nature of the food within
   their reach, <U+FB01>xed for themselves the limit of their consumption.
   All such comparative experiments were conducted for many
   weeks, or even for several months, consecutively, and the weights
   of the animals themselves were determined at the commence
   ment, at stated periods during the progress, and at the conclu
                                                                                   '
   sion of the experiment *.
       To determine the character and composition of the gross in
  crease in live-weight, the weights of the individual internal
  organs and of other separated parts of several hundred animals
  of different descriptions and in different conditions as to age,
  maturity, and fatness were taken ; whilst in some carefully
  selected cases the total amounts of fat, nitrogenous substance,
  mineral matter, and water were determined-1'.                                         ,
'
       It is obvious that in the case of fattening animals, the amount
  of food consumed in relation to a given body-weight within a given
  time will be regulated, not only by the demands of the system
  for the support of respiration, perspiration, &c., and for the repair
  of normal waste of nitrogenous substance, but also by the addi
  tional requirements for growth and increase ; whilst, on the other
  hand, the amount required to be consumed for the production of
  a given amount of increase will, in its turn, include that due to
  the demands of the system for respirable and perspirable matter
  and the repair of the waste of nitrogenous substance.                   W'hether,
  however, the experimental results were calculated so as to show
  the amount consumed per 100 lbs. live-weight per week, or to

 out in all comparable experiments that it was in neither case the
 amount of nitrogenous constituents, but in both the amount of
 digestible or available non-nitrogenous constituents (or total or
 ganic substance) of the food that had regulated the result obtained.
     Referring the reader to our former papers for all experimental
 details, and for the fuller discussion of the results and statement
 of our conclusions, we will close this part of the subject in words
 quoted from a paper given at the Meeting of the British Asso
 ciation at Belfast in 1852*.       The sentence as quoted had refer!
 ence to the results obtained with sheep ; but subsequently those
 obtained with pigs were summarized in almost the same words :—
     “ . . . . if we consider that it is the results obtained under the
 subtle agency of animal life that we are seeking to measure and
 express in <U+FB01>gures, and if we also bear in mind the various sources
 of modi<U+FB01>cation to which our actual <U+FB01>gures must be submitted in
 order to attain their true indications, we think that it cannot be
 doubted that, beyond a limit below which few, if any, of our
 current fattening food-stuffs are found to go, it is their available
 non-nitrogenous constituents, rather than their richness in the
 nitrogenous ones, that measure both the amount consumed to a
 given weight of animal, within a given time, and the increase in
                                                                '         '

  ; Bearing in mind the nature of the respiratory process, and the
 great in<U+FB02>uence which its demands must necessarily exercise over
the amount of food consumed, it will scarcely appear surprising
that consumption at least should be chie<U+FB02>y regulated by the sup
ply in the food of non-nitrogenous constituents; but that the
amount of increase obtained in feeding animals for the butcher
should also bear a closer relationship to the supply of the
non-nitrogenous than to that of the nitrogenous constituents,
might perhaps well be looked upon as inconsistent with the
currently adopted views as to the highly nitrogenous character"
of the increase of animals fed for human food, and, indeed,
of the highly nitrogenous character of the animal portion of
human food generally.                                                   7
    The investigation into the composition of the fattening ani
mals, and their increase, above alluded to, showed, however,
how small was the proportion of the nitrogenous substance
of the food that was stored up in the increase of the animal,

greater than had previously been supposed.            The results fur

  60     Messrs.   J.  B. Lawesand       J. H. Gilbert on Food in its
  of the   estimated total consumed portions of animals admitted
  to be in only a proper condition of fatness into its starch
  equivalent, there was, on the average, a higher proportion of
  so-reckoned non-nitrogenous substance to one of nitrogenous
  substance in such animal food than in bread itself.            It was con
  cluded, indeed, that, on the large scale, the introduction of
  animal aliments into our otherwise chie<U+FB02>y farinaceous diet did
  not increase, but diminish the relation of the nitrogenous or so
  callcd “<U+FB02>esh-forming,”         to the non-nitrogenous constituents
  (reckoned according to their respiratory and fat-forming capa
 city) in the collective food.           The important bearing of these
 facts in forming an estimate of the characteristics of different
 human dietarics will be at once apparent.                         - - -
     So much, then, for the characteristic food requirements of
 animals exposed to as little exertion as possible, and fed with
 the express view of accumulating <U+FB02>esh and fat in their bodies.
 Concurrently with the earlier experiments to determine the re
 lations of food and body-weight and increase above referred to, the
 question of the relation of the amount of the constituents voided
 (especially the nitrogen) in the liquid and solid excrements to
that in the food consumed, was also investigated. Consistently
with the results obtained in regard to the amount and character
of the increase resulting from the consumption of very different
 amounts of nitrogenous substance, it was found that the amount
 of nitrogen voided by fattening animals fed under equal con
 ditions as to the exercise of force, bore a very direct relation to
that supplied in the food. S0 direct, indeed, is the connexion
between the composition of the matters excreted and that of the'
food consumed, that we have constructed Tables showing the
relative value of the manure produced by fattening animals from
a given weight of different food-stuffs according to the com
position of the latter.
     But more to our present purpose—so striking were the re
sults obtained in regard to the connexion between the composi
tion of the food on the one hand, and the amount consumed,
the amount and character of the increase produced, and the
composition of the excreted matters, on the other, and, on
some important points, so contrary in their indications to the
prevailing views, that we were led at once to turn our attention
to human dietaries, and especially to a consideration of the
management of the animal body undergoing somewhat excessive
labour, as, for instance, the hunting horse, the racer, the cab
horse, and the fox-hound, and also pugilists and runners.                The
conclusions to which we were led by this study were brie<U+FB02>y
summarized in 1852 as follows * :—
    ‘ Report ofthc British Association forthe Advancementof Science for1852.

           relations    to various exigencies of the  AnimaleBody.        61
    “  ; . . .  . .‘. . that in the' cases, at least of ordinary exercise
 of  force,    the exigencies of the respiratory system keep pace
more nearly with the demand for nitrogenous constituents of
 food than is usually supposed.”
                                                   ‘
    And further :—
    “A somewhat concentrated supply of nitrogen does, however,
in some cases, seem to be required when the system is over
 taxed—as for instance, when day by day more labour is de
manded of the animal body than it is competent without de
terioration to keep up; and perhaps also, in the human body,
when under excitement or excessive mental exercise.                 It must
be remembered, however, that it is in butchers’ meat, to which is
attributed such high <U+FB02>esh-forming capacity, that we have also,
in the fat which it contains, a large proportion of respiratory
material of the most concentrated kind.               It is found, too, that
 of the dry substance of the egg, 40 per cent. is pure fat.
    “A consideration of the habits of those of the labouring
 classes who are under- rather than over-fed, will show, that
 they <U+FB01>rst have recourse to fat meat, such as pork, rather than
 to those which are leaner and more nitrogenous—thus perhaps
 indicating, that the <U+FB01>rst instinctive call is for an increase of the
 respiratory constituents of food.           It cannot be doubted, how
 ever, that the higher classes do consume a larger proportion of
 the leaner meats; though it is probable, as we have said, that
even with these, as well as pork, more fat, possessing a higher
respiratory capacity than any other constituent of food, is
 taken into the system than is generally imagined.                 Fat and
butter, indeed, may be said to have about twice and a half the
 respiratory capacity of starch, sugar,            &0.    It should be re
 memb'ered, too, that the classes which consume most of the
 leaner meats, are also those which consume the most butter,
 sugar, and in many cases, alcoholic drinks also.
    “It is further worthy of remark, that wherever labour is
 expended in the manufacture of staple articles of food, it has
 generally for its object the concentration of the non-nitro
 genous, or more peculiarly respiratory constituents.                 Sugar,
butter, and alcoholic drinks are notable instances of this. Cheese,
 which at <U+FB01>rst sight might appear an exception, is in reality not
so ; for those cheeses which bring the highest price are always
those which contain the most butter; whilst butter itself is
always dearer than cheese.
    “ In conclusion, it must by no means he understood that we
 would in any way depreciate the value of even a somewhat
liberal amount of nitrogen in food.                  We believe, however,
.that on the current views too high a relative importance is at--'
tached to it ; and that it would conduce to further progress in

this   most important <U+FB01>eld of inquiry if the prevailing opinions
 on the subject were somewhat modi<U+FB01>ed*.”
    It will be borne in mind that at the time the statement of
 view here quoted was made, the opinions expressed were directly
 contrary to       recognized authority on the subject, and
                     all                                              is          it
 since that date that so much evidence has been accumulated
-in regard to the amounts of urea, and the amounts of carbonic
'acid and other products, given 03' under varied conditions as to
food and exercise.     Still, from the facts even then at command,                     it
was concluded that the increased demand for food resulting
 from the exercise of muscular power was specially characterized
 by the requirement for an enhanced amount of the non-nitroge
 nous constituents. Con<U+FB01>rmatory evidence was, however, not
 long wanting.
    In 1854 we selected two pigs as nearly as possible of equal
 Weight and character; to one was given, ad libitum, lentil-meal
'(containing about     per cent. of nitrogen) and to the other, also ad
                           4                          ,
libitum, barley-meal (containing less than        per cent). After the
                                                          2
 animals had been kept for           certain time on their respective

 foods, one comparative experiment was conducted for             period  a
 of three days, and another for            period of ten days.
                                                 a                 The
 weights of the animals were taken at the beginning and at the
 end of each experiment, and, besides other particulars, the
 amounts of nitrogen consumed in food, and voided as urea,
 were determined         The result was, that with exactly equal
                           1'.
 conditions as to exercise, both animals being in fact at rest, the
 amount of .urea passed           by
                                 the one feeding on the highly nitro
 genous lentil-meal was more than twice as great as that passed
 by  the one fed on the barley-meal.       We have since made' other
 such experiments with similar results.
  It    was clear, therefore, that the rule laid down           Liebig, by
 and assumed to be substantially correct by so many writers, did
 not hold good—namely, that “ The sum of the mechanical effects
 produced in two individuals, in the same temperature,             pro;      is
 portional to the amount of nitrogen in their urine, whether the
 mechanical force has been employed in voluntary or involuntary
 motions, .whether      has been consumed

 heart and other viscera ”—unless, indeed, as has been assumed
 by some experimenters, there           with increased nitrogen in the
                                           is,

-the other, the amount of urea passed could not be any measure
  of the amount of muscular power exerted; and this evidence,
  considered in connexion with that relating to the demands of the
 'system (not only of the fattening animal but of the animal body
  fed with a view to mechanical exertion, afforded further con<U+FB01>r
  mation of the View we had already put forward as above quoted,
  and also led to the extension and more de<U+FB01>nite expression of it.
     The results of Bischo<U+FB02>‘ and Voit, conducted through a period
/of many months, with a dog, either submitted to hunger or fed
  from time to time on foods containing very different amounts of
  nitrogenous substance, showed a very variable amount of urea
  voided, although the animal were kept under equal conditions
  as to exercise.    Still, on the publication of those results in 1860,
  the authors assumed that although there had been no greater
  exercise of force manifested in the form of external work, yet
  when the amount of nitrogenous substance in .the food was
greater, and the amount of urea voided correspondingly greater,
,there must have been a corresponding increase in the force .ex
  ercised in the conduct of the actions proceeding within the body
itself in connexion with the disposition of the increased amount
.of nitrogenous substance consumed.                 When, however, they
!subsequently      found   that  the  amount       of urea passed by the
.animal when subjected to somewhat severe labour was, other
  things being equal, no greater than when at rest, whilst the
  carbonic acid evolved was much increased by such exercise, their
  view was of necessity somewhat modi<U+FB01>ed.
‘    Again, the results of Dr. Edward Smith, which showed great
  variation in the amount of urea passed when there was concur
  rent variation in the amount of nitrogenous substance in the
  food, and comparatively little variation in the amount of urea
  voided with great variation in the amount of labour performed,
  but, on the other hand, great increase in the carbonic acid
  evolved with increased exercise of force, obviously still further
  pointed to the correctness of the view that with muscular ex
  ertion there was a more marked increased demand for the non
  nitrogenous than for the nitrogenous constituents of food.
     That this was the necessary conclusion from the results of
  our own investigations, and also from those of the researches of
  Bidder and Schmidt, Bischo<U+FB02>', Voit, Pettenkofer, E. Smith, and
  others, we have frequently maintained. Indeed the view urged

64             LiClli.-C010116l  Strachcy on the Action of
in public discussion has been, that all the evidence at command
tended to show that by an increased exercise of muscular power
there was, with increased requirement for respirable material, pro
bably no increased production and voidance of urea, unless, owing
to excess of nitrogenous matter in the food, or a de<U+FB01>ciency of
available non-nitrogenous substance, or diseased action, the nitro
genous constituents of the <U+FB02>uids or solids of the body were drawn
 upon in an abnormal degree for the supply of respirable material.
.
     From the facts brie<U+FB02>y summarized in the foregoing pages, it
will be obvious that the generally accepted views in regard to
the adaptation       of food, according to its composition, to the
various exigencies of the animal body, require modi<U+FB01>cation in
other respects than in so far as they relate to the source or
development of muscular power alone.            At the same time we
hail with much satisfaction the con<U+FB01>rmation of the views we
have so long maintained on the point (in opposition to general
authority) which has recently been afforded by the results of
 the interesting, though limited experiment of Professors Fick
 and Wislicenus, so ably discussed by them in their paper, and
 by Professor Frankland in his lecture.
IX.     On the Action of Aqueous Vapour on Terrestrial Radiation.
               By Lieut.-Colonel S'rnacnnr, F.R.S.*
            soundness of Dr. Tyndall’s conclusions as to the effect
 THE     of watery vapour in the air on the passage of radiant heat,
 has, I understand, been disputed by some high authorities. The
  testing of these conclusions by observations made with no refer
  ence to the question at issue, will therefore probably be interest
 ing to persons who have followed Dr. Tyndall’s admirable and,
  as it seems to me, altogether       satisfactory researches.    Some
 thing of the sort has already been undertaken, and the results
  have been published in the Philosophical Magazine.            My own
  method of examination is somewhat different from that to which
  I thus refer, and seems, in some respects at least, preferable.
  The views which I shall now brie<U+FB02>y state were, I may add, adopted
  some little time back, in the course of an investigation on an
  other meteorological problem.
     Iu examining the character of the diurnal variation of the
  barometrical pressure as recorded in the Madras Observations,
  and in considering the probable connexion between the variations
  of pressure and those of temperature, it became apparent to me
  that the principal cause of the increased or diminished range of
  air-temperature was to be found in the greater or less degree of
  clearness of the sky in the various months of the year.        Follow
  ing up this idea, I further saw that the degree of cloudiness
  of the sky was greatly dependent on the quantity of vapour in
                      * Communicated                           '

the air. It then occurred to me to ascertain whether the quantity
of vapour appeared to in<U+FB02>uence the variation of diurnal tempera
ture, irrespective of the action of clouds. For this purposeI se
lected from the observations those days on which the sky was
almost free from clouds, and noted the march of the thermometer.
      The varying power of the sun in its annual course from north
to south prevents any immediate comparison of the gain of Heat
during the day being available to test the in<U+FB02>uence of the watery
vapour in absorbing the sun’s heat.                      But the loss of heat at
night being essentially dependent on the radiation from the earth
into space through the air, a reliable standard was here to be got.
I accordingly calculated the fall of temperature from 6h 40m P.M.,
Madras time, to 5" 40m A.M. next morning for the days selected
as su<U+FB02>iciently celar; at the same time the mean tension of va
pour'during the night was also calculated, and the temperature
at 6h 40m P.M. noted.            The results, arranged according to the
quantity      of   vapour, for the years 1841, 1842, 1843, and 1844 are
given     in  the annexed Table :—

earth generally    essentially due to radiation into space, yet this

will not be exactly the case at any particular place. The air, the
temperature of which was measured and noted in the Madras
observations, was of course in motion, and probably, or rather
certainly, had acquired its temperature as     came up from some        it
distant place to Madras.   The observed fall of temperature, there

the sky over               it,

such variations will of course have affected the <U+FB01>nal results noted.
Further, the means of determining the clearness of the sky are
very imperfect, and important differences of transparency may
occur of which        impossible to judge

have taken at random, will be suf<U+FB01>cient to explain the method
adopted, and to show the character of the support given in this

the sun prevented useful comparisons between the increase of
heat during the day at different times of the year.   But the fact
comes out clearly enough that the air, when dry,       more'freely                         is
traversed by the sun’s heat than when damp.      The observations
of March 1850, arranged so as to bring out this point, give the

  notwithstanding the great depression of evaporating surfaces.
  During' the night hours in March 1850, the mean depression
  of the temperature of the wet-bulb thermometer varied from 60'0
  in the dampest period, to 9°‘9 in the driest. During the day
  hours the mean depression varied from 12°‘4 in the dampest, to
   15°'O in the driest.     If the cooling of evaporation had any im
  portant effect at night in increasing the fall of' temperature, it
  must have acted during the day in diminishing the rise of tem

      l. I lay hold of one end of this india-rubber rope, the other end
 of which is <U+FB01>xed to the ceiling, and by a jerk raise a protuberance
upon it. The protuberance runs along the rope to its <U+FB01>xed end, is
 there re<U+FB02>ected, and reversingoitself, returns to my hand.        In this
 case, where the points of the rope rise in succession to form the pro
 tuberance, we have an example of a progressive wave or undulation.
      2. After the <U+FB01>rst wave I now send a second, so that it shall meet
the re<U+FB02>ected wave on its return.       The foremost ends of both waves
now meet in the centre of the rope; they there neutralize each other.
and the two halves continue to swing with an apparently motionless
                                                  ‘
point called a node between them.
      3.  I now stop the rope, send a wave forward, and then another
wave so quickly after it that this second wave shall meet the <U+FB01>rst at
one-third of the length of the rope from its <U+FB01>xed end.           At that
point a node is produced.‘ But I have already sent a third wave
after the second.       The second wave being re<U+FB02>ected at the node,
meets this third one and a second node is formed.        The whole rope
is now divided into three vibrating parts, separated from each other
by two nodes.
   .
         By properly timing the impulses imparted to the rope I can
divide it into four, <U+FB01>ve, six, ten, and eVen twenty vibrating parts

               Prof. Tyndall    on the Vibrations   of Strings.         6Q
separated from each other by the_ appropriate number of nodes.
With a certain rapidity of vibration on the part of my hand I cause
the rope to swing to and fro as awhole. Twice that rapidity divides
it into two equal vibrating parts ; three times that rapidity into three
vibrating parts, and so on. The number of vibrating parts, or ven
tral segments, as they are called, is in fact directly proportional to
the rapidity of my hand’s vibration.
     5. In these cases, where every point of every ventral segment
moves to and fro at the same time, we have examples of stationary
undulations.
     6. My hand, which produces this vibration, does not move through
more than half an inch of space, while the ventral segments oscil
late through a space of four-and-twenty.          This wide vibration is in
fact produced and maintained by the addition together of small im
pulses properly .timed.        The nodes, moreover, though apparently
motionless, are not strictly so; for if they were, the vibration of the
segments would soon come to an end. In fact, it is by the motion
transmitted through the nodes that the vibrations of the rope are
sustained.
     7.  I might attach the free end of this rope to any suitable vibra
 ting body instead of taking it in my hand. If the rate of vibration
of the body were that of any aliquot part of the rope, it would
divide itself accordingly.
     8. The effect may also be produced by causing the vibrations of
 an aliquot part of our rope to excite vibrations in the remaining
 portion. Stretched vertically from top to bottom of this wooden.
 frame is an india-rubber tube.        Iencircle the middle of the tube
 with the <U+FB01>nger and thumb of my left hand, and pull the lower half
 aside with my right. The lower half vibrates, but the upper half
 vibrates also.      In fact the small amount of play permitted by my
 hand has enabled the pulse to transmit itself, to be re<U+FB02>ected, and to
 accumulate its motion to this extent.          I withdraw my left hand:
 the tube continues to vibrate in two equal parts, divided from each
 other by a node.
      9. I encircle the tube at one-third of its length from the lower
 end, and pull aside the shorter segment; it vibrates more quickly
 than the half tube, and the vibration immediately causes the upper
 and longerfportion to divide into two equal parts.         I now withdraw
 my hand, and the tube continues to vibrate in three equal segments,
  which are separated from each other by two nodes.
      10. In like manner I encircle the tube at one quarter of its length
  from its lower end, and pull the lowar and shorter segment aside;
  itzvibrates, and forthwith the longer segment above divides into three
 vibrating parts. Inow withdraw my hand, and the tube continues
  to oscillate in four equal segments, separated from each other by
  three nodes.                         v
   _ 11. Again, from side to side of the room is stretched this stout
  iron wire 24 feet long.         I seize the wire at the point which
  divides it into two parts, one three times as long as the other, and
 pulling the shorter segment aside permit it to vibrate; the remain
 ing portion of the wire divides itself into three ventral segments.        I

 have placed silvered beads at the nodes and at the centres of the
 vibrating segments; you see the light shining from those beads,
 and you notice that while the nodal beads remain stationary, the
 others describe luminous lines.
     12. If I place sheets of paper across the wire at the nodes and at
  '
 the ventral segments, on causing it to vibrate thus, the sheets placed
 across the ventral segments are tossed o<U+FB02>", while those at the nodes
 remain undisturbed.                                       ‘
     13. From these effects which you can actually see, I might passi
 on to vibrating strings, and show you that they divide‘themselvea
 similarly.    I  might also show you that it is hardly possible for a
 musical string to vibrate as a whole without having these smaller?
 vibrations riding like parasites upon the large one.          The addition
 of these smaller vibrations gives quality or timbre, or, as the Germans
 call it, Klangfarbe to the note.     They constitute the harmonics of
 the string.
     14. In this vice is <U+FB01>xed upright a rod of iron 4 feet long.       I pull
 it aside and it vibrates as a whole; its vibrations are rendered more
 distinct by casting its shadow upon a white screen.            I now strike
 the rod sharply at a point about one-third of its length from its
 <U+FB01>xed end.        The pulse runs along the rod, returns from its free
 end, and is met by the succeeding pulses; and now the rod is
 divided into two vibrating parts—a whole segment and a half seg
 ment, separated from each other by this dark motionless node.            By
 Promptly striking the rod IOWer down, 1 cause it to divide into two
 complete vibrating segments, forming those shadowy spindles upon
 the screen, and half a segment at the top. which spreads out like a
 fan.    The nodes are marked by the two dark points where the
 shadow is complete.
     15. This production    of stationary undulations on a large scale
 through the combination of direct and re<U+FB02>ected waves, for the illus
 tration of which we are mainly indebted to the brothers Weber,
 forms a <U+FB01>t introduction to the experiments of M. Melde of Mar
 burg, who has obtained a series of very beautiful effects by asso
 ciating with vibrating bodies suitably stretched strings.
     16. In M. Melde's <U+FB01>rst experiment he stretched a string across a
 bell, or belljar, from edge to edge: when the bell was caused to
 vibrate, the string vibrated also. By varying the tension of the
 string it was caused to vibrate as a whole, or to divide itself into
 two, three, four, <U+FB01>ve, or more vibrating parts, separated from each
 other by the appropriate number of nodes.
    17. He then attached his strings to tuning-forks, and obtained
 the same-e<U+FB02>'ect in a more marked and beautiful manner.              ‘0 this
tuning-fork I have attached a silk string which passes round a dis~
taut peg, by turning which the string is stretched.          The length of
the string is 8 feet. The tension of the present moment is such
that when the fork is caused to vibrate, the string swings as a whole,
its periods of vibration being synchronous with the impulses ima
parted to it by the fork.      We have here a beautiful gauzy spindle
produced by the silk, fully 6 inches wide at its point of greatest

    is hardly sensible; and still through this apparently motionless part‘
                                                                    '
    of the string the whole of its motion is transmitted.             -    -
       19. I relax the string by turning the peg, and now it suddenly
    divides itself into two ventral segments, separated from each other*
‘
    by a node. When the synchronism between the fork and string                      is;
    perfect, the vibrations of the string are steady and long continued;
    but slight departure from synchronism introduces unsteadiness, and,
       a
    the vibrations, though they may show themselves for     time, quickly
                                                                      a

        20.I   relax the string still further;      now divides itself into three
                                                      it
    vibrating parts relaxing still further,

    even twenty equal parts, separated from each other by               number of
                                                                             a
    nodes one less than the number of ventral segments.
     ’
        21. In the arrangement now before you, the fork vibrates in the
    direction of the length of the string; its tendency, therefore, is‘ to.
    throw the string into longitudinal vibration.            But, in fact, eVery
    forward stroke of the fork raises a protuberance upon the string,
    which runs to its <U+FB01>xed end and            there re<U+FB02>ected, so that when the
                                                is
    longitudinal impulses are properly timed, they produce a transverse
    vibration.   I     take
                          a    heavy string in my hand, stretch it, and move
    my hand     to   and  fro in the direction of the string.     It vibrates as a.
    whole, and notice that
                 I               it   isalways when the string         at the two
                                                                          is
    limits of its excursion that my hand moves forward.              If the string
    vibrate in   a   vertical plane, my hand, in order to time the impulses
    properly,    must    move forward at the moment the string reaches the
    upper and also at the moment           reaches the lower limit of its excur
                                           it
     sion.   A   little re<U+FB02>ection will make       plain that, in order to accom
                                                     it
    plish this, my hand must execute               complete vibration while the
                                                     a
    string  executes  a     semi-vibration*;   in other  words, the vibrations of
    my hand must be exactly twice as rapid as those of the string. _
        22. Precisely the same must be true of            tuning-fork to which
                                                               a                     a
    Proper string    is   attached.   When the fork vibrates in the direction
    of the string, the number of complete vibrations which                executes
                                                                               it
    in a certain time will be twice the number executed by the string.
        23. If in this case the fork and string vibrate with suf<U+FB01>cient rapi
    dity to produce musical notes, the note of the fork will be an octave
    above that of the string. That         it so, has been proved by M. Melde’s
                                                is
    direct observations.
        24. Taking hold of the end of this heavy string, cause my hand
                                                                    I
    to move to and fro, not in the direction of the string, but at right
    angles to that direction.        The string now swings as           whole in
                                                                             a       a
    vertical plane.       Here every upward movement of my hand coincides
    with an upward movement of the string, every downward movement
    of my hand with       a    downward movement of the string.            In fact
    the vibrations of hand and string in this case synchronize perfectly
                                                                                     a ;

                                it

    an excursion from one limit of the vibration to the other.

  note of the same pitch.     The same holds good when avibrating fork
  is substituted for the vibrating hand.      While, therefore, when the
  vibrations are longitudinal a complete vibration of the fork synchro
  nizes with a semi-vibration of the string, when the vibrations are
  transversal, a complete vibration of the fork corresponds to a com
  plete vibration of the string.
      25. Hence, if the string vibrate as a whole when the vibrations
  are longitudinal, it will divide itself into two ventral segments when
  the vibrations are transversal; or, more generally expressed, pre
  serving the tension constant, whatever be the number of ventral
  segments produced by the fork when its vibrations are longitudinal,
  twice that number are produced when the vibrations are transverse.
  Here, for example, is a string 8 feet long, vibrating longitudinally;
  the fork divides the string into four equal vibrating parts. 1 place the
  fork so that it shall vibrate at right angles to the string. The num
  ber of ventral segments is now eight, or double the former number.
  This result was amply illustrated by the experiments of M. Melde.
     26. Attaching two strings of the same length to the two prongs
  0 f the same fork, stretching one string in the direction of the prongs,
  and the other at right angles to that direction, and subjecting the
  strings to the same tension, when the fork is caused to vibrate, the
  one string divides itself into double the number of vibrating seg
  ments exhibited by the other.
     27. When white silk strings vibrate thus, the beauty of the ven
 tral segments is extreme.      The nodes appear white and <U+FB01>xed, while
 the vibrating parts form delicate gauzy spindles in the air; every
 protuberance of the twisted string writes its motion in a more or less
luminous line on the surface of the aerial gauze.
     28. Certain twisted strings do not adhere to the same plane.
 They vibrate simultaneously in two rectangular directions, and every
 one of their points describes a closed curve.      When the two vibra
 tions are of the same amplitude, and have the proper difference of
 phase, the ventral segments describe surfaces of revolution.
     29. The path described by the various points of the string may
 be studied, after the manner of Dr. Young, by throwing light upon
 them and watching the lines described by the illuminated points.
 By twisting a <U+FB02>at and burnished silver win we form a spiral sur
face, from which at regular intervals the light <U+FB02>ashes when the whole
wire is illuminated._     Attaching the wire to a tuning-fork and cans
 ing it to vibrate, its luminous spots describe luminous lines. If the
 wire vibrate as a whole without any sensible admixture of its har
 monic divisions, these spots describe straight lines, which are drawn
 brilliantly across the ventral gauze; but when, by slackening or
 tightening the wire, other vibrations are caused to mingle with the
 fundamental one, the combination of vibrations expresses itself in
luminous scrolls of extraordinary beauty.
     30. But to see this beauty you must be close to it. The vibra
 ting segments of our silk strings were, I fear, also too faint to be
 seen at a distance.     For the silk string I substitute a <U+FB01>ne platinum
 wire, which now stretches from this tuning-fork over a bridge of
  copper, and then round a peg.       I send an electric current through

                                                                              v
  the wire, which now glows brightly.         I sound the fork: the wire
  vibrates  as a  whole;  itstwo    ends  are  brilliant,  but its middle is
  chilled by its rapid passage through the air. Thus you have a.
  shading off of incandescence from the ends to the centre of the wire.
  I relax the tension: the wire now divides itself into two vibrating
  parts; I relax still further and obtain three; still further, and now
 you have the wire divided into four ventral segments separated from
 each other by these three brilliant nodes.       Right and left from every
 node the incandescence shades away until it disappears.                 You
 notice also that when the wire settles into steady vibration the nodes
 shine out more brilliantly than the wire shone before the vibration
 commenced.       This is due to the cooling of the vibrating segments.
 When they are chilled by their swift passage through the air, their
 conductivity    is improved.     More electricity passes through the
 vibrating than through the non-vibrating wire, and hence the aug
 mented glow of the nodes.
    31. Certain twisted cords, as       I  have said, when attached to
 tuning-forks execute circular instead of plane vibrations.          Circular
 vibrations may always be obtained by attaching one end of a string
 to a rotating point, and timing the velocity of rotation to suit the
 periods of vibration possible to the string.
    32. Thus, suspended from the ceiling is this white cotton rope,
 the lower end of Which is attached to a hook belonging to this whirl
 ing table. When this handle is turned the hook rotates, describing
 a circle less than an inch in diameter.       By properly regulating the
 velocity of rotation I cause the rope to divide into a series of spin
 dles, which appear like grey gauze ,when projected against a dark
background.       I can cause the number of these spindles to vary from
one to twenty, by varying the velOcity of rotation.
    33. In this experiment the rope is vertical and the rotating wheel
horizontal; but I have here an arrangement in which the wheel is
vertical and the vibrating chord horizontal.         Instead of a rope Inow
employ a burnished silver chain. Turning this wheel slowly, I cause
the chain to swing as a whole, and describe a spindle 12 feet long
and nearly 2 feet in diameter at its widest part.          Augmenting the
speed of rotation I divide the chain into two spindles, each 6 feet
long and more than a. foot in diameter; a still higher velocity gives
us three spindles, a still higher four, and so on.        The gas-light here
<U+FB02>ashes at intervals from the burnished links of the chain, and each
of those brilliant points describes a curve of light.
    34. As soon as synchronism is established between the wheel and
the chain, the amount of work performed by the arm which turns
the wheel is very sensibly augmented.         Indeed it may be augmented
until the strain thrown upon the chain by the accumulation of small
impulses is su<U+FB02>icient to break it.
    35. l substitute for the chain this lighter cotton rope, round which
a silver band has been coiled as a spiral; and from an electric lamp
 placed at the end of the rope I send a beam of light along its entire
length.     I now turn the wheel and divide the rope successively into
 two, three, four, or <U+FB01>ve ventral segments. The spindles show a gra
duated brilliancy, which is intensi<U+FB01>ed until it becomes almost daz~

  zling at the nodes. The vibrating chord is indeed better seen when'
  the light that falls upon it has been caused to pass through coloured
  glass.   We thus obtain at pleasure green, blue, and red spindles,
  with nodes like <U+FB01>re shading off into the more subdued light of the
  ventral segments.
     36. Substituting for the cotton rope a string of silvered beads 12
  feet long, I send the beam from the electric lamp along the string.
  On every bead rests a spot of light of sunlike brilliancy. When
  the wheel is turned, each spot describes a circle, and every ventral
 segment, of which we have now four, seems formed of a series of such
  dazzling parallel rings, which diminish in size right and left from the
 points of maximum amplitude till the diameters vanish at the nodes.
     37. So much for physical beauty; we have now to revert to
 beauty of another kind. The experiments with tuning-forks above
 described may be extended to the establishment of all the laws of
 vibrating strings.      I have here four forks, a, b, c, d, whose vibra-.
 tions are in the proportion of the numbers 1, 2, 4, 8.         Attaching a
 string 8 feet long to the largest fork, I stretch it by a weight which
 causes it to vibrate as a whole.     Keeping the stretching weight or
 tension the same, I attach pieces of the string to the other forks, and
 determine in each case the length which swings as a whole.           These
 lengths are in the ratio of 8, 4, 2, l.
     38. Hence the rapidity of vibration is inverser proportional to the
length of the string.
     39. Here the string 8 feet long vibrates as a whole when attached
 to the fork a.    I now transfer it to b, still keeping it stretched by
 the same weight.       It vibrates when b vibrates; but how? By di
 viding into two equal ventral segments. In this way alone can it
 accommodate itself to the vibrating period of 6. Attached to c, the
 same string separates into four, while when attached to d it divides
 into eight ventral segments.       This may be deduced immediately
from the law enunciated in 38, and its experimental realization
reacts as a proof of that law.
     40. This result admits of extension.       I have here two tuning
forks separated from each other by the musical interval called a <U+FB01>fth.
Attaching a string to one of the forks I stretch until it divides into
two ventral segments; attached to the other fork and stretched with
the same weight, the string divides instantly into three segments
when the fork is set in vibration.     Now to form the interval of a <U+FB01>fth
the vibrations of the one fork must be to those of the other in the
ratio of 2 :3.     The division of the string therefore declares the in
terval.    Here also are two forks separated by an interval of afourth.
With a certain tension one of the forks divides our string into three
ventral segments; with the same tension the other fork divides it
into four, which two numbers express the ratio of the vibrations.        In
the same way the division of the string in relation to all other musi
cal intervals may be illustrated.
    41. Again. Here are two tuning-forks, a and b, one of which (a)
vibrates twice as rapidly as the other.      I attach this string of silk to
d, and stretch the string until it synchronizes with the fork and
vibrates as a whole.      I now form a second string of. silk of the same

                Prof. Tyndall on   the Vibrations of Strings.           75
length by laying four strands of the <U+FB01>rst side by side.       I attach this
compound thread to b, and, keeping the tension the same as in the
last experiment. set 6 in vibration.       The compound thread synchro-'
nizes with b, and swings as a whole.         Now by quadrupling the ori
ginal thread, I obtained a string of twice the diameter of the original
 One; for the transverse section of any string is as the square of its
 diameter.       Hence. as the fork b vibrates with half the rapidity of a,
by doubling the diameter of the string, I halved its rapidity of vibra
 tion. In the same simple way it might be proved that by trebling
 the diameter of the string we reduce the number of its vibrations to
 one third. In general terms :—
      42._ The rapidity of vibration is inversely proportional to the dia-“'
                                                                ‘
 meter of the string.
      43. A beautiful con<U+FB01>rmation of this result is thus obtained :—
 Attached to this tuning-fork is a silk string 6 feet long.       Two feet
 of this string are composed of four strands of the single thread placed
 side by side, the remaining 4 feet are a single thread.          I apply a
 tension which causes the string to divide into two ventral segments.
 But how does it divide ? Not at its centre, as is the case when the
  string is of uniform thickness throughout, but at the point where the
  thick string terminates.      This thick segment 2 feet long is now
  vibrating at the same rate as the thin segment 4 feet long, a result
  which must manifestly follow from the combination of the two laws
  which we have already established.        I  need hardly say that if the
  lengths were in any other ratio than 1 : 2, the node would not be
  formed at the point of union of the two strings.
                                                                         '
      44. We have now to establish the third law of vibrating chords.
  Here are two strings of the same length and thickness.             One of
  them is attached to the fork b, the other to the fork a, which vibrates
  with twice the rapidity of b. Stretched by a weight of 20 grains
  placed on this balanced scale-pan, the string attached to b vibrates
  as a whole.      Substituting the fork a for b, I <U+FB01>nd that a weight of
   80 grains causes the string to vibrate as a whole. Hence to double
   the rapidity of vibration we must quadruple the stretching weight.
   In the same way it might be proved that to treble the rapidity of
   vibration we should have to make the stretching weight nine-fold.
   In general terms :—
       45. The rapidity of vibration is proportional to the square root of
   the tension.
       46. In the foregoing experiment both the tension and the rate of
   vibration were caused to vary.        We will now cause the tension
   alone to vary, and observe the effect upon the entire string. I carry
   this silk chord from this tuning-fork to the scale-pan, and stretch it
   by a weight of 80 grains.      The string vibrates as a whole.     By di
   minishing the weight I relax the string, which <U+FB01>nally divides sharply
   into two ventral segments. What is now the stretching weight?
    20 grains.    With a stretching weight of almost exactly 9 grains it
    divides into three segments, while with a stretching weight of 5 grains
   it divides into four segments. Thus then a tension of one-fourth
    doubles, a tension of one-ninth trebles, a tension of one-sixteenth
    quadruples the number of ventral segments.       In  general terms, the

76                              Royal Society:—
number of segments is inversely proportional to the square root of the
tension. This result may bededuced by reasoning from thelaws enun
ciatedin 38 and 45, and its realization in factcon<U+FB01>rmstheircorrectness*.
     47. Finally, I have here three wires of the same length and thick
ness, but of very different densities ; one of them is of the light metal
aluminium, another of silver, and another of the heavy metal plati
num. I attach the wires in succession to this tuning-fork, and deter
mine the weights necessary to cause them to vibrate as a whole, or
to form the same number of ventral segments.               The stretching
weigh ts here necessary I <U+FB01>nd {to be directly proportional to the spe
ci<U+FB01>c gravities of the wires.        From this result, combined with that
enunciated
  '
               in 45,  it follows that—
     48. The rapidity of vibration of diferent chords of the same length
and thickness is inversely proportional to the square root of their
densities.
     49. It is perhaps worth remarking, that, by means of a tuning
fork, the speci<U+FB01>c gravities of all metals capable of being drawn into
wires of suf<U+FB01>cient <U+FB01>neness and tenacity may be determined.
     The foregoing laws have been combined in various ways; and the
deductions drawn from them, when subjected to the test of direct ex
periment, have in every instance been veri<U+FB01>ed.

     “On Uniform Rotation.” By C. W. Siemens, F.R.S.
     The paper sets out with an inquiry into the conditions of the
conical pendulum as a means of obtaining uniform rotation.            This
instrument, as applied by Watt to regulate the velocity of his steam
engines, is shown to be defective,-——<U+FB01>rst, because the regulated posi
tion of' the valve depends upon the angular position of' the pendulums,
and therefore upon the velocity of rotation, which must be perma
nently changed in order to effect an adjustment of the valve; and
secondly, because when the balance between force and resistance of
the engine at a given velocity is disturbed, the angular position of
 the pendulums will not change until a power has been created in
 them, through acceleration of the engine, suf<U+FB01>cient to overcome the
mechanical resistance of the valve—giving rise to a series of <U+FB02>uctua
tions before a balance between the power and resistance of the engine
is reestablished.
     These defects in Watt’s centrifugal governor are shown to be ob
viated in the chronometric governor, an instrument which was pro
posed by the author of the paper twenty-three years ago, and which
consists of a conical pendulum proceeding at a uniform angle of
rotation, and therefore at uniform speed, which is made to act
upon the regulating-valve by means of a differential motion between
itself and the engine to be regulated, which latter has to accommo

   date itself to the rotations imposed by the independent pendulum.
   The differential-motion wheels are taken advantage of for imparting
   independent driving- or sustaining-power to the pendulum; and a
   constancy of the angle of rotation, notwithstanding              unavoidable
   <U+FB02>uctuations in the sustaining-power, is secured (within certain limits)
   by calling into play a break, or <U+FB02>uid resistance, at the moment when
   the angle of rotation reaches a maximum, which maximum position is
 'perpetuated by increasing the sustaining-power beyond what is strictly
   necessary to overcome the ordinary resistance of the pendulum.
_     The chronometric governor is used by the Astronomer Royal to
  regulate the motion of the large equatorial telescope and recording
  apparatus at Greenwich, in which application a very high degree
  of regularity is attained; but the instrument proved to be too deli
  cate in its adjustments for ordinary steam-engine use.
      After a short allusion to M. Foucault’s governor, the paper enters
  upon the description of a new apparatus which the writer has ima_
  gined for obtaining uniform rotation, notwithstanding great variations
  in the drivmg-power, and which consists, in the main, of a parabolic
  cup, open at top and bottom and mounted upon a vertical axis, which
  cup dips with its smaller opening into a liquid contained within a
  casing completely enclosing the cup.            It is shown that a certain
  angular velocity of the cup will raise the liquid (entering from
  below) in a parabolic curve to its upper edge or brim, and that a very
  slight increase of the velocity will cause actual over<U+FB02>ow, in the form
  of a sheet of liquid, which, being raised and projected against the sides
  of the outer chamber, descends to the bath below, whence fresh
  liquid continually enters the cup. Without the over<U+FB02>ow scarcely
  any power is required to maintain the cup, with the liquid it contains,
 in motion ; but the moment an over<U+FB02>ow ensues, a considerable amount
  of power is absorbed in raising and projecting a continuous stream
  of the liquid, whereby further acceleration is prevented, and nearly
  uniform velocity is the result. W'hen absolute uniformity is required,
  the cup is not <U+FB01>xed upon the rotating axis, but is suspended from
 it by a spiral spring, which not only supports its weight, but also
  transmits the driving-power by its torsional moment.             The cup is
 guided     in  the  centre upon  a helical  surface,  which  arrangement   has
  for its result that an increase of resistance or of driving-power pro
  duces an increased torsional action of the spring, and with it an
  automatic descent of the cup, suf<U+FB01>cient to make up for the thick
 ness of over<U+FB02>ow required to effect the readjustment between power
 and resistance, without permanent increase of angular velocity.
     It is shown that the density of the liquid exercises no in<U+FB02>uence upon
 the velocity of the cup, which velocity is expressed by the following

       In or er to test the principle of action here involved, Mr. Sieinens
    has constructed a clock consisting of a galvanic battery, an electro
  magnet, and his gyrometric cup, besides the necessary reducing
  wheels and hands upon a dial face, which proceeds at a uniform
  rate, although the driving-power may be varied between wide limits,
  by the introduction of arti<U+FB01>cial resistances into the electrical circuit.
  The instrument appears, therefore, well calculated for regulating the
' speed
          of all kinds of philosophical apparatus, and also for obtaining
                  rotations at different places for telegraphic purposes.
     ne of its most interesting applications is embodied in the “ Gyro

'This consists of a cup of 200 millimetres diameter and the same

  closed in an outer chamber, containing water in such quantity that
  the lower extremity of the cup dips below its surface.           The upper
  edge of the rotating cup       is,  in this application, surrounded         aby
  stationary ring armed with vertical varies, by which the over<U+FB02>owing
  liquid  is arrested and directed downward, causing          to fall through

      The cup-spindle carries at its lower extremity pinion, which gears

  ened upon    a  vertical shaft in continuation of the cup-spindle, and        is
  driven round by the engine in the opposite direction to the motion of
  the cup.     The two intermediate or planet-wheels are attached to a
  rocking frame supported, but not <U+FB01>xed, upon the central axis, which
  wheels, in rotating upon their studs, are also free to follow the im
  pulse of either the pinion or the inverted wheel to the extent of
  the di<U+FB02>'erential motion arising between them.         The rocking frame       is
  connected to the regulating valve of the engine, and also to weight a
  suspended from     a   horizontal arm upon the valve-spindle, tending
  to open the valve and at the same time to accelerate the cup to the
  extent of the pressure produced between the teeth of the planet-wheels
and the pinion, while the engine         is   constantly employed to raise
  the weight and to cut off the supply of steam. The result           is  that
  the engine has to conform absolutely to the regular motion imposed
  by the cup, which will be precisely the same when the engine                  is
 charged with its maximum or its minimum of resisting load.
      The paper shows that the action upon the valve must take place
 at the moment when the balance between the power and load of
 the engine    is  disturbed, and that the readjustment will be effected
 notwithstanding    a   resistance of the valve exceeding 100 kilogrammes
 -—a result tending towards the attainment of several important objects.

                                 BY MR. CHASE.
                    observations with a Savart polariscope having led me to
.
  RECENT
     results       which, while generally con<U+FB01>rmatory, differ in a few par
    ticulars from those published by Sir David Brewster (Philosophical
   Magazine, S. 4. vol. xxx. pp. 118 and 166 et seq.), Iplace some of
 ,them on record to facilitate     a    comparison with similar observations
    at other places.
  ’
     1.    In all the great circles which pass through the sun the polari
   zation of a clear sky     is positive, except in the neighbourhood of the
 _solar and antisolar points.          If the polariscope     rotated from the
                                                             is
   positive maximum, the bands gradually diminish in brilliancy, vanish
   ing at about 45°, and attaining       a   negative maximum at about 90°.
       2. Within the primary lemniscates, of which the solar and anti—
   solar points are the respective centres, and the neutral points (actual
 -or theoretical   *)    are the limits, the polarization of a clear sky        is
   negative when the bands pass towards the sun’s centre, vanishing
 _when the bands are inclined 45° to the solar radii, and attaining a
   positive maximum when the inclination reaches 90°.                           '
_      3. Arago’s and Babinet’s neutral points can be seen as well before
    sunrise as after sunset, provided the atmospheric conditions are the
    same. Brewster gives the preference to the evening observation,
‘but apparently for no other reason than that the sky                 then gene
                                                                       is
    rally clearer than in the morning. (Vol. cit. p. 118.)
      I4. have repeatedly, and with little comparatiVe dif<U+FB01>culty, observed
    Brewster’s neutral point.        In the majority of cases, when the sun’s
    altitude has been su<U+FB02>icient,   I    have been able to <U+FB01>x its position with
    nearly as much facility as that of Babinet's.        (For the dif<U+FB01>culties of
JBrewster and Babinet, see lac. cit. pp. 119, 166, 181.)
        5. Within the solar primary lemniscate       it     frequently di<U+FB02>icult
                                                            is
   to make any ordinary observation of the polarized bands, on account
a of the
            dazzling intensity of the light.        But when the direct rays of
   the sun have been shut off by       a   thin disk (placed with its edge to
    wards the eye, so that the polarization will not be affected by re
 <U+FB02>exion from the surface of the disk), have often been able to mark
                                             I                                       ,
'
   the opposite polarizations and the position of the neutral points with
   perfect case, even at midday.           '
        6. In our climate     is
                             it   by no means unusual to have days on which
 .all the three neutral points can be observed, and their places deter
    mined.     During the whole period of Brewster’s observations at St.
    Andrews he found but two such days, April and       5          1842 (lac. cit.
                                                                  8,
   pp.    124, 163).
        7. Quasi neutral lines, dividing bands of opposite polarization, can
    be found in nearly all parts of the sky by rotating the polariscope
    45° from the line of maximum positive or negative polarization.
       * There
             is    one theoretical neutral point below the antisolar point.  It is
  robably never above the horizon when there       is   light enough to determine
its position.

 But a slight additional rotation will show that the neutralization is
 only apparent.
     8. The position of a true neutral point can be determined by
'sweeping its neighbourhood alternately with the vertical and with
 the horizontal bands, and marking the intersection of the lines of va
  nishing polarization.
     9. In consequence of the arrangement of the lines of equal polari
  zation, when the sky is swept with a polariscope for a few degrees on
 each side of a neutral point, the line which separates the oppositely
 polarized bands forms curves with a convexity determined by the
 position of the sun or the antisolar point".
     10. Some of my observations have indicated an apparent corre
 lation between these curves and the magnetic dip and terrestrial
 latitude.    I have not been able to satisfy myself whether this corre
spondence was merely accidental, or whether it indicated another
 point of analogy between the laws of light and magnetism.
     11. The varying e<U+FB01>’ects of haze or cloud appear, on the whole,
 to con<U+FB01>rm BreWster’s theory that the neutral point is produced
                                                                         “ by
 the opposite action of light polarized by re<U+FB02>exion         and  refraction."
  (See pp. 1'23, 169,176, 178, 180.)
      12. In one instance, soon after sunset, the re<U+FB02>exion from scat
 tered clouds in the neighbourhood of the antisolar point was such as
  to totally eclipse Arago’s neutral point, the polarization being posi_
  tive over the entire arch, from Babinet's neutral point to the eastern
  horizon—Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, vol. x.

                   ON MOTION     IN A RESISTING MEDIUM.
                     BY DR. 0. SCHRECK OF BREMEN.
     A series of experiments were made by <U+FB01>lling a tall vessel with
  water, and allowing bodies to fall in it. From_the space fallen
  through and the time occupied, an approximate conclusion could be
  drawn as to the resistance of the liquid. The results are as follows :—
      (1) With velocities up to 20 centimetres the resistance is propor
  tional to the square of the velocity.
      (2) With greater velocities it is proportional to a higher power of
  the velocity, which increases with the increase of the resisting
  surface.
      (3) The resistance to spheres is approximately proportional to
  the square of the diameter of the sphere, but, with larger spheres,
  increases with the diameter in a continually increasing ratio.
 5' (4) The resistances to spheres and cylinders of the same diameter
  are as 2 : 3.
     (5) A cone experiences greater resistance than a sphere of the
  same diameter.—-Poggendortf’s       Annalen, April 1866.
     *  I am not aware whether this is the “ singular effect ” thus described
 by Brewster (loc. cit. p. 124) :—“ In carrying the bands vertically round,
 the neutral line, in place of crossing them at a right angle, was the arc of
 a circle, to which one of the bands was a tangent.”

                             [With a Plate.]      _
               all the reactions which can be performed by means
ALMOST  of the blowpipe may be accomplished with far greater ease
and precision in the <U+FB02>ame of the non-luminous gas-lamp.      This
<U+FB02>ame, moreover, possesses several peculiarities which render it
available for reactions by which the smallest traces of many sub
stances occurring mixed together can be detected with certainty
when the blowpipe and even still more delicate methods fail.
   The number of new reactions which can in this way be per
formed is so large that     I
                           am only able here to mention the most
important,.leaving it to those who wish to make themselves ac
quainted with this subject to apply the same principles to other
cases, and to follow out this method in other directions.
     I. THE STRUCTURE or THE NON-LUMINOUS GAS-FLAME.
    The gas-lamp with non-luminous <U+FB02>ame used for these reac
tions is represented in <U+FB01>g. 1, Plate    I.,and must be made, exactly
to scale, 3% times as large as the drawing.        It must be furnished
with a   cap  at
               a   for closing and  opening    the draught-holes, so as
to be able to regulate the supply of air for every dimension of
the <U+FB02>ame.        The conical chimney dddd, <U+FB01>g.        2,  must also be
made of such    a  size that the <U+FB02>ame burns perfectly steady.
    Fig. 2 represents this <U+FB02>ame of its natural size.         It com
                                                               is
posed of the following three chief divisions :—
    A. The dark cone, a 11, containing the cold unburnt gas mixed
                        a
with about 62 per cent. of atmospheric air.
    B. The <U+FB02>ame-mantle, acab, formed of the burning coal-gas
mixed with air.

   C. The luminous point, a b a, not seen when the lamp is bum
ing with   the draught-holes open, but obtained of the size required
for the reactions by closing these holes up to a certain point.
   The following six points in the <U+FB02>ame are used in the re
actions  :—
    (1)  The base  of the <U+FB02>ame lies at at; its temperature is compa
ratively very low, as here the burning gas is cooled by the up
ward current of cold air, and much heat is absorbed by the cold
end of the metal tube.      Ifmixtures of <U+FB02>ame-colouring substances
are held in this part of the <U+FB02>ame, it is often possible to vaporize
the most volatile constituent, and thus in the <U+FB01>rst few moments
to obtain tints which cannot be observed at higher temperatures,
because they then become masked by colours produced by the
volatilization of the remaining substances.              -
   (2)   The  zone offusionlies   at B, somewhat above the <U+FB01>rst third
of the <U+FB02>ame in height, and midway between the inner and outer
limits of the mantle at the point where the <U+FB02>ame is thickest.
This is the point in the <U+FB02>ame which possesses the highest tem
perature, and it is therefore used in testing substances as regards
their melting-point, their volatility, emissive power, as well as
for all processes of fusion at high temperatures.
    (3) The lower owidizing<U+FB02>ame lies at 'y, in the outer margin of
the zone of fusion, and is especially suitable for the oxidation of    .
substances dissolved in beads of fused salts.
   (4) The upper oxidizing <U+FB02>ame at e is formed by the highest
point of the non-luminous <U+FB02>ame, and acts most powerfully when
the draught-holes of the lamp are wide open.             This <U+FB02>ame is
suited for the oxidation of larger portions of substance, for roasting
o<U+FB02>' volatile oxidation-products, and generally for all those cases of
oxidation in which an excessively high temperature is not needed.
    (5) The lower reducing<U+FB01>ame lies at 5, on the interior edge of
the mantle next to the dark central zone.        As the reducing gases
at this point are mixed with unburnt atmospheric oxygen, many
substances remain here unaltered which become deoxidized on
exposure to the upper reducing <U+FB02>ame.           This point of the <U+FB02>ame
gives, therefore, very valuable reactions which cannot be obtained
with the blowpipc.        It is especially available for reductions on
charcoal, and in beads of fused salts.
   (6) The upper reducing <U+FB02>ame is formed by the luminous point 17,
produced over the dark zone when the admission of air is lessened
by the gradual closing of the draught-holes (<U+FB01>g. 1, a). If this
luminous point is made too large, it will be found that a test
tube <U+FB01>lled with cold water becomes covered with a <U+FB01>lm of lamp
black: this never ought to occur. This <U+FB02>ame contains no free
oxygen, is rich in <U+FB01>nely divided incandescent carbon, and hence
it possesses far more powerful reducing-powers than the lower

reducing <U+FB02>ame.           It is especially available forr'reducing metals
when it is desired to collect them in the form of <U+FB01>lms.
  II.  Mnrnon or EXAMINATION IN             THE   vaarous mars or run
                                    FLAME.
        A. Behaviour of the       Elements  at High  Temperatures.
    This   is one of the most important reactions which can be em
ployed    for the detection and separation of ubstances.         The pos
sibility  of producing, with the <U+FB02>ame of the lamp alone, a tempera
ture as   high as or higher than that of the blowpipe, depends upon
the fact that the radiating surface of the heated body be made as
small as possible.        The arrangement for bringing the substances
into the <U+FB02>ame must therefore be on a very small scale. The pla
tinum wire upon which the substance is heated must. scarcely
exceed the thickness of a horsehair, and one decimetre in length
of the wire must not weigh more than 0'034 grm. It is impos
sible to obtain the results hereafter detailed if a thicker wire than
this is employed.        Substances which act upon platinum, or which
will not adhere to the moistened surface of the metal, are held
in the <U+FB02>ame upon a thin thread of asbestos, of which a hundred
may be obtained from one splinter of the mineral.           These threads
must not exceed in thickness one-fourth of that of an ordinary
lucif'er-mateh.       Decrepitating substances are ground to the <U+FB01>nest
powder on the porcelain lamp-plate with the elastic blade (a) of
the knife (<U+FB01>g. 4), and drawn up on to a moistened strip of one
square centimetre of <U+FB01>lter-paper.           If the paper is then burnt,
being    held   with  ‘the  platinum forceps, or, better, between two
rings    of   <U+FB01>ne  platinum wire, the sample remains as a coherent
crust, which now may withbut dif<U+FB01>culty be heated in the <U+FB02>ame.
    If the substance requires to be heated in the <U+FB02>ame for a long
period, the holder (<U+FB01>g. 5) is used.          The arm (a) is fastened to
the carrier (A), so <U+FB01>xed on the stand by a spring (as seen at B)
that it can be moved both horizontally and vertically. The glass
tube (<U+FB01>g. 6) is held on this arm (a), and the <U+FB01>ne platinum wire
fused on to the tube thus held in the <U+FB02>ame.              The splinters of
 asbestos are stuck into the glass tube (6), which slips into the
 holder, and'may then be moved with the carrier (A).             The car
 rier (B) carries a spring-clamp for holding test-tubes which have
to be heated for a considerable time in a particular part of the          _
 <U+FB02>ame.       The little turntable (C) contains nine upright supports
 to hold the wire tubes (<U+FB01>g. 6) employed in the experiments.
 By means of these arrangements a particle of the substance
 under examination is brought into the <U+FB02>ame, and its behaviour
 in the coldest and hottest parts of the <U+FB02>ame is ascertained, the
substance being examined with a lens after each change of tem

perature. The following six different temperatures can be ob
tained in the <U+FB02>ame, and these points may be judged of by obser
ving the tints attained by the thin platinum wire :—
                      1. Below 0. red heat.
                     2. Commencing red heat.
                     3. Red heat.
                     4. Commencing white heat.
                     5. White heat.
                     6. Strong white heat.
    It is scarcely necessary to remark that these different tempe
ratures must not be ascertained by the glow of the substances
themselves, as the luminosity of different bodies depends not
only upon the temperature, but also mainly upon their speci<U+FB01>c
power of emission.
   The following phenomena are observed when a sample of a sub
stance is heated :—-         »
    1. Emission of Light—The emissive power of substances is
ascertained by placing them on the platinum wire in the hot
test part of the <U+FB02>ame.      The sample is of weak emissive power
when it is less luminous than the platinum wire, of a mean emis
sive power when both appear about equally luminous, and of
strong emissive power when the intensity of the light which it
emits is greater than that from the platinum.       Most solid bodies
emit a white light, others (as, for instance, erbia) coloured light.
   Some bodies, such as many osmium, carbon, and molybdenum
compounds, volatilize and separate out <U+FB01>nely divided solid mat
ter, which renders the <U+FB02>ame luminous.            Gases and vapours
always   exhibit  a smaller power  of emission than  fused substances,
and these generally less than solid bodies.         The form of the
substance under examination must always be noted, as the emis
sive power depends upon the nature of the surface: thus com
pact alumina, obtained by slowly heating the hydrate, possesses
only a moderate emissive power, whereas the porous oxide pre
pared by quick ignition of the sulphate possesses a high power
of emission.
   2. The meltiny point is determined by using the six different
temperatures already mentioned.         At every increase of tempera
ture the head is examined with the lens to see whether the v0
lume is decreased or increased, whether bubbles are given off on
melting, whether, on cooling, the bead is transparent, and what
changes of colour it undergoes during the action of the heat or
on afterwards cooling.
   3. The volatility is ascertained by allowing equally heavy
beads of the substance, placed on a platinum wire, to evaporate
in thev zonejof fusion, and observing the time, by means of a me

                Prof. R. Bunsen on Flame Reactions.                              85
 tronome, which the bead takes to volatilize.      The point at which
 the whole of the substance is converted into vapour can be ascer
 tained with great accuracy, often to a fraction of a second, by the
 sudden disappearance of the coloration of the <U+FB02>ame.        The plati
 num wire upon which the substance is weighed is protected from
 the moisture of the air by insertion in a tube (<U+FB01>g. 7).        If we
 know the Weight of the tube and Wire, the right weight of sub
 stance can easily be attached, either by volatilizing a portion or
 by fusing some more substance on to the bead, and thus making
it lighter or heavier.    The experiments are best made with one
centigramme of substance.        The position in the <U+FB02>ame where the
highest constant temperature exists can be found by moving a
<U+FB01>ne platinum wire, <U+FB01>xed on a stand and bent at its point at a
right angle, slowly about the zone of fusion, and noting the point
where it glows most intensely.       The beads to be volatilized are
then most carefully brought into the <U+FB02>ame at the same distance
from the point of this wire.      Care must also be taken that the
dimensions of the flame do not undergo change from alterations
in the pressure of the gas whilst the experiments are going on.
As a measure of volatility, it is convenient to take the time
needed to evaporate one centigramme         of the sodium-chloride.

weight of another substance            t1,

   Drops of water, alcohol, ether, and other volatile liquids
brought into the <U+FB02>ame on the platinum wire do not boil even in
the hottest part of the <U+FB02>ame, and hence they exhibit under these
circumstances the phenomenon of the spheroidal state.
   4. Flame-coloration.—Many substances which volatilize in the
<U+FB02>ame may be detected         by
                            the peculiar kinds of light which their
glowing gases emit. These colorations appear in the upper oxi
dizing <U+FB02>ame when the substance causing them            placed in the is
upper reducing <U+FB02>ame.      Mixtures of various <U+FB02>ame-colouring sub
stances are tested in the lowest and coldest part of the <U+FB02>ame   and              ;

  easily made out of one ordinary-sized test-tube, by softening the
  glass before the blowpipe, and then drawing it out until the re
  quisite size of tube is obtained.     This long tube is then cut up
  with a diamond into pieces 6 to 8 centims. long, and each of
  these again divided into two over the lamp, and the closed ends
  neatly rounded. The sample having been <U+FB01>nely powdered with the
- knife-blade
                (<U+FB01>g. 4, a) on the porcelain plate (fig. 3), is treated
  in a tube either by itself, or with a mixture of carbon and soda,
  or with sodium or magnesium.            A.pieee of magnesium wire a
  few millims. in length is for this purpose pushed down into the
  powdered sample contained in the glass tube ; the sodium is care
  fully freed from rock-oil and rolled out between the <U+FB01>ngers to a
  small cylinder, which is then surrounded by the powdered sub
  stance.    The best form of carbon is the soot from turpentine,
  which has been deposited upon the outside of a basin <U+FB01>lled with
  cold water.     As soon as the small tube containing the perfectly
  dry sample has been heated to the point of fusion of the glass,
  when generally an ignition inside the tube is noticed, it is allowed
  to cool and then placed upon the porcelain plate, covered by a
  piece of paper and crushed to powder with the knife, for the pur
  pose of further examining the products of reduction.
     2. Reduction on splinters 0f Charcoal.—In this way the metal
  can he obtained in small globules, or as a porous mass, from            '
  quantities often less than a inilligramme of the sample.              .
     A transparent crystal of sodium-carbonate is brought near to
  the outside of the <U+FB02>ame, and a common wooden lucifer-match
  then rubbed over two-thirds of its length with the drops of fused
  salt.   If the match is then turned upon its axis through the
  <U+FB02>ame, the carbonized wood becomes surrounded with a crust of
  solid sodium-carbonate, which, on heating in the zone of fusion,
   melts and is absorbed by the carbon.         A splinter of charcoal is
  thus obtained, which is prevented from burning by its glaze of
  soda.    A mixture of the substance is then made with the knife
  upon the hand with one drop of the melted soda-crystal, and a
  portion of this, of the size of a mustard-seed, placed upon the point
  of the splinter. As soon as this has been melted in the lower oxi_
  dizing flame, it is passed through a part of the dark interior zone
  to the hotter portion of the lower reducing <U+FB02>ame.          The point at
  which the reduction occurs is easily seen by the violent efferves
  cence of the soda; and this is after a time stopped by bringing
  the splinter into the dark zone.       In order to isolate the reduced
  metal, the end of the splinter is broken off and rubbed up with
  a few drops of water in a small agate mortar, when the metallic
  particles are generally visible without removal of the carbon.
  For further examination, the carbon and soda can be easily re
 moved by several careful washings, and the particles transferred

to a small piece of curved glass cut out from                  an old <U+FB02>ask*, in
 which they are again washed by decantation,                    the last drops of
 water removed by suction with a piece of <U+FB01>lter-paper, and the
 metallic particles dried at a moderate heat.                  A few tenths of a
 milligramme of the metal is generally suf<U+FB01>cient to yield a solu
 tion with which all the characteristic precipitations can be accom
 plished, the reagents being contained in capillary glass threads,
  dropped into the solution by the milligramme, and the effect thus
 produced ascertained by examination with a lens.                      Iron, cobalt,
 and nickel, which do not fuse to globules on the splinter, are
 withdrawn from the agate mortar by means of the point of the
 magnetized blade (<U+FB01>g. 4, b), washed with water, and dried high
 above the <U+FB02>ame on the point of the knife.                  If the blade be then
tightly drawn between          the   upper part    of the  thumb     and the lower
 part   of  the  <U+FB01>rst  <U+FB01>nger,   and   if  the  point   of the  blade    be then ap
 proached     to  the   metallic   particles    on  the  <U+FB01>nger, they jump from
the    hand   to  the   blade, forming      a  brush-like   bundle which can be
conveniently       examined    by   the  lens,  and  by touching with a melted
 borax-bead can be transferred in suitable quantities. The por
tion of metal remaining on the knife is rubbed on to a small
piece of <U+FB01>lter-paper, a drop of acid added, and the paper warmed
 over the <U+FB02>ame so as to allow the metal to dissolve ; this solution
 can then be further examined with various reagents.
  ~ 3. Films
                  upon P0rcelain.-—Those volatile elements which are
reduced by carbon and hydrogen can be deposited from their
 compounds as <U+FB01>lms on porcelain either in the elementary state
 or as oxides.       Such <U+FB01>lms can be extremely easily.converted into
 iodides, sulphides, and other compounds, and thus may be made
 to serve as most valuable and characteristic tests.                  The <U+FB01>lms are
 composed      in  the  centre  of  a thicker    layer,   which   on  all sides gra
 dually    becomes     thinner   until    the  merest    tinge   is reached   ; it is
                                                                    ” and “ thin ”
 therefore necessary to distinguish between “thick
 parts of the <U+FB01>lms.        Both exhibit in their variation of thickness all
 the tints of colour characteristic of the substance under different
 circumstances of division.             One-tenth up to one milligramme
 is in many cases su<U+FB02>icient for these reactions.                    Many surpass
 Marsh’s arsenic test in delicacy and certainty, and approach
 in this respect the spectrum-analytical methods.
     The following <U+FB01>lms can be obtained :-—
     (a) Metallic <U+FB01>lms are prepared by holding in one
                                                                        hand a par
 ticle of the substance on an asbestos-thread in the upper reducing
 <U+FB02>ame, which must not be too large, whilst with the other hand
 a glazed porcelain         basin, 1 to 2 decimetres in diameter, <U+FB01>lled
 with cold water, is held close above the asbestos-thread in the
 upper reducing <U+FB02>ame.            The metals separate out as dead-black
    " Watch-glasses crack much too readily to be used for such experiments.

                 Prof. R. Bunsen on Flame Reactions.                89
or brilliantly-black <U+FB01>lms of varying thickness. Even lead, tin,
cadmium, and zinc yield in this way <U+FB01>lms of reduced metal which
by mere inspection cannot be distinguished from the soot sepa
rated out on the porcelain by a smoky <U+FB02>ame.            By means of a
glass rod,   these <U+FB01>lms  can be touched  with  a drop  of dilute nitric
acid containing about 20 per cent. of real acid; and the various
degrees of solubility of the <U+FB01>lms serves as a distinguishing cha
                                                          ’
racteristic.
    (b) Oxide-<U+FB01>lms are obtained by holding the porcelain basin
<U+FB01>lled with water in the upper oxidizing <U+FB02>ame, the rest of the
operation being the same as in the production of the metallic
<U+FB01>lms.     If only a very small quantity of the sample can be em
ployed, care must be taken to lessen the siZe of the <U+FB02>ame, in
order that the volatile products may not be spread over too large a     .
surface of porcelain.
   The <U+FB01>lm of oxide is examined as follows :—
    (a) The colour of the thick and thin <U+FB01>lm is carefully observed.
    ([3) The reducing action or otherwise of a drop of stannous
chloride is noted.
    (7) If no reduction occurs, caustic soda is added to the stan
nous chloride until the precipitated hydrate redissolves, and then
it is to be observed whether a reduction occurs.
    (5) A drop of perfectly neutral silver-nitrate is rubbed over the
<U+FB01>lm with a glass rod, and a current of ammoniacal air is blown
over the surface from a small wash-bottle containing ammonia
solution, and having the mouth-tube dipping under the liquid
and the exit-tube cut o<U+FB01>' close below the cork. If a precipitate
is formed, the colour is observed, and the solubility or alteration,
if any, noticed which occurs when the current of alkaline air is
continued, or when a drop of ammonia-liquor is added.
    (0) Iodide-<U+FB01>lms are simply obtained from the oxide-<U+FB01>lms by
breathing on the latter upon the cold basin, which is then placed
upon the wide-mouthed well-stoppered glass (<U+FB01>g. 8) containing
fuming hydriodic acid and phosphorous acid derived from the
gradual deliquescence of phosphoric triiodide.        When the mix
ture no longer fumes, owing to absorption of moisture, it is easy
to render it again fuming by adding a little anhydrous phosphoric
acid.    Other <U+FB01>lms, often containing both iodides of a metal, and,
therefore frequently less regular in colour and appearance, may
be easily obtained by smoking the oxide-<U+FB01>lm with a <U+FB02>ame of alco
hol containing iodine in solution placed upon a bundle of asbestos
threads and held under the basin.       If any iodine be condensed
on the basin with the hydriodic acid, it can easily be removed by
gentle warming and blowing.
   The examination of the <U+FB01>lm is conducted as follows :—
    (a) The solubility of the <U+FB01>lm is examined simply by breathing

90                     Prof. R. Bunsen          o'n   Flame Reactions.
upon it when the basin is cooled ; the colour then either changes
or entirely disappears, the <U+FB01>lm being dissolved in the moisture of
the breath.      If the basin be gently warmed, or if it be blown
 upon    for some    distance, the <U+FB01>lm again becomes visible by the
evaporation     of the  moisture in the current of air.
    (,8)  The  ammonia     compound of the iodide is formed by blow
ing ammoniacal air upon it and noticing whether the colour of
the thick and thin <U+FB01>lms alters quickly, slowly, or not at all.   The
different colours reappear at once if the basin be held for a few
             over an open bottle containing fuming hydrochloric
mogients
acl .
   ('y) The iodide-<U+FB01>lms generally give the same reactions as the
oxide-<U+FB01>lms with silver-nitrate and ammonia, with stannous chlo
                                         °
ride, and with caustic soda.
   (d) The sulphide-<U+FB01>lm is most easily obtained from the iodide
<U+FB01>lm by blowing upon it a current of air saturated with ammo
nium-sulphide, and removing the excess of sulphide by gently
warming the porcelain. It is advisable to breathe on the <U+FB01>lm
from time to time whilst the current of sulphuretted air is being
blown on the basin.    The experiments to be made with this <U+FB01>lm
are   :—
   (a) The solubility or otherwise in water is ascertained by
breathing on to     or   addition of
                           it,   by     drop of water.   The sul
                                                           a
phides often possess the same colour as the iodide-<U+FB01>lms; they
may, however, generally be distinguished                        by
                                             their insolubility on
breathing.
   (B) The solubility of the sulphide in ammonium-sulphide                                    is
ascertained          by
                 blowing or dropping.
   41- Films on Test-tubes.—Under       certain circumstances                            it   is
advisable not to collect the <U+FB01>lm on porcelain, but upon the out
side of large test-tube (<U+FB01>g.
           a                          this method

when   it     needed to collect larger quantities of the reduction
               is
<U+FB01>lm for the purposes of further examination.      The <U+FB01>ne asbestos
thread with the sample of substance        held on the glass tube (b)
                                                           is

                                 it   is

lowest point     just above the end of the asbestos-thread.
                     is                                         If the
lamp be now pushed under the test-tube, the substance and the
asbestos-thread    are in the reducing <U+FB02>ame.      By repeating this
operation the <U+FB01>lm can be obtained of any wished-for thickness;
some pieces of marble are in this case placed in the test-tube, to
prevent the water from being thrown out of the tube           percus                by
sive boiling.
                    III.   THE REACTIONS          OF THE        ELEMENTS.
  The elements, which can easily                      be    recognized        by   their <U+FB02>ame

                  Prof. R. Bunsen on Flame Reactions.                       91
reactions, are arranged in the following groups and subgroups
according to their behaviour in the reducing and oxidizing
<U+FB02>ames       :—
  A. Elements which        are reducible           to metal and are deposited
in <U+FB01>lms.                                                        p
       1. Films scarcely soluble in cold dilute nitric acid—tellu
          rium, selenium, antimony, arsenic.
       2. Films slowly and di<U+FB02>icultly soluble in cold dilute nitric
        acid—~bismuth, mercury, thallium.
     3. Films instantly soluble in cold dilute nitric acid—cad
        mium, zinc, indium.
  B. Elements reducible to the metallic state, giving no <U+FB01>lm.
     1. Not fusible to a metallic bead.
        a. Magnetic—irOn, nickel, cobalt.
       b. Non-magnetic—-palladium,      platinum, rhodium, iri
             dium.
     2. Fusible to metallic beads—copper, tin, silver, gold.
  C. Elements most easily separated and recognized as com
pounds—tungsten, titanium, tantalum and niobium, silicon,
chromium, vanadium, manganese, uranium, sulphur, phosphorus.
  I now proceed to consider the special behaviour of the bodies
named in the foregoing groups.
                 1. Behaviour   of   the   Tellurium Compounds.
   (a) Flame-coloration—In    the upper reducing <U+FB02>ame pale blue,
whilst the upper oxidizing  <U+FB02>ame  appears green.
   (b) Volatilization unaccompanied by any smell.
   (0) Reduction <U+FB01>lmblack, thinnest part b'lackish brown, dead or
bright; heated with concentrated sulphuric acid gives splendid
carmine-red colour.
    (if) Oxide-<U+FB01>lm white, invisible or nearly so; stannous chloride
colours it black from reduced tellurium ; silver-nitrate, after
blowing with ammoniacal air, yellowish white.
      (e)Iodide-<U+FB01>lm blackish brown, thinnest part brown; disap
pears   momentarily    on breathing upon              it,
                                                but not when slightly
warmed reappears on exposure to hydrochloric acid; blackened
            ;
                                                       '
 by  stannous chloride.
    (f) Sulphide-<U+FB01>lm blackish brown to black; does not disap
pear by breathing; soluble in sulphuretted air reappears on     ;
warming or        by
                   dry blowing.            ,
   (9)    On the charcoal splinter with soda yields sodium-telluride,
                                                            a
which, when moistened, leaves           black mark on
                                               a          silver coin;
                                                                    a
and   if the sample contains much tellurium, gives off        smell of  a
telluretted hydrogen when moistened with hydrochloric acid.

                2. Behaviour         of   the Selenium     Compounds.
   (a) Flame-coloration—the bright blue of the corn-<U+FB02>ower.
   (h)  Volatilizes and burns, giving off the peculiar putrid smell
of selenium.
       Reduction <U+FB01>lm brick-red to cherry-red, sometimes dead,
     (c)
sometimes bright; heated with strong sulphuric acid, gives an
olive-green  solution.
     (d
     )  Oxide-<U+FB01>lm white     on addition of stannous chloride, brick
                                ;
red from liberated selenium     the red colour becomes darker on
                                      ;
addition of caustic soda; silver nitrate gives      white not easily
                                                               a
visible coloration, which disappears in      current of ammoniacal
                                                       a
air.
   (e) Iodide-<U+FB01>lm brown, contains some reduced selenium,         and
hence cannot be completely removed either                    by
                                                  blowing with am
moniacal air or        by
                     breathing.
   (f) Sulphide-<U+FB01>lm yellow to orange-red, insoluble in water,
soluble in ammonium-sulphide.         As the sulphide      prepared     is
from the iodide,     also contains free selenium, and does not give
                       it
very clear reactions.
   (g) Reduction with soda on [he charcoal splinter gives sodium
selenide, producing    black mark on
                            a           silver coin when moist
                                                      a
ened, and giving rise,     the quantity be not too small, when
                                if
touched with hydrochloric acid, to red selenium and       smell of           a
seleniuretted     hydrogen.
              3. Behaviour          of    the   Antimony Compounds.
   (a) Flame-coloration,  treatment in the upper reducing <U+FB02>ame,
                                 by
pale green, unaccompanied      any smell. by
   (6) Reduction <U+FB01>lm black, sometimes dead, sometimes bright.
   (c) Owia'e-<U+FB01>lm white; moistened with perfectly neutral silver
nitrate solution and then blown on                    by
                                          ainmoniacal air, gives                 it
a  black spot which does not disappear in ammonia.          If the
<U+FB01>lm be <U+FB01>rst placed over bromine-vapour the reaction cannot
be obtained, owing to the oxidation of antimonious to anti
monic acid.     It unaltered stannous chloride, either with or
                       is                   by
without caustic soda.
    (d) Iodide-<U+FB01>lm orange-red, disappearing                  by
                                               breathing, and re
appearing       by
                blowing or warming:   blown on  with ammoniacal
air  it disappears, but does  not return; generally     gives the       it
same reactions        as the oxide.
     (e)
       Sulphia'e-<U+FB01>lm  orange-red; the <U+FB01>lm          dif<U+FB01>cult to blow

away  with  sulphide of ammonium;      returns on  blowing  with air;
insoluble in water.
   (f) VVilh soda 0n charcoal splinter gives no black stain on silver,
but yields    white brittle metallic bead.

                     Prof. R. B‘unsen 0n Flame Reactions.                             93
                   fl.   Behaviour        of   the Arsenic Compounds.
   (a) Flame-coloration in upper reducing <U+FB02>ame pale blue, giving
the well-known arsenical smell.
   (b) Reduction <U+FB01>lm black, dead or brilliant, thin <U+FB01>lm brown.
   (0) Owide—<U+FB01>l'm white; touched with perfectly neutral silver
nitrate and then blown with ammoniacal air,          gives   canary it            a
yellow precipitate, ,soluble in ammonia.        Together with the
lemon-yellow precipitate,   bricksred one of silver-arseniate occurs
                                      a
when the <U+FB01>lm has previously been treated with bromine-vapour.
Stannous chloride with and without soda produces no change.
    (d) Iodide-<U+FB01>lm     deep yellow, disappears on breathing, but
                            is
returns on drying; disappears in ammoniacal air and does not
return; reappears unaltered after the action of hydrochloric
 acid.
    (e) Su/phide-<U+FB01>lm lemon-yellow, disappears easily on blowing
with ammonium-sulphide, and reappears on warming or blowing                           ;
insoluble in water, and does not disappear        breathing.   by
    (f) Reduction on charcoal splinter yields no metallic head.
                   5.    Behaviour        of   the   Bismuth Compounds.
       Flame-coloration bluish, not characteristic.
     (a)
   (b) Reduction <U+FB01>lm black, dead or brilliant; thin portion of
<U+FB01>lm brownish black.
       Oxide-<U+FB01>lm light yellow; unaltered
      (0)                                                      by
                                                  silver nitrate with
or without ammonia; gives no reaction ’with stannous chloride,
but yields black precipitate of bismuth suboxide on addition of
caustic soda.                              >
   (d) Iodide-<U+FB01>lm    very  characteristic,
                           is                and remarkable     for the
number of tints which       assumes; the thick part
                                     it                     of brown         is   a
or blackish-brown colour with shade of lavender-blue; the thin
                                                a
<U+FB01>lm varies from <U+FB02>esh-coloured to light pink;                        it
                                                     easily disappears                     '
on breathing, and appears again on blowing; in         stream of am-     a
moniacal air    passes from pink to orange, and on blowing or
                    it
warming     again attains
              it              chestnut-brown colour;
                                      a                      resembles       it
the oxide-<U+FB01>lm in its behaviour to stannous chloride and caustic
soda.
        Sulphide-<U+FB01>lm
      (e)               of burnt-umbercolour, the thin parts are
                                is    a
of   lighter coffee-brown colour; does not disappear on blowing,

   (f) On charcoal splinter with soda the bismuth compounds are
reduced to     metallic bead, yielding, when rubbed in the mortar,
               a
bright shining yellowish splinters of metal soluble in nitric acid.
The solution gives, with stannous chloride and caustic soda, black
bismuth suboxide.

                  6. Behaviour   of   the   Mercury Compounds.
   (0) Metallic <U+FB01>lm is mouse-grey,     non-coherent, and spreads
over the whole basin.    To obtain small traces of mercury in the
reduced state, the sample is mixed with soda and saltpetre and
<U+FB01>lled into a thin test-tube 5 to 6 millims. wide and 10 to 20
millims. long. This is held by a platinum wire in the <U+FB02>ame,
whilst the bottom of the basin <U+FB01>lled with cold water is placed
close above the open end of the tube.               If
                                              the quantity of mer
cury is considerable, the metal collects in the form of small glo
bules which can be seen with a lens, and which can be collected
into larger drops by wiping the basin with a piece of moistened
<U+FB01>lter-paper.                                          .
   (b) Oxide-<U+FB01>lm cannot be obtained.
   (0) Iodide-<U+FB01>lm is obtained by breathing on the metallic <U+FB01>lm
and then placing it over the vessel (<U+FB01>g. 8) containing moist bro
mine.    It <U+FB01>rst becomes black and then disappears, but not until
after some time, as mercuric bromide is formed.       the basin beIf
now placed above the vessel of fuming hydriodic acid, a very cha
racteristic carmine-coloured <U+FB01>lm of mercuric iodide is produced:
this is often accompanied by mercurous iodide; but neither of
thesedisappear on breathing, nor when blown with am moniacal air.
   (11) Sulphide-<U+FB01>lm black, not altered by breathing
                                                     or by blow
ing with ammonium-sulphide.
     (e)   With   soda on the charcoal splinter gives no reaction.
              7. Behaviour       of   the Thallium Compounds
    As the presence of few millionths of milligramme of thal
                           a                        a
lium can be recognized           by
                                the spectroscope,     does not often
happen that this metal needs to be sought for             in it
                                                      any other way.
I  add the following reactions for the   sake of  completeness.
    (a) Flame-coloration bright grass-green.
     (b) Metallic <U+FB01>lm black; thin parts coffee-coloured.
     (c)  Oxide-<U+FB01>lm colourless,- with stannous chloride and soda,
as well as with silver-nitrate with and without ammonia, no
alteration.
    (a') Iodide-<U+FB01>lm lemon-yellow, does not disappearon breathing, or
on blowing with ammoniacal air, or on addition ofliquid ammonia.
     (e)  Sulphide-<U+FB01>lm formed from the oxide, black, and the thin
parts bluish grey; insoluble in liquid ammonium-sulphide.
    (f) On charcoal splinter with soda reduced to white ductilea
bead, which quickly oxidizes in the air, and          acted upon
                                                          is               by
hydrochloric acid with dif<U+FB01>culty.
    In addition to the foregoing, there are two metals, viz. tin and
molybdenum, which may be classed under the group            2. These   A
two metals, however, cannot be reduced from all their com

              Prof. R. Bunsen      on Flame Reactions.          95
pounds, and the reduction never takes place easily, owing to
their slight volatility; so that it will be better to class them
under the groups B 2, B 1, b, as they can be best distinguished by
the reactions which are characteristic of these groups.
              8. Behaviour   of   the   Lead Compounds.
     (a)They colour the <U+FB02>ame pale blue.
        Reduction <U+FB01>lm black, dead or brilliant.
     (1))
    (c) Oxide-<U+FB01>lm bright yellow-ochre-coloured ; stannous chloride
gives no reaction even on addition of caustic soda ; silver-nitrate
does not produce any reaction, either alone or on addition of
ammonia.
    (d) Iodide-<U+FB01>lm orange- to lemon-yellow, insoluble on breath
ing or on moistening ; disappears on blowing with ammoniacal
air, and again appears on warming.
    (e) Sulphide- <U+FB01>lm brownish red to black; by blowing or moist
ening with ammonium sulphide it remains unaltered.
      f
    ( ) On charcoal splinter with soda gives a grey, very soft duc
tile metallic bead, which is slowly but completely soluble in nitric
acid, yielding a white easily crystallizable salt, soluble in water,
and precipitated as a white powder on addition of sulphuric acid
from a capillary tube.
            9. Behaviour of the Cadmium Compounds.
   (11) Metallic <U+FB01>lm black 3 the thin parts brown.
   (6) Oxide-<U+FB01>lm brownish black, shading off through brown to
a white invisible <U+FB01>lm of suboxide, which is not altered by stan
nous chloride either alone or with soda; silver-nitrate produces
a blackish-blue coloration of reduced metal, which is very cha
racteristic and does not disappear on addition of ammonia.
   (c) Iodide-<U+FB01>lm white, no change produced by ammonia.
   (d) Sulphide-<U+FB01>lm lemon-yellow, insoluble in liquid ammonium.
   (e) Reduction on charcoal splinter with soda. The metal, owing
to its volatility, can only with dif<U+FB01>culty be obtained as a silver
white ductile head.
             10. Behaviour of the Zinc Compounds.
   (a) Reduction <U+FB01>lm black, in the thin parts brown.
   (b) Oxide-<U+FB01>lm white, and therefore invisible.        To test    it,
square centimetre of <U+FB01>lter-paper moistened with nitric acid     is a
rubbed over the surface and then rolled up on two rings of <U+FB01>ne
platinum wire,  3 millims. in diameter, and burnt.      If the paper
is burnt in the upper oxidizing <U+FB02>ame at as low      temperature as
                                                     a
possible, the ash forms  a  small solid mass about     square milli
                                                         a
metre  iu area, which  can be ignited  without fusion, and becomes
yellow  on gently heating, appearing, however,    white  on cooling.

96                    Prof. R. Bunsen on Flame Reactions.
If this  be moistened with a few milligrammes of a very dilute
cobalt solution and ignited, it appears of a beautiful green colour
on cooling.     It need scarcely be added that the same reaction
can be effected with the metallic <U+FB01>lm.      Stannous chloride with
and without soda, as well as silver-nitrate with and without am
monia, give no reaction.
       Iodide-<U+FB01>lm white, not easily recognizable either by itself
     (0)
or after blowing with ammoniacal air.
   (d) Sulphide-<U+FB01>lm also white, not easily recognized either with
Or without blowing with ammonium-sulphide.
     (e)The reduction     the metal cannot be accomplished, owing
                                of
to the volatility of zinc.
                 11. Behaviour           of   the Indium Compounds“.
   Indium     most easily and surely detected
                is                               the spectroscope     by                ;
the <U+FB02>ame reactions are given for the sake of completeness.
   (a) Flame-coloration intense, and pure indigo-colour.
   (b) Metallic <U+FB01>lm black, the thin parts brown, either dead or
brilliant instantly disappears in presence of nitric acid.
            ;
     (0)Oxide-<U+FB01>lm yellowish white, scarcely visible; gives no re
action with stannous chloride and silver solution.

    (a) Reduction on charcoal splinter.—-On pnIVerizing the char-h
coal the metal obtained as white, lustrous, ductile particles, for-inf
ing a brush on the magnetized blade.            The metal dissolved in
nitric acid on paper gives a green solution, which on moistening
with soda, exposure to bromine-vapour, and subsequent addition
of soda, gives a blackish-brown spot of nickel-sesquioxide. The            _
ash of the paper, from which the excess of soda has been washed'
out, can be used for the borax-bead test.
   (b) Borax bead.———Oxidizing <U+FB02>ame greyish brown or dirty violet.
Upper reducing <U+FB02>ame grey from reduced nickel, which often col
lects to a spongy mass of metal, rendering the bead colourless.
                14. Behaviour    of  the Cobalt Compounds.
    (a)  Reduction  on charcoal splinter.-—By pulverizing       the char
coal, as with nickel, white ductile lustrous metallic particles are
obtained which form a brush on the magnetic blade. The metal,
rubbed off on to paper, gives a red solution when moistened with
nitric acid; this yields a green colour on addition of hydrochloric
acid and drying, which disappears again on moistening. The paper
moistened with soda, brought into bromine-vapour and again
moistened with soda, yields a blackish-brown spot of cobalt-ses
quioxide.     This reaction is plainly seen With a few tenths of a
milligramme of metal.        The paper can also be used, after wash
ing out the soda and burning, for the coloration of the borax bead.
    (b) Borax bead—In the oxidizing <U+FB02>anie a bright-blue bead,
unaltered in the lower reducing <U+FB02>ame.           The head, when held for
some time in the most powerful upper reducing <U+FB02>ame, becomes
colourless, owing to separation of metallic cobalt : this separation
takes place more rapidly in presence of the platinum-ammonium
chloride, when an alloy of nickel and platinum is formed.
                       15.  Palladium Compounds.
    (a) In theoxidizing<U+FB02>ame        these compounds,     heated on a <U+FB01>ne
platinum wire with soda, yield a grey mass resembling spongy
platinum; this yields silver-white lustrous particles when rubbed
up in the agate mortar.       These particles, washed and dried on
a piece   of curved   glass, yield a red solution with nitric acid.
A drop    of mercuric   cyanide added to this solution forms, when
blown upon by     ammoniacal    air, a white precipitate soluble in excess
of  ammonia.      After evaporation, and on boiling with aqua regia,
the liquid, when evaporated to a drop, deposits at dirty-orange
  ellow crystalline precipitateof the ammonium-palladium-chloride.
    (b) The
              solution of palladium is coloured blue, green, and
brown by stannous chloride, according to the quantity of the re
agent added.

       (a)   In    oxidizing <U+FB02>ame with soda they also yield a grey
                  the
  spongy mass, giving white, ductile, lustrous particles on rubbing
  up in a mortar.       These are insoluble in either nitric or hydro
  chloric acid alone, but dissolve in a mixture of these acids, form
  ing, if the platinum is pure, a light-yellow solution, which is of
  a darker colour if rhodium, iridium, or palladium is present.
  The solution does not give with mercuric cyanide and ammonia
  a white precipitate,     but a light-yellow crystalline precipitate of
  platinum-aminonium-chloridc.
       (b) Stannous chloride colours platinum compounds yellowish
  b rown.
     17,. Iridium Compounds are likewise reduced to metal when
 heated with soda in the upper reducing <U+FB02>ame, yielding               grey          a
 non-lustrous powder which           not the least ductile. This
                                           is                          not         is
 only insoluble in the separate acids, but also        aqua regia. in
     18. Rhodium Compounds can be distinguished from those of
 iridium only        the fact that the metallic powder, insoluble
                        by                                                              in
_aqua regia, when fused with hydropotassic         sulphate,     partially    is
 okidized, giving      rose-coloured solution.

 volatile osmic acid, possessing an acrid chlorine-like smell and
 attacking the eyes powerfully.
     20. Gold Compounds—If gold contained only in traces mixed
                                                   is
 .with large quantities of the matrix,        can only be concentrated

                     the old gold-test*.     In other cases, however,                   a
 few tenths of       milligramme can be detected byreductiou with
 soda on     acharcoal splinter.      The yellow lustrous ductile glo
bules thus obtained can be <U+FB02>attened out to larger golden parti
cles   ; these do not dissolve in nitric or hydrochloric acid, but are
pretty easily soluble in aqua regia, yielding         light-yellow solu
                                                                   a

 coloured brown from separation of reduced gold on addition of
,ferrous sulphate, whilst the solution appears blue          transmittedby
light.
   21‘. Silver Compounds—If silver occurs only in traces in slags
or complex ores,      can only be detected
                               it            the well-known meby
thod of cupellation'l'. If, however, the silver compound      not                  is
mixed with     very large amountof foreign matter,
                  a                                    can be de         it

warming in dilute nitric acid, and yield silver~chloride with by
drochloric acid, which can then readily be recognized by its be
haviour with nitric acid and ammonia.                Less than one-tenth of a
milligramme of silver can thus be easily detected with certainty.
                          22. Copper Compounds.
    (a) On the charcoal splinter with soda the copper compounds
yield a ductile lustrous metallic bead, easily recognizable by its
red copper-colour.         By rubbing in the mortar, <U+FB02>at metallic par
ticles are obtained, which can be readily washed, and are easily
soluble in nitric acid.          The blue solution, absorbed on <U+FB01>lter
paper, yields a brown stain on addition of potassic ferrocyanide.
Instead of acting upon the metal in a curved glass, it may be
dissolved by moistening paper upon which it is placed‘ with
nitric  acid.
    (b)  With boraw on platinum wire—Blue head, not altered to
cuprous oxide when heated in the lower reducing <U+FB02>ame alone,
but on addition of very little tin-salt, forms a reddish-brown
bead.      If this bead be frequently oxidized and reduced in the
<U+FB02>ame, a ruby-red transparent head is obtained ; this occurs most
readily when the bead is allowed to oxidize very slowly.
                            23. Tin Compounds.
    (a) On the charcoal splinter the tin compounds are easily re
duced to white lustrous ductile metallic beads.-                The <U+FB02>attened
particles transferred to the curved glass slowly dissolve in hydro
chloric acid ; and the solution, when, absorbed by paper, gives a
red precipitate with selenious, and a black precipitate with tel
lurous acid dissolved- in hydrochloric.            If to the solution a trace
of bismuth-nitrate be added, an excess of soda gives a black pre
cipitate of bismuthous oxide.            The metal acted on by nitric acid
yields   a  white   powder   of  insoluble   stannic acid.
    (b)  A   boraa'  bead, containing enough copper-oxide            to render
it faintly blue,     serves as  a  delicate test  to  ascertain with  certainty
the presence of a trace of a tin compound, as the bead placed
                                                                                '
 in the lower reducing <U+FB02>ame, as explained above, turns reddish
 brown, or forms a clear ruby-red glass.
                        24. Molybdenum       Compounds.
     (a) On a charcoal splinter with soda molybdenum is reduced
to a grey powder, but. with such dif<U+FB01>culty that its detection in
this way is not to be recommended.              In the same way some mo
 lybdenum      compounds     give   in  the upper    reducing <U+FB02>ame a <U+FB01>lm on
 porcelain which it is very dif<U+FB01>cult to obtain.               Molybdenum is
 best detected as follows.                         .
    (b) The sample, <U+FB01>nely pulverized with the knife on the porce

102                   Prof. R. Bunsen   on Flume Reactions.
 lain plate, is mixed on the hand with soda, obtained in a pasty
 state by melting a crystal.       The mixture is then transferred on
 to a spiral of <U+FB01>ne platinum wire and fused in the <U+FB02>ame; the
 liquid fused mass is then knocked off the wire and allowed to fall
 upon the plate, when it is digested with two or three drops of
 water, and the clear supernatant liquid absorbed by three or four
 strips of <U+FB01>lter-paper a few millimetres in breadth.
     (a) One of these strips, on moistening with hydrochloric acid,
 'does not change colour, but on addition of a drop of potassium
 fcrrocyanide it is coloured a reddish brown.
     (B) If one of the strips be gradually moistened with a few
 milligrammes of stannous chloride, it is coloured blue either at
 once or on gently heating; if the tint be yellow or light brown,
 a few drops of soda solution must be added by a capillary tube
 until the blue colour appears.
    (7) A drop of ammonium-sulphide added to the third strip
 produces a brown coloration; and on addition of hydrochloric
 acid a brown precipitate is formed, the paper, at the circumfe
 rence of the drop, often being coloured blue.
      (8) The yellow phosphate precipitate produced            bythe nitric
 acid solution of ammonium-molybdate can also be readily ob
tained.
      (c) The borax head      not very characteristic;
                             is                           in the oxidizing
<U+FB02>ame        it  colourless, and in presence of much molybdenum
                 is                                                     it
 becomes opake; in the reducing <U+FB02>ame            it    dark from reduced
                                                     is
molybdenum.
     25. Tungsten Compounds—The reduction of tungsten can
likewise be made on the charcoal splinter with soda, but this
method          not available for the detection of the metal.
                 is                                                     The
tungsten compounds are therefore best examined in the mode
described under molybdenum,             byabsorbing the liquid obtained
 by   fusion with soda on some strips of <U+FB01>lter-paper.
    (a) One strip       moistened with hydrochloric acid;
                        is                                         remains
                                                                   it
white, but on heating turns yellow; moistened with ferrocyanide
it   is unaltered.                                    ,
    (B) A second strip, touched with staunous chloride,         iscoloured
blue in the cold or on heating.
    ('y)    Adrop of ammonium-sulphide causes no precipitate either
 by itself or after addition of hydrochloric acid the paper becomes,
                                                      ;
however, blue- or greenish-coloured, especially on warming.
    26. Titanium Compounds give          a colourless bead with micro
cosmic salt in the oxidizing <U+FB02>ame, which turns of              apale ame
thystine    colour     the
                       in   reducing    <U+FB02>ame.     On  addition  of  ferrous
sulphate    the  bead  assumes  in  the  reducing   <U+FB02>ame the  peculiar red
colour       venous blood, whilst in the oxidizing <U+FB02>ame the light—
            of
brown colour of ferric oxide can be obtained at pleasure.               The

                Prof. R. Bunsen on Flame Reactions.                103
titanium    compounds form with soda a bead which at <U+FB01>rst effer
vesces, and when hot is colourless and transparent, but on cool
ing becomes opake.        If  to the hot bead stannous chloride be
added, and if it then be heated in the lower reducing <U+FB02>ame, a grey
mass is formed, which dissolves on heating in hydrochloric acid,
yieldinga pale-amethystine-coloured solution.
    27 8t 28. Tantalum and Niobium Compounds exhibit the same
reactions as titanium.
                         29.  Silica Compounds.
    (a) Treated with soda in the oxidizing <U+FB02>ame, the silicates dis
solve with more or less-e<U+FB02>'ervescence.      When treated whilst hot
with stannous chloride and fused, the mass does not yield a trace
of blue colour on solution in warm hydrochloric acid; and the
silicates may thus be distinguished from the compounds of titanic,
tantalic, or niobic acids.       The blood-red colour obtained with
ferric oxide from these acids is also not_ yielded by silicates.
Gelatinous silica separates out when the fused mass is carefully
treated with water and acetic acid on the lamp-plate.        Fine par
ticles of any silicate yield, on fusion in a head of microcosmic salt,
a mass of gelatinous silica when fused, which on cooling forms a
solid opake mass swimming in the transparent head.
                      30. Chromium Compounds.
    (a) In the spiral of platinum wire with soda the chromium com
pounds givc, when fused with repeated additions of nitre, a yellow
mass, which, when pulverized on the plate and treated with water,
yields a light-yellow solution.        If this solution be carefully
poured off from the insoluble matter and acidi<U+FB01>ed with acetic
acid, it turns a deep orange-colour, and yields, when absorbed
on strips of paper, a yellow precipitate with lead-salts, a red pre
cipitate with mercuric salts, and a reddish-brown precipitate with
silver compounds. This solution turns green on addition of
ammonium-sulphide, or on treatment on the plate with aqua
regia, as likewise 0n addition of stannous chloride.
    ([2) The bonus head is emerald-green
                                              in the oxidizing <U+FB02>ame,
and does not undergo alteration when heated in the reducing
<U+FB02>ame.
                      31. Vanadium Compounds.
    (a) By treating the‘vanadium compounds with nitre and soda
in the platinum spiral, a bright yellow mass is obtained; this
gives a solution which, on addition of silver-nitrate and acidi<U+FB01>
cation with acetic acid, yields a yellow precipitate. The fused
mass-gives a yellow instead of a green solution when evaporated
with aqua regia, which becomes blue on addition of stannous
chloride.    If the mass contains much vanadium, the solution

101‘            Prof. R. Bunsen on Flame Reactions.
gives a yellowish-brown colour or precipitate on addition of an
excess of cold concentrated hydrochloric acid.
   (b) In the boron: bead the vanadium compounds give in the
oxidizing <U+FB02>ame a greenish yellow, in the reducing <U+FB02>ame a green
colour.
                     32. Manganese   Compounds.
   (a) These give an amethystine-coloured head in the oxidizing,
and a colourless head in the reducing <U+FB02>ame.
   (b) A green-coloured bead is formed on cooling after fusion
with soda, especially when some nitre is added; this, extracted
with water, yields a green solution, which turns red on addition
of acetic acid, and then often becomes colourless, with separation
of brown <U+FB02>occuli.
                      33. Uranium Compounds.
   (a) These give a yellow bead in the oxidizing <U+FB02>ame, which
becomes green in the reducing <U+FB02>ame, especially on addition of
stannous chloride.      These colours closely resemble those of the
iron compounds, but may easily be distinguished, at least if no
other colouring metallic oxide is present, by the fact that the
uranium head, when incandescent, emits a bluish-green light
analogous to that which the uranium compounds exhibit when
<U+FB02>uorescing. Beads of lead-oxide, stannic acid, and a few other
substances exhibit a similar phenomenon when incandescent, but
they none of them yield, like the uranium compounds, a coloured
bead on cooling.
    (6) Heated gently on the platinum spiral with hydropotassic
sulphate, the insoluble uranium compounds can be decomposed.
The melted mass is powdered with a few particles of crystallized
sodic carbonate, and the“ moistened mass is absorbed by <U+FB01>lter
paper.    A brown spot is formed by addition of a drop of ferro
cyanide to the moistened paper.
   34. Phosphorus Compounds.—The presence of phosphorus
may easily be detected, even when mixed with large quantities of
other substances, as follows :—
    (a) The sample having been ignited, is rubbed <U+FB01>ne on the por
celain plate, is introduced into a small glass tube of the thick
ness of a straw; into this tube, which is cIOsed at the bottom, a
piece of magnesium wire, about one-fourth of an inch in length,
is placed so that it is covered by the powder.     On heating the
tube, magnesium-phosphide is formed with incandescence.        The
black contents of the tube powdered on the plate give, on moist
ening with water, the highly characteristic smell of phosphuretted
hydrogen.     A piece of sodium can be equally well used if mag
nesium cannot be procured.
   (b) If it has been ascertained that the sample does not yield

                Prof. R. Bunsen on Flame Reactions.                 105
any <U+FB01>lm on porcelain in the upper oxidizing <U+FB02>ame, the phos
phates may be recognized by heating on platinum with borax
and a thin piece of iron wire in the hottest part of the reducing
<U+FB01>anie, when a bright molten head of iron-phosphide is obtained
which can be extracted with the magnetized knife on crushing
the bead under paper.
                         35. Sulphur Compounds.
    (a) These give a fused mass with soda on the charcoal splin
ter, which leaves a black stain when brought on to moistened
silver. As selenium and tellurium give rise to the same reaction,
the absence of these substances must <U+FB01>rst be ascertained by
seeing that no <U+FB01>lm of selenium or tellurium is deposited on
porcelain.
    (b) In the case of metallic sulphides, and not of sulphates,
the simple ignition of the sample in the <U+FB02>ame is suf<U+FB01>cient to
produce the peculiar smell of burning sulphur.
    It is impossible in a limited space to follow out the applica
tion of the foregoing methods to all the special cases of the ana
lysis of complicated mixtures. I con<U+FB01>ne myself, therefore, to
illustrating the value of those methods in one or two examples.
    1.  A  mixture of   the sulphides of arsenic, antimony,  and tin.
    If in a mixture of these three sulphides, containing only traces
 of antimony and tin, they are separated according to the ordinary
 rules of qualitative analysis, by dissolving in alkaline sulphides and
 reprecipitation with acids, the detection of these two metals by
 the regular tests is extremely uncertain and troublesome.          Ac
 cording   to the  following  method,  the  detection of these metals is
 rendered easy and certain when the proportion of tin is only a
 few thousandths, and that of the antimony only a few hundredths
 of the total weight of the mixture.
    Three decigrammes of the sulphides are roasted on a curved
 piece of glass, small enough to be altogether surrounded by the
 <U+FB02>ame, and the residue, weighing only a few milligrammes, is
 scraped together with the knife. The moistened mass is then col
 lected on the end of a thread of asbestos, and a strong metallic <U+FB01>lm
 obtained on the test-tube (see page 90). In order to prevent
 the deposition of any carbon with the metals, which would act
 injuriously in the subsequent operations, the upper reducing
 <U+FB02>ame is made so small that the luminous point is only just visi
 ble. The <U+FB01>lm is next dissolved in a drop or two of nitric acid
 in the curved rim of the plate (<U+FB01>g. 3), and the solution evapo
 rated below its boiling-point by gently warming and blowing, so
 as to obtain the solid residue in as small a space as possible.

106               Prof. H. Bunsen on Flame Reactions.
A drop of neutral silver solution        is now brought on to the residue
at the moment       when it becomes solid; and on blowing with am
moniacal air, a characteristic black stain is formed, whilst the
 reaction of arsenic is also generally noticed.
    In order to detect tin, a few scarcely visible particles of the
 roasted sulphides are fused on to a borax bead which has been
 very slightly tinted with cupric oxide.             If the bead is now
brought     into  the   lower    reducing <U+FB02>ame,   it  becomes a ruby-red
colour from reduced cuprous oxide.              If  the oxide be present
in too large a quantity, the bead can be obtained transparent
by the process described under the reactions of the copper com
pounds. This reaction can only be obtained in the lower redu
cing <U+FB02>ame of the non-luminous gas-lamp, as in the ordinary
blowpipe-<U+FB01>ame the cupric oxide is reduced to cuprous oxide
without the presence of tin-salt.
    2. Black tellurium,      containing tellurium, selenium, antimony,
                          lead, gold, and sulphur.
    After the sulphur has been detected by the smell on roasting,
the metallic <U+FB01>lm is obtained on a test-tube, which is then placed
inside a wider and shorter tube containing a few drops of con
centrated sulphuric acid, so that the metallic <U+FB01>lm is surrounded
by the acid.       If the temperature be now gradually raised, the
presence    of tellurium    is at once ascertained by the formation of
a bright carmine-colour.            If the temperature be still further
raised,   the   tellurium     oxidizes, and the olive-green    colour of
selenium becomes visible; the cooled solution, on dilution with
water, then no longer exhibits the black precipitate of tellurium,
but is coloured yellowish red from the selenium.             If this sub
stance be present only in small traces, it can be best detected by
looking down the length of the test-tube upon a sheet of white
paper.     As the common commercial sulphuric acid not unfre
quently   contains    traces of selenium, it is well to make a blind
experiment     to  assure  one’s self of its absence.    The antimony is
detected exactly as described in the preceding example.                To
detect the lead and gold, a sample is reduced on the charcoal
splinter, the beads of the alloy are washed into a curved glass,          _
and the <U+FB02>attened and dried metallic particles treated with pretty
strong nitric nitric acid as long as anything dissolves.              The
acid is then evaporated o<U+FB01>“, and the soluble portion of the residue
dissolved in a drop or two of water.               The solution is then
brought on to a second curved glass by means of a capillary
pipette, and the characteristic precipitate of lead-sulphate ob
tained by addition of a few milligrammes of sulphuric acid.           The
gold, left undissolved as a brown powder, is completely washed by
frequent addition of water and removal of the same with the

fused on a charcoal   splinter with soda, and yield bright golden
yellow particles in the mortar; a second portion is shown to be
insoluble in hydrochloric acid, but soluble in aqua regia, and the
solution after evaporation is tested with stannous chloride, and
the purple of Cassius obtained.      One centigramme of the sub

  XIII.       On   the   In<U+FB02>uence of the Tidal Wave on the Motion of the
                           Moon.   By JAMEs CROLL*.
                twenty years ago M. Mayer showed that, as the
NEARLY
   tidal wave       is always a little to the east of the moon’s me
ridian, the attraction of the moon tends to pull back the wave
against the earth’s rotation.    The wave thus acting as a brake
or drag must diminish the motion of rotation.
    The researches of Mr. Adams and M. Delaunay show that the
change in the excentricity of the earth’s orbit accounts for only
about one-half of the secular acceleration of the moon’s motion
as determined     by observation, namely about 6” in a century.
Professor Hansen suggested that the other 6” would be accounted
for by simply assuming that the length of the sidereal day has
increased by merely '01197 of a second in the course of 2000
y ears.
   About six months ago M. Delaunay showed that the retarding
effect of the tidal wave, pointed out by M. Mayer, was perfectly
su<U+FB01>icient to account for the increase required in the length of
the day.     Professor W. Thomson, who has lately investigated
the subject, arrives at the conclusion that in a century the earth
is rotating so much slower that, regarded as a time-keeper, it is
losing about four seconds in a year'l'.
   The conclusion to which M. Delaunay has arrived is that the
6" of acceleration resulting from the change in the excentricity
of the earth’s orbit is real, but that the other 6” is only appa
renti. That        in making our calculations regarding the actual
                     is,
amount of the acceleration from the date of ancient eclipses, we
make      6" more than really
         it                          owing to our taking as
                                    it    is,                 standa

on account of the in<U+FB02>uence of the tides on the earth’s rotation,
is now too long            by

     The Astronomer Royal, in an elaborate paper read before the
Astronomical Society in April last, arrives at the following con
 clusions of an opposite character :—
     (1) That the effect of friction is to accelerate the time of each
individual tide.                                                ‘
     (2) That friction does not retard the earth’s rotation.
     (3) That it is a further result of this friction and the conse
quent disturbance of the form of the waters that the moon’s
motion is affected ; her orbit is made to become large, and her
motion in longitude is retarded.
     It may be stated that the latter conclusion was arrived at a
year or two ago by Professor W. Thomson*.                In regard to the
second conclusion, the Astronomer Royal, in a note appended to
his paper, says that he has at length discovered two terms which
appear to exercise a real effect on the rotation of the earth.
“There is,” he says, “a constant acceleration of the waters as
following the moon’s apparent diurnal course.             As this is oppo
site to the direction of the earth’s rotation, it follows that from
the action of the moon there is a constant retarding force on the
rotation of the water, and therefore (by virtue of the friction
between them) a constant retarding force on the rotation of the
                                                                  '
earth’s nucleus-l".
    In a paper published in the Philosophical Magazine for April
 1864, I showed that the solar wave retards the motion of the
earth around the common centre of gravity of the earth and
moon in precisely the same way as the lunar wave retards the
motion of the earth around the earth’s centre of gravity;
and that as the vis viva of the earth’s motion around the com
mon centre of gravity of the earth and moon is being gradually
converted into heat by the friction of the solar wave and dissi
pated into space, the earth must therefore be continually ap
proaching nearer to the moon.             The moon being thus moving
in an orbit which is gradually becoming less and less, its period
of revolution must also be diminishing.              Or, in other words,
there is an actual acceleration of the moon’s angular motion.
    The reason which has prevented this important consequence
from being recognized is no doubt the way in which the question
is at present viewed by physicists in general.         They still continue
to view the in<U+FB02>uence of the wave in the way in which it <U+FB01>rst
suggested itself to the mind of Mayer.          They consider with him
that the whole retarding effect is due to the attraction of the
moon pulling the wave back to the moon’s meridian against the
motion of rotation. This, however, is only a part of the effect.
The question must be viewed under a more general form; for it

                        on the Motion     of the Moon.                  109
is evident that the heat generated by friction in the rising of the
water to form the wave before the moon’s meridian is reached is
as truly at the expense of the earth’s rotation as the heat gene
rated after the meridian is passed.
    Suppose that in the rising of a giVen mass of water in the
formation of the wave,         a unit of heat, 1390 foot-pounds, is gene
rated    and  dissipated      into space before the water passes the
moon’s meridian. The question suggests itself, where has this
1390 foot-pounds of energy come from? The only answer that
we can give is that it comes from the vis viva of rotation.              In
my former paper I showed that the rising of the water to form
the wave tends to diminish the vis viva of rotation, and that the
vis viva thus lost is completelyr restored as the water descends to
its original level.       But if any heat be generated during the
rising and falling of the water, the vis viva will not be wholly
restored.    If, for example, 1390 foot-pounds of energy in the
form of heat be generated by the friction of the water as it rises
and falls, then the water on reaching its original level will owe
to rotation 1390 foot-pounds of the energy borrowed as it as
cended which it can never pay back.              And hence the vis viva of
rotation must be diminished by that extent.
    The same result follows when mechanical work is performed
by the water as it ascends or descends if heat be generated.              A
tide-mill, as Professor Tyndall remarks, tends to diminish the
rotation of the earth.
    The way in which the phenomena of the tides are usually
viewed has the effect of preventing the rationale of the process
from being clearly seen*. Take, for example, the lunar wave.
All physicists agree that it depends upon two causes, viz. the
attraction of the moon, and the centrifugal force of the earth’s
motion around the common centre of gravity of the earth and
moon. But practically, however, in explaining the phenomena
the kinetic element is almost entirely oyerlooked, and an undue
prominence is given to the static element.             It is well known, for
example, that students have a considerable             difficulty in under
standing how the water can rise on the side furthest from the
IllOOIl:   But no possible dif<U+FB01>culty could be felt if the student
was shown (what in theory is admitted) that the rise of the water
at that place is a necessary result of the centrifugal force of the
earth’s motion around the Common centre of gravity, that being
the point furthest from the centre of rotation.              By viewing the
phenomena from the kinetic stand-point instead of the static,
new light is cast upon the subject.             WVe can then, as has been
shownzl', perceive     how   it  is that heat  generated by friction as the

110     In<U+FB02>uence   of the Tidal Wave      on the Motion     of the Moon.
water ascends     and descends      must tend to diminish the vis viva
of rotation.
    That the solar wave must diminish the earth’s motion round
the common centre of gravity of the earth and moon appears
evident from the following considerations.
    Suppose the diurnal rotation of the earth to be stopped, or,
rather we should say, reduced to the same as that of the moon,
viz. to one revolution in a month.          In this case the earth would
always present the same side to the moon.                   The lunar wave
would of course exist the same as at present, only it would remain
stationary on the earth’s       surface, seeing that the earth would
always present the same side to the moon.             As the water would be
motionless, of course there could be no friction 3 no heat generated,
and consequently no loss of rotation.            But let us look at the in
<U+FB02>uence of the solar wave.         The solar wave would also, of course,
exist the same as it does now, but it would move round the earth
not once in twenty-four hours, as at present, but only once in a
month.       But however slow the water would rise and fall, a con
siderable amount of heat would be generated by friction.                 The
question now arises, from what source would this energy lost in
the form of heat be derived?             The source would evidently be
the   rotation  of the  earth   round    the common centre of gravity;
for it is  to this source  that  the motion    of the water is due.     Sup
pose now the. diurnal rotation        of  the  earth to commence; new
effects would certainly result, but these would not prevent the
occurrence of those we are now considering.                  In other words,
 the effects which, we have seen, would take place under the
above conditions, do actually at present take place. The two sets
of effects do not interfere with each other.              Consequently the
solar wave    must   be slowly consuming        the  vis viva  of the earth’s
rotation round the common centre of gravity.                But it is the vis
viva of rotation that keeps the two orbs separate from each other.
 Hence as this vis viva is being consumed, the two must be ap
proaching nearer to each other; And this must accelerate the
 angular motion of the moon.
    The solar wave does not consume the vis viva of the moon’s
 motion around the common centre.                   It only consumes the
 earth’s motion around that centre.           The motion of the earth is
retarded, but not the motion of the moon.               Now, since the earth
is gradually approaching nearer and nearer to the moon in con
 sequence of the consumption of the centrifugal force keeping it
 separate from that orb, the moon must therefore be moving with
 all its original stock of vis viva in an orbit which is gradually
 becoming less and less.        Consequently the period of its revolu
tion must be diminishing in length.
    There is still another effect which results from this condition

In<U+FB02>uence of the Absorption of Heat on the Formation of Dew. 111
of things.   The approach of the earth tOWards the moon will to
a certain extent make up for the direct loss of motion due to the
in<U+FB02>uence of the solar wave.     But still the moon, which has sus
tained no less of 122'sviva, will be moving around the common
centre in a shorter period than the earth.     This will therefore
cause the common centre of gravity to have an exceedingly slow
motion around the earth’s centre of gravity.    This effect may be
illustrated experimentally in the following manner z—Let two
balls, representing the earth and moon, connected by a rod, be
made to revolve upon their common centre of gravity.        Retard
the motion of the ball representing the earth, and instantly the
common centre of gravity        at liberty to move) will begin to
                                          (if
move slowly around the centre of gravity of the ball whose motion
has been retarded.

                                          a
of the tidal wave will not only stop the diurnal motion of the
earth, but will ultimately bring the moon to the earth’s surface.

 112             Prof. Magnus on the In<U+FB02>uence          of the
drawback in the case of aqueous vapour, that it condenses on the
rock-salt; and as even the thinnest layer of water only transmits
an exceedingly small quantity of heat, the result is interfered with
by that thin layer of water.        To remove this drawback I quite
avoided rock-salt plates, by bringing the thermopile inside a tube
in a vertical position ; the top part of the tube was closed by very
thin glass, which was directly heated externally, and thus served
as source of heat.     Yet as there is complete discordance between
the results which I obtained for aqueous vapour by this method and
those which Professor Tyndall has obtained with the use of rock
salt plates; and as this physicist, although the in<U+FB02>uence of rock
salt plates is easily ascertained, always reverts to the statement
that heat is absorbed by aqueous vapour with several thousand
times greater energy than by air; and as this extraordinary ab
sorptive capacity of vapours has, both by himself and others,
already been made the basis of an explanation of several im
portant phenomena in meteorology and in terrestrial physics,
I  have considered it a duty incumbent on me to compare, if pos
sible, in another manner, the absorption of heat by aqueous vapour
with that by air. For this purpose the comparison of its radia
tion seemed especially <U+FB01>tted, as all solid walls were thus avoided.
    Such a comparison has been made by Professor Frankland in
London*, and described in a paper “On the Physical Cause of
the Glacial Epoch.”       He says there that he has devised a simple
method of experimentally proving the radiation of aqueous vapour
so that several persons could see the effect at once.         “ A charcoal
chauffer,   14 inches high and 6 inches in diameter, is placed
about 2 feet from, and in front of, a thermo-electric pile, the
radiation from the chau<U+FB02>'er and fuel being carefully cut off from
the pile by a double metallic screen.          The de<U+FB02>ection of the gal
vanometer due to the radiation from the ascending and heated
carbonic acid being new carefully neutralized by a constant
source of heat radiating upon the opposite face of the pile, a
current of steam is made to ascend through an iron tube pass
ing vertically through the chau<U+FB01>er. Instantly the galvanonieter
de<U+FB02>ects for heat much more powerfully than it did previously to
its compensation, when it was exposed to the full radiation from
heated air and carbonic acid.        When the current of SM!!!“ is iii
terrupted, the needle immediately returns to zero.              If now a
current of air be forced up the central tube instead of steam,
either no de<U+FB02>ection at all, or a slight one for cold occurs.           The
heat of the chautfer effectually prevents any condensation of the
steam.”                                                 _
   It is possible that the condensation of steam was avoided by
the heat of the chauifer; yet this would presuppose              that the

steam still existed in the middle of the heated air.     it mixed     If
with the air, it must, on the edge (where it came in contact with
colder air),have been condensed and converted into mist. Now
the question here simply         is,
                              whether there was any condensation,
whether mist was present; for         has never been doubted that

It appeared desirable therefore to make the experiment in an
altered form, and to compare the radiation of dry air with that
of moist, as well as of some other gases and vapours.
   For this purpose the gases or vapours whose radiation was to
be determined were passed through        brass tube 15 millims. in
                                                   a
internal diameter, and placed in     horizontal position.

heated to redness by gas-<U+FB02>ames.        One end was bent upwards,
so that the heated air ascended vertically.    At distance of 400

its two conical re<U+FB02>ectors was placed.      To protect this against
lateral radiation,    was placed in
                       it              box which was

this box turned to the hot current of air was of polished sheet
zinc._ In front of this there was     double metallic screen, to cut

                           the heated tube.    In the zinc side, as
well as in the screen, was an aperture 50 millims. in height by
25 millims. in breadth, the middle of which was in the prolon
gation of the axis of the thermopile.     The bent part of the tube
from which the heated air issued was 45 millims. from the side
of the box, but was at such      depth below the aperture that no

heat-rays could pass from      to the pile. The horizontal part of
                                 it
the brass tube was at an angle of 40° with the plane of the side
of the box; thus neither the <U+FB02>ames which served for heating, nor
the products of combustion arising from them, especially the
carbonic acid, could radiate against the pile, and the heated part
of the tube was as far as possible from the side. In spite of this
distance of the tube and of the interposed screen, the front side
of the box became heated and radiated towards the pile. To
neutralize the current thus occasioned,       vessel was placed in
                                                       a

  a               asimilar manner to that which Professor Tyndall
used in his experiments, and Professor Frankland in the experi_

cases.

  latter is constant, the pile takes the less heat the warmer it is
  itself; but if its temperature alters, the indications are no longer
  comparable.       The use of the method of compensation presup
  poses that the changes of temperaturewhich the pile undergoes
  in the course of time, are small as compared with the actions to
  be measured.
       The atmospheric air whosev radiation was to be measured was
  pressed into the brass tube by means of a large bellows.             If  it
  was to be dry, it passed previously through a spacious vessel
 <U+FB01>lled with pieces of fused chloride of calcium ; and if it was to be
  saturated with aqueous vapour, through a <U+FB02>ask in which was
  water that could be heated at pleasure.         Arrangements were so
  made by means of stopcocks that the air could be passed at will
 either through the chloride of calcium or through water.
       In order to be quite certain that in both cases the tempera
                                                                              '
 ture of the emerging air, if not exactly, was approximately the
  same, and also in order to ascertain how high was the tempera
 ture of the radiating air, a thermometer was so introduced that
 its bulb was in the middle of the ascending current and in front
 of the middle of the aperture through which the heat radiated
 into the box and against the pile. This position was at a height
 of 60 millims. above the end of the brass tube.              It indicated
 there a temperature of 220° to 2300 C.           It was then placed at
 a height of 180 millims. above the aperture, where it still indi
 cated 120° to 130° C.          During the experiments it was always
 in this latter position ; in which it could neither radiate against
the pile, nor hinder the ascending current.           In both positions
the temperature was the same whether dry or moist air passed
through the tube, provided the pressure was the same under
which the gas issued.         In the case of the other gases, of which
mention will immediately be made, the pressure in the heated
 tube was so regulated that the thermometer remained at the
temperature 120° to 130° at a height of 180 millims.
      \Vhen dry atmospheric air was blown through the heated tube,
it produced an extremely slight action upon the column. The
de<U+FB02>ection of the very delicate galvanometer was about 3 millims.
or parts of the scale*.        If the air had passed through the <U+FB02>ask
containing water, the de<U+FB02>ection remained almost unchanged; it
only increased by three to <U+FB01>ve divisions of the scale.
     If instead of atmospheric air dry carbonic acid was passed
through the ignited metal tube, the de<U+FB02>ection of the galvano
meter amounted to 100 to 120 divisions.
     Ordinary coal-gas furnished almost the same de<U+FB02>ection.

        The galvanometer was the same as that described in Poggendor<U+FB01>":

    If atmospheric air was passed through the <U+FB02>ask while the water
in it was heated to from 60° to 80°, the air thus saturated with
aqueous vapour produced a de<U+FB02>ection which was irregular, and
sometimes increased to 20 millims. ; this was very gradual, while
the de<U+FB02>ections which carbonic acid and coal-gas produced set
in at once, and rapidly increased to a maximum. It might be
thought that from the <U+FB02>ask to the heated part of the brass tube
the vapours had so far been precipitated that there was here
little or no vapour.     But, leaving out of sight that such a cool
ing   was   impossible, because  the short piece of tube from the
<U+FB02>ask to the heated tube was always very warm, the great quan
tity of aqueous vapour present in the radiating air could be
readily shown by holding a glass plate in       it,
                                                  on which water was
copiously deposited.
    When the water in the <U+FB02>ask boiled so violently that there was
mist in the emergent air, the galvanometer produced de<U+FB02>ec           a
tion of upwards of 100 divisions. The result was the same
when no air was passed through the <U+FB02>ask, but the water in                it
boiled so violently that the vapour issued from the heated tube,
in which case mist was always seen, If no mist was visible,
 the galvanometer produced no greater de<U+FB02>ection than twenty
 divisions, however much vapour the air contained.           From the
manner in which this comparatively small de<U+FB02>ection occurred,
from its irregularity, and the slow advance of the needle, one           is
 tempted to conclude that this also depended on          formation of
                                                          a
 mist produced at the boundary of the ascending current, but not
perceptible to the eye on account of its small quantity.           As
 soon as the greater de<U+FB02>ection was produced, the mists could
 each time be seen.      They can be perceived with such certainty
that always, if    one observer <U+FB01>rst noticed the mist, the other at
 the
  '   telescope announced the motion of the galvanometer.
 I     imagined that   by   using the very ingenious arrangement
 which M. Toeppler has described in his paper, “Observations by
a New Optical Method,” under the name Schlierenapparatus,
 the mist could be still more readily perceived      yet
                                                      ;   Isoon found
that this arti<U+FB01>cial arrangement has here no advantage—the more
 so, thata    mistake as regards the occurrence of the mist was not
 possible.

     Several of my friends also, who at different times were present
 at the experiments, especially MM. Dove, Du Bois-Reymond,
 Hofmann, Poggendor<U+FB02>, Quincke, and Riess, have convinced
 themselves    that air, when saturated at ordinary temperatures
with aqueous vapour, produced no greater de<U+FB02>ection than about
3   millims., and, even when saturated     at   ahigher temperature,

whose help      I
              have had the advantage of having in this investi
gation, has convinced himself of the accuracy of these statements.
  From these experiments it follows that the radiation of trans
parent aqueous vapour (that          of aqueous vapour in the proper
                                       is,

                        is
coal-gas, and but little more than that of dry atmospheric air.
Hence      follows that the absorptive power of air which contains,
          it
or is saturated with, transparent vapours, differs little from that
of dry, and that      it
                      isonly     air

   The vapours of most other liquids are oxidized when they
pass through the tube mixed with atmospheric         air, or    while     if,
heated, they pass into the air.        With especial facility are the
vapours of ether oxidized.      When air passed through ether at
the ordinary temperature of the room (15° C.), on emerging from
the heated tube the odour of aldehyde and of acetic ether could
be at once perceived; at the same time the thermometer over
the tube rose considerably, indicating continued oxidation out
                                                   a
side the tube.    Corresponding to this heating, the de<U+FB02>ection of
the galvanometer was so great that           could be no longer ob
                                                   it

   When air passed through absolute alcohol at 15° C., the de
<U+FB02>ection of the galvanometer amounted to about 30 millims.
only.    Heated to its boiling-point, the de<U+FB02>ection rose to 80 to
100 millims.      Here also there was an oxidation, but, as com
pared with that of ether,      was but small.
                                  it             The thermometer
also was unchanged, whether the air emerged from the tube free
from vapour or saturated with aqueous vapour.
   As regards temperature, the behaviour was the same in the
case of the following liquids.
   When air passed through amyltc alcohol,      produced scarcely
                                                         it             a
perceptible de<U+FB02>ection of the galvanometer.    As this alcohol only
boils at 130° to 132° C., but little vapour    formed on passing
                                                         is
air through it. If, while the air passed,    was heated almost to
                                                        it
its boiling-point,   de<U+FB02>ection of 60 to 80 millims. ensued.
                       a

60 millims. when used at 15° C.         used at its boiling-point,

                was so considerable that no observation could be

ma  e.
  When the air passed through cold acetic                     ether, the de<U+FB02>ection
amounted  to 30 to 50 millims.   If heated to                 its boiling-point,   it
was 200 to 220 millims.
  Through boracic ether at 15°      de<U+FB02>ectiona                of 30 millims. was
obtained; heated to its boiling-point    was       it         100 to 110 millims.

vapours, since from their easy oxidability it was not possible to
obtain certain results. From its unchangeability, carbonic acid
affords a more certain criterion for judging the radiating power
of vapours than all other vapours.        Yet a comparison with it
shows very decisively that aqueous vapour in its transparent con
dition has scarcely greater absorptive capacity for heat than dry
atmospheric air, and hence that the absorptive capacity of both
di<U+FB02>'ers little from each other.
       I
   But think these experiments were not needed. A well-known
phenomenon, which depends on the radiation of heat, furnishes a
more striking proof of the small absorptive capacity of aqueous
vapour than all experiments in the laboratory. If aqueous vapour
were in fact so good an absorbent of heat as Professor Tyndall
maintains, dew could never be formed; for the aqueous vapour,
which is indispensablefor dew, would at the same time form a
covering over the surface of the earth and prevent its radiation.
But just where the atmosphere is particularly rich in water, in
the tropics, is dew principally formed; and those regions would
be devoid of all fertility were it not that moisture is imparted to
the plants by dew.       Should it be urged that the vapour absorbs
heat indeed, but radiates a portion only back to the earth while
the greater part goes to the higher regions of the atmosphere,
this process of partial radiation would repeat itself from layer to
layer, and hence the temperature in different layers must dimi
nish with the height. This, however, is notoriously not the case
in the formation of dew: the temperature merely sinks near the
good radiating surface of the earth ; and a few feet above, it is not
lower than over a badly-radiating place which is not covered with
 dew. Further, a cooling would be impossible, since all layers of        -
the atmosphere, just as they radiate away part of their heat from
the earth, send another portion back to it. If aqueous vapour
possessed so great an absorptive capacity as Professor Tyndall
ascribes to  it,  extremely little of the radiating heat could reach
the clouds, since the enormous layer of vapour extending to them
 would entirely absorb it. It would then be inexplicable that
clouds prevent dew.        Since Wells’s memorable investigations,  it
is  generally assumed that thermal rays reach the clouds almost
undiminished, and are thence re<U+FB02>ected back to the earth         ;   if
there were no such almost unhindered transmission through
moist air, the clouds at their great distance could not hinder the
radiation as does  a    board or any other solid body ata  small dis
tance from the earth.
    The conclusions which Professor Frankland deduces for the
 glacial epoch from the great absorptive capacity of aqueous va
 pour, and Professor Tyndall for certain climatic phenomena,
 remain unchanged   if    nebulous be substituted for actual vapour.

For this it is which contributes to the maintenance of the beau
tiful green of the British Islands; for it moderates the burning
rays of the sun, as well as prevents the great colds, which only
occur with a clear sky and a copious radiation.
    Quite recently Father Secchi in Horne“, and Mr. Cooke at Cam
bridge in America'l', have connected the occurrence of certain
lines in the solar spectrum, which they have observed accom
panies a high hygrometric state of the atmosphere, with the ab
sorption of heat by aqueous vapour.              Apart from the circum
stance that, as shown by the above experiments, heat is extremely
little absorbed by transparent aqueous vapour, the absorption of
light indicated by the small quantity of dark lines which occur
with moist air, compared with the luminous intensity of the whole
 spectrum, corresponds to by no means so great an absorption of
heat as, according to Professor Tyndall, must occur.              It might
rather be maintained that in itself the small diminution in lumi~
nous intensity with moist but perfectly transparent air, is a con
 <U+FB01>rmation that thermal rays are but little absorbed by such air.
     Notwithstanding the great pains taken to ascribe to trans
 parent aqueous vapours a great absorptive capacity for heat, it
 follows from the experiments adduced, .and still more from the
 phenomena of dew, that this powerful absorption is not due to
 the transparent, but to nebulous vapours.
            XV. Remarks       on the Paper of Professor Magnus.
                    By Professor TYNDALL, F.R.S., 330.1
 I      SHOULD refrain for
         upon the paper of my friend
                                    the present from making any remark
                                             Professor  Magnus, did
 fear that my silence might be misconstrued by meteorologists,
                                                                      I  not
                                                                        and
 that they might be withheld, through a doubt as to their value,
 from prosecuting observations which I think are sure to expand
 the boundaries of their science.
      For an abstract of the experiments and reasonings by which
 each successive objection which has been urged against the action
  of aqueous vapour on radiant heat has been met,           I  would refer
  to the second edition of my work ‘ On Heat,’ pages 381 to 421.
  With the desire there manifested to get at the bottom of the
  difference between us,        I approach the latest objections of Pro
  fessor Magnus, regretting only that, being on the point of quit
  ting London,      I  can do no more than jot down a few of the more

                       Paper of Professor Magnus.                         119
 obvious re<U+FB02>ections suggested by his own description of his ex
 periments.
     Professor Magnus now infers the absence of absorption from
 the absence of radiation.       He employs as source of heat a stream
 of air which is <U+FB01>rst urged through water at the ordinary tempe
 rature, and afterwards caused to pass through a hot brass tube
 15 millims. in diameter.         On its emergence from the tube it
 radiates against a thermo-electric pile placed at a distance of 400
 millimetres. When dry air was urged through the tube, the de
 <U+FB02>ection was exceedingly small ; when air moistened as above was
 employed, the de<U+FB02>ection was scarcely augmented.
     Now, in the <U+FB01>rst place, the amount of vapour taken up by air
 in its passage through cold water is so small, and the stream of
 such air employed by Professor Magnus is so thin, that the heat
 radiated from the vapour must be excessively minute.                Suppo—
 sing the vapour compressed to the density of ordinary atmo
 spheric air, the average thickness of the radiating layer would
 probably be less than mtg of an inch.                 Even assuming the
 rays from this source to reach the pile without impediment, its
 action would be inconsiderable, if not insensible.
     But the rays were not permitted to reach the pile without
 impediment.       I assume that Professor Magnus did not deem it
'necessary to dry the air intervening between his source and his
 pile; otherwise he would have mentioned a precaution of such
 importance.      Here, then, we have the vapour of a column of air
 15 millims. thick radiating through the vapour of a layer of
 air 400 millims. thick, that is to say, through twenty-seven
 times its own thickness of a substance intensely opake to the
 radiation.     Considering, then, the feebleness of its origin and
 the dif<U+FB01>culties in its way, it is not surprising that the radiation
 from the source chosen by Professor Magnus failed to produce
'any very sensible impression upon his galvanometer*.
     It must be borne in mind that, to obtain copious radiation
 from a substance so attenuated as aqueous vapour, a considerable
 length of it must be employed.          An example will illustrate this.
 When enclosed in a tube 3 feet long, the radiation of sulphuric
 ether vapour, at 0'5 of an inch of pressure, exceeds that of ole<U+FB01>ant
 gas at the pressure of the atmosphere.           In a tube 3 inches long,
 on the contrary, the radiation from the gas is more than treble
 that from the vapour'l'.       That carbonic acid gas excels aqueous
    *  I have no means of judging the humidity of the radiating air as com
 pared with that of the air through which it radiated.     If the water em
 ployed to saturate the air were very cold, the latter might be the greater of
 the two.

  vapour, in the experiments of Professor M agnus, does not, there
 fore, surprise me.
     I have at present no means of judging of the validity of the
  assumption by which Professor Magnus accounts for the effect
  observed when his air, instead of being passed through cold
  water, was urged through water at a temperature of 60° or
  80° C. He here assumes precipitation, though there is none
  visible. By a similar assumption he explains the experiment of
  Professor Frankland, in which aqueous vapour was discharged
  along the axis of a cylinder of hot air and carbonic acid, and
 protected from precipitation by its gaseous envelope.
     With regard to the: formation of dew, the amount deposited
  depends on the quantity of vapour present in the air; and where
 that quantity is great, a small lowering of temperature will cause
  copious precipitation.     Supposing 50, or even 70 per cent. of
  the terrestrial radiation to be absorbed by the aqueous vapour of
  the air, the uncompensated loss of the remaining 30 would still
 produce dew, and produce it copiously where the vapour is abun
  dant. Attenuated as aqueous vapour             is,

easy, to compute the value of the vanishing fraction as in the
following examples, a step of the work on the left and a step on
 the right being taken alternately.                 It will be readily foreseen
 that, although no expressions of higher degree than the third are
 here taken, these being fully sufficient for the purpose of illus
 tration, yet the higher the degree, and the larger the number a,
 the greater is the facility of this method of calculation as com
 pared with that usually employed.

    In my demonstration of Newton’s rule, the case in which the
sign of inequality in any of the criteria is replaced by the sign of
equality is not adverted to ; and Newton makes no mention of
it.     I
        propose here brie<U+FB02>y to examine what inference may be
drawn from this circumstance.
 . 1. And <U+FB01>rst, let it be the leading triad of terms that furnishes
this equality. Then if the roots of the equation be diminished or
increased by that quantity which will cause the second coef<U+FB01>cient
in the transformed equation to be zero, it will follow, from the
theorem established at the end of my paper in the May Number
of this Journal, that the third coef<U+FB01>cient in that transformed
equation must be zero also.     For, as there shown, the condition
                         2nA,,A,,_2 —   (n-1)AZ_1= O
necessitates      the condition
                                      —
                         2nA'nA'n_2       (n— 1)A'fl_I = O,
which,      if A'n_1=0,
                      can have place only when also A'n_2=0.
Now if all the coef<U+FB01>cients, after this third, in the transformed
equation turn out to be zero, the roots of the primitive equation
must all be equal, their common value being the nth part of the
    second coef<U+FB01>cient (when divided by the <U+FB01>rst) taken with contrary
    sign.   But if all
                     the  coef<U+FB01>cients do not vanish, then, as is well
    known, the equation must have at least one pair of imaginary
    roots.
       The inference, therefore, is that the equation must have either
    one pair of imaginary roots at least, or else that the roots must
    be all real and equal.
       The same conclusion follows when it is the <U+FB01>nal triad that
    supplies the equality, since we may reverse all the coef<U+FB01>cients.
       2. But let it be an intermediate triad which furnishes the
    equality.    Then by taking the derived equations in succession,
    we shall at length arrive at one of these in which the interme
    diate coef<U+FB01>cients enter the <U+FB01>nal triad; and consequently, as just
    seen, this derived equation, if all its roots be not equal, must
    have at least two which are imaginary.       In the latter case, two
    at least must occur in the primitive equation.        In the former
    case the derived polynomial (after division by the <U+FB01>rst coef<U+FB01>cient,
    if this be other than unit) will be a cemplete pOWer ;             its
                                                                   three
    leading   coef<U+FB01>cients must thereforeful<U+FB01>l the condition  cf equality,

    124     Prof. Young on the Evaluation of Vanishing Fractions,
    which it could not do unless the three corresponding coef<U+FB01>cients
    of the primitive ful<U+FB01>lled that condition: hence in this case also
    the roots of the primitive must all be equal, or else two at least
    must be imaginary.      The general inference, then, is this: which
    ever triad furnishes the condition of equality, the equation must
    have either two imaginary roots at least, or else all its roots must
    be equal.     When, therefore, the equation is not a complete
    power, the sign =, in the application of Newton’s criteria to the
    several triads of coef<U+FB01>cients, is to be regarded as signi<U+FB01>cant of the
    same thing as the sign >.
       It may be observed here that we know that the equation
    m(.'r—a)"=0 will have all its roots equal to a; and that by de
    veloping the <U+FB01>rst member by the binomial theorem, the above
    mentioned condition of equality will have place throughout;
    and further, that when this condition has not place throughout
    all the triads, the <U+FB01>rst member of the equation cannot be the de
    velopment of m(.z'—a)",—-in other words, that the roots of the
    equation cannot be all equal.       Hence the theorem, that, if the
’
    roots are all equal, the condition of equality has place for every
    triad, holds conversely; that    is,   ifthe condition has place for
    every triad, the roots are all equal.
       In no subject  is greater caution needful, in dealing with the
    converse of established theorems, than in the Theory of Equa
    tions; for the most part they are ineonvertible. It has been
    regarded as questionable, or
                                    “ more than questionable,” whether
    the converse of Newton’s rule    is   true; but there ought to be no
    doubt at all on the matter. Equations, in any number, may be
    proposed, for which not one of Newton’s criteria of imaginary
    roots holds, and yet of which the roots shall be all imaginary.
    To be convinced of this,           suf<U+FB01>cient to refer to the theorem
                                it
                                is
    marked (II.) at the end of my paper in the Journal for October
    1865, to consider A3 as negative, and       AI    as
                                                       a    comparatively
    small coef<U+FB01>cient.    From the theorem marked (1.), too,     it it  at
    once seen that   if
                     p   in the cubic be negative, two roots of    ismay
    be imaginary, though Newton’s rule could never make known the
    fact. And Newton himself was fully aware of the inconvertibility
    of this rule; for, when speaking of the marks      by   which to dis
    tinguish the entrance of positive roots from the entrance of ne
    gative roots, he says   (I    still refer to Raphson’s translation),
    “And this   is  so where there are not more impossible roots than
    what are discovered    by  the rule preceding.      For there may be
    more, although   it seldom happens.”
       Nata—In the opening paragraph of my paper in the Journal
    for May last, the word “ holds ” should be replaced       by
                                                            “holds
    or fails :” the next following  paragraph, however, suf<U+FB01>ciently
    implies that this was intended.

     I
     have justi<U+FB01>ed the statement in the paragraph here alluded
to by a reference to the series of limiting cubics ,' but the truth
of it may be easily established in a direct manner without any
such reference-éthus :—
   The group of conditions given in my paper in the Journal for
August 1865 are all comprehended in the general form
              ("innit-5171M”.-. AM,                    >    met-mar,”     .     .    (1)
where m is the exponent of .z' in the middle one of any triad of
terms. That is to say, the triad itself being
                        Am+1wm+1+Amwm+Am_lx”‘-l,
the triad derived from this is
               (m+1)Am+1w"‘+mAmw"‘-‘+                  (m—1)Am_1w'"‘2;
and the principle af<U+FB01>rmed        that accordingly as (1) holds or
                                         is,
fails, so will the following condition, in which this derived triad
replaces the former, hold or fail, namely the condition
 m(n—m+2)(m—1)(m+1)Am_1Am+l> (m-1)(n-nT-_1)(mAm)<U+FB02>,
or, expunging the factors common to both sides, the condition
               (n—m+2) (m+         1)A,,,_1A,,,_1_1    > m(n—H-—l)      A9,".
Now     being remembered that, for the triad with which we are
         it
dealing, the degree of the equation   n—1, and not n, (as in the
                                                      is
case of the former triad) we must put n-1 for n in this last con
dition: the form will then be
 ((n—])—m+2)(m+1)Am_1A<U+FB02>,+l                             >
                                                            m((n—1)— m—1)A2m,
which         is   the same as
               (m+1)(n—m—1)Am_1Am+, >                       m(n—m)A‘zm,
and      is   thus identical with
 I   may add, in conclusion, that    any number  ifof consecutive   p
triads ful<U+FB01>l the condition of equality, then there will always be
at least p+1 or    imaginary roots; the former number
                           p                                    be              if  p
odd, and the latter               if
                            be even.
                               is p
    The truth of this      readily seen.  If the derived equation, of
which the <U+FB01>rst member terminates with the last of these triads,
be replaced           by
                  its reciprocal, we shall have   consecutive leading
                                                              p
triads ful<U+FB01>lling the condition      and by diminishing or increasing
                                         ;
the roots of this reciprocal equation                  by
                                            the number which causes
the second term of the transformed equation to be zero, the next
1) terms will be zero also, just the same as        all the following
                                                               if

distinct sequences of this kind imply distinct groups of imagi

     XVII.      On the formation of Rosalie Acid and Rosaniline.
                               By H. CARO *.
    T    has been recently shown by Wanklyn and myself-f, that
        rosolic acid may be obtained from rosaniline by the same
method as that by which phenol is derived from aniline.                 This
observation indicates the existence of a common hydrocarbon
skeleton 'in rosolic acid and rosaniline, and exhibits the dye
forming acid and the dye-forming base as members of the same
natural family.                                                       1
    From this point of view it seemed that a comparison and
study of the various methods of preparing these substances was
calculated     to throw light upon the constitution of both of
them.                                .
    Rosolic acid is formed in a set of reactionsI hardly less
numerous and interesting than the variety of processes devised
for’the production of rosanilinc. Discovered in 1834 by Runge§
in coal-tar, and obtained from the residues of the preparation
of carbolic acid by treating them with lime, its beautiful rose
coloured compounds with alkalies and “ appropriate mordants,”
attracted the attention of this chemist, to whom we also owe the
                                                            '
 discovery of carbolic acid and aniline.
    Range considered rosolic acid to be a true colouring-matter
capable of forming red pigments and lake-colours, rivalling in
beauty those produced by saf<U+FB02>ower, cochineal, and madder.                 In
fact, rosolic acid, or more correctly the rosolates, were the <U+FB01>rst
remarkable colouring-matters derived from coal-tar. Curiously
enough, notwithstanding its striking properties, rosolic acid was
lost sight of by chemists, and even its existence doubted, until
Tschelnitz<U+FB02> noticed its formation during the prolonged contact
of carbolic acid with lime, and, following the indications given
by Runge, con<U+FB01>rmed his observations                   upon this colouring
 matter.
    A more complete investigation was made by H. Miiller<U+FB01>l, who
 found that a quantity of “ crude carbolate of lime, which had
 been left for many months in a warm drying-closet, was entirely
 converted into a red substance, which on treatment with water
 gave a beautiful dark-red solution.”

        On the Formation         of Rosalie Acid      and Rosaniline.      127
published an account of some researches upon a red colouring
matter which had been formed by the contact of lime with
carbolic acid used in the manufacture of McDougall’s disin
fectants. This red colour was due to the presence of rosolates;
and its arti<U+FB01>cial preparation was <U+FB01>rst attempted by passing
vapour of carbolic acid over heated lime, and then more success
fully by heating phenylate of sodium with peroxide of manganese.
In this case large quantities of rosolate of sodium were readily
                                 '
obtained.
   Dussart* investigated the properties of rosolic acid, arriving
at the same results as H. Miiller.         He moreover found that
when rosolic acid is distilled with excess of lime and potash, i
carbolic acid is regenerated.
   Jourdin-l' proved that rosolic acid could be easily obtained
by heating a mixture of carbolic acid and oxide of mercury with
caustic soda.    At a temperature not exceeding 150° 0., the re
action   is  quickly accomplished,     and an abundance      of pure
rosolate of sodium is obtained.      He mentions besides the forma
tion of rosolic acid by treatment of carbolic acid with mercuric
chloride.    In this instance the elimination of a large amount of
hydrochloric acid was observed.
   F. Foli found that “bisulphate of mercury produced with
phenol a reddish-brown resinous matter, yielding with alkalies
very soft red and rose colours, and by itself dyeing yellow.” He
further studied the action of arsenic acid upon “phenic or cres
sylic acid or other analogous substances,” and observed the for
mation of a yellow colouring-matter, for which he proposed the
name “xanthophenic acid,” which, however, presented most of
the well-marked characters of rosolic acid.         Schiitzenberger
and Sengenwald§ noticed the formation of rosolates during the
heating of the substitution-products which they obtained by the
action of chloride of iodine upon phenylic alcohol.
   All these processes for the production of rosolic acid are pro~
cesses of oxidation more or less direct.        There            is,

acid with biodide of amyle at 130° 0., and obtained yellow             a
colouring-matter, bearing      striking resemblance to rosolic acid.

one possessing all the properties     of rosolic acid (while the
other had the character      of brunolic acid).”       The    like
wise found “that a mixture of iodine and carbolic acid): when
heated with formic, acetic, butyric, and valerianic acids, produce
rosolic acid or a similar substance.      A mixture of iodine and
carbolic acid did not give a similar result (but a black solid, con
taining iodine) .”
    In an analogous manner rosolates are formed by heating mo
nobromophenylic acid with alcholic potash*.
    The most interesting formation of rosolic acid, and that which
has led to the practical application of this colouring-matter upon
a large scale, was discovered by Kolbe and Schmitt during their
researches upon the synthetical formation of salicylic acid from
phenylic alcohol. In a paper

   2. Whether, the agent being one containing carbon of the fatty
series, it is possible to get rosolic acid from phenol absolutely
                                                                  -
free from cressylic alcohol ?
                                 I
   In carrying out my design, was at once met by the dif<U+FB01>culty
of obtaining pure phenol. Even the best crystallized and co
lourless specimens of carbolic acid now to be met with in com
merce contain more or less cressylic alcohol.        I
                                                    am therefore
greatly indebted to Mr. C. Lowe, who kindly supplied me with a
splendidly crystallized specimen of pure hydrated carbolic acid*,
which by simple distillation is resolved into water and into
perfectly pure phenylic alcohol, which immediately solidi<U+FB01>es in
the receiver.      Pure phenol has a faint vinous smell, fuses at
42° C., and boils constantly at 184° C. (correct).      It shows no
tendency to deliquescc, nor to get coloured in the air.
   Another specimen of phenylic alcohol was obtained by the de
structive distillation of salicylatc of lime (prepared from gaul
theria oil).    It presented the same physical characters as coal
tar (phenol). Its boiling-point was found to be 184° C. (correct),
and its fusing-point 41° 0.1'
   The mixture of phenylic and cressylic alcohols employed in
the following experiments was obtained by repeated fractional
distillations from the higher-boiling portions of commercial
cressol.    It was a colourless, highly rcfracting liquid of faint
pleasant smell, and boiling between 194° C. and 199° C.
   Lastly, I prepared some cressylic alcohol by treating perfectly
pure hydrochlorate of toluidine with nitrous acid, and heating
the resulting and diluted solution of hydrochlorate of diazotoluol
to ebullition.      Under evolution of nitrogen, cressylic alcohol
separated out as a heavy brown oil, largely contaminated with
nitrocressylic acids.    Treatment with tin and hydrochloric acid
 destroyed these nitro-compounds; and repeated washings and,
lastly, distillation over a small piece of sodium rendered cressylic
alcohol perfectly colourless.
   These substances were submitted to the action of peroxide of
manganese (Smith) and oxide of mercury (Jourdin) in the pre
sence of caustic soda, likewise to the action of chloride of mercury
(Jourdin), sulphate of mercury, arsenic acid (F01), and iodine.
  In every instance equal quantities of pure phenol and of the
mixture of phenylic and cressylic alcohols were employed, and
heated with the same weights of the aforesaid reagents under
conditions precisely alike, and observing the indications giVen
by the authors of these processes.   Some of these experiments
have been several times repeated with altered proportions.

130                Mr. H. Caro    on the Formation     of
    The result was in all cases the same.          Not a trace of rosolic
 acid  could be obtained from pure phenylic alcohol, while the
 formation of rosolates was most decided in the corresponding
 experiments with the mixture of phenylic and cressylic alcohols.
     Cressylic alcohol yielded not a trace of rosolates upon treat
 ment with arsenic acid, or with hydrated oxide of mercury and
 caustic soda, but the addition of phenol to it gave an imme
 diate formation of rosolic acid under these conditions.
     Thus it appears that there is a most striking analogy between
 the preparation of rosolic acid and rosaniline; for the latter, as
is well known from the beautiful experiments of Hofmann*, is
not capable of being formed by the action of oxidizing agents
either upon pure aniline or pure toluidine, but is easily obtained
from a mixture of the two.
    Passing now to query No. 2. Pure phenol from coal-tar and
from salicylic acid was mixed with concentrated sulphuric acid
and oxalic acid in the proportions recommended by Kolbe and
Schmitt, and maintained at a temperature of 160° C. for 2%
hours.      There was very little evolution of gas, and an excellent
yield   of rosolic acid.
    Kolbe   and  Schmitt’s process, applied to a mixture of phenol
and cressol, gave much more gas, and a comparatively poor
yield of rosolic acid, whilst with pure cressol there was an abun
dant evolution of gas, and absolutely no production of rosolic acid.
    The formation of rosolic acid from pure phenol was moreover
proved by repeating the experiment of Monnet.              Two parts of
pure phenol, one part of concentrated sulphuric acid, and two
parts of iodide of amyle were heated for four hours at 115° to
120° C. There was disengagement of iodine, and formation of
a notable quantity of rosolic acid.
    A mixture of pure phenol with bromacetic acid, or with gla
cial acid and iodine, or formiates and iodine, gave rosolic acid
when heated in a sealed tube, thus con<U+FB01>rming the interesting
results of Perkin and Duppa.
    Iodoform acts very energetically upon pure phenol        ‘ (whether
prepared from coal-tar or from salicylic acid).
    Iodine and hydroiodic acid are liberated, and a large quantity
of rosolic acid is rapidly formed.
    Pure cressylic alcohol and iodoform give not a trace of rosolic
acid.
    The next point to be made out, was whether pure aniline,
free from toluidine, is capable of giving rosaniline on treatment
with reagents containing fatty carbon.           For this purpose pure
aniline was prepared from indigo, from pure coal-tar benzol, and
from benzoic acid benzol.       These specimens had been repeatedly

                         Rosalie Acid and Rosaniline.                     131
  tested by heating them with iodine, mercuric chloride and
 arsenic acid, andgave only the minutest trace of rosaniline.
      Iodoform* was heated gently with this pure aniline.              It dis
  solved, and almost immediately afterwards gave rise to an ener
 getic reaction, the mixture darkening rapidly, and then solidify
 ing from the formation of hydroiodates of aniline and rosani
 line, the latter being produced in great abundance.
      Under similar conditions toluidine is attacked violently,
 giving a brown-coloured product which contains no rosaniline.
      Similar results were obtained by heating pure aniline with
 iodine and formiate of lead; and the formation of rosaniline was
 likewise, although less strikingly, observed by the action of
 chloroform, chloride of carbon, and iodide of cyanogen upon
 pure aniline.
      The bearing of these experimental results on the theory of the
 constitution of rosolie acid and rosaniline will be obvious. Both
 of these substances appear to contain aromatic and fatty carbon,
 and accordingly we see that, in order to form either of them, it is
necessary to have both a phenyle-compound and a fatty carbon
compound present.           This fatty carbon-compound may be cres
sol or toluidine, which the researches of Tollens and Fittig'l'
have shown to contain methyle ; or it may be a simpler member
of the fatty series, such as iodoform or oxalic acid.
     The subjoined equations, which may be regarded as expres
sing the formations of rosaniline and rosolie acid, exhibit this
fact, and show the very close parallelism subsisting between                    ,

   132                Archdeacon Pratt    on a   Problem in
   gents, seems to corroborate these views.           These agents, which
   are known not to act upon benzol, ammonia, or water respec
   tively, leave the component groups of amido-benzol and hy
   droxyl-benzol unchanged.          Thus it appears that their action
   consists mainly in the abstraction of hydrogen from the methyle
   group contained in toluidine (amido-methylbenzol) and cres
   sol (hydroxyl-methyl-benzol), thereby increasing the atomicity
   of the residuary groups, and causing a coalescence of three phe
   nyle molecules.
      In the case of reagents being employed which at the same
  time exert an action upon, or effect a substitution in the benzol,
   ammonia, or water residues of aniline and phenol respectively,
   we can easily recognize the formation of corresponding by
  products which interfere with the practical values of these pro
  cesses for the formation of colouring-matters.

  parts negative, the whole mass being zero, and its attraction on

condensed into its own centre.      But the present investigation
shows that there     no other kind of surface which po'ssesses the
                        is
property.   Hence no changes in the arrangement of the mate
rials of body can be made so as to preserve the external attrac

tration and dispersion of matter to or from one or more <U+FB01>xed
centres in the body.
   6.I  trust I have now vindicated the truth of the two important
propositions which have been noticed recently in your Magazine,
while have at the same time taken the opportunity of correcting

it has hitherto altogether 0verlooked)——bear upon the <U+FB02>uid theory
of the earth.    For      itonly  is              by
                                    geodetic means, which the second

 have at once a surface of equilibrium;           and the laws of hydro,
 statics show that it must be a spheroid.        But we have no means of
 actually measuring the form of the ocean. Were it studded with
 islands so that a large part could be covered with survey-triangles,
 this might be remedied.         In the absence of this we are obliged to
 con<U+FB01>ne ourselves to the continents; and by supposing them per
 meated by canals letting in the sea-water to any extent, calcula
 ting by means of the spirit-level how it would lie, we ascertain
 by laborious surveys that the canals lie very nearly on a sphe
 roidal surface.      This surface, where it comes in contact with the
 sea at sea-coast stations, of course coincides with the sea-surface.
 But whether the sea-surface as we proceed out to sea carries on
 the same spheroidal form, geodesy does not enable us to deter
 mine.      Perhaps accurate and extensive coast-surveys, as nearly
  north and south as possible, would be serviceable for this end.
 If the sea-surface and the inland sea-level can be shown to belong
 to one spheroid, then the earth’s mass is undoubtedly arranged
 according to the <U+FB02>uid law.
     In our ignorance of the form of the ocean by direct measure
 ment,    I think the close accordance of the ellipticity obtained by
 pendulum experiments, many of them made at insular stations,
 with that found by geodetic measures, is a fact of the last im
 portance, and in great measure compensates for the want of
 direct measurement: and in our ignorance from direct sources
 whether or not the spheroidal surface of the continents obtained
                                          I
 by geodesy is one of equilibrium, think that the near agreement
of the ellipticity of that surface with the ellipticity obtained from
the <U+FB02>uid theory and an assumed law of density is a strong argu
ment in favour of its being so.

          by Professor Domeyko        (after whom it has been named),
and there found in the copper-veins which traverse thegstrata
pertaining to the upper oolitic period, has now been met with
by the author at Corocoro in Northern Bolivia, occurring in the
beds of cupriferous sandstone of Permian or Triassic age, which
    * Communicated by the Author.
                                                                    _    '
    1' Has since been found in the copper-mines   of the Lalze Superior district
in North America.

   136               Mr. D. Forbcs’s   Researches on the
   apparently are the representatives of the European “Kupfer
   schicfer.”
      In the mine of Bucn Pastor at Corocoro it is found in the
   form of irregular nodules imbedded in the sandstone along with
   metallic copper and minute grains of metallic silver: the mine
   itself is explored for silver as well as copper.
      The nodules vary much in size, from that of a pea up to some
   three or four inches across, irregularly imbeddcd in the compa
   ratively soft red sandstone, which in the proximit of the nodules
   appears deprived of its red colour, or, as it were, bleached, appa
  rently by some deoxidating agency—a phenomenon which is also
  the casein such parts of the sandstone bed in which metallic
  copper or silver is found, and thus serves as a guide to the miner
  in rejecting the non-metalliferous or unaltered part of the rock.
      On fracture these nodules have considerable glance, and at <U+FB01>rst
  sight appear to be nearly pure Domeykitc ; but upon closer ex
  amination they are seen to consist of an intimate mixture of that
  mineral with quartz grains, the metallic glance of the Domeykite
  obscuring the colourless particles of sand.
      The speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the richest part of such nodules was
  found to be 4'65 at 60° F. (15°‘5 C.), whilst the metallic powder
  obtained upon pulverizing the nodules and washing out the in
  termixed quartz was found to be 6'91.
      An analysis was made of these metallic particles, and the
  results obtained showed the mineral to have the following per
  centage composition :—
                      Arsenic     .  .   .  .  2841

  arsenic 75, the formula Cu6 As, as accepted for Domeykite,
  would by calculation require—

.     Titaniferous Iron-sand (Kibdelophan ?) .——Along the west coast
  of Peru at Arica, the sands which cover the barren porphyrics
  and other rocks subordinate to the upper oolitic series contain a
  considerable intermixture of black particles, easily extracted from
  the bulk of the sand by drawing a magnet through them, to
  which these particles adhere.
      Although they appear homogeneous to the eye, a microscopic
  examination shows them to be rounded irregular grains, which
  still retain some adherent gangue, colourless, or of a reddish-browu

or brown colour, translucent, and probably a felspathic mineral.
It was impossible to get the sand quite free from this admixture;
but taken as pure as possible to obtain, the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of
the black mineral was found to be 4'34 at 60° F. (l5°'5 C.).
    The sand was not entirely decomposed by hydrochloric acid
even when previously heated in a current of hydrogen, during
which operation it lost in weight, and afterwards dissolved in part
in hydrochloric acid, with the evolution of hydrogen gas.
    The chemical examination was therefore made by fusing a
known quantity in the state of <U+FB01>ne powder along with ten times
its weight of bisulphate of potash.           The fused mass when quite
cold was dissolved in cold distilled water, which left behind a
small amount of white insoluble silica amounting to 332 per
cent.     The <U+FB01>ltrate, much diluted with water, was acidi<U+FB01>ed by a
little nitric acid, with the intention of retaining all iron in solution,
when, after prolonged boiling, it deposited a considerable amount
 of faint yellow-coloured titanic acid, which, however, became
brown upon ignition, evidently from still retaining some sesqui
oxide of iron.      This titanic acid amounted to 57' '72 per cent. of
the mineral’s original weight.         Approximatively, therefore, the
mineral may be regarded as being composed of-
             Titanic acid (with some Fe2 03)            .    57'72

 From which it would         appear that the mineral belongs to the

    1‘ I have to thank M. Falkenheimer of La Paz for extremely large and
 <U+FB01>ne specimens of this mineral.

 188             Mr. D. Forbes’s   Researches on the
    The Epsomite presents itself in elongated masses, consisting
 of  an aggregate of crystalline <U+FB01>bres, either colourless or of a
 white colour; streak white; hardness 1'75,scratching talc, but not
 rock-salt, and apparently but little less hard than the last-named
 substance.    Lustre semivitreous to vitreous, occasionally earthy.
 The speci<U+FB01>c gravity was taken by weighing the mineral in petro
 leum at 60° F. (15°‘5 C.), and calculated to be 1636, water
being 1000.
    It was readily soluble in water, leaving only a minute residue
of white quartz and; and the qualitative examination showed the
absence of lime, alumina, and iron, but the presence of sulphuric
 acid, water, magnesia,  and soda.
    The quantitative analysis was conducted as follows.        23'27
grains dissolved in water left, upon <U+FB01>ltration, a minute insoluble
residue of quartz particles weighing 0'08 grain, or equivalent to
0'34 per cent.    The <U+FB01>ltrate was precipitated by a solution of
chloride of barium, and afforded a precipitate of sulphate of ba
rytes amounting to 2226 grains, equivalent to 7'62 grains anhy
drous sulphuric acid, or 32'86 per cent.
    Another portion, 27 '35 grains in weight, was dissolved in water
and precipitated by adding acetate of barytes in slight excess.
The precipitate formed was, after standing for some time, removed
by <U+FB01>ltration, and the clear solution evaporated to dryness in a
platinum capsule, and heated to redness in order to convert the
acetates into carbonates.     The incinerated mass was then ex
tracted with water and evaporated to dryness in a tared platinum
crucible with the addition of a few drops of pure sulphuric acid.
The sulphate of soda thus obtained weighed 021 grain, or equi
valent to 0'09 grain soda, or 0'33 per cent. soda in the mineral.
   In order to determine the amount of water, a third quantity,
amounting to 30-06 grains, was heated in a Rammelsberg’s air
bath to 300° F. (150° 0.), when it sustained a loss of 12-37
grains; upon heating further to 600° F. (317° C.) more water
was evolved, and this heat was continued until traces of sul—
phuric acid fumes commenced to show themselves, when the
amount of water driven off was found to be 15'27 grains, or equi
valent to 5079 per cent.

    Nitratine.—Notwithstanding            that the exploration of nitratine
0r nitrate of soda has for many years formed one of the most ex
tensive and important branches of Peruvian industry, the infor
mation published in the works of different chemists and minera~
logists  as to its occurrence and formation appears to be extremely
vague,   while   at the same time singularly confused views are given
as to the geographical position of the deposits themselves.
    One very evident source of this confusion is due to the general
use of the name Chile saltpetre in commerce; this name having
arisen at the commencement of the trade in this article, from the
fact of the ships in which it was exported from Peru to Europe
having been chartered and freighted by the merchants of Valpa
raiso in Chile.       The name is both misleading and entirely inap
propriate,    as  there   are no available deposits of nitrate of soda
known in any part of the Chilian territory. With the exception
of some more recently discovered deposits on the coast of Bolivia
to the south of the river Loa, which forms the line of frontier
between that country and Peru, n0 workable deposits of nitrate of
soda are known in any part of South America beyond the limits
of the province of Tarapaca, in the department of Moquegua in
Peru.
  _ These remarks will help to explain some of the statements
made under this head in various mineralogical and chemical
works.      In Ure’ s ‘ Dictionary of Arts and Manufactures,’ vol. iii.
p. 7 26, nitrate of soda is stated to be “found native in immense
quantities in Chile.”          In Naumann’s Mineralogie, p. 216, it is
described as occurring “in Thonlagern bei Iquique uud Tarapacav
im Department Arequiba in Bolivia”*.                  In Brooke and Miller’s
‘Mineralogy,’ p.      61,  the  localities given   are  “Desert of Atacama,”
and “Tarapaca in Peru near the frontier of Chile.”                     Again, in
Burat’s Minéralogie applique, p.            243,    the   locality  is  given as
“principalement        aux  environs    d’Arica   et  d’Iquique    sur  les cotes
de Pérou et de la Bolivie.”           Both Iquique and Arica are ports
on the Peruvian coast; but notwithstanding some searches were
a. few years back made for nitrate of soda on the coast near Arica,
 no nitrate of soda has ever been found anywhere near that town.
    * It must be remembered that Iquique is the chief town of the province
 of Tarapaca in the department of Moquegua, Peru, and that Ariquipa is the
 name of a city and department in Peru still further north.

cite analyses of nitratine by Hayes and Lecanu, which analyses
are also given by Ramme-lsberg in his Handbuch derMineralchemie,
p. 247, but he groups them all together in respect to locality,
simply stating them to be all “aus dem Distrikt Atacama in
Bolivia,” although it is quite certain that no one of the specimens
referred to came from any part of the Bolivian desert of Atacama.
   Since the author’s visits to this part of the Paci<U+FB01>c coast of South
America in 1857 and 1859, the results of which are published in a
report on the Geology of Bolivia and Southern Peru, communi
cated to the Geological Society of London, Nov. 21, 18601', a
second exploration, made in 1863, has fully con<U+FB01>rmed his pre
vious observations, and the views expressed in that report as to
the origin of these vast deposits of nitrate of soda.
 '
   The workings for the crude nitrate of soda are opened upon
the inclined grounds which ascend gently from the arid salt
valleys and plains which had, as it were, been bays and indenta
tions in the eastern coast-line of the Great Plain or Pampa de
Tamarugal when that was a sea, which, at an elevation of about
3250 feet above the level of the Paci<U+FB01>c Ocean, extends over a
large portion of the Province of Tarapaca in the department of
Moquegua in Peru.
   These deposits are known to exist from about latitude 19° S.
extending to latitude 21° 30’ S., where the river Loa forms the
southern boundary between the Republics of Peru and Bolivia.
More recent explorations in 1860 have showed that some de
posits existed also to the south of the river Loa in Bolivian
territory, and were subsequently worked on a small scale, the
produce being shipped from the harbour of Tocopilla on the
coast of Bolivia.   It        is,
                             however, stated that they were soon
abandoned as unpro<U+FB01>table.
   The range of saliferous country runs parallel to the coast, at
an average elevation of from 2500 to 3500 feet above the level

aus Peron.”       As this chemist   is understood never to have been in the dis
trict, and the analysis corresponds to the commercial nitratine, differing
greatly from all analyses of naturalnitrate,          seems most probable that the
                                                       it
analysis in question was made upon the commercial nitrate as shipped from
Iquique, and which    is   generally supposed to be a natural product, although
in realityit   has been subjected to     a crude process of re<U+FB01>ning.

of the Paci<U+FB01>c Ocean; and previously to having attained this ele
vation, it may be supposed to have been occupied by a chain of
shallow lagoons broken up by promontories and islands; and
these probably had for a long period tidal communication with
the main ocean, until, by the still greater upheaval of the whole
country, they became isolated from the sea and dried up, leaving
their original sea-bottoms covered by vast beds of salt, more or
less mixed with sand, and which are productive in nitrate of soda
on the slopes which now bound the present valleys and plains
and encircle the hills which represent the islands, bays, and
indentations of the ancient lagoons.
    Most descriptions of these nitrate-of-soda deposits leave the
reader under the impression that they occur like other sedimen
tary strata, in more or less regular layers or beds of salt, sand,
clay, or gypseous marls, &c.     This, however, is quite erroneous.
The nitrate of soda does not represent any bed in a series, but
in reality is only the representative of the outcrop of a bed of
salt (with which it is always more or less contaminated), or, in
other words, the bed of salt left on the bottom and sides of the
ancient lagoons, after their complete desiccation, becomes, at the
edge of the sloping shore or bank, more or less converted into
nitrate of soda by chemical action.    In the centre or lower parts
of the salt-bed, nitrate is never found ; at the outcrop it is gene
rally, if not always, found in more or less quantity—sometimes
almost on the surface itself, or covered by a few inches of sand,
but generally concealed by the upper part of the salt-bed being
still unaltered salt, and forming, as it were, a hard crust (the
“ crosta” of the
                    miners) over the soft white impure nitrate of
soda.
   It  has been advanced that the nitrate of soda was the product
of the volcanic action developed in the higher mountains to the
east of the Pampa de Tamarugal, and that it had been dissolved
out and washed down into these lower valleys and plains, where
it had been deposited and dried up.                  -
    All the circumstances of the locality, however, tend to reject
this hypothesis; and surely in that case we ought to <U+FB01>nd the
nitrate deposits in the basins or lower parts of the valleys and
plains; which is never the case in reality, as such low deposits
invariably consist of salt, alone or mixed with the gypseous com
 pounds usual to dried-up sea-water, whilst the nitrate-of-soda
 deposits are found higher up, on the slopes of the hills which
                                         ’                        -
 surround such basins.
    A very attentive study of these deposits has quite con<U+FB01>rmed
 the view as to the origin of the nitrate of soda, expressed in
the report previously alluded to, and which supposes the nitrate
 of soda to have been formed at the margin or fringe slopes of

142                Mr. D. Forbes’s    Researcher  on the
the tidal lagoons by the decomposition of sea-salt, effected by the
agency of carbonate of lime and organic matter of all kinds,
both terrestrial and marine vegetation in particular.            No doubt
such lagoons or swamps in a tropical climate would be sur
rounded by a luxuriant growth of marine and other plants of
semiaquatic habits; but, independent of this, the whole country
in the immediate vicinity, although now perfectly arid and
without a drop of surface-water, must then have been clothed
by immense and luxuriant forests.             This is attested by the
occurrence everywhere of enormous quantities of wood, trees
with branches and roots perfect and of immense size, found all
over this district (buried in the plains themselves), and appa
rently of the same species as now grow in the country.                   The
wood of such is found in all states, from nearly perfect preserva
tion to extreme decay; and it may not generally be known that
for many years, at the commencement of the nitrate trade, and
in parts even now, these accumulations of ancient wood formed
the supply of fuel for carrying on the process of boiling out
the nitrate, and that it was only much later that coal, imported
from England and Chile, became the chief combustible, as might
be expected, from the great demand created by the subsequent
great development of the trade.
    Reeds, rushes, and other vegetable matter, as well as sea-shells,
are constantly met with in the deposits ; and at the workings of
La Noria*, it was stated that a quantity of what appeared to be
guano, had also been found imbedded in the nitrate.
    A chemical examination of the nitrate of soda from the depo
sits at La Noria about thirty miles east of Iquique, and 3052 feet
above the sea, was made with the subjoined results.
    The specimen taken was picked out of a large mass of the
more impure “ caliche” or crude nitrate, and was pronounced to
be of the <U+FB01>nest quality, and was in most parts a transparent
and colourless aggregate of crystals of small size, but evidently
rhombohedral.        Hardness =1‘Z5, being below rocksalt, but
scratching talc. Its speci<U+FB01>c gravity was found by taking it in
petroleum, and at 60° Fahr. (15°‘5 cent.) was 2'18, water being
 1'000.
    A careful qualitative examination showed the presence of
soda, nitric acid, chlorine, sulphuric acid, and lime, with minute
traces of alumina, magnesia, and potash, but iodine could not
be detected by any of the usual processes.

as regards nitrate of soda and the borates of lime,  is greatly indebted to
Mr. Smith’s labours; and his map of the saliferous    district, published in

    The quantitative analysis was effected as follows :—
    100'3’7 grains of the nitrate dried at 212°. “Thenitrate did not
 contain any other than hygroscopic moisture ;” it dissolved into
 a colourless solution in cold water, and left 0'32 grain insoluble
 red sand, equivalent to 031 per cent. The solution was divided
 into three portions, respectively representing 50'185, 25'092,
 and 25-092 grains in weight of the original mineral.
    50'185 grains gave, upon addition of oxalate of ammonia, a
 precipitate of oxalate of lime, which, upon incineration, yielded
 022 carbonate of lime, equivalent to 023 per cent. of lime, or
 representing 0'45 per cent. chloride of calcium.
    25'092 grains gave, when precipitated by nitrate of silver,
 13'69 grains chloride of silver, equivalent to 13'41 per cent.
 chlorine, from which, after deducting 0'22 as combined with
 calcium, the percentage of chloride of sodium present was calcu
 lated at 21'63.
    25'09 grains, when precipitated by chloride of barium, afforded
0'42 grain sulphate of barytes, equivalent to 0'52 per cent. sul
 phuric acid, or 092 per cent. sulphate of soda.
    The nitrate of soda present was estimated by loss; and the
 analysis will therefore stand as follows :—
                 Nitrate of soda      .  .   .   76'69
                 Sulphate of soda .       .   .   0'92

                                                10000
    The specimen represented by the above analysis must be red
garded as not only far superior to the general average of what
would be regarded as native nitrate of the best quality, but
must be viewed more from a mineralogical than a technical point
of view.
    It was, however, considered interesting also to examine the
more massive nitratine for sake of comparison, and for this pur
pose the following analysis was made.
    The specimen was taken from a virgin working about to be
commenced, situated on the slope of the hill overlooking the Sal
de Obispo, in the interior, to the west of the port of Pisagua, and
about 30 feet higher than the salt bottom of that dry plain or
former lagoon.
    The nitrate of soda here cropped out to the surface, barely
covered by a little sand and salt, and possessed a saccharine
white appearance veined with brownish dirty-looking streaks;
the quality was pronounced <U+FB01>ne by the experienced workmen,
and the speci<U+FB01>c gravity taken in petroleum was found to be 2'21

 (water being 1000).     Some insoluble rock-matter was left upon
dissolving in cold water, but otherwise the solution was quite
colourless and transparent.
    The quantitative analysis was conducted as follows :—
    114'67 grains, in water, left some reddish sand-grains, which
 amounted to 2'35 grains or 2'04 per cent. after <U+FB01>ltration.    The
 solution was divided into four parts and treated as follows 1—
    A quarter gave, upon treatment with chloride of barium,
 10'40 grains sulphate of barytes, equivalent to 12'45 per cent.
 sulphuric acid.
   A quarter, precipitated by nitrate of silver, gave 394.? grains
                                                                '
mixed chloride and iodide of silver.
   A quarter, supersaturated with ammonia, afforded 0'47 grain
alumina (with no trace of iron), or 1'63 per cent. alumina ; the
<U+FB01>ltrate, treated with oxalate of ammonia, gave upon incineration
0'09 grain carbonate of lime, equivalent to 0'17 per cent. lime ;~
and subsequently the addition of phosphate of ammonia to the
<U+FB01>ltrate precipitated phosphate of ammonia and magnesia, which
upon incineration yielded 1'26 pyrophosphate of magnesia, re
presenting 1'81 per cent. magnesium.
    The potash-determination was effected on another portion,
18'03 grains, repeatedly heated to dryness with hydrochloric
acid, to expel all nitric acid; the sulphuric acid present was
then removed by an alcoholic solution of chloride of strontium,
and the potash determined by bichloride of platinum as usual ;
the metallic platinum weighed 0'19 grain, or equivalent to 0'23
per cent. potassium.
   To determine the iodine another portion, 29'84 grains, was
dissolved, and after <U+FB01>ltration precipitated by chloride of palla
dium ; 0'08 grain metallic palladium was obtained from igniting
the precipitated iodide of palladium, representing 0'19 iodine.
   The amount of iodine and potassium respectively found being
close upon the numbers of their combining proportions, their
united weights are given in the analysis as iodide of potassium.
   From the above data, the analysis when calculated will stand
as below  :—

THE“Researches          on   Gun-cotton.—Memoir I. Manufacture and
 Composition of Gun-cotton.”         By F. A. Abel, F.R.S., V.P.C.S.
    A review of the researches on the production, properties, and com
position of gun-cotton hitherto published, and a brief examination
into the probable causes of the discrepancies exhibited between the
results and conclusions of different experimenters, are followed in
this paper by a criticism of the several steps in the system of manu
facture of gun-cotton, as prescribed by Baron v. Lenk.
    The conclusions arrived at on this subject are founded upon care
fully conducted laboratory-experiments, and upon extensive manu
facturing operations carried on during the last three years at the
Royal Gunpowder \Vorks, Waltham Abbey.               In some of these ope
rations v. Lenk’s system of manufacture, as originally communi
cated to the English Government by that of Austria, was strictly
followed ; in others, various modi<U+FB01>cations were introduced in differ
ent stages of the manufacture—such           as in the composition of the
acids used, in the proportion borne by the cotton to the acids in
which it remained immersed, in the duration of the treatment of
cotton with the acids, and in the methods of puri<U+FB01>cation to-which
the gun-cotton was submitted.
    Exception is taken to one or two points in the general system of
manufacture, and directions are indicated in which they may be ad
vantageously modi<U+FB01>ed ; but the general conclusion arrived at is that,
although Baron v. Lenk cannot be said to have initiated any new
principle as applied to the production of gun-cotton, he has suc
ceeded in so greatly perfecting the process of converting cotton into
the most explosive form of pyroxyline or gun-cotton, and also the
methods of puri<U+FB01>cation, as to render a simple attention to his clear
and de<U+FB01>nite regulations alone necessary to ensure the manufacture
of very uniform products, which are unquestionably much more
  erfect in their nature than those obtained in the earlier days of the
  istory of gun-cotton.       Great stress is laid upon the fact that de
viations from the prescribed process which at <U+FB01>rst sight may appear
trivial (such as a slight modi<U+FB01>cation in the strength of the acids
used, the neglect of proper cooling-arrangements)             are certain to
lead to variations in the products of manufacture, affecting their
explosive characters, or their permanence, or both.           A considerable
deviation from the normal composition, due evidently to some
accidental irregularities in the course of manufacture pursued, has
been exhibited occasionally by gun-cotton obtained from the manu
factories at Hirtenberg and Stowmarket.
    The composition of gun-cotton has been made the subject of a
very extensive series of experiments, both analytical and synthetical.
The material employed in the analytical researches consisted of ordi
nary products of manufacture, prepared at Waltham Abbey, and

146                  I           Royal Society          :—
obtained from Hirtenberg and Stowmarket.       The general analytical
results are as follows :—
    Air-dry gun-cotton contains very uniformly about two er cent.
of water, which proportion it reabsorbs rapidly from t e atmo
 sphere after desiccation.           If
                               exposed to a moist con<U+FB01>ned atmosphere,
 it will gradually absorb as much as six per cent. of water; but it
"rarely
         retains more than two per cent. upon re-exposure to open air.
    The mineral constituents of gun-cotton vary according to the
quality of the water employed in its puri<U+FB01>cation.    The average pro
portion of ash furnished by gun-cotton prepared at Waltham Abbey,
where the water used is hard, amounts to one per cent. It should
                                  “
be observed that the process of silicating” the gun-cotton, which
  prescribed by Von Lenk, but the value of which
_is

has been applied at Waltham Abbey only        in  special experimental
operations.   Its use naturally adds to the mineral   constituents con
tained in the <U+FB01>nished products.
   The proportions of matters soluble in alcohol alone, and in mix
                                              to he remarkably uniform
tures of alcohol and ether, were found
 vinproducts  of manufacture  obtained  by  strictly  following You Lenk’s
directions.    In the ordinary products from Waltham Abbey, the

 consists of one or more of the lower products obtained by the action
 of nitric acid upon cotton-wool, the existence of which was esta
 blished   byHadow.    The causes of the invariable production of small
 proportions of these substances in the ordinary manufacturing 0pc?
 rations, and of their existence in larger quantities in exceptional
 instances, have been carefully examined into.            Their absolute re
 moval from specimens of gun-cotton, puri<U+FB01>ed for analytical purposes,
 was found to be almost impossible.
    The methods employed for determining the proportions of carbon,
 hydrogen, and nitrogen in gun-cotton, and the relative proportions of
 carbonic acid and nitrogen furnished by its combustion, have been very
 carefully tested.  Four different methods of determining the carbon
 were employed, and forty-nine successful estimations of that element
 have been accomplished in      variety of products of manufacture.

 direct estimations of the volumes of nitrogen furnished by the
 complete oxidation of gun-cotton, have been made.           The indi

    v"I‘hedeterminations of the comparative volumes of carbonic acid and
    nitrogen have furnished results closely in accordance with those of
    the direct determination of nitrogen.
       Since the specimens of gun-cotton analyzed'always retained small
    quantities of the products soluble in ether and alcohol, it was to
    be expected that the proportion of nitrogen found would be slightly
     below, and consequently that the carbon-results would be somewhat
    above, those which the chemically pure substance should furnish.
    The variations exhibited by the analytical results do not exceed such
    .as are ascribable to the above cause.                                   .
         A number of eXperiments were instituted with Hadow’s method of
    determining the composition of gun-cotton, which consists in re
    ducing the latter to cotton by means of potassic sulphydride.         The
    results show that, although the method is useful for controlling the
     results obtained, by determining the increase of weight which cotton
     sustains by treatment with nitric acid, it does not afford suf<U+FB01>ciently
     de<U+FB01>nite and trustworthy data to render it applicable as a method of
     ascertaining the degree of perfection of manufacturing products,        2'.

     increase of weight varying between 81'8 and 82'5 upon 100 parts
     of cotton, if    submitted for 24-48 hours to treatment with        avery
     considerable excess (about 50 parts to of cotton) of the acid mixture.
                                             1
     Similar results may also be obtained by repeatedly treating the same
     sample of cotton for comparatively brief periods with fresh quantities
     of acid, provided this treatment be not too greatly prolonged.
     Lower results (somewhat above or below 78 upon 100 parts of
     cotton) are obtained  if   the cotton be submitted to treatment with          a
     large excess of acid for only brief or for very protracted periods, or
     if be left for about 24 hours in contact with comparatively limited

      results furnished by carefully puri<U+FB01>ed cotton-wool, and the number
      83'3, are to be principally ascribed to the small proportions of foreign

   “ Experimental Researches in Magnetism and Electricity-.”-Part                      I.
 By H. Wilde, Esq.
   This paper    divided into two' sections,—the <U+FB01>rst being on some

 new and paradoxical phenomena in electro-magnetic induction, and its
 relation to the principle of the conservation of physical force       the       ;
  second on  a   new and powerful generator of dynamic electricity.
     The author de<U+FB01>nes the principle of the conservation of force to
 be the de<U+FB01>nite quantitative relation existing between all phenomena
  whatsoever;     and in the particular application of the principle to
  the                 of physical science and the mechanical arts, certain
       advancement
  problems    are pointed out which, in their solution, bring out results
  as surprising as they are paradoxical.    Although, when rightly inter
  preted, the results obtained are in strict accordance with the prin
  ciple. of conservation, yet they are, at the same time, contrary to
 .the inferences which are generally drawn from analogical reason

  Mr. H.    VVilde’s Researches in Magnetism and Electricity.           149
ings, and to some of those maxims which philosophers propound

 for the consideration of others.
     The author directs attention to some new and paradoxical pheno
 mena arising out of Faraday’s important discovery of magneto
 electric induction, the close consideration of which has resulted in
 the discovery of a means of producing dynamic electricity in quantities
 unattainable by any apparatus hitherto constructed.           He has found
 that an inde<U+FB01>nitely small amount of magnetism, or of dynamic elec
tricity, is capable of inducing an inde<U+FB01>nitely large amount of magne
 tism,—and again, that an inde<U+FB01>nitely small amount of dynamic
 electricity, or of magnetism, is capable of evolving an inde<U+FB01>nitely
 large amount of dynamic electricity.
      The apparatus with which the experiments were made consisted
  of a compound hollow cylinder of brass and iron, termed by the
  author a magnet-cylinder, the internal diameter of which was              19;
  inch.    On this cylinder could be placed, at pleasure, one or more
  permanent horseshoe magnets.          Each of these permanent magnets
  weighed about        1b., and would sustain      weight of about 10 lbs.
                                               in a
                   1
  An armature was made to revolve rapidly           the interior of the cylin
  der, in close proximity to its sides, but without touching.         Around
  this armature 163 feet of insulated copper wire was coiled, 003
  of an inch in diameter, and the free ends of the wire were connected
  with commutator <U+FB01>xed upon the armature-axis, for the purpose
      a
   of taking the alternating waves of electricity from the machine in
  one direction only.     The direct current of» electricity was then trans
  mitted through the coils of tangent galvanometer and as each addi
                                a                       ;
  tional magnet was placed upon the magnet-cylinder,          it   was found
  that the quantity of electricity generated in the coils of the armature
  was very nearly in direct proportion to the number of magnets on
  the cylinder.
      Experiments were then made for the purpose of ascertaining what
   relation existed between the sustaining-power of the permanent mag—
   nets of the magnet-cylinder, and that of an electro-magnet excited
   by the electricity derived from the armature.
                                                                        '
      When four permanent magnets capable of sustaining collectively        a
   weight of 40 lbs. were placed upon the cylinder, and when the sub
   magnet was placed in metallic contact with the poles of the elec
   tro-magnet, a    weight of 178 lbs. was required to separate them.
   With larger electro-magnet
        a                           a  weight of not less than 1080 lbs.
   was required to overcome the attractive force of the electro-magnet,
    or twenty-seven times the weight which the four permanent magnets
   used in exciting    itwere collectively able to sustain.     It was further
   found that this great difference between the power of       a    permanent
   magnet and that of an electro-magnet excited through its agency
    might be inde<U+FB01>nitely increased.
       Experiments were then made with electro-magnets of various sizes,
    for the purpose of ascertaining the cause of these paradoxical results.
       When the wires 'forming the polar terminals of the magneto
   electric machine were connected for   a    short time with those of very
                                                                       a

  electric machine had been broken. Hence it is inferred that an electroi
  magnet possesses the power of accumulating and retaining a charge.
  of electricity in a manner analogous to, but not identical with, that
  in which it is retained in insulated submarine cables, and in the
   Leyden jar.     It was also found that the electro-helices offered a
  temporary resistance to the passage of the current from the magneto
  electric machine.     When four magnets were placed on the cylinder,
  the current from the machine did not attain a permanent degree of
  intensity until an interval of <U+FB01>fteen seconds had elapsed; but when
  a more powerful machine was used for exciting the electro-helices,
  the current attained a permanent degree of intensity after an interval
                                                                       '
  of four seconds had elapsed.
      The general conclusion which is drawn by the author from a con
  sideration of these experiments is, that when an electro-magnet is
 excited through the agency of a permanent magnet, the large amount
 of magnetism manifested in the electro-magnet, simultaneously with
 the small amount manifested in the permanent magnet, is the con
 stant accompaniment of a correlative amount of electricity evolved
 from the magneto-electric machine, either all at once, in a large
 quantity, or by a continuous succession of small quantities,—the
 power which the metals (but more particularly iron) posses of accu
 mulating and retaining a temporary charge of electricity, or of mag-.
 netism, or of both together (according to the mode in which these
 forces are viewed by physicists), giving rise to the paradoxical phe
 nomena which form the subject of this part of the investigation.
     Having established the fact that a large amount of magnetism
 can be developed in an electro-magnet by means of a permanent
 magnet of much smaller power, it appeared reasonable to the author
 to suppose that a large electro-magnet excited by means of a small
 magneto-electric machine could, by suitable arrangements, be made
instrumental in evolving a proportionately large amount of dynamic
 electricity.
     Two magnet-cylinders were therefore made, having a bore of 2%
inches, and a length of 12-} inches or <U+FB01>ve times the diameter of the
bore.
     As frequent mention is made of the different-sized machines ems
ployed in these investigations, they are distinguished by the calibre,
or bore of the magnet-cylinders.
 _ Each cylinder was <U+FB01>tted with an armature, round which was coiled
an insulated strand of copper wire 67 feet in length, and 0'15 of an
inch in diameter.       Upon one of the magnet-cylinders sixteen per
manent magnets were <U+FB01>xed, and to the sides of the other magnet
cylinder was bolted an electro-magnet formed of two rectangular
pieces of boiler-plate enveloped with coils of insulated copper wire.
The armatures of the 2%-inch magneto-electric and electro-magnetic
machines were driven simultaneously at an equal velocity of 2500
revolutions per minute.       When the electricity from the magneto
electric machine was transmitted through a piece of No. 20 iron
wire 0'04 of an inch in diameter, a length of 3 inches of this wire
was made red-hot.       When the direct current from the magneto-elec
tric machine was transmitted through the coils of the electro-mag

    Mr. H. Wilde’s   Researches in Magnetism and Electricity.          151
net vof the electro-magnetic machine, the electricity from the latter
melted 8 inches of the same-sized iron wire as was used in the pres
ceding experiment, and a length of 24 inches was made red-hot.
    When the electro-magnet of a 5-inch machine was excited by the'
2—}-inch magneto-electric machine,, the electricity from the 5-inch
electro-magnetic machine melted 15 inches of No. 15 iron wire 0075‘  '
of an inch in diameter.                                    _
     The author having found that an increase in the dimensions of
the machines was accompanied by a proportionate and satisfactory
increase of the magnetic and electric forces, a 10-inch electro-mag
netic machine was constructed: the weight of its electro-magnetis
nearly 3 tons, and the total weight of the machine is about 4% tons.
The machine is furnished with two armatures—one for the produc
tion of “ intensity”-, and the other for the production of “ quantity”~
effects.
  '
    The intensity armature is coiled with an insulated conductor con
sisting of a bundle of thirteen No.    II copper wires, each 0125 of an‘
inch in diameter. The coil is 376 feet in length, and weighs 232 lbs.
    The quantity armature is enveloped with the folds of an insulated
copper-plate conductor 67 feet in length, the weight of which is
344 lbs.     These armatures are driven at a uniform velocity of 1500'
revolutions per minute, by means of a broad leather belt of the strong
est description.
    When the direct current from the l%-inch magneto-electric ma
chine, having on its cylinder six permanent magnets, was trans;
mitted through the coils of the electro-magnet of the 5-inch electro
magnetic machine, and when the direct current from the latter was‘
simultaneously, and in like manner, transmitted through the coils of
the electro-magnet of the l0-inch machine, an amount of magnetic
force was developed in the large electro-magnet far exceeding any;
thing which has hitherto been produced, accompanied by the evolu
tion of an amount of d namic electricity from the quantity armature
 so enormous as to met pieces of cylindrical iron rod 15 inches in"
 length, and fully one-quarter of an inch in diameter. With the same
arrangement, the electricity from the quantity armature also melted
 15 inches of No. 11 copper wire 0'125 of an inch in diameter.
     When the intensity armature was placed in the magnet cylinder,
 the electricity from it melted 7 feet of No. 16 iron wire 0'065 of an
 inch in diameter, and made a length of 21 feet of the same wire red-hot.
     The illuminating power of the electricity from the intensity arma
 ture is, as might be expected, of the most splendid description. When

  posed for a period of one minute to the direct rays of the sun, at
  noon, on a very clear day in the month of March.
      The extraordinary calori<U+FB01>c and illuminating powers of the lO-inch
   machine are all the more remarkable from the fact that they have
  their origin in six small permanent magnets, weighing only 1 lb. each,
  and only capable, at most, of sustaining collectively a weight of 60
  lbs.; while the electricity from the magneto-electric machine em
  ployed in exciting the electro-magnet was of itself incapable of heat
  ing to redness the shortest length of iron wire of the smallest size
  manufactured.
     The production of so large an amount of electricity was only ob
  tained (as might have been anticipated by the physicist) by a cor
  respondingly large amount of mechanical force; for it was found
  that the large electro-magnet could be excited to such a degree that
  the strong leather belt was scarcely able to drive the machine.
     When the electro-magnet of the 10-inch machine was excited by
  means of the 2%-inch magneto-electric machine alone, about two
  thirds of the maximum amount of power from the 10-inch machine
  was obtained.
     From a consideration of the combined action of the magneto
  electric and electro-magnetic machines, the author points out a re
  markable analogy, subsisting between the operation of the static
  forces of magnetism and of cohesion in modifying dynamical phe
  nomena, which throws additional light upon the nature of the mag
  netic force.
     On reviewing and comparing the whole of the analogous phe
  nomena manifested in the operation of the magnetic and cohesive
  forces under the varied conditions to which the author invites atten
  tion, it appears to him that magnetism is a mode of the force of
  cohesion, or is, if the term be allowed, polar cohesion acting at sea
  sible distances, the equivalent of magnetic force being obtained at
  the expense of an equivalent of ordinary cohesive force (in an axial
  direction) so long as the iron continues to be magnetized.

     The following communications were read :
      1. “ Notes on the Geology of Mount Sinai.”            By the Rev. F.
  W. Holland.
     The physical features of the peninsula were described as exhibit
  ing in the north an extensive tableland of limestone of Cretaceous
   age, supported and enclosed on the south by a long range of moun
  tains composed of syenite, porphyrics, and schistose rocks.          Near
  Jebel Serbal is a mountain of Nummulitic limestone; and a lime
  stone, apparently of more recent date, occurs near Tor and Has
  Mohammad.       The author further stated that in some parts of the
  peninsula the sycnitic mountains are capped by horizontal beds
  of sandstone of considerable thickness,        'which   are unaltered at

       Mr. H. \Voodward     an  'th oldest known  British Crab.     153
their contact with the syenite. This sandstone formed-the great
mining district of the Egyptians in Sinai, and is now worked for
turyuoises, which appear to occur more or less in veins.         Raised
beaches were discovered by the author, on the western        side of the
peninsula, at elevations of from 20 to 30 feet.
    2. “ On anew genus of Phyllopodous Crustacea from the Mo<U+FB01>'at
 Shales (Lower Silurian), Dumfriesshire.”        By Henry Woodward,
Esq., F.G.S., F.Z.S.
    The fossil described consists of the disk-shaped shield, or cara
pace, of an Apus-like Crustacean, the nearest known form to it being
Peltocuris aptycbuides, Salter, from which, however, it is at once
distinguished by the absence of a dorsal furrow.
    A line of suture divides the wedge-shaped rostral portion of the
shield from the rest of the carapace, the two parts being seldom
found together.      From their strong resemblance to Discina, the
author proposed for them the generic name Discinocaris, and named
the species Browniana, after Mr. D.      J. Brown, who <U+FB01>rst drew his
attention to it.
    3. “ On the oldest known British Crab (Protocarcinus longz'pes,
Bell, MS.) from the Forest Marble of Malmesbury, Wilts.” By
 Henry Woodward, Esq., F.G.S., F.Z.S.
    The author stated that three genera and twenty-<U+FB01>ve species of
 Brachyurous Crustacea had already been described by Prof. Reuss
 and H. von Meyer from the Upper White Jura of Germany; but as
 no limbs or abdominal segments had been met with, it was more
 doubtful where to place them than the species now described,which
 had nearly all its limbs in situ. and a portion of the abdomen united.
 Protocarcinus closely resembles the common spidercrabs (the Maida:
 and Leptopodidw) living on our own coasts.
    4. “ On the species of the genus Eryon, Desm., from the Lias
 and Oolite of England and Bavaria.” By Henry Woodward, Esq.,
 F.G.S., F.Z.S.
    The genus Eryon of Desmarest was established for certain ex
 tremely broad and <U+FB02>at forms of Astacidw found in the Solenhofen
 limestone near Munich, and <U+FB01>rst described in 1757.        The late Dr.
 Oppel has recorded fourteen species, two of which, E. Barrovensis
 and E. (Goleia) antiguus, are from the Lias of England.     Mr. wood—
 ward gave descriptions and <U+FB01>gures of E. Barrovensis, M‘Coy, and
 <U+FB01>ve other species, namely, E. crassiclzelis, E. Wilmcotensis, and E.
 Brodiei, from the Lower Lias; E. Moorei, from the Upper Lias of
 Ilminster; and. E. Oppeli, from the Lithographic stone of Solen
 hofen.

 Lingula-<U+FB02>ags in the neighbourhood of Tyddynglwadis Silver- lead_
 Mine.”     By J. Plant, Esq., F.G.S.                        -
    The discoveries described in this paper includcd the <U+FB01>nding of
  Paradowiales near the second adit of the Tyddynglwadis mine, in the
  Lower Lingula-beds, and subsequently of further specimens in the
  neighbourhood, associated with fragments of Anopolenus and Theca.

Mr. E. Williamson      had proved the correctness of their opinion that
the strata at Tyddynglwadis belong to the Primordial zone, and
that, within a limited area extending east from the boundary line of
the Lower Cambrian grits, the rocks ought to yield a series of
fossils of Primordial types.        This examination had also enabled
them to draw a section extending from the junction of the Lower

   The following communications were read :—
   l. “ On the     Metamorphic      and Fossiliferous      Rocks of the Co.
Galway.”        By Prof. R. Harkness, F.R.S., F.G.S.
   A great portion of the area under consideration was described as
being occupied by contorted gneissose rocks, striking east and west,
with a prevailing southerly dip towards the granitic area of Galway
Bay. Quartzose rocks exhibiting great folds give rise to the bold
mountainous scenery of Connemara; and reposing on these, and
passing underneath the gneissic strata, is a band of serpentinous
limestone, the structure of which is not of animal origin, but results
solely from mineral association.         The gneissose rocks on the north
are covered unconformably by sandstones, the fossils of which indi
cate the horizon of the Upper Llandovery Rocks. These meta
morphic rocks correspond with those of the Highlands of Scotland,
representing the Upper Quartz rocks, Upper Limestone, and Upper
Gneiss, the positions of which are known in consequence of the
Lower Limestones at Durness having been determined to be not
lower than the Llandeilo Flags.
   2. “ On the Metamorphic Lower Silurian Rocks of Carrick, Ayr
shire.”    By J. Geikie, Esq.
   In surveying the southern district of Ayrshire, the author and his
colleagues recognized the metamorphic character of certain Diorites,
Serpentines, and crystalline telepathic rocks independently of each
other; and Mr.     J. Geikie had also been enabled to trace passages
between the various altered rocks, which seemed to him to throw
light upon the obscure process of metamorphic action.                      In this
paper he <U+FB01>rst gave a generalized description of the metamorphic
strata, dividing them into four groups—namely
Rocks, (2) Diorites, (3) Serpentines, and (4) Altered Limestone
                                                               (l)     Felspathic
and Calcareous Greywacke,——and again subdividing the Felspathic
rocks into Amygdaloid,       Porphyry, Breccia-form rocks, and <U+FB01>nely
crystalline Felstones, and the Serpentine into Schistose and Com
pact.    He also described the association of serpentine with diorite;

           Prof. Williamson    oh a Ckéirotkerian Footprint.         155
 and stated that the only igneous rocks of the district, consisting of
 arfew dykes of felstoneand greenstone,.iar.e of much later date. than
 the metamorphism, and have not altered the strata in contact with
 them.     These and other facts described in the paper had enabled
 him    to arrive at the following conclusions :—(1) That the strata
 owe their metamorphism to hydrothermal action.             (2) That the
  varying mineralogical character of the rocks is due principally to
  original di<U+FB02>'erences of chemical composition, and not to in<U+FB01>ltration
  of foreign matter at the time of metamorphism.            (3) That the.
 highly alkaline portions of the strata have been most susceptible
 .of change.     (4) That in beds having the same composition, but
  exhibiting various degrees of alteration, the intensity of the meta
 morphism has been in direct proportion to the amount of water
 present in the strata.    (5) That in some places the rocks have been
 reduced to a pasty condition.
  _  3. “ On a Cheirotherian Footprint from the base of the Keuper
  Sandstone of DaresburyLCheshire.”        By W. C. Williamson, Esq.,
 F R.S., Professor of Natural History, Anatomy, and Physiology in
  Owens College, Manchester.
     The specimen in question was discovered by Mr.      J.  W. Kirkham,
  in the Lower Keuper Sandstone at Daresbury Quarry. It differs
  from all footprints hitherto obtained from this district, in being
  more quadrate, and distinctly that of a scaly animal; the separated
  toe is also less recurved, and approaches nearer to the other_toes.
  The arrangement of the scales corresponds very closely with that
  seen in the foot of the living Alligator; many of them run across
  the foot in oblique lines, as is common amongst living Crocodilians,
  leaving no room to doubt that they represent true scales, and not'
  irregular tubercles, such as are seen on the skin of some Batrachians.
  Traces of other impressions of feet occur on the slab, particularly an
  imperfect one with much larger and more oblong scales, especially
.under the heel; and this difference is so very similar to what is seen
  in the fore and hind feet of many Saurians, that Prof. Williamson
  believed that they did not belong to a Batrachian animal at all, but
  that they were Saurian, if not Crocodilian, in every feature.            -
     4. “  A description -of-sdme remarkable ‘Heaves' or Throws in
  Penhalls-Mine.”      By J. W. Pike, Esq.
     This mine is situated in the parish of St. Agnes, in Cornwall,
  and is, from the extraordinary dislocations and heaves of the lodes
   and veins, without a-parallel in any other part of the county.       In
  the immediate neighbourhood of the workings, taking the well
  known law that a lode or vein traversed is older than the one tra
  versing it, there are, in the order of formation, (1) four or <U+FB01>ve tin
  lodes, (2) three or four “ Downright” lodes, (3) innumerable
  “gossans,” (4)1a- great number of slides or faults, dipping at
  various angles, (5) four cross courses, and (6) certain Caunting
  slides.  .The mineral productiveness of the tin-lodes is increased by
  the proximity of the gossans, but not by that of the slides; and
  although the dislocations are most perplexing to the miner, the district
  has yielded great riches, and has been worked from time immemorial.'

ON    THE COMPARATIVE        VISIBILITY or ARAGO’S, BABINET’S, AND
            BREWSTER’S NEUTRAL POINTS.                BY MR. CHASE.
       my communication of January 5, I stated that when Brewster’s
IN   neutral point is above the horizon, I had frequently determined its
position with great ease.       My experience was so di<U+FB01>'erent from those
of Brewster and Babinet, thatl commenced on the 6th of March
a series of comparative observations upon the three neutral points.
The month which has just ended appears to warrant the following
conclusions for stations in Philadelphia and its vicinity.                 The <U+FB01>rst,
second, and sixth seem to be con<U+FB01>rmed by observations elsewhere,
while the third, fourth, and <U+FB01>fth, which are perhaps dependent
partly upon local atmospheric peculiarities, have never, so far as                    I
am aware, hitherto been noticed.
    I. Arago’s neutral point often assumes a distinctness which is
never exhibited by either of the others, merely because the polarized
bands in the vicinity of the sun are obscured by the dazzling bril
liancy of its rays.
   2. Forthesamereason, Bahinet’sneutralpointis oftenbetterde<U+FB01>nedin
the morning and evening thanBrewster’s during the middle of the day.
    3. But when Brewster’s and Babinet’s neutral points are both
above the horizon, if the sky is clear, the former is generally more
easily posited than the latter.        This is especially the case at midday.
    4. On every clear day, and on a large portion of the days which
are partially obscured by clouds, the position of each of the neutral
points can be determined.        Brewster records but two days during
<U+FB01>ve years’ observations (Phil. Mag. S. 4. vol. xxx. p. 124), upon
which he saw all the points.
    5. Arago’s neutral point often rises before Brewster's sets. Under
favourable atmospheric conditions the three points are, therefore,
sometimes simultaneously visible.
    6. Halos and clouds are frequently discernible through the polari
scope which are invisible to the naked eye.
    The following abstract embodies some of the results of the month’s
observations :-——                                                               Days_

cessary hypothesis that a <U+FB02>uid is absolutely continuous".         Conceive
the contraction to be continued until all the matter of the supposed
spherical earth is concentrated at its centre, and we formally as well
as substantially have the case discussed by Ostrogradsky.            About
that   centre  describe    geometrically  a  sphere passing through  one   of
the points of contact of the particles situate on the inner surface of
the liquid vault.       Then, from the symmetry of the arrangement,
we know that the geometrical sphere will pass through all the points
of contact of all the particles situated on that surface, and all the
points of contact of any one particle will he in one plane.             In a
plane, through the points of contact, draw geometrical tangents at
all the points of contact of any one particle with all the adjacent
particles.    Then the symmetry of the supposed arrangement shows
that the closed <U+FB01>gure so formed will be a regular (equilateral and
equiangular) polygon.         And that symmetry further indicates that
each particle will afford the construction of a similar polygon, that
all the polygons so formed are equal, and that each side of each p0,
lygon is common to two adjacent particles, and forms the edge of a
regular polyhedron.        But we know that there are only <U+FB01>ve regular
solids or polyhedra,—namely, the regular pyramid (or tetrahedron),
bounded by four equal and equilateral triangles ; the cube (or hex-ahe
 dron) , by six squares; the octahedron, by eight equal and equilateral
 triangles; the dodecahedron, by twelve equal and equilateral penta
 gons; and the icosahedron, by twenty equal and equilateral triangles.
 Consequently, however we adjust the magnitude of the spherical
balls 0r particles in reference to that of the geometrical sphere, if we
require a system of balls such that each ball shall be capable of being
 placed in contact with the adjacent balls while each shall be equidis
 tant from the centre of the geometrical sphere, we are restricted to
 systems of four, six, eight, twelve, and twenty balls, each touching
 the others of the same system as follows: viz. three others in the
 system“of four, four others in the system of six, three others in that
 of eight, <U+FB01>ve others in that of twelve, and three others in that of
 twenty.     A case of <U+FB02>uid equilibrium which can only occur where the
 particles of the fluid do not exceed twenty in number, can scarcely
 be held to affect the fundamental principle of hydrostatics.            And
 the fact that while the number of regular polygons is unlimited,
 that of the regular polyhedra is limited, destroys (except in the pan
 ticular instances just adverted to) the analogy between aline or circle
 of particles in equilibrium and a sphere of like particles in equilibrium,
 and prevents it from being urged in support of the new hydrostatical
 paradox.     I do not at present call to mind any investigations in which
 a perfect continuity of the <U+FB02>uid is assumed, unless probably in some
 of those of Professor Challis of Cambridge.         But even if I am right
 in thinking that he has assumed it, all the ends that he had in view
 would probably be equally well served by changing the assumption
 to that of particles or distances in<U+FB01>nitesimally small in comparison
 with the particles whose motion is discussed, or the mutual distances
 of the latter particles. At all events an hypothesis assumed for a spe
 cial purpose ought not to in<U+FB02>uence the present discussion, unless it
 explains phenomena to be explained in no other way.—Queensland

EONTRIBUTIONS TOWARDS THE MORE ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF
     THEIHENOMENA 0F FLUORESCENCE.               BY DR. VICTOR PIERRE
     OF PRAG.
     The results of this investigation are as follows :—
     (1) That the property of exciting <U+FB02>uorescence is not con<U+FB01>ned to
the most refrangible rays of the spectrum, but that rays of any wave
length can in general excite <U+FB02>uorescence.
     (2) There is for each substance a de<U+FB01>nite prismatic colour in
which <U+FB02>uorescence <U+FB01>rst occurs, so that all colours less refrangible
than this produce no <U+FB02>uorescence.
   -
     (3) It is seldom that this colour is the one which produces the
most intense <U+FB02>uorescence; generally it is the next more refrangible
rays, but always de<U+FB01>nite rays for a de<U+FB01>nite substance.
     (4) If rays of a de<U+FB01>nite colour, that is, of de<U+FB01>nite wave-length
and time of vibration, evoke <U+FB02>uorescence in a substance, not only
are rays produced of greater time of vibration than those of the ex
citing rays, but the rays produced by <U+FB02>uorescence are, for each sub
 stance, always the same, whatever be the duration of vibration of
the producing ray.                           ~
     (5)  The  wave-lengths   of the  rays produced by <U+FB02>uorescence do
not always gradually shade into one another, but there are occasion
ally jumps, so that rays of a certain length are not developed, in
which case the spectrum of the <U+FB02>uorescence-colour is traversed by
dark lines; this phenomenon also is independent of the wave-length
(direction of vibration) of the exciting rays.
     (6) Among the new rays resulting from <U+FB02>uorescence, those are
always the most intense whose wave-length is either equal, or very
nearly equal, to that of the rays in which <U+FB02>uorescence <U+FB01>rst occurs;
 in the latter case, however, it is always larger than that correspond
 ing to the beginning of the <U+FB02>uorescence.
     (7) In substances which <U+FB02>uoresce in solution, in case they are
 soluble in different agents, the solvent occasionally in<U+FB02>uences the
 character of the <U+FB02>uorescence, so that, dissolved in different solvents,
 the same substance <U+FB02>uoresees di<U+FB02>'erently.          In one and the same
 solvent the concentration of the solution only affects the intensity
 of the <U+FB02>uorescence, but leaves its character unaltered.      Above. and
 below that degree of concentration which makes the phenomenon of
 <U+FB02>uorescence most intense, the intensity of the <U+FB02>uorescence in all
 parts of the spectrum in which it is at all developed appears to de
 crease in almost the same ratio; so that with the feeblest develop
 ment it is distinctly perceptible only in the position of the maximum.
      (8) The occurrence of one <U+FB02>uorescing substance with other <U+FB02>uo
 rescing or non-<U+FB02>uorescing substances exercises very different effects
  on the character of the <U+FB02>uorescence; in many cases it undergoes no
  change, but in others it is entirely altered.       If many <U+FB02>uorescent
  substances are mixed together, acompound <U+FB02>uorescence is produced,
  the colour of which, in diffused day- or in direct sunlight, may be
  very di<U+FB01>'erent although the same substances are in both cases mixed
  together;    If the various <U+FB02>uorescent substances do not act on each
  other so as to alter their <U+FB02>uorescences, such a compound <U+FB02>uores
  cence may always be resolved into the simple <U+FB02>uorescences of those
  substances which are contained in the mixture; and so far the

   160              Inlelligence and Miscellaneous        Articles.
   presence of certain substances may be detected by <U+FB02>uorescence in a
  mixture of different substances, but not in the opposite case.
       (9) There are substances which become strongly <U+FB02>uorescent by
   the addition of acids, and others by the addition of alkalies : in these
   cases it is immaterial which acid or which alkali is used; the cha~
  meter of the <U+FB02>uorescence is always the same'.               (Hydrochloric and
  hydriodic acid form an exception, as they destroy <U+FB02>uorescence.)
      (10) The light of arti<U+FB01>cial sources, or such as has passed through
  coloured media, occasionally produces changes in the <U+FB02>uorescence
  compared with that of the sunlight, inasmuch as the commencement
  and maximum <U+FB02>uorescence may fall at other parts of the spectrum.
           Connexion between Fluorescence and Phosphorescence.
      It was of some interest to include in my investigations the phe
  nomena of phosphorescence which are so markedly developed by the
  sulphides of the different earth-metals; and I used for this purpose
  preparations partly obtained from Albert in Frankfort, and partly
 from Lenoir in Vienna.
     1f the prismatic spectrum is projected on one of these phospho
 rescent bodies, the phenomena are the same as with <U+FB02>uorescent
 bodies.     Phosphorescence begins sometimes in the visible, some
 times in the ultra-violet rays—in short, in different preparations, in
  different parts of the same spectrum; it has also a maximum (in
  some substances 1 found two maxima), and the colour of “the light
 of phosphorescence is the same in the entire extent of the part of the
 spectrum which excites phosphorescence.              If a linear spectrum pro
jected upon such a body be analyzed by a prism, 21derived spectrum
 is also obtained, which in its principal features has the same appear
 ance as that of a <U+FB02>uorescent substance; but the uneven rough sur
 face of this body permits no pure spectrum; a good deal of light is
 always irregularly scattered, owing to which it was impossible to
 ascertain with certainty whether there is not here something analo
 gous with compound <U+FB02>uorescence; I imagine that in some of the
substances examined something of that kind is the case.                    The
entire appearance which a phosphorescent body o<U+FB02>’ers in the pri..
matic spectrum is so completely the same as in a <U+FB02>uorescent one,
that from this appearance alone it could not at all be decided
whether it was a case of <U+FB02>uorescence or of phosphorescence; the
difference of the two phenomena consists only in the fact that <U+FB02>uo
rescence immediately disappears if the incident light is cut off,
while phosphorescence continues in this case, though it quickly
diminishes in intensity; the phenomena occur just as with a <U+FB02>uores
cent liquid in which the concentration is altered to the disappear
ance of <U+FB02>uorescence.         The phenomena is <U+FB01>rst imperceptible at the
side of the commencement and in the ultra-violet,                and is <U+FB01>nally
only perceptible at the positions of maximum.               Thus I agree with
the statement of Becquerel, that <U+FB02>uorescence and phosphorescence
are only distinguished by their duration, inasmuch as the former is
at once extinguished with the cessation of the exciting rays, while
the latter continues—Wiener Bnrichte, May 11,

    * This
             deportment is, in a certain sense, analogous to that of coloured
transparent media, which change their colour by the addition of acids or
alkalies.
             In this also the resulting mixture is independent of the nature of
the acid or base added.

   F.R.S.*
I  N    the Philosophical Magazine for May, there appeared a trans
       lation of a paper “ On the Unit of Electrical Resistance
Dr. Werner Siemens, containing views much at variance with the
                                                                   ”

conclusions of the British-Association Electrical-Standard Com
mittee, and referring frequently to the part      I have taken in sup
porting those conclusions. Dr. Siemens enjoys so high a repu
               I
tation, that am anxious to answer his arguments directly, in
stead of simply referring, as     I might do, to the Reports of the
Committee, where most of the points have,        I  think, been already
met.
   Dr. Siemens has treated of several very distinct questions,
which might be divided as follows :—
    (1) What is the best unit of electrical resistance?
   (2) What is the best method of making and reproducing any
unit  ?
    (3) Have Dr. Siemens’s proposals and labours met with fair
consideration and full acknowledgment by the Committee and by
myself i’
   As to the <U+FB01>rst point, Dr. Siemens supports as unit the resist
ance of a prism of mercury 1 metre long and 1 square millimetre
section at 0° C., or a million times the resistance of a cubic metre
of mercury at 0°.
   The British-Association Committee propose as unit ten million
times the absolute electromagnetic unit, or metre per second, as

 162            Mr. F. Jenkin   on the Question of  the
 determined bya Subcommittee consisting of Professor Thomson,
Professor Maxwell, Mr. Balfour Stewart, and myself.
    The arguments in favour of one or the other of these units
 should be kept quite distinct from those in favour of the best ma
terials for the reproduction or manufacture of material standards.
 If mercury be the best material for a permanent standard, any
 unit can be made of mercury. If mercury be the best material for
reproducing a standard, then when the speci<U+FB01>c resistance of pure
mercuryjn any unit has been determined, mercury can be used
for the reproduction of that unit.     Conversely, if Dr. Siemens’s
be the best de<U+FB01>nition for a unit of resistance upon some inde
pendent grounds, then the fact that mercury was a bad substance
for constructing or reproducing the unit might not even weaken
the arguments in favour of his de<U+FB01>nition.
    Now, apart from the question of manufacture and reproduc
tion, why should a mercury unit be chosen '3     I see no arguments
in Dr. Siemens’s paper in favour of his own de<U+FB01>nition, except
perhaps the statement that
                              “ mercury is the conductor which is
without doubt the best suitedto serve as unitof conducting-power.”
   Dr. Siemens here separates conducting-power from resistance,
and seems to think that the speci<U+FB01>c conducting-powers of mate
rials should be referred to some one standard material, and that
the unit of conducting-power may be distinct from the unit of
resistance.    But conducting-power is naturally de<U+FB01>ned in calcu
lations as the reciprocal of resistance, the unit of resistance and
of conducting-power being the same ; there is therefore no need
whatever to select any substance as a unit of conducting-power,
which would indeed simply introduce confusion into mathema
tical expressions of electrical relations. The Committee have
therefore adopted Professor Thomson’s de<U+FB01>nition of the speci<U+FB01>c
conducting-power of metals as the conducting-power of the wire
of unit length and weight (being the reciprocal of the resistance
of the same wire).    In this way the numbers expressing the spe
ci<U+FB01>c properties are rendered independent of comparison with any
material whatever, whereas, on the other plan, we should always
have to ask on whose determination of mercury, silver, or gold
&c. the values given were based. Moreover Professor Thomson’s
plan is in<U+FB01>nitely more convenient in calculating from the speci<U+FB01>c
values the actual resistance, or conducting-power of any given
wire.    These considerations   absolve me from the necessity of
even considering whether, if a unit-material must be selected,        -
mercury would be the best—a question which             I nevertheless
think might not be decided af<U+FB01>rmatively.
   Dr. Siemens also claims practical advantages, but does not
state their nature.   Mercury is little used in telegraphy as com
pared with copper, German silver, or iron.

                    Unit of Electrical Resistance:                 163
      A
      metre long and square millimetre section has a symmetrical
sound;   but, except in calculating the resistance of prisms of
mercury,   Iknow of no practical advantage which it has over any
other magnitude.    A metre of pure copper weighing a gramme
would be more practically useful, for it would serve as an imme
diate term of comparison with the copper supplied for conduct
ing-wires.   A mile of iron wire, of the size generally used in tele-,
graphy,   would have a practical advantage in <U+FB01>nding the distance
of faults.     I
              could give other de<U+FB01>nitions with practical advan,
tages, but do not know of any practical advantage which has re
sulted, or could result, from a de<U+FB01>nition in terms of mercury.
   Then even in a mercury unit, no reason is assigned for prefer
ring the particular de<U+FB01>nition given to any other, such as a metre
of mercury, weighing a gramme, or contained in a tube of say
1 millimetre diameter.     I do not ask these questions as contend
ing that these de<U+FB01>nitions are better than Dr. Siemens’s, but
simply to point out the completely arbitrary nature of his de<U+FB01>
nition.
      I
     have heard in favour of that de<U+FB01>nition two arguments which,
 0 far as they go, are really in its favour.      First, that it was
coming into extensive use when the Standard Committee was
appointed; secondly, that it was at least an intelligible de<U+FB01>nition.
The <U+FB01>rst argument is based on truth, though the use of Dr. Sie
mens’s unit was by no means so general as some of his friends
suppose.     No large English telegraph company used         it,
                                                             nor has
it,
 I     believe, been at all adopted in France.       Nevertheless  I
admit that, owing to the undoubtedly excellent manufacture of
Messrs. Siemens’s resistance-coils, and the convenient arrange
ments of those coils, his unit was largely used; but this ex
tended use was not, I   think, caused by the excellence of his de
<U+FB01>nition.    People ordered coils from the most celebrated <U+FB01>rm in
Europe and took what was given them—the miles of copper
wire before 1860, and the mercury units afterwards.
   This argument, however, was fully considered         by the Com
mittee, but was overthrown     by the considerations   that changes
were yearly being made in the coils supplied, that the de<U+FB01>nition,
being wholly arbitrary and having no intrinsic merit, could not
be compared in value with an approximation to the natural unit
adopted, and that the use was        byno means so general as to
outweigh the two previous arguments.
I    next come to the question of intelligibility.   No doubt most
people think they know what      ametre of mercury of   1millimetre
section means, and comparatively few understand the de<U+FB01>nition
adopted by the Committee.       But who in practical life,-or in the
use of standards, refers to their de<U+FB01>nition? What Frenchman,
measuring the contents of    a  brick wall, thinks of the earth’s
                                 M   2

164'                   Mr: F. Jenkin   on the Queslion   of   the
diameter      what Englishman, using a foot, thinks of pendulums
              ?                                                               '1’
For practical     use the material standard, not the de<U+FB01>nition,        the
                                                                         is
  important point.
     Further than this, the apparently simple de<U+FB01>nition might lead
 to gross errors.        requires all Dr. Siemens’s skill to producea
                            It
 mercu      unit,    even he can do it.
                       if                  The attempt on the part of
 any or inary optician to produce         mercury unit would result in
                                           a
 gross discrepancies, which unfortunately might not be discovered
 until coils had been in use for years. The Committee, therefore,
 did not think the dif<U+FB01>culty of explaining the de<U+FB01>nition of their
 unit of any serious importance.
    Hitherto      have endeavoured to show that there
                  I                                                 is

 to adopt Dr. Siemens’s de<U+FB01>nition more than any other;               haveI
 now to show why any other de<U+FB01>nition should have been preferred
                                                                                    '

 these  is,that to make them exact         to make them unpractical.
                                              is
 Pure metals or speci<U+FB01>c alloys must have been adopted, and in
 practice these are never found.        Practically no two feet of cop
 per wire or miles of iron wire are alike.        There are other argu
 ments on this pointwhich will be found in previous Reports.
 I     now come to the de<U+FB01>nition adopted.           The reason of this
 adoption   was   that the  absolute or natural   units  are those which
 must necessarily be used in all mathematical calculations of the
 relations between currents and magnets, according to the exist
 ing system of the measurement of magnets.            They are, further,
 most convenient in expressing the relations between all electrical
 magnitudes themselves.         How this      done

                                        Dr. Siemens.      WVeber, Thom
 son, and Clerk Maxwell’s writings are full of examples: the ab
 solute unit      as natural an expression of electrical resistance as
                  is
the cubic metre         of capacity when the lineal metre
                         is                                      the unit
                                                                    is
of length.        It the unit which necessarily expresses resistance,
                       is
just as the cube necessarily expresses capacity.             It would as
certainly have been used in all scienti<U+FB01>c investigations (even                if
Dr. Siemens’s unit had been in universal practical use) as the cubic
metre or cubic foot are used in calculation even where the practical
measures in use may be the chopin or the gallon.               The Com
mittee, therefore, considered that'they had no choice in the mat
ter so far as de<U+FB01>nition was concerned. On the one hand there
was a   number of arbitrary de<U+FB01>nitions, on the other the natural
unit inevitably used in calculations          could their decision be
                                                   _:.
doubtful   ?

                      Unit of Electrical Resistance.                165
     So far  I have argued the matter simply on the ground of de<U+FB01>
nition.     Dr.  Siemens says that “the resistance-unit must con
sist of   a de<U+FB01>nition, or be an absolute measure, which can be at
any time and in any place reconstructed.”          I       I
                                                     think am right in
understanding these words to mean that Dr. Siemens prefers a
mere de<U+FB01>nition to any material standard whatever, even his own ,
and    I am borne out in this view by his remark, that future and
more complete determinations of his unit would become neces
sary as the exactness of physical measurements progresses ;
though he anticipates that no practical inconvenience could result
from these corrections, as they would be very small. The Com
mittee were of a diametrically opposite opinion: they thought
that the one essential quality of a standard was its invariability,
that no possible inconvenience would be equal to the continual
variation of the standard, making, as it were, the 12 inches of
today the 13 inches of tomorrow.          No doubt we all believe that
the corrections would not be so great or so frequent as this ; but
what man of science could recommend a periodical tampering
with the lengths of the standard metre to bring it more nearly
 in accordance with some abstract de<U+FB01>nition?              Such changes
would on each occasion render almost useless an inconceivable
mass of scienti<U+FB01>c labour.        For instance, all Dr. Matthiessen’s
 speci<U+FB01>c resistances of metals, recorded in Siemens’s units, would,
 since their <U+FB01>rst issue, have required two or three revisions, and
would even now be far from <U+FB01>xed.           If, therefore, we can make a
 permanent unit,     I think  any permanent unit will be better than
 any de<U+FB01>nition ;    butif  a  de<U+FB01>nition  alone is to be adhered to, the
 de<U+FB01>nition adopted by the Committee is much preferable to that
 of Dr. Siemens.
     Dr. Siemens acknowledges with perfect candour the scienti<U+FB01>c
 importance of the determination of Weber’s dynamic unit, but
 thinks that, as the determination of resistances combined with
  dynamic values rarely occurs, its general use is not of much
 practical importance. But although the combination of resist
  ances with dynamic values rarely occurs in practice, the combina
  tion of resistance with the measurement of quantity, capacity, and
  currents is of daily occurrence. The unit proposed by Dr. Siemens
  stood alone and unconnected with any of those measurements.
  The Committee have adopted a coherent system, in which the
 current will be equal to the electromotive force divided by the
  resistance, the quantity to the quantity conveyed by the unit of
  current in the second, and the capacity to the capacity which,
  when electri<U+FB01>ed by the unit electromotive force, will contain the
  real quantity.    Standards for the determination or measurement
  of all these magnitudes will be issued by the Committee. Dr.
  Siemens himself very fairly admits that in the British Associa

 166             Mr. F. Jenkin    on the Question   of the
 tion Reports the argument in favour of this coherent          system of
 measurement     is very convincingly put forward.         The mercury
 stands alone an arbitrary de<U+FB01>nition, while every one of the Com
 mittee’s units will be an approximation to the natural or mathe
 matical unit.     Now this relation between the several units is of
 practical convenience in the daily testing of submarine cables, and
 in all other electrical measurements.
     But Dr. Siemens says, <U+FB01>rst, your so-called permanent unit
 does not represent your de<U+FB01>nition even with reasonable accuracy ;
 and secondly, it will not be permanent.
    With reference to the first point, Dr. Siemens has fairly
 pointed out the great dif<U+FB01>culties of the determinations; but I
 think he also admits that the names of those who actually con-.
 ducted the experiments are some guarantee that care would be
 taken, and that the names of the Committee at large are a
 further guarantee that the results would not be adopted without
 a strong conviction that they were trustworthy.             But even if
 they were not, which     I entirely disbelieve, the B.A. unit would
 not be at all more arbitrary than Dr. Siemens’s unit, although I
 allow there would then be no reason for its adoption except its
 permanency.
    Will it then be permanent? Time alone will show whether
 any of the ten material standards will remain perfectly perma
 nent; but we have at least as good a guarantee for their per~
 manence as Dr. Siemens has for his.
    If  his 1864 issue were correct, and     I  heartily wish we could
be sure of this, the BA. unit would be equal- to 10486 metre of
mercury at 0° C. of 1 square millimetre section; and this resist
ance can be obtained     just as easily as the resistance of one metre.
If,  therefore, all our material standards vary, we are no worse off
than Dr. Siemens.       But we have what, while the present dis
crepancies    in                                   I
                 mercury-determinations exist, venture to think is
an extremely important addition to our security, in the probabi
lity of the permanence of the standards already made. We have
all Dr. Siemens has, and a great deal more.
    Every additional metal of which the speci<U+FB01>c resistance is ac
curater determined gives a fresh guarantee ,- and it is possible
that some day this method of ensuring permanence may be more
important than the mere conservation of material standards. As
yet   I think this is not so.
    To sum up the arguments hitherto used.
    The mercury unit as de<U+FB01>ned is arbitrary, varying, has no prac
tical advantage, and forms part of no coherent system of general
electrical measurements.                                   .
    The British-Association unit is based on the natural mathema
tical unit, is permanent, and has the practical advantage of form

                       Unit of Electrical Resistance.                         167
ing part of      a coherent    system for other electrical measure
ments.
    Hitherto       I
                   have argued wholly on de<U+FB01>nitions, keeping in
reserve all the questions as to how far Dr. Siemens had been
 successful in producing or reproducing his unit.         For instance,
 when above I say that the mercury unit is varying,              I
                                                              mean that
 Dr. Siemens intends that it shall vary as better and better deter
 minations are made; and when            I
                                        say that the B.A. unit is per
 manent,       I
              mean that the Committee intend it to be permanent.
I  will now consider how far some of the proposals for the ma
nufacture have been, and are likely to be, practically successful.
 In arguing this point I am quite willing to abandon all the dis
crepancies hitherto pointed out in the units supplied by Dr. Sie
mens. The important question undoubtedly                 is,
                                                           not whether
Dr. Siemens has from <U+FB01>rst to last supplied faultless mercury
units, but whether any unit can be reproduced           by given length

I  have shown that there        isno reason to adopt    ametre of mer
cury of      millimetre section as unit of resistance; but mercury

or by which to reproduce them.           am at

Dr. Siemens’s experiments are exceedingly valuable, although
they can hardly yet be said to be conclusive.         Dr. Siemens be
lieves that he can reproduce his unit (and therefore the BA.
unit) at least to within 01 per cent. of accuracy, and, when the
greatest possible care     isused, probably with an almost unlimited
exactness.‘    It would, am sure, give every member of the Com
                         I
mittee great pleasure       this fact could be fully established; but

it    not yet established.
     is                         Iadmit that the discrepancies between
the coils exhibited in 1862 have little to do with this point;
although      was informed, as
               I                 I   now believe mistakenly,         Dr. by
Esselbacb, that the difference was due to        a change in Dr. Sie
mens’s standard.        Mr. C. W. Siemens himself at the Royal
Society stated that inconvenience had been caused by             prema
                                                                     a
ture issue of coils based on an imperfect standard       ;but after Dr.
Siemens’s statements,    I  can feel no doubt that no material altera
tion has knowingly occurred in this standard.        Moreover admit  I
that errors in early determinations would only show that the re
production was not very easy, as no one now contends that             is. it
I  further allow that commercial coils cannot be accepted as
standards; also that an error in the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of mercury

168                Mr. F. Jenkin    on the Question    of the
in   no way affects this part of the question, also that an error in
the coef<U+FB01>cient of correction for the German-silver copies does not
affect the argument; but        I  do maintain that when Dr. Siemens
and Dr. Matthiessen obtain discrepant values after taking all
possible care, we must be allowed to suspend our judgment as
to which of the two have obtained the value which is most near
to truth.       According to Dr. Sicmens’s paper, making a correc
tion in his 1864 standards, as he desires, of 0287 per cent., the
BA.      unit = 1'0486 millimetre of mercury of 1 lmillimetre sec
tion at 0° C. According to Dr. Matthiessen the value is 10396.
These values are too different to allow us yet to use mercury as a
certain means of reproduction.
    As soon as one or more independent observers shall obtain
really concordant results, they will be accepted by all as a means
of checking the permanency of the material standards already
made.       Till then, I believe the best check will be found in the
comparison of the standards themselves, which can be measured
with an accuracy approximating at least to within 001 per cent.,
 and are correct within this amount, although, owing to a misun~
 derstanding and possible ambiguity of the language employed,
Dr. Siemens believed they were not even intended to be so.
     I shall not enter into the controversy between Dr. Matthiessen
 on the one hand, and Mr. Sabine and Dr. Siemens on the other*.
Dr. Matthiessen can take good care of himself, and his reputa
 tion is too high to allow us simply to accept Dr. Siemens’s results,
 differing as they do from those of the only other observer who
has made researches with similar objects in a distinct laboratory.
     Dr. Matthiessen places greater reliance on reproductions by
    *  I should, however. be lad to have an explanation       upon one     int.
Dr. Siemens gives aTable s owing that the determinations made wit two
tubes in 1859, and four tubes in 1860 and 1863, di<U+FB01>'ered less than 0'1 per
cent., and the most concordant results were obtained in the latest mea
 surements.     I venture to point out that, as I understand this statement,
 it does not prove that the determinations in 1859, 1860, and 1863 were
concordant     and gave the same unit.       It shows that the relative mea
 surements of the several tubes on the three occasions were correctly made
 within 0'1 per cent., and the relative resistances agreed with these measure
ments.      But this result would have been obtained, however di<U+FB02>'erent the
 mercury might have been on the three occasions, provided of course the
 three tubes during any comparison were <U+FB01>lled from one and the same source.
 But if by any chance impure mercury was used in 1859 and pure mercury
 in 1860, the unit as determined b the apparently concordant observations
 would be very different, and the i<U+FB01>'erence could only be detected by com
parison with a material standard assumed as permanent.        I should be glad
 to know whether this comparison was made or not; andif made, with what
 result.    Unless some such comparison has been made, we have no guarantee
 whatever that the results of the three determinations were really concord
 ant.    I do not <U+FB01>nd any mention of this comparison in Mr. Sabine’s or Dr.
 Siemens's papers ; but I may have overlooked it.

                         Unit of Electrical Resistance.               169
  lead, or by a gold-silver alloy, than on reproductions by mer
  cury ; but until Dr. Siemens, or some other competent observer,
  also obtains thoroughly concordant results with these materials,
  I   can place no reliance on any of these means of reproduction.
       Yet it cannot be denied that the ten so-called permanent
  standards may all vary, and that unless some means of reproduc
   tion be discovered before that variation takes place, the unit may
   be lost. It would therefore be of immense importance to be able
   to say with certainty that the unit is equal to a certain length
   and weight of mercury, or lead, or platinum, or any other mate
                 I
   rial; only protest that if lead, platinum, or mercury be found
   the best material for this purpose,      I  will not therefore take the
   unit length and weight’or section of that material as the unit of
   resistance.
        It is this fallacy which I have always endeavoured to expose.
   No one in the Committee has ever underrated the value of a
   chemical means of reproduction; on the contrary, money has
   been freely voted, and committees yearly appointed, having this
   sole object.     Dr. Matthiessen has been opposed to mercury, and
   to support his views has argued that at any rate hitherto the
   value of the mercury unit remained un<U+FB01>xcd—a perfectly justi<U+FB01>
   able argument, Supported by discrepancies in coils issued, though
   certainly not conclusive against the possibility of using mercury
   hereafter. But until this question is settled, the Committee have
   thought that material standards of very different materials, which
   remained unaltered in their equality, a<U+FB01>orded a fair guarantee of
'
   permanency.         Should they not remain equal, they can fall back
   on the length and weight of fresh mercury, lead, or gold-silver
    alloy which have been or may be found equal to the BA. unit.
   Thus, according to Dr. Matthiessen, the ten standards are equal
   to wires or prisms weighingl gramme per metre, and of the fol
   lowing lengths for the various materials :—
                   Lead     .   .  .  .  .    0'44307'  metre.
                   Gold-silver alloy  .  .    0'59952    ,,
                   Mercury       . .  .  .    0'076505 ,,
       We have therefore, as before said, all the guarantees Dr. M at
    thiessen can have for'    permanency, with the addition of ten mate
    rial standards.                                         ‘
       Thus, to resume, the reproduction of a standard, whatever
    that may be, by mercury or any other metal is recognized by the
    Committee as of great importance, both as an additional gua
    rantee of permanency, and in case of accidental injury,- but
    hitherto they recognize no means of reproduction by mercury or
    otherwise as established with such authority as to justify its
    formal adoption, and they see no reason to adopt a unit length

  and weight or section of any reproducing material as the unit of
  electrical resistance.
     I now come to the third and personal point, and         I enter upon
  it with great regret.       I feel that I must have unconciously
  written in a manner calculated to give annoyance, or Dr. Siemens
  could never have accused me of attacking his propositions “in
  a way not customary in scienti<U+FB01>c critiques.”           I am the more
  pained by this, as although       I have only a slight acquaintance
  with Dr. Siemens, I may acknowledge with pleasure the friend
  ship of his brother, Mr. C. W. Siemens of London.             Certainly,
 though I have had occasion to differ from Dr. Siemens, and
 have urged my arguments as forcibly as          I could,   I  never sup
 posed that he or any one would have suspected me of
                                                                  “ an in
 tention to throw a false colouring upon the value of his work ;”
 indeed I hardly know in what terms I ought to answer such an
 imputation.
     Meanwhile     I prefer to believe that Dr. Siemens will express
 regret at having in the warmth of controversy made such an
 accusation.      I  myself regret that the Report, which as Secre
 tary I had the honour to write and present in 1865, had not
 been printed before Dr. Siemens wrote his article. The following
 extract will show the feeling which animated the Committee
 and myself :—“ Thus a difference exists in Dr. Siemens’s and
 Dr. Matthiessen’s reproduction of a unit by means of mercury,
 as pointed out in last year’s Report.       It is of course probable
 that differences of this kind will in time disappear, and Dr.
 Siemens fairly points out that the discrepancy mentioned in last
 year’s Report, between coils made from a very old and those
 made from a new determination of the mercury unit, a<U+FB01>'ords no
 criterion of the accuracy with which mercury can now be used
 as a means of reproduction.         Dr. Siemens was the <U+FB01>rst person
 who produced numerous ets of coils accurately adjusted; and
 although unable to recommend the adoption of his unit of re
 sistance, the Committee once more take an opportunity of ex
 pressing their sense of the high value of Dr. Siemens’ s researches
 on the reproduction of units by means of mercury.”
    Probably if Dr. Siemens had seen this Report, his article would
 have been in some respects different. He should remember that
if many of our arguments have been directed against his pro~
position, there are two good reasons for this, inasmuch as his
units alone have been able to challenge any comparison with
those of the Committee, and he himself has hitherto alone op
posed our proposals.
    Dr. Siemens refers specially to my Report to the Royal Sui
ciety on the New Unit of Electrical Resistance. He blames me'
for using a single determination published in my Report on the

                      Unit of Electrical Resistance.                 171
Exhibition of 1862,       to force   into Tables columns headed “ Sie
                         "'
mens, Berlin” and            Siemens, London,” throws doubt on the
accuracy    of my  observation     in 1862, and says that, even if     I
made no mistake, the coils were adjusted when the art of copying
resistances was scarcely known.
    First, as to the accuracy of my observation,        I may state that
the whole of my Report on Dr. Siemens’s instruments was sub
mitted in manuscript long before publication to his Firm, in
order that any mistakes might be corrected.             The discrepancy
between the coils was specially pointed out by me verbally, with
regret that it should have been found to exist.         Messrs. Siemens
very kindly    sent   me    a number   of valuable corrections, but were
 unable to explain to my satisfaction the discrepancy between the
coils.
    I received more than one verbal explanation of that discre
pancy. Dr. Esselbach said the standard had been altered ; an
other gentleman said the coils had been touched on their return
from the Red Sea ; and it was suggested they might have altered
with time.
    In Mr. Loef<U+FB01>er’s written reply on behalf of the <U+FB01>rm, a sugges
tion was made that        I   might have observed the coils at different
temperatures.       I  pointed out that this would have required 45°
Fahrenheit as the difference between the coils, and that repeated
experiments were made, all with the same result. Messrs.Siemens
had the coils returned to them long before the publication of the
Report, and did not then deny that a discrepancy existed.
    I confess that    I believed that they had been made from dif
ferent standards; nor do I now know the true cause of their
difference.     In my belief I was strengthened by Mr. Siemens’s
statement (when the report was read at the Royal Society) that
much trouble had been caused by the premature issue of the
coils. But     I                                           I
                 entirely abandon that opinion since, understand
that Dr. Siemens states that the mercury standard has never
been sensibly changed.
   Dr. Siemens throws doubt on the accuracy of my observations
by saying that the difference given by me between the sets of
coils as 1'2 per cent. was really 1'8 per cent.; but on examina
tion he will see that the difference reported between the two
1862 coils was really 1'2 per cent., though 1'8 per cent. is
nearly the difference between one of those coils and the 1864
issue; errors of O‘l per cent. certainly did not exist in the coils
themselves, and therefore the discrepancy could not have re
sulted from the rudeness of the methods employed to adjust
them.
    Next, as to the time at which those coils were made, Messrs.
Siemens in 1862 stated that both sets exhibited were made at

 172             Mr. F. Jenkin  on the Question of the
nearly the same time; they were both extremely well adjusted,
as  I stated at that time in my Report; and‘I am not aware that
since 1862 any material advance has been made in the adjust
ments.
   I  do not quite understand whether Dr. Siemens means to state
that the coils called by me “ Siemens, London,” had been only
roughly adjusted by the method of weighing in 1859 and then
readjusted in 1862 before exhibition ; but whatever be the ease,
the two sets were equally well adjusted when exhibited, and as
good in themselves as any set of coils    I have since seen.    The
charge therefore of unfairness in publishing observations on
rude coils, made by an imperfect method, arises from some mis
take of Dr. Siemens as to the condition in which the coils were
when exhibited by the London <U+FB01>rm. Moreover let me point
out that in the Report referred to I give the values of coils
adjusted by Mr. White of Glasgow in 1859, under Prof. Thom
son’s supervision, and also exhibited in 1862.       These are, and
were, in excellent adjustment, with the exception of one coil.
They were subjected to the same treatment as to travelling and
use as Messrs. Siemens’s coils; and     I will not do Messrs. Sie
mens the injustice to suppose that in 1859, when the coils ex
hibited were <U+FB01>rst made, they knew less of the art of copying.
resistances than we did in England.                                 4
   This value of Prof. Thomson’s old unit, based on the old
1859 coils, has been repeated by me in every Table published,
although it tells against the absolute unit as a standard, about
as much as Messrs. Siemens’s old coil tells against the mercury
unit.     Similarly I  have repeated Weber’s various discrepant
determinations.
   To resume. No serious error could have occurred in my ex
periment without being corrected by Messrs. Siemens at the
time, for which they had every opportunity.     The coils were not
rudely adjusted when exhibited, nor were they even originally
made at the time when the art of copying resistances was scarcely
known.      No explanation of the di<U+FB02>'erence which could be sub
stantiated was given me, and I believed that the difference was
probably due to bad reproduction ; but I abandon that opinion
since   I  understand Dr. Siemens to say that no change in the
standard has been made.        I have only repeated their value in
Tables in which I repeated still worse discrepancies in so-ealled
absolute determinations, and in which the value of coils as old
as those of Dr. Siemens were also given.
   Dr. Siemens has himself allowed that the standard in 1864
did not, even by his experiments, truly represent his de<U+FB01>nition
within 0287 per cent.        Surely it was no unfair criticism to
 point this out ; and this is the only point urged by me in the

                     Unit of Electrical Resistance.                  173
1864 Report to the Royal Society: and even if it be conceded
that the old discrepancies gave no measure of the accuracy of
the plan of reproduction, they greatly weaken any argument
founded on the priority of Dr. Siemens’s unit, and its extended
use. One reason for repeating these various values of all units,
besides that of showing the discrepancies in those hitherto issued,
is that results have been published expressed in each unit.
    Dr. Siemens is in error in supposing that Dr. Matthiessen’s
calculation of the value of the 1862 mercury coils, as com
pared with the others, rests on the measurement of a copper
wire.                                         I
          He had been led into this error, suppose, by some am
biguity of language ; but Dr. Matthiessen’s mile of copper wire
exhibited in 1862 was a German-silver resistance-coil, as stated
in my Juror’s Report, and in the Report to the Royal Society.
This German-silver coil Dr. Matthiessen still has, and I have
the set of German-silver coils called “ Thomson’s units ” in 1862.
Both of these have remained constant in their ratio, and the
value of all Dr. Siemens’s coils has been determined by compa
                                                                         '
rison with them.
    A difference of 15’ C. would therefore by no means account
for the discrepancy of 0'5 per cent., which we believe exists
between Dr. Siemens’s 1862 coils and 1864 standards.
    I  have now concluded all the remarks         I  have to make on
those    parts of  Dr. Siemens’s   paper which    are  strictly relevant
to the matter at issue; but Dr. Siemens, at the end of his paper,
makes some criticisms on the historical sketch            I gave in the
paper above referred to, of the various units of resistance which
have been proposed.
    I  think none of these criticisms would have been made by
                                 I
him if he had observed that did not profess to give a history of
the “progresses in the <U+FB01>eld of resistance-measurements,”           as he
supposed, but only of the units proposed.         A whole book would
have to be written to do justice to a history of resistance-mea
 surements, whereas my sketch occupies only three pages.
                                          I
     First, Dr. Siemens complains that did not mention the sets
 of resistance-coils made since 1848 in Berlin.         I presume these
 are what I mistakenly called the German mile of No. 8 iron wire.
 This mistake of mine was not corrected by l\1essrs. Siemens in
 1862, and appears again in the historical sketch. Unfortunately
 Dr. Siemens’s letter to me, giving information for my historical
 sketch in answer to mine of the 28th February, did not come
 till the 21st April, while the Report was sent in on the 16th of
 March, and read on the 6th of April.           The value of the coils
 he refers to is given in the Table annexed to the sketch, and I
 am sorry that    I did not add a note to the reprint giving the exact
                                                                           '
 date of their introduction and their true de<U+FB01>nition.       Dr. Siemens

   174            Mr. F. Jenkin     on the Question   of the
  may, however, observe that I did not think it necessary to give
  the exact dates at which any of the mile or kilometre units
  were introduced after those which      I was informed were used in
   1847 by the Electric and International Company.
      Dr. Siemens further criticises my statement that, until about
  the year 1 850, measurements of resistance were chie<U+FB02>y con<U+FB01>ned to
  the laboratory; but    I confess  I think his statement that in 1848
  they began to make resistance-coils rather proves than disproves
  my assertion, especially as     I  had mentioned that the Electric
  and International Company had coils in use in 1847.
      Next he complains that    I  do not mention the complete set of
  resistance-coils made in 1859. But as resistance-coils were then
  common, I do not see why they should have been mentioned.
  Does Dr. Siemens mean that he then weighed the coils, instead
  of using Wheatstone’s balance or other electrical adjustment?
  1 had in 1859 one set of coils adjusted by the Wheatstone’s
  balance to within 01 per cent., which       I use to this day, made
  by White, under Professor Thomson’s directions; and many
  other sets were in use at the time.      These were the coils    I used
  as standards at Birkenhead (not Dr. Siemens’s coils, of which
  I  had only very rough specimens of the so-called German mile).
     I  did not mention this set of practical coils, or any others, my
  object being to mention new units.        I  only speak of them now
  to show that my silence cannot possibly have proceeded from
                                                                        '
  any hostile animus.                               _        _
     Dr. Siemens says my historical sketch is very incomplete;
  but, beyond the correction in the description of one comparatively
  unimportant unit, he does not add one de<U+FB01>nition to those              I
  enumerated, although     I quite admit that in all probability some
  omissions must have occurred.        As to Marié Davy’s prior pro
  posal for a mercury standard, my own statement is that, though
  not <U+FB01>rst in order of time, Dr. Siemens merits especial recogni
  tion, owing to the manner in which his proposal was carried
  out.    Is not this what Dr. Siemens claims? The Report was
  not specially on his unit; and he may observe that Ohm,Wheat
  stone, Weber, and Thomson, and others of equal rank, have ne
  cessarily each but a few lines in the short sketch      I wrote.
     Next Dr. Siemens complains that         I  mentioned neither the
  fact that in 1859 the relative resistances of the conductor and
  insulator were given in mercury units, nor the method fol
  lowed to measure the resistance which the insulating covering
  offered to the electric current and to compare it with that cal
  culated from the speci<U+FB01>c resistance of the insulated material.
      This subject was unconnected with the introduction of any new
' unit, and was therefore omitted as irrelevant.
         I
      If had mentioned the subject at all, I should <U+FB01>rst have

                        Unit of Electrical Resistance.                     175
 mentioned Professor Thomson, who in a lecture in 1857 to the
 British Association gave the relative speci<U+FB01>c resistances of the
 copper and gutta percha of the Atlantic cable. In a note below
 is an extract from a printed report published in a local paper*.
 Next to Professor Thomson I should have mentioned myself,
 who, acting not under Dr. Siemens’s direction, but at the sugges
 tion of ProfessorThomson,made in the spring and summer of 1859
 experiments on this subject, more complete,              I  think, than are
 contained in Dr. Siemens’s Red-Sea Report.              These results were
 published at the Meeting of the British Association in 1859, and
 communicated in a more complete form to the Royal Society;
 whereas it is not till 1860 that          I <U+FB01>nd any publication by Dr.
 Siemens on the subject, in a paper read to the British Association
 in 1860, the very body which had received the two previous com
 munications.        He is silent as to both of these.         He gives less
 complete results than those given in the previous year; he gives
 no experiments on the difference between positive and negative
 currents, nor any account of the curious effect of electri<U+FB01>cation
 due to the time the current has been applied, and without,
 which any record of resistance-measurements               is nearly useless.
 Experiments on both these points are given in my paper.
 Surely, then, it cannot have been from any hostile feeling to
 Dr. Siemens that I said nothing about the measurement of the
 resistance of insulators.
    ‘  Extract from Professor W. Thomson’s Lecture before the Members
                                                                        ‘
 of the British Association at Dublin, 1857, taken from the Glasgow North
 British Daily Mail’ of the 4th of September, 1857 :—
    “  ......   He had now described the material and the process of manu
facture. He would like to say something of the relative qualities of gutta
percha and copper as conductors, for they were both conductors—~the dis
tinction between non-conductors and conductors being not an absolute
 distinction, but only a relative distinction. Gutta percha is not a non
 conductor, but a very powerful resister of electricity.     Gutta ercha and
 every known substance conducted electricity through it.         (T e lecturer
proceeded to explain that, when tested by the galvanometer, there was
very little ditl'erence in the force of a current sent into 2500 miles of the
Atlantic cable, whether the circuit was or was not completed.)             This
seemed rather hopeless for telegraphiug (he continued), where there was so
much leakage that the difference could not be discovered between want
of insulation and insulation at the remote end. But if there were 49-50ths
lost by defective insulation, it would only make the di<U+FB02>'erence between
sending a message in nine minutes instead of in eight.      The explanation of
this was simple, but must be reserved.        He then roceeded to allude to
the variations of the conducting—power of gutta perclia in different tempe
ratures, and gave several comparisons, the result of experiments by Mr.
Whitehouse and himself on this subject, and showed that the variations
observed in portions of the same material were caused by difference of tem
perature.    At hot temperatures gutta percha resisted twenty million million
million times as much as copper; at cold temperatures one hundred million
million million   .....  .”

    176        On the Question      of  the Unit      Electrical Resistance.
       Dr. Siemens also speaks of his methods, read to the British
   Association in 1860, as forming the foundation of the rational
   system of cable-testing now in use. When writing of what is done
   in a foreign country, we are often very imperfectly informed as
   to the literature and progress of that country.                 I cannot doubt
_ Dr. Siemens never heard of Professor Thomson’s lecture or of
   my papers, or he would in 1860 have mentioned them.
       It is equally clear that he has not paid much attention to the
   mass of evidence given in 1859 before the Board-of-Trade Com
   mittee on submarine cables.               I  have no doubt that he never
   heard of Professor Thomson’s paper published in 1860 in the
 Encyclopedia Britannica, giving all the methods which he claims.
   If he had seen any of these papers, he never could have thought
   that he had taught us much by a paper in 1860. The methods de
   scribed in his interesting paper were quite familiar to Professor
  Thomson, Latimer Clark, C. F. Varley, myself, and others.                      The
  methods       are  so treated  by  Professor   Thomson      in the above   article,
  which deserves to be better known even in England than it is.
                                                     I
 - Can Dr. Siemens still think that avoided mention of all
   these papers, familiar as they are to me, in order wilfully to be
   silent   as to his work?
                                           I
    '
       Be it well understood that             am making no counter accusa
  tion of unfairness.          I  am sure some of the papers            I  have re
  ferred to were        unknown      to  Dr.   Siemens;      and   probably, with
  reference to the Report         of  the  Committee      of the  Board   of Trade,
  as it was only published in 1861, Dr. Siemens may not have
  observed that the evidence to which              I refer was given in 1859.
       I can well understand that Dr. Siemens, who has undoubtedly
  invented these methods independently and has carried them out
  successfully in important works by a large and able staff, may not
  have been fully informed as to the progress independently made
  in England; but to one who is familiar with the papers referred to,
  his claim to have founded the rational system now in use reads
  a little strangely.         I  will not be led into a controversy as to
  every    little   improvement in arrangements, or every mathemati
  cal formula in use: these improvements are often made inde
  pendently by many men ; and the formulae are often obvious and
  necessary deductions from perfectly well known principles: but
  I   do claim for Professor Thomson the honour of having been the
  <U+FB01>rst to insist on a measurement of the conducting-power of the
  copper in submarine cables, and to express the quality of the
  insulation in terms of resistance, though              I  said nothing of these
  things     in  my Royal-Society Report         because    they were irrelevant.
      I  wish in conclusion to say that          I  believe no English electri
  cian is more fully persuaded of the great services rendered to
  telegraphy by Dr. Siemens than               I  am.     I  know the immense

    Phenomena observed in the Absorption-wectram                of Didymium.         177

    isolated experiments, and actually carrying out those methods or a
    large scale by the aid of ati organized staff. I concede botn merits
    to Dr. Siemens; and if I have urged my arguments forcibly as to
    the independence of the English school of electricians of that of
                I
     Germany, beg Dr. Siemens to believe that I have done so from no                       I

                                                   could not do,but only
     to vindicate myself from what I felt to be a very unmerited suspi
     cion, that of having wilfuily omitted to mention his discoveries.

    with one prism and with telescope of moderate power are em

    show any difference, yet most undoubted differences are noticed
    when more powerful instruments are used.

    these circumstances      form the subject of the present communi
    cation.         .                                 .
        In the following experiments two of Steinheil’s spectroscopes
.   were used. In the one, which         I   call the smaller, was placed one
    <U+FB02>int-glass prism having        arefracting angle of 60°, and       refract

       The oxide of didymium employed was specially prepared from
    cerite.  The oxalates of the cerite metals were separated from
    cerium-oxide by heating in the air, dissolving in nitric acid, and
    boiling with magnesite, and repeating this mode of separation
    three times with the reprecipitated oxalates.
       The separation of the didymium-salt was accomplished in the
    usual way, by recrystallizing the sulphate twelve times, according
I   to the methods best adapted to effect a complete separation.      The
    crystals exhibited   a bluish-red   colour;   and  the oxide prepared
    from them was of a similar or rather redder tint, but was not the
    least brown-coloured.
       The solution of the salt in water deposited well-formed crystals
    when allowed slowly to evaporate in a beaker covered with <U+FB01>lter
    paper during the hot months of summer.          They gave on analysis
    the following numbers :—                          _

                in  the Absomtion-spectrum     of Didymium.           179
      The crystal (Plate II. <U+FB01>g. 11) employed in these experiments
  exhibited a strongly-marked tabular habitus, owing to the growth
_ of the surfaces 0 P. It was cemented between two thin micro
  scopic glasses with Canada balsam, and was strongly coloured
                                                               ‘
  and perfectly clear and transparent.
      The plane of polarization of the ordinary and extraordinary
  rays which pass perpendicular to the surface 0 P makes with the
  klinodiagonal and with the orthodiagonal an angle of 20°.
  Which is the plane of polarization of the ordinary, and which of
  the extraordinary ray, cannot be settled, as the positions of the
  optic axes have not been determined.           In order to distinguish
  the spectra of the two rays, a Nicol’s prism was placed in front
  of the crystal, which was so arranged that the light was trans
  mitted in a direction perpendicular to the surface 0 P; and the
  crystal so turned round that the plane of polarization of the
  Nicol coincided with one or other of the two planes.         The posi
  tion of the crystal when the plane of polarization of the Nicol
  made an angle of nearly 20° with the orthodiagonal I shall call
  the orthodiagonal position; the other I call the klinodiagonal
  position.
      In the investigation of the spectra of different salts of didy
  mium, a dif<U+FB01>culty occurs, in the fact that absorption-spectra,
  otherwise perfectly similar, assume a different appearance accord
  ing to the degree of intensity, the breadth of the absorption
  bands varying with the thickness and with the proportion of salt
  contained in the absorbing medium.            Such comparative obser
   vations, therefore, can only be of value when, in all the compari
   sons, the light has been acted upon by the same quantities of
  the absorbent body in passing through the absorbing medium.
  This condition is ful<U+FB01>lled when the amount of didymium con
  tained in the absorbing medium is inversely proportional to the
  length of the column through which the light passes.              In the
   comparison    of the  crystallized  and  dissolved sulphate   with  the
   solutions of other didymium salts this condition was most carefully
   taken into consideration.
      Let the thickness of the layer of crystal through which the
   light passes be I, the thickness of the column of solution 1, ; let
   the amount of didymium oxide contained in the unit of volume
   of the crystal be d, and that in the unit of volume of the solution
   be d, ; then in all the experiments d, was so chosen that
                                   d,l,=dl.
   The crystals used in the experiments had a speci<U+FB01>c gravity of
   27153    at 8° C. as a mean of two well-agreeing determinations.
   1 cubic centim. -of the crystalline mass therefore contains 1'2563
   grtn. of didymium oxide.         The layer of crystal lying between

 180           Prof. R. Bunsen on the Phenomena observed
 the faces 0 P, and through which the light passed, had a thick
  ness, of 1'55 millim. as measured by a spherometer.            Hence the
  'values of d and l are
                          d=l'2563,      l=1'55.
  Solutions of three didymium salts were examined; one of sul
 phate, one of acetate, and one of chloride.       In all three the values
 of d, and I, were
       I         d,=0'03414 grm.,        l,=57'l   millim.
 The tube (l’lateII. <U+FB01>g.10) used to contain these solutions consists
 ofa thick-walled glass tube of6 millims. internal diameter, into the
 ends of which two glass stoppers wrth plane parallel terminal sur
 faces were ground. These stoppers were cut out of a piece of plate
 glass, and <U+FB01>tted by accurate grinding into the tube.          In order to
 prevent   the tube  from   crackingwhen   completely full of liquid, from
 expansion    caused   by  rise of temperature, a  side-tube   was  melted
 into the middle ofthe tube,and this was closed at the end and <U+FB01>lled
 with air. This side-tube also served as a handle to hold the tube
 horizontal in the cork of the stand, so that the tube could be turned
 upon the axis of the side-tube and then taken out to be cleaned
 or re<U+FB01>lled.     Fig. 1 (Plate II.) gives the position of Fraunhofer’s
 lines, to which the three <U+FB01>rst spectra are to he reduced.          Fig. 2
 represents the spectrum obtained by polarized lamplight with the
 small apparatus when the crystal is placed in the orthodiagonal
 position; and <U+FB01>g. 3 gives the spectrum by polarized light when
 the crystal is placed in the klinodiagonal position. Non-polarized
 light ought to give a spectrum the mean of these two; but it
 cannot be distinguished from that represented by <U+FB01>g. 3.               The
 differences between <U+FB01>gs.         and 3 are best seen in the three chief
 groups of bands near Fraunhofer’s lines D, E, and F, as in these
groups the bright spaces between the well-de<U+FB01>ned sharp absorp
tion-bands in <U+FB01>g. 3 become darker in <U+FB01>g. 2, and thus each group
 of bands attains an indistinct and totally different appearance.
     In order, to investigate more accurately the changes which
 occur when polarized light is used, the single groups of bands at
 D, E, and F were examined by sunlight in the larger instrument.
 Fig. 5 represents the group of bands near D when the crystal
is examined by polarized light in orthodiagonal position; <U+FB01>g. 6
the same group in klinodiagonal position.           The spectrum <U+FB01>g. 6
differs from that of <U+FB01>g. 5, inasmuch as the spaces between the
single dark bands become brighter, and the band at 1100 dis
appears, and. in its place a new band appears between 1090 and
1095.      The group of hands near E undergoes a still more re
markable change.         The form of spectrum seen by polarized light
in orthodiagonal position (<U+FB01>g. l2, Plate III.) changes to the
form represented by <U+FB01>g. 13 when the position of the crystal is

             vin the Absorption-spectrum   of Didymz'unt.   .   181
altered to_the klinodiagonal one.      The <U+FB01>ve weaker bands disap
pear almost entirely, whilst only a slight alteration is noticed in
the shade of the bands between 1557 and 1570; but at 1476 a
new band appears.        The alterations produced in the group of
bands near the line F are the least visible. Fig. 17' represents
this group: it exhibits such slight alterations in the relative
brightness of the absorption-bands viewed with polarized light,
either in the orthodiagonal or klinodiagonal position of the
crystal, that these differences cannot be distinctly made out,
especially when viewed by the somewhat weak light which the
 solar spectrum possesses near F. The same observation was
made with several other bands; and their description, for a similar
reason, is not given.
    All these differences in the absorption-spectra occurring with
polarized light resemble the absorption-phenomena which tour
maline exhibits under similar circumstances.           The property
which crystallized didyminm-sulphate possesses, of absorbing
differently the ordinary and extraordinary rays, is in its nature
identical with that which makes tourmaline so valuable in optical
experiments.
    The solution of the crystals in water gives another spectrum,
differing, again, from both the foregoiuv. This is represented on
Plate 11. <U+FB01>g. 4. Here also the three chief groups of bands are
situated near D, E, and F, but they are still more confused than
in the spectrum obtained when the crystal is placed in the ortho
 diagonal position (<U+FB01>g.
    Some of the maxima of absorption do indeed show a small but
perceptible change of form: thus, for instance, the band 27 to
31 of the crystal-spectrum disappears, whilst a new but faint
band becomes visible at 30 in the spectrum of the solution.
 7 Very remarkable and noteworthy are the small alterations in
position which occur in the minima of brightness in the didy
mium-spectrum, dependent upon the nature of the compound in
which the metal occurs.      These changes are too minute to be
seen with the small, though seen with the larger instrument;
I  have as yet only investigated them completely in the case of
three didymium-salts, viz. the chloride, sulphate, and acetate.
It  is, however, more than probable that these same phenomena
will also be found to occur with other solutions, and with the
absorption-spectra of other crystals of didymium-salts, and per
haps may be exhibited with the luminous spectra of the oxide
and other compounds of didyniium.         The dif<U+FB01>culty of obtaining
a variety of well-crystallized didymium-salts of suf<U+FB01>cient trans
parency has prevented me from pursuing the subject further in
this direction.    Plate II. <U+FB01>gs.7,   8,and9  represent the group of
bands nearD of didymium chloride, sulphate, and acetate, in the

182         Prof. Frankland on the Origin       of Muscular Power.
order in which these salts are mentioned. Plate III. <U+FB01>gs. 14-,
15, and 16 represent the group of bands near E for these salts in
the          order, and <U+FB01>gs. 18, 19, and 20 the same for the group
nearsaFme.
     The atomic weight of didymium-chloride is 95-9, and that of
the    anhydrous acetate 1069. It will be noticed that all the
groups of bands in the case of the salts under examination ap'
proach the red end of the spectrum in the order of their increa
sing atomic weights.
     These differences here noticed in the absorption-spectra of dif
ferent didymium-compounds cannot, in our present complete
 state of ignorance of any general theory for the absorption of
light in absorptive media, be connected with other phenomena.
 They remind one of the slight and gradual alterations in pitch
which the notes from a vibrating elastic rod undergo when the
 rod is weighted, or of the change of tone which an organ-pipe
exhibits when the tube is lengthened.
               XXIV.      On the Origin of Muscular Power.
                       By E. FRANKLAND, F.R.S.*
                 this title there appeared in a recent Number of the
  UNDER    Philosophical   Magazine an able article by Professors Pick
 and Wislicenus-l', in which these gentlemen describe the results
 of experiments made upon themselves before, during, and after
 an ascent of the Faulhorn in Switzerland.            In these experiments
 the amount of measured work performed in the ascent of the
 mountain was shown to exceed, by more than threeJourths, the
 amount which it would be theoretically possible to realize from
 the maximum amount of muscle-oxidation indicated by the total
 quantity of nitrogen in the urine.
     The data afforded by these experiments appear to me to ren
 der utterly untenable the theory that muscular power is derived
 from muscle-oxidation. Nevertheless, in the application of these
  data to the problem under consideration, one important link was
 found to be wanting, viz. the amount of actual energy gene
  rated by the oxidation of a given weight of muscle in the human
  body. Fick and Wislicenus refer to this missing link in the
  following words z—“ The question now arises, what quantity of
 heat is generated when muscle is burnt to the products in which
  its constituent elements leave the human body through the
 lungs and kidneys?           At present, unfortunately, there are not
 the experimental data required to give an accurate answer to
 this important question ; for neither the heat of combustion of
 muscle, nor of the nitrogenous residue of muscle (urea),is known.”

         Prof. Frankland    on the Origin  of Muscular Power.          183
     Owing to the want of these data, the numerical results of
the experiment of Fiek and Wislicenus are rendered less eon
elusive against the hypothesis of muscle-oxidation than they
otherwise would have been ; whilst similar determinations which
have been made by Edward Smith, Haughton, Playfair, and
others are even liable to a total misinterpretation from the same
cause.
     I  have endeavoured to supply this want by the calorimetrical
determination of the actual energy evolved by the combustion of
muscle and of urea in oxygen: but, inasmuch as uric and hip
 purie acids frequently appear in the urine as products of a less
 perfect muscle-oxidation, I have also determined the calori<U+FB01>c
 value of these substances, and have added puri<U+FB01>ed albumen and
 beef fat to the list. .Creatin would also have been included; but,
 although I was furnished with an ample supply of this substance
 through the kindness of Dr. Dittmar, all attempts to burn it
 in the calorimeter were fruitless.         In numerous trials under
 varied conditions it always exploded violently on ignition.
      The determination of the actual energy developed by the com
 bustion of the above-named substances is surrounded by formi
  dable dif<U+FB01>culties, which have probably prevented their previous
 execution.      It is impossible to effect their complete combustion
  in oxygen gas, under conditions which permit of the accurate
  measurement of the heat evolved; but preliminary experiments
  showed that complete oxidation could be secured by de<U+FB02>agration
  with potassic chlorate; and, although this method is doubtless
  inferior in accuracy to the calorimetrical methods usually em
  ployed, it is hoped that, with the corrections described below,
 the results obtained merit suf<U+FB01>cient con<U+FB01>dence to render them
  useful in subsequent discussions of this and allied subjects.        The
  determinations were made in a calorimeter devised some years
  ago by Lewis Thompson, and which I have repeatedly used with
  satisfaction in other determinations of a like kind.           This in
  strument censists of a copper tube made to contain a mixture of
  potassic chlorate with the combustible substance, and which can
 be enclosed in a kind of diving-bell, also of copper, and so
  lowered to thebottom of a suitable vessel containing a known
  quantity (2 litres) of water.      The experiments were conducted
  in the following manner 2—19'5 grams* of chlorate of potash,
  to which about one-eighth of manganie               oxide was added,
   were intimately mixed with a known weight (generally about
  2 grams) of the substance whose thermal value was to be deter
   mined; and the mixture being then placed in the copper tube
   above mentioned, a small piece of cotton thread, previously
     * I follow the
                      example of the Registrar-General in abbreviating   the

steeped in potassic chlorate and dried, was inserted in the mix
ture. The temperature of the water in the calorimeter was now
carefully ascertained by a delicate thermometer, and, the end of
the cotton thread being ignited, the tube with its contents was
placed in the copper bell and lowered to the bottom of the
water. As oon as the combustion reached the mixture, a stream
of gases issued from numerous small openings at the lower edge
of the bell and rose to the surface of the water—a height of
about 10-inches.      At the termination of the de<U+FB02>agration, the
water was allowed free access to the interior of the hell, by open
ing a stopcock connected with the bell by a small tube rising
above the surface of the water in the calorimeter.       The gases in
the interior of the bell were thus displaced by the incumbent
 column of water; and by moving the bell up and down repeat
 edly, a perfect equilibrium of temperature throughout the entire
 mass of water was quickly established.      The temperature of the
water    was  again carefully observed;  and  the difference between
 this and the previous observation gives the calori<U+FB01>c power, or the
 potential energy, of the substance consumed, expressed as heat.
     The value thus obtained, however, is obviously subject to the
  following corrections :—
     1. The amount of heat absorbed by the calorimeter and ap
 paratus employed: to be added.
 '
     2. The amount of heat carried away by the escaping gases
  after issuing from the water: to be added.
     3. The amount of heat due to the decomposition of the chlo
 rate of potash employed : to be deducted.
     4. The amount of heat equivalent to the work performed, by
 the gases generated, in overcoming       the pressure of the atmo
 sphere: tu be added.
     Although the errors due to these causes to some extent
 neutralize each other, there is still an outstanding balance of
 suf<U+FB01>cient importance to require that the necessary corrections
  should be carefully attended to.
     The amount of error from the <U+FB01>rst cause was once for all ex
  perimentally determined, and was added to the increase of tem
  perature observed in each experiment.
     The amount of heat carried away by the escaping gases after
 issuing from the water may be divided into two items, viz.: —
 ,   a. The amount of heat rendered latent by the water which is
  carried off by the gases in the form of vapour.
     B. The amount of heat carried off by these gases by reason
 of their temperature being above that of the water from which
  they issue.
     It was ascertained that a stream of dry air passed through
 the water of the calorimeter at about the same rate and for the

depressed
  By placing a delicate thermometer in the escaping gases, and
another in the water, no appreciable difference of temperature
could be observed.    Both these corrections may therefore be
safely neglected.
   The two remaining corrections can be best considered together,
since a single careful determination eliminates both.    When a
combustible substance is burnt in gaseous oxygen, the con
ditions are essentially different from those which obtain when
the same substance is consumed at the expense of the com

the products of combustion, when cooled to the temperature of
the water in the calorimeter, occupy less space than the sub
stances concerned in the combustion, and therefore no part of
the energy developed is expended in external work—that           is,in
overcoming the pressure of the atmosphere.         In the second case
both the combustible and the supporter of combustion are in
the solid condition, whilst      considerable pr0portion of the pro
                                  av
ducts of combustion are gases.          The generation of the latter
cannot take place without the performance of external work for  ;
every cubic inch produced must obviously, in overcoming atmo
spheric pressure, perform        an amount of work equivalent       in_
round numbers to the lifting of weight of 15 lbs. to the height
                                            a

consequently less heat       communicated to the water of the calo_

 small. Under the actual conditions of the experiments detailed
 below, its amount would only have increased the temperature of
 the water in the calorimeter        0°'O7 C.
                                       by      Even this slight error

    It well known that the decomposition of potassic chlorate
      is
 into potassic chloride and free oxygen           attended with the
                                                 is
 evolution of heat:   if
                       a   few grains of manganic oxide, or, better,
 of ferric oxide, be dropped into an ounce or two of fused po
 tassic chlorate, which      isslowly disengaging oxygen, the evo
 lution of gas immediately proceeds with great violence, and
 the mixture becomes visibly red-hot, although the external ap
 plication of heat be discontinued from the moment when the
 metallic oxide  is  added.     The latter remains unaltered at the
 close of the operation. ,It-     thus obvious that potassic chlorate,
                                  is
 on being decomposed, furnishes considerably more heat than that
 which is   necessary to ‘gasify‘the‘ oxygen which     it evolves.     It
 was therefore necessary to determine the amount of heat thus
 evolved    bythe quantity of potassic chlorate (9'75 grms.) mixed

with one gram of the substance burnt in each of the following
determinations.    This was effected by the use of two copper
tubes, the one placed within the other. The interior tube was
charged with a known weight of the same mixture of potassic
chlorate and manganic oxide as that used for the subsequent
experiments, whilst the annular space between the two tubes
was <U+FB01>lled with a combustible mixture of chlorate and spermaceti,
the calori<U+FB01>c value of which had been previously ascertained.
The latter mixture was ignited in the calorimeter as before; and
the heat generated during its combustion effected the complete
decomposition of the chlorate in the interior cylinder, as was
proved by a subsequent examination of the liquid in the calori
meter, which contained      no traces of undecomposed     chlorate.
The following are the results of <U+FB01>ve experiments thus made,
expressed in units of heat, the unit being equal to ] gram of water

      It is evident that the above determination of the actual energy
 developed by the combustion of muscle in oxygen represents
 more than the amount of actual energy produced by its oxida
 tion within the body, because when muscle burns in oxygen its
 carbon is converted into carbonic acid, and its hydrogen into
 water, the nitrogen being to a great extent eVolved in the ele
 mentary state; whereas when muscle is most completely con
 sumed in the body the products are carbonic acid, water, and
 urea: the whole of the nitrogen passes out of the body as urea,
 a substance which still retains a considerable amount of potential
 energy.        Dry muscle and pure albumen yield, under these cir
 cumstances, almost exactly one-third of their weight of urea;
 and this fact, together with the above determination of the actual
 energy developed on the combustion of urea, enables us to de
 duce with certainty the amount of actual energy developed by
 muscle and albumen respectively when consumed in the human
 body.        It is as follows :—

   The actual energy capable of being produced by the consump
tion of 3717 and 3700 grins. of dry muscle in the body was
estimated by Fick and Wislicenus at 106,250 and 105,825 me
trekilogs.
   The experimental determination of the actual energy deve
loped by muscle-oxidation renders it now abundantly evident
that the muscular pOWer expended by these gentlemen in the
ascent of the Faulhorn could not be exclusively derived from the
oxidation either of their muscles or of other nitrogenous consti
tuents of their bodies, since the maximum of power capable of
being derived from this source, even under very favourable as
sumptions, is in both cases less than one-half of the \\ ork actually

       Prof. Frankland on the Origin of Muscular Power.                                    189
performed; but the de<U+FB01>ciency becomes much greater         as Fick              if,
and Wislicenus have done, we take into consideration the fact
that the actual energy developed                    by
                                         oxidation or combustion
cannot be wholly transformed into mechanical work. In the best
constructed steam-engine, forhinstance, only one-tenth of the
actual energy developed      the burning fuel can be obtained in
                                   by
the form of mechanical power; and in the case of man, Helm
holtz estimates that not more than one-<U+FB01>fth of the actual energy
developed in the body can be made to appear as external work.
The experiments of Heidenhain, however, show that under fa
vourable circumstances     muscle may be made to yield, in the
                               a
shape of mechanical work, as, much as one-half of the actual

mechanical work capable of being got out of actual energy,                                  it
becomes necessary to multiply                 by

   Thus, taking the average of the two experiments,         evident          it   is
that scarcely one-<U+FB01>fth of the actual energy required for the work
performed could be obtained from- the amountof muscle consumed.

   In  these experiments the conditions were obviously very un
favourable    for the comparison of the amount of actual energy
producible     from muscle-metamorphosis with the quantity of
actual energy expended in the performance of estimable work,
since, during that portion of the twenty-four hours not occupied
in the actual experiment, a large amount of unestimable internal
work ,such as the statical activityof the muscles,peristaltic motion,
&c., was being performed. Nevertheless these experiments show
that the average actual energy developed in producing work in
the body of eachman was nearly twice as great as that which
could possibly be produced by the whole of the nitrogenous matter
oxidized in the body during twenty-four hours.                  It must also be
remarked that the prisoners were fed upon a nitrogenous diet
containing 6 ounces of cooked meat without bone—a diet which,
as is well known, would favour the production of urea.

   The men employed for these experiments were fed exclusively
upon a vegetable diet, and they consequently secreted a consi
derably smaller amount of nitrogen than the <U+FB02>esh-eaters engaged
in the treadwheel work; the other conditions were, however,
equally unfavourable-for showing the excess of work performed
over the amount derivable from muscle-metamorphosis.
   In shot drill each man lifts a 32-lb. shot from a tressel to his
breast, a height of 3 feet; he then carries it a distance of 9 feet
and lays it down 'on a similar support, returning unloaded.                  Six

    Owing chie<U+FB02>y to the vegetable diet of these prisoners, this
result is more conclusive than that obtained upon the treadwheel,
the amount of work actually performed being considerably more
than twice as great as that which could possibly be obtained
through the muscle-metamorphosis occurring in the bodies of the
prisoners.                        _                  ,     _

was obtained       as the average amount of daily work performed by
pedestrians,       pile-drivers, porters, paviours, 8:0. ; but as the
amount of muscle-consumption is calculated from the nitrogen
taken in the food, the conditions are as unfavourable as possible
with regard to the point 1 am seeking to establish; for it is here
assumed, not only that all the nitrogen taken in the food enters
the blood, but also that it is converted into muscle, and is after
wards oxidized to carbonic acid, water, and urea.                                      ~

    Thus, even under the extremely unfavourable conditions of
 these determinations, the actual work performed exceeded that
 which could possibly be produced through the oxidation of the
 nitrogenous constituents of the daily food by more than 30
 per cent.                                                             _
    We have seen, therefore, in the above four sets of experiments,
 interpreted by thedata afforded by the combustion of muscle
 and urea in oxygen, that the transformation of tissue alone can
 not account for more than a small fraction of the muscular
 power developed by animals; in fact this transformation goes
 on at a rate almost entirely independent of the amount of mus
 cular power developed.          If the mechanical work of an animal
 be doubled or trebled, there is no corresponding increase of
 nitrogen in the secretions; whilst it was proved, on the other
 hand, by Lawes and Gilbert as early as the year 1854, that
 animals under the same conditions as regarded exercise, had
 the amount of nitrogen in their secretions increased twofold by
 merely doubling the amount of nitrogen in their food. Whence,
 then, comes the muscular power of animals?                  What are the
 substances which, by their oxidation in the body, furnish the
 actual energy whereof a part is converted into muscular work?
 In the light of the experimental results detailed above,'can it be
doubted that a large proportion of the muscular power developed
 in the bodies of animals has its origin in the oxidation of non,
 nitrogenous substances? For, whilst the secretion of nitrogen
 remains nearly stationary under widely different degrees of mus
 cular exertion, the production of carbonic acid increases most
 markedly with every augmentation of muscular work, as’is
 shown by the following tabulated results of E. Smith’shighly
important experiments upon himself, regarding the amount of
 carbonic acid evolved under different circumstances*_.

starch, fat, &c., are the chief sources of the actual energy which
becomes partially transformed into muscular work ; and secondly,
that the food does not require to become organized tissue before
its metamorphosis can be rendered available for muscular power,

furnishing actual energy, might be expected to be available for
the same purpose; and such an expectation        con<U+FB01>rmed by the

experiments of Savory upon rats“, which show that these animals
can live for weeks in good health upon food consisting almost
exclusively of muscular <U+FB01>bre.     Even supposing these rats to
have performed no external work, nearly the whole of their in
ternal muscular work must have had its source in the actual

   It can scarcely be doubted, however, that the chief use of the
nitrogenous constituents of food     for the renewal of muscular

tissue—the latter, like every other part of the body, requiring a
continuous change of substance; whilst the chief function of the

'courses through the muscle; but when the muscle        at rest,   is

articles of food in common use, as to their capabilities for the
production of muscular power.         have therefore made careful

estimations of the calori<U+FB01>c value of different materials used as
food, with the same apparatus and in the same manner as described
above for the determination of the actual energy in muscle, urea,
&c.     The results are embodied in the following series of Tables                 ;

but it must be borne in mind that it is only on the condition
of the food being digested and passed into the blood, that the
results given in these Tables are realized.   If, for instance, saw
dust or paraf<U+FB01>n oil had been experimented upon, numbers would
have been obtained for these substances, the one about equal to
that assigned to starch, and the other surpassing that of any
article in the Tables; but these numbers would obviously have
been utterly fallacious, inasmuch as neither sawdust nor paraf<U+FB01>n
oil  is, to any appreciable extent, digested in the alimentary
canal. \Vhilst the force-values experimentally obtained for the
different articles in these Tables must therefore be understood as
the maxima assignable to the substances to which they belong,
yet it must not be forgotten that     large majority of these sub
                                                      a
stances appear to be completely digestible under normal cir
cumstances.

      These results are fully borne out by experience in many in
    tances.    The food of the agricultural labourers in Lancashire con
  tains a large proportion of fat.              Besides the very fat bacon which
  constitutes their animal food preper, they consume large quan
  tities of so-called apple dumplings, the chief portion of which
'
  consists of paste in which dripping and suet are large ingredients ;
  in fact these dumplings frequently contain no fruit at all. Egg
  and bacon pies and potatoe pies are also very common piéces dc
  résislance during harvest time, and whenever very hard work is
  required from the men.                I  well remember being profoundly im
  pressed with the dinners of the navigators employed in the con
  struction of the Lancaster and Preston Railway; they consisted
  of thick slices of bread surmounted with massive blocks of bacon
  in which mere streaks of lean were visible.                         These labourers
  doubtless <U+FB01>nd that from fat bacon they obtain at the minimum
  cost the actual energy required for their arduous work.                          The
  above Tables af<U+FB01>rm the same thing.                    They show that '55 lb. fat
  will perform      the work of 1'15 lb. cheese, 5 lbs. potatoes, 1'3 lb.
  of <U+FB02>our or pea-meal, or of 3% lbs. of lean beef.                          Donders, in
  his admirable pamphlet ‘ On the Constituents of Food, and their
  relation to Muscular Work and Animal Heat,’ mentions the ob
  servations of Dr. M. C. Verloren on the food of insects.                         The
  latter remarks, “ many insects use, during a. period in which very
  little muscular work is performed, food containing chie<U+FB02>y albu
  minous matter; on the contrary, at a time when the muscular
  work is very considerable, they live exclusively, or almost exclu
  sively, on food free from nitrogen.”                  He also mentions bees and
  butter<U+FB02>ies as instances of insects performing enormous muscular

work, and subsisting upon a diet containing but the merest traces
of nitrogen.     The following conclusions may therefore be drawn
from the foregoing experiments and considerations :—
    1. A muscle is a machine for the conversion of potential
energy into. mechanical force.
    2. The mechanical force of the muscles is derived chie<U+FB02>y, if
not entirely, from the oxidation '_'of matters contained in the
blood, and not from the oxidation of the muscles themselves.
    3. In man, the chief materials used for the production of
muscular power are non-nitrogenous ; but nitrogenous matters
can also be employed for the same purpose, and hence the greatly
increased evolution of nitrogen under the in<U+FB02>uence of a <U+FB02>esh diet,
even with no increase of muscular exertion.
    4. Like every other part of the body, the muscles are con
stantly being renewed; but this renewal is scarcely perceptibly
more rapid during great muscular activity than during compa
rative quiescence.                                       ‘
    5. After the supply of su<U+FB01>icient albuminoid matters in the
food of man to provide for the necessary renewal of the tissues,
the best materials for the production both of internal and external
work are non-nitrogenous matters, such as oil, fat, sugar, starch,
gum, &c.
   '6. The non-nitrogenous matters of food which <U+FB01>nd their way
into the blood yield up all their potential energy as actual energy ;
the nitrogenous matters, on the other hand, leave the body with
a portion (at least one-seventh) of their potential energy unex
pended.
    7. The transformation        of potential energy into muscular
power is necessarily accompanied by the production of heat
within the body, even when the muscular power is exerted exter
nally.    This is doubtless the chief, and probably the only, source
of animal heat.
         XXV.    On  a  Problem in   the Calculus of Variations.
                  By I.  TODHUN'I'ER,    M.A.', F.R.S.*
        the Philosophical Magazine for July 1866, Professor Chal
 IN lis has    communicated some additional observations respect
ing   the  problem in the Calculus of Variations which had been
discussed in various preceding Numbers of the Magazine.              The
problem may       be  thus  enunciated:     To  determine   the  greatest
solid of revolution, the surface of which is given, and which cuts
the axis at two <U+FB01>xed points.        I  have stated in the Philosophical
Magazine     for June   what  I consider  to be the solution of the pro
                       ' Communicated by the Author.

 this solution does give the solid of greatest volume, and              in                    is

 to the ennnciation, as will be seen from the following words
 which occur towards the beginning of the article :—-“ That                                        a

I     may remark that the word absolute does not seem very ap

that the surfaces considered shall be continuous; but this            not                    is
a  matter of great importance in connexion with my design.
I     will <U+FB01>rst show,        examining  by    particular case, that the
                                                                     a

taking an ellipse of very small excentricity, solid can be formed             a
of greater volume with an equal surface.
    Let 2a and 26 be the axes of the ellipse, and let             revolve               it
 round the tangent at one end of the axis minor.
    Then the volume generated                           is ,

    This example       special case of
                            is     a     general proposition which   a
was enunciated in the Philosophical Magazine for March, and to
which attention was again invited in July. The general propo
sition    the following: a ring having
        is is                              circular transverse sec         a

<U+FB01>cies, and the same radius either interior or exterior, but    dif                                                  a
ferent form of transverse section.    Now   have just taken   spe          I                                        a
cial case of this general proposition, and shown that in this case
the result        is
              erroneous.
   Moreover the general proposition itself        erroneous.    For             is                                        it

axis parallel to the axis of revolution,      solid can be formed of       a
greater  volume   with an  equal  surface when  the interior radius of
the ring     given.

202                     Mr. I. Todhunter      on a Problem in
will be found that by changing the semicircle into a semiellipse,
a solid can be formed of greater volume with an equal surface.
                                          I
   In the <U+FB01>rst example which brought forward, supposed the      I
length of the axis of the required solid of revolution to be inde<U+FB01>
nitely small, and         I
                    showed that the result which 1 am examining
is incorrect. If the length of the axis be <U+FB01>nite, it may be shown
that, by changing the segment of a circle into a segment of an
ellipse, a solid can in many cases be formed greater than that
which is erroneously said to be the maximum, but having an
equal surface.     I do not say that this is possible in all cases 3
but the fact that it is possible in any case establishes the opinion
which I am maintaining.
    Of course       I
                  do not assert that in the cases I have noticed
I  have here assigned the greatest solid, or a maximum solid ;              I
have only professed to show that the statements on which          am    I
commenting are erroneous.
    The foregoing examples will enable a person who has not
studied the Calculus of Variations, but is acquainted with the
elements of the Differential and Integral Calculus, to form an
opinion on the subject I am discussing.                I
                                                shall proceed, in the
second place, to show that the method by which the erroneous
results are obtained is essentially unsound.
     Let
                                       a: soda,
where v is a function of w, y, and the differential coef<U+FB01>cients of y
with respect to .z. Then by the Calculus of Variations we obtain
                          Bu: SA(5y—p8x)dz+B,
where      B   stands    for certain terms which are free from the inte
gral sign, and          A is   a function of .z', y, and the differential
coef<U+FB01>cients.
   Now if u is to be a maximum or minimum, we must have, ac
cording to the received theory, A=0 ; and this is admitted in
the article in_the July Number. And if there are more than one
value of the ordinate corresponding to a given abscissa, the rela
tion A=0 must in general be satis<U+FB01>ed at each point thus assigned.
   Suppose that y' and      represent two values of
                                 3;”                   which cor    g
respond to one abscissa a:   and let A' and A” denote the corre
                                 ;
sponding values of A. Then we must have A' =0 and A”=0.
This   isalso admitted in the article in the July Number; the
equations A'=0 and A” =0 are expressed at full on page 52.
Then from these the equation A' -A” =0         deduced, and the
                                                           is
following words are added :—“ This last equation, inasmuch as
it takes account of both values of A,    the one which the form
                                                  is
of the curve      is
                required to satisfy.  To draw any inference from

                               the   Calculus of Variations.                                  203
    one value of   A and exclude the other would be nothing short of
    error.”
      I   admit of course that the equation A' —A”=0 must be satis
    <U+FB01>ed ; but    Ido not admit that this is the one equation which the
    form of the curve is required to satisfy.
       We have to satify both A'=0 and A”=O. We may of course
    try to assist ourselves by discussing the equation A'—A”=O;
    but any result which we deduce from the last equation will not
    be applicable to the problem we are solving, unless it makes both
    A' =0 and A” =0. It is therefore unnecessary to examine the
    validity of the process which is applied to the equation A'—'A” :0,
     so long as it is obvious that the result does not make both A'=O
    and   A” =0.
       That the equations A'=0 and A” =0 are not satis<U+FB01>ed when
    we take for the required curve a segment of a circle, can be im
    mediately ascertained by trial.
       01' we may establish this assertion by referring the curve to
    polar coordinates.   In this case we shall have only one value of
    r, corresponding to one value of i9 ; so that we have no occasion
    to consider two values of A.    The differential equation in polar
    coordinates, as given in the Magazine for March, is
                 1'   sin 9 (r+r”)            1"   cos 9—31' sin 0 __ sin 6
                                                                             “A.
                       (7.9+7J2)§                  7.0.2 +,./2)%
    where accents denote differential coef<U+FB01>cients.      Now the equation
    corresponding to        segment of
                              a             circle     1'=CI cos (9—0,),
                                                       a                is
    where   Cl  and      C2
                        are constants.    It will be found immediately,
    on trial, that so long as           C,2
                                     not zero the equation
                                              is                not satis          is
    <U+FB01>ed, whatever sign we give to the radical.
       Thus  it  follows that the method which am examining        I  0p                     is
    posed to the fundamental principles of the Calculus of Variations.
     I   wish to advert to one of the results enunciated in March,
    because     am uncertain whether         still maintained, or   aban
            I                                         it
                                                      is                                is
    doned    as  erroneous.    The result  was   enunciated thus:—“   The
    solid consisting of cylinder and two hemispherical ends of the
                              a
    same radius,     larger than any other solid of revolution having
                       is
    the same amount of surface and the same length of axis.”
     I    urged two objections against this, one of them being that
    the fundamental equation A=O        not satis<U+FB01>ed. is  cannot agree       I
    with Professor Challis that he suf<U+FB01>ciently meets the objection.
    It seems to me that there are only three ways in which the ob
    jection may be combated: (1)                       by
                                          showing that the equation
    A=O    is satis<U+FB01>ed;               by
                                denying that       necessary to satisfy
                                                                   it   is
    the   equation       A=O
                           (3) by showing that although
                               ;                                    in                  it   is
‘   general necessary  to satisfy the equation A=0,    yet  there are
    special reasons which remove the necessity in the present case.

204          On a Problem in the Calculus      of Variations.
    But the objection is not      removed by reasoning which does not
bear on these points:       it is not removed, for example, by showing
that the proposed solution satis<U+FB01>es A=0 at some points, and
satis<U+FB01>es p=0 at all the other points.
    It is almost super<U+FB02>uous to advance another argument against
the untenable result; but         I may just mention that, by changing
the hemispherical ends into semispheroids, we can form a solid
having the same surface and the same length of axis as that
which is erroneously called the greatest, but having a greater
volume.
    Having shown by examples and by theory that the results
given in the Numbers for March and for July are inadmissible,
I  shall proceed in the third place to offer some remarks as to the
possibility of solving the problem with the condition of continuity.
    The word continuous may have more than one meaning; but -I
think that the following remarks will apply with any meaning
which is likely to be assigned.
    The <U+FB01>gure which by its revolution round the axis generates
the solid of greatest volume with a given surface, is a <U+FB01>gure
formed of an arc of a semicircle and a straight line which coin
cides in direction with the bounding diameter.          This <U+FB01>gure will
be regarded as non-continuous by those who seek for a conti
nuous solution.       But we know that we can in general draw a
continuous curve through any assigned number of points, how
ever large.     Hence we can in effect make a continuous curve
coincide as nearly as we please with the non-continuous curve
which gives the greatest solid. The best method of conceiving
this to be done is to employ the theorems which serve as the
foundation for the expansion of functions in terms of sines and
cosines of multiple angles.
    It seems to follow from this consideration that it is in vain to
seek for any solution, continuous or non-continuous, which dif
fers from that determined by the semicircle and straight line.
    Again, whether a solution be continuous or non-continuous, it
must satisfy the fundamental equation of the Calculus of Varia
tions which    I  have denoted by A=O ; and it does not seem pos
 sible to satisfy this equation except in the manner indicated in
the Magazine for June.
    The very interesting investigation respecting the course of a
 ship, to which Professor Challis refers, was unknown to me
when    I published my History of the Calculus of Variations.’ I
                            ‘
regret this, because the subject of discontinuous solutions of
 problems in the Calculus of Variations appears to me important;
 I  have given several examples, and I should have been glad to
 have included in my work a notice of every case which had been
 discussed. I   I ventui'elto suggest, without, however, laying much

                      Prof. Norton on Molecular Physics.                 205
stress    on the suggestion, that if there are reasons for asserting
that the problem of the greatest solid of revolution ought to have
a continuous solution, there will also be reasons for making a
similar assertion for the problem respecting the course of a ship.
    I will  advert to one fact which, although not essential, will be         -
of use in studying what has been written on the problem under
discussion.
    I  have quoted above the ordinary formula
                                                                            '
                            3u=SA(3y—p8.r)d.z'+B
 as  that which         will probably be most familiar to readers of the
 Magazine.         It has, however, been shown by some of the most
 eminent writers on the subject, that we may use the formula
                                 8n = SAdy   llZ' +B ;
 A   is the same       in  the two formulae, but B is not.      I  retain the
 opinion that       I  have elsewhere expressed in favour of the second
 formula: it seems to me to be obtained in a more simple and
 intelligible manner than the <U+FB01>rst, and to be better adapted to the
 higher investigations by which we discriminate between a maxi
 mum and a minimum.                                               -
     Although      I   do not admit that the articles in the Magazine for
 March and for July have contributed directly to the solution of
 the problem discussed, yet            I am glad that attention has been
 again drawn to the subject.            My own conviction is that the pro
 blem is no longer perplexing, but that its true solution is that
 which was stated and supported in the Magazine for June.

      XXVI.     On Molecular Physics.            By Prof. W. A. NORTON*.
                          [Continued from vol. xxxi. p. 282.]
                            Condition of the Sun—The intimate magnetic
 MAGNETIC  relation subsisting between the earth and sun enforce,
  even   in the present general exposition of terrestrial magnetism,
  a brief consideration of the probable magnetic condition of the
  sun.     We have seen that the sun’s surface must be traversed by
  magnetic currents developed in two ways,—(1) by reason of the
  sun’s rotation about an axis; (2) by reason of the combined
  e<U+FB02>’ect of its motion of rotation and its motion of translation through
  space (vol. xxxi. p. 280). According to the most reliable determi
  nations the sun’s progressive motion is directed toward a point
  Whose longitude is 253° 16', and north latitude 57° 27', and with
  a velocity of
                    4% miles per second, while his velocity of rotation at
  the equator is 1'3 mile per second.               Accordingly the currents
  developed from the second cause must originate at the parts of
                 '
                    "I  From Silliman’s Journal for March 1866.

206              Prof. Norton on Molecular Physics.
the sun’s surface that have a heliocentric longitude of about 163°,
and with a gradually decreasing intensity on both sides of that
point.    The north pole of this system of currents, as developed
at any moment of time, will lie in the heliocentric latitude 33°,
and longitude 73°.     In the course of one complete rotation of
the sun (25 days), this pole will be carried around the parallel of
latitude which contains that point.      The resultant of the cur
rents thus developed that will traverse any locality at the end
of one or more rotations will therefore run parallel, or nearly so,
to the equator, like the currents that originate in the simple
rotation.   In all this we neglect the small inclination of the
sun’s equator to the ecliptic (about 7°) ; or suppose the equator
and ecliptic to coincide.   It appears, therefore, that the poles of
all the permanent currents should coincide with the poles of
rotation.
   But it is important to observe that at every moment of time
there will be, coexisting with the permanent currents, a system
of new currents originating as above mentioned; and that there
fore there will be a secondary magnetic equator, crossing the eclip
tic in 163° and 343° of longitude, and a secondary magnetic pole,
in longitude 73° and north latitude 33°. Or rather the nodes
and pole should be somewhat to the east of these positions, since
the currents developed must decline gradually and the rotation
carry them forward.       The individual parallel currents of this
system must decrease in intensity in both directions from their
equator, by reason of the increasing distance from the equator
of rotation of the points of tangential action of the impulses
of the aether and cosmical matter, and the decreasing size of the
magnetic parallels followed by the currents. It will be readily
seen, in view of the fact that the sun derives its magnetism in
part from its motion toward a point in the northern celestial
hemisphere, that the magnetic intensity of its northern must be
greater than that of its southern hemisphere.

others, and especially the detailed discussion to which all the
observations have been subjected by Professor Wolf, have served
conclusively to establish that the sun’s spots have their imme
diate origin in some action of the planets Jupiter, Saturn, Venus,
and the Earth upon thev photosphere of the sun, or in such
action cooperating    with some other cause.     (See Astronomische

sun’s spots for a period comprising 100 years; and <U+FB01>nds that
the period of the spots varies from 8 to 16 years, and that its

mean value is 11-15 years.         He gives a formula for determining
the spot-condition of the sun at different dates, in which the seve
ral terms represent the speci<U+FB01>c actions of the four planets just        '
mentioned, dependent upon their masses, distances, and annual
motions, and which gives results in close correspondence with the
results of the observations made between 1826 and 1848 (Astro
nomische Nachrichten, No 1181). He has more recently extended
his investigations so as to include, but with less certainty, a much
longer period.
    The epochs of maxima and minima from 1750 to 1856 are

    It will be seen that (omitting the results answering to the <U+FB01>rst
two epochs of the Table, which will be separately considered) at
the epochs of maxima Jupiter was in some position intermediate
between the point toward which the progressive motion of the
sun is directed (long. 253°) and the diametrically opposite point
 (long. 73°, which is the longitude of the secondary magnetic
pole), reckoning from east to west from the <U+FB01>rst point to the
second.      The average position is 183°, or in the vicinity of the
descending node of the currents of the secondary magnetic equator
 (p. 206).     Again, omitting the epochs 1755-7 and 1766-5, at
all the epochs of minima the positions of Jupiter fell in the other
half of the ecliptic, and his average position was in long 23°.
This is in the vicinity of the ascending node of the same equator,
which lies somewhat to the east of 343° (p. 206).           If we con
sider now the case of Saturn, we <U+FB01>nd that his average position
at the epochs of minima was 182°, or 183° if we take the <U+FB01>rst
two epochs into'account.        If  we separate the positions that fall
in the two halves of the ecliptic, lying on opposite sides of the
line from 253° to 73°, we obtain the average p0sitions 162° and
333°.      If we include the <U+FB01>rst two epochs, the latter average

208               Prof. Norton on Molecular Physics.
becomes 348°.       The average position of Saturn at the epochs of
                                      '
maxima was 236°.
    If we now direct our attention to the <U+FB01>rst two epochs of
maxima, we shall perceive that Jupiter was in that part of the
ecliptic in which his ordinary action is the least ; and if we refer
to the <U+FB01>rst two epochs of minima, it will be seen that he was in
or near the part of the ecliptic in which his ordinary action is
the greatest.     We must conclude, then, that from 1750 to 1766
the normal condition of things at the two nodes was greatly
changed, and that the action of Saturn conspired with that of
Jupiter to produce the anomalous results.
    In view of the general results that have now been obtained,
we may infer (1) that in general the action of a planet to pro
duce spots is greatest in the portion of the ecliptic which con
tains the descending node of the secondary magnetic equator, and
least in the opposite portion; (2) that the action is approxi
mater the same at corresponding points on one side and on the
other of either node.     But the indications are that a somewhat
greater liability  to epochs of maxima exists when the planet is      t
on the side of the line of the magnetic nodes toward which the
progressive motion of the sun is directed than on the opposite
side.    This is most observable in the case of Saturn; for his
average position at the_ epochs of maxima was 236°, while that
of Jupiter was 183°.
    By an examination in detail of the diverse positions of the
operating planets at all the different epochs, and following their
motions from one epoch to another, it may further be shown
(1) that a planet operates more effectively before and after it has
passed either magnetic node than at the very node; (2) that the
normal positions of the two nodes are not far from 0° and 180°
of longitude, the sun’s rotation having the effect to displace them
about 17° toward the east (p. 206); (3) that the principal maxima
of planetary action occur at about the positions 135° and 230°
on opposite sides of the descending node, and that under cer
tain circumstances other positions of inferior maxima manifest
themselves, lying in the vicinity and on opposite sides of the
ascending node; (4) that the principal minimum falls at about
0°, or at the ascending node, and a secondary minimum at 180°
 (or the descending node) ; but in the normal state of things the
effect of the planet appears to experience small changes in the
space from 320° to 70°. These positions of maxima and minima         ,
are given here only as <U+FB01>rst approximations.         -
    These results of observation, deducible for thé most part from
the Table we have given (p. 207), and con<U+FB01>rmed by a detailed
examination of Professor Wolf’s entire series of determinations,
are all decided intimations of a dependence of the sun’s spots

                   Pref. Norton on [Molecular Physics.            209
 upon the varying magnetic or electric condition of the sun, and
 indicate that they are closely connected with the varying inten
 sity of the magnetizing or demagnetizing action of the system of
 secondary   magnetic currents developed by the sun’s progressive
 motion, in conjunction with the cooperative action of the elec
 tric waves that proceed from the region (long. 2530 and lat. 57°)
 upon which the impulses of the aether and cosmical matter fall
 normally.    Of these two operative causes, the <U+FB01>rst should aug
 ment on both sides of the secondary magnetic equator, and for
 considerable distances.     It should be much greater on the side
 of the descending than on that of the ascending node of this
 equator, because the new magnetic currents originate on the
 former side.   The electric currents developed at any instant upon
 the ascending-node side of the sun run in the opposite direc
 tion, and tend to weaken the prevailing currents.     The residual
 excess of the latter over the former at any point, and at any in
 stant, constitutes the new e<U+FB01>'ective magnetic current at that point
 and moment of time       c.
                         (l.    266). Each of these two sets of cur
                                    p.
 rents may also play certain part in conjunction with the mag
                        a
 netic currents that result from them.    It will be seen, then, that
 the results of observation which we have signalized (pp. 207—
 208) are, in general, such as should ensue  if the operative causes
 here considered cooperate with some action of the planets to
           the spots, each tending to enhance the effect of the
 delyelope
 ot er.
    The tendency of the second operative cause,      if  it conspires
 in  this manner with the planetary action, should be to make
 that action apparently the greatest when the planet      is about in
 long. 253°; and therefore the region of the spots developed by
 the planet (which lies near the ecliptic on the side of the sun
 turned toward the planet)       nearest the central point of origi
                                     is
 nation of the waves in question.      On the other hand, the ten
 dency of the same general cause should be to make the effect
 of the planet least at the diametrically opposite point (long. 73°).
    It may be seen that the three causes here supposed to be
                               if
_continually in operation—and to be cooperating more or less
 according to the positions of the planets with respect to the
 special points of maxima and minima alluded to, at the same
 time that the individual planets are conspiring more or less with
 each other according to their relative positions—should deter
 mine spots   by their conjoint action; their effects, in respect  to
 the connexion of the epochs of maxima and minima with certain
 positions of the planets, and the lengths of the periods com
 prised between these epochs should correspond, in the main,
 with the results of observation.
    From the point of view we have now reached we may         gain an

insight into the probable nature of the process of origination of
the sun’s spots.           Conceiving the luminous matter of the sun’s
pliotosphere      to    be   endued with the properties we have recog
nized in those emanations of solar matter that enter the earth’s
 photosphere           0. pp. 275—280), we may regard         it   as inductively
                 by(l.
 magnetized            the   sun’s  magnetic   currents,   and   disposed in the
 lines of magnetic polarization, and probably also distributed into
 separate masses having in the various latitudes all the diverse
 directions of the sun’ directive force.
                           s                          We have reason to sup»
 pose    that  in the    upper    portions  of such  masses    the molecules on
 each line of polarization will be so widely separated as to be sub
 ject to an e<U+FB01>'ective force of molecular repulsion from the sun              (I.  c.
  p.   272),  and  that    in the  state of equilibrium   thisis  neutralized    by
  the magnetic attraction between contiguous molecules. Now such
a    state of equilibrium may be disturbed, and the matter expelled
 to an inde<U+FB01>nite distance in three ways,—(1)                  by    demagnetiza~
 tion ;    (2)  by electric     discharges   along   the lines   of polarization;
  (3) by    both   of  these    causes  operating   together.      A   demagneti
  zation may result, as we have seen, from the new currents deve
  loped in the upper photosphere           by    the tangential action of the
  aether and cosmical matter; and electric discharges                   may ensue
  in consequence of the propagation of electric waves in every
  direction from the region (in long. 253°, and N. lat. 57°) that
  receives the impulses from the aether and cosmical matter nor
  mally. The points of greatest and least demagnetization should
  be such as have been already indicated (p. 209).                  But the pho
  tospheric matter should also be subject to the molecular repul
  sion of the masses of the different planets; and one effect of the
  impulses of this force should be to develope electric waves or
  currents proceeding from the region normally exposed to them.
  Such waves are of the same character, and originate essentially
  in the same manner as the “ radial currents ” that we have
  recognized as playing      a     conspicuous part in terrestrial magnetic
  phenomena      (l.  0. pp.
                               271—272).      They should be m0st energetic,
   as in the case of these radial currents, at           a    certain moderate
   distance from the point directly under the planet,                  i. e. in low
   latitudes. On the other hand,           it   is to be observed that for a
   certain distance from this point the repulsive                    force of the
  planet may check the expulsion of the solar matter                   byits direct
 action.
    The tendency to the formation of spots should be wanting at
 the permanent magnetic equator (or rotation equator), because
 the lines of polarization are there parallel to the surface and the
induced magnetism feeble.    Again, the effect of demagnetization
should be greatest in low latitudes, where the total magnetic in
tensity  the least, and where also the new demagnetizing cur
           is

                  Prof. Norton on Molecular Physics.                     211
rents are most energetic.  To this we may add, that as we have
reason to believe that the temperature of the mass of the sun
decreases toward the poles  0. pp. 269—270), the molecules of the
                               (l.
photospheric matter may be less widely separated there, or be
combined in groups so as to be subject to    less energetic force
                                                  a
of repulsion from the sun. It conceivable, too, that in special
                                     is
localities the electric waves or currents originated        by  the planets
may operate to disunite molecules in the act of combining or
condensing at the surface of the photosphere (the state of things
supposed     by  Faye), and so bring them into the condition to be
repelled and completely dispersed          by  the repulsive force of the
sun.    The process of dispersion having once begun, from any
cause, may extend inde<U+FB01>nitely downward.
   There    is
            a   special mode of origination of spots, connected with
the sun’s motion in space, that has not yet been noticed.               It   is
that the cosmical matter as          it <U+FB02>ows away from the region of
normal impact toward the equator will become demagnetized,
and thus initiate the process of dispersion of certain portions of
the photospheric matter.          The effect will be especially produced
on the opposite side of the pole from the point of normal im
pact, as the changes of' the induced magnetism will there be the
greatest.   A    similar effect may ensue from        a    <U+FB02>ow toward the
equator   of  the   matter    at  the very  surface  of  the   photosphere,
produced    by  the impulses of the cosmical matter or aether.           The
phenomena      are  precisely   similar to  the  auroral  phenomena      that
light up occasionally the earth’s photosphere         (l. c. p. 280}.   This
is undoubtedly     the   origin  of the annual    maximum     of spots  after
the autumnal equinox detected             by Professor Wolf.       1t   isthe
result of the effects previously noticed, augmented           by  that here
considered.     An inferior maximum manifests itself in December,
which  is the direct result of this cause alone. (See Astronomische
Nachrickten, Nos. 1043 and 1223.)              It important to observe
                                                is
here that when    a   planet is   on that side of the sun, or in the vici
nity of the ascending magnetic node before alluded to,             it  tends
to check this southerly <U+FB02>ow of matter at the surface of the pho
tosphere, and so prevent the development of spots from the
cause in question.       We may add that we have doubtless another
revelation of its operation in the predominating irregular dis
turbances of the magnetic needle in the autumnal months (or
from August to December inclusive; see Professor Bache’s
Reports).     The secondary maximum of the annual inequality
of spots and magnetic disturbances near the vernal equinox                   is
to be chie<U+FB02>y attributed to the demagnetization            in the vicinity of
the descending magnetic node already considered.
   The spots are more numerous in the northern than in the
southern hemisphere of the sun, because the low latitudes at
                                      P   2

which they chie<U+FB02>y originate lie, in the northern hemisphere,
nearest the region (long. 253°, N. lat. 57°) from which the elec
tric and material currents radiate, and because in the northern
hemisphere       alone is the <U+FB02>ow 'of the material currems in the
direction to be attended with .a demagnetization. Again, the
spots are con<U+FB01>ned to a narrower belt in the northern than in the
southern hemisphere, because, the magnetic intensity of the
 northern hemisphere being the greatest (p. 206), the ordinary
limiting parallel of the spots (which is the circle at which the
demagnetizing action from either .of the two causes speci<U+FB01>ed,
together with the electric discharges along the photospheric
 columns, cease to be suf<U+FB01>cient to effect the dispersion of these
 columns) must lie nearest the equator in that hemisphere.
     It is to be observed that spots may .arise from electric dis
charges along the photospheric lines of polarization, although
no demagnetizing action may .come .into operation ; and it is even
 possible that indirectly .an increase of magnetic intensity may,
in special cases, cooperate with such currents.
    Note—Since the foregoing was written, the line of investigation
 here entered upon has been followed up, and new and important ge—
neral results obtained.    One of the principal results is, that the density
 or quantity of matter of the sun's photosphere, in the region of the spots,
experiences periodical augmentations, in consequence of certain e<U+FB02>'ects
produced by Jupiter and Saturn while passing by the <U+FB01>rst quadrant
 of heliocentric longitude and the sun’s north magnetic pole, and
that these augmentations of density, in connexion with the subse
quent diminutions, are one of the determining causes of the great
variations that occur in the length of the period of the 'sun’s spots
 (viz. from eight to sixteen years).         Another cooperative cause
consists in the diverse positions of the planets, especially of Venus,
with respect to positions of favourable action, at the epochs of helio
centric conjunction wit-b the earth.      The other causes have been in
timated.

a well-de<U+FB01>ned image of all the various parts situated on di<U+FB01>'erent

give a sharp image only for the plane in focus; the images of
the objects situated before and behind are more and more con
fused as they are more and more distant from that plane.

           Mr. A. Claudet     on the Optics of Photography.         213
   To obviate this, or rather to equalize the effect to a certain
degree, it is customary to reduce as much as possible, by means
of diaphragms, the aperture of the lens.           The object of such
diaphragms is to cut off all-v the oblique rays, and to employ only
the rays which emerge      from the~lens at the least angle possible.
It is evident that when     the rays are emerging from the centre of
the lens, they follow»a     course so nearly parallel: that any equal
points of the object on    various planes are included'ibetween   spaces
not   varying much in size; so that although these points are
distant from the plane which is represented at thesmathematical
focus with the greatest de<U+FB01>nition, they form their image within
a circle of confusion so near the circle of de<U+FB01>nitions-that the eye
cannot easily detectv the difference, and the image of the solid
<U+FB01>gure appears well de<U+FB01>ned in its various planes...
   But this result cannot be obtained without sacri<U+FB01>cing'a great
amount of the light which falls on the lens and is stopped by the
diaphragm ; consequently the time of exposure for-"the formation
of the imageis to be increased as much as the surface of the
lens has been reduced.        It is then obvious that, in the case of
portrait-taking,   the  advantage which would be gained in. point
of  de<U+FB01>nition  is~lost by the unavoidable unsteadiness oflthe sitter,
and at all- events is more than counterbalanced      by the constrained
expression resulting. from 'a long sitting.
   Even supposing that the person could sit suf<U+FB01>ciently long
without moving, and preserve all the while the same expncssion,
it is a question not dif<U+FB01>cult to decide in an artistical point of
view, whether a photographic portrait showing all the pores- and
asperitics- of the skin, with the smallest of- its wrinkles, would
ever be-anragzreeable or'artistic production._
   Excessive minutencss is the greatest reproach which has been
made by. artists to the best photographic portraiture; and in
order to obviate it, some have gone so far as to suggest that it
would be desirable that photographers shouldtake their portraits
a little out offocus.    But these artists, forgetting certainlaws of
optics, failed to [observe that it was impossible to represent the
whole of the <U+FB01>gure- in the same degree out of focus.         If, for ex
ample, the nose wassa little out of focus,.the eyes would be con
siderably more‘so, and the ear still more; in fact some parts of
the <U+FB01>gure would be quite indistinct and confused, whilst one part
only would be a little. softened down by a slight deviation from
the plane of sharp focus.v
   Although such a method is therefore unavailable, this sugges
tion, being made in a .true spirit of- progress, was worthy of consi
deration ; and a very usefnl‘lesson was to be learned from the well

lenses, and which is particularly observable in the part of the
image situated in the plane of the exact focus of the len.
    Convinced myself of the advantage which, in an artistical point
 of view, would result from photographic portraits being taken in
 such a manner that they should as much as possible resemble a
 work of art, in which all the features are marked by light touches
 of the brush or pencil, softly blending from light to shade, such
 an important subject has for a long time occupied my attention.
 My precise object has been to discover a method of removing, if
 possible, from photographic portraiture that mechanical harsh
 ness which is due to the action of the most perfect lenses.
    In the best works of art all the effects are produced by a soft
 and harmonious treatment; nothing is hard or dry, nothing is
 too minutely delineated: in fact the hand of the artist is not
 capable of microscopic correctness—and fortunately so, for its
 work is not intended to be examined by a magnifying lens; still
 the general effect may be suf<U+FB01>ciently minute for the artistic
 purpose.
     Notwithstanding its defects, photography is the great teacher
 to artists:  they <U+FB01>nd in it the true reflex of nature; it shows the
 correct distribution of light and shade with all its delicate half
 tints; its perspective drawings are perfect, and it represents the
 folds and texture of draperies in the most exquisite manner.
 But if art derives a great advantage from the imitation of photo
  graphic productions, art is in its turn a very competent and va
 luable teacher of photographers. Their works indeed have no
  value if they do not partake of a certain character which distin
  guishes the best works of art.      And therefore photographers
 must not despise the recommendations of true artists ; for in try
  ing to imitate art they will often improve their own productions.
  Therefore as artists have nothing better to do than to imitate
  photography, so, photography has nothing      better to do than to
                                            ‘
  be guided by art.
     By the laws which regulate the action of lenses, it happens, as
  has been already pointed out, that in the representation of a solid
  <U+FB01>gure there is strictly only one plane of that solid which can be
  taken in perfect focus.    The image therefore of that plane is
  not in harmony with the images of the other planes, which are
  not so sharply de<U+FB01>ned.    This inequality in the texture of the
  image cannot but be considered a defect; and it would be a great
  advantage if it were possible to equalize the effect, even at the
  cost of losing the mathematical    accuracy of the plane in focus.
  I hope to show indeed that such a loss would be really a consi
  derable gain.   If photographic portraits should not exhibit all
  the pores, wrinkles, and defects of the skin, it is still less desi

           Mr. A. Claudet   on the Optics of Photography.          215
rable that only one part of the face should be in that condition,
 while allthe others should gradually lose their sharpness as they
 are more and more distant from the plane of de<U+FB01>nition.
    We can at will bring the focus upon any plane of the <U+FB01>gure.
 In taking portraits not smaller than miniature size, we may
 choose the nose, the eyes, or the ears; but we cannot have
 the three equally sharply de<U+FB01>ned ; and photographers endeavour
 to focus upon a middle plane, for example upon the eyes, in
 order to have the nose and the ears in the same degree of less
 perfect de<U+FB01>nition, not very far from that of the eyes.
    Perfection in the portrait would be attained, were it possible
 to do so, <U+FB01>rst by taking the image of the nose, then, after having
 altered the focus, the image of the eyes, and <U+FB01>nally, after again
 altering the focus, the image of the ear, and then, from these
 various images, forming a collective portrait.     Such an idea may
 appear impracticable, possibly even absurd, and it is sure on <U+FB01>rst
 thoughts to be rejected and condemned.         Yet I seriously, and
 after mature consideration both of the practice and of the theory
of such a scheme, propose its adoption as one of the greatest im
 provements which will have been introduced in photography since
 its discovery. I beg to be allowed to explain the method in which
 l conceive I' have solved the dif<U+FB01>culty I have above alluded to.
    Let me premise a few words upon the effect produced by the ex
 periment of taking the photographic image of the focimeter. This
 instrument, I may be permitted to remark, was invented by me
 upwards of twenty years ago, and has been constantly used in my
operating-room in order to test in what degree the chemical and
 visual foci of lenses coincided or di<U+FB01>'ered.     Until it came into
 use, nobody had ever dreamt that they did not exist in the same
 plane when the object-glasses were as much achromatic as those of
the best telescopes.    This fact being demonstrated by the instru
 ment   I refer to, was the cause of a complete change in the con
struction of lenses for photographic purposes ; and from that time
opticians have endeavoured to calculate, and succeeded in disco
Vering curvatures the combination of which, to invent a phrase,
achrornatize, with the visible rays of light, the invisible rays which
are exclusively endowed with the chemical action.       The use of the
focimeter I have found indispensable since the further discovery
I have made that the two foci undergo continual changes from
various atmospheric in<U+FB02>uences; and no photographic studio,
therefore, should be without this instrument; for no optical
combination is capable of preserving an invariable coincidence of
foci, and the photographer must have the means at any moment
of testing the then state of the elements, and of the light itself,
in order to ascertain any change in its refraction and to act ac
cordingly.

 216           ‘M r. A. Claudet        (m the Optics    of Photography.
      My focimeter, a model of which is on the table, is made of
  eight' separate segments of a disk, mounted spirally on a hori
   zontal axis of 12 inches, corresponding with the optical axis of the
  lens ; the segments are all separated and distant about 1% inch
  from each other. In a front view they form on the ground
   glass the image of a complete and regular disk.             (The segments
   are covered with some uniform and well-de<U+FB01>ned devices ; and the
   centre of each is marked with its number, from 1 to 8.                 The
   <U+FB01>rst segment is the nearest, and the last the furthest from the lens.
      By moving slightly and slowly forward and backward the fo
   cusing or ground glass, any one of these segments, and all in
   succession, may be brought into focus.          If we focus upon No.             41-,
   for example, we see that the segments before and behind gra

                                            a
   to the quality of the lens; and from that experiment we may
   judge of what     is empirically called the depth of focus of the lens.
   By comparing at the same time the photographic image with the
   image we had on the ground glass, we see             the visual and che

   object not being to test whether the chemical and visual foci
   agree, we will take       lens in which we know that they coincide.

    thin vapour.
        This being well understood, let us apply the same mode of
    operating to the taking of             a  portrait; and while the person
    is  sitting, let us move the frame holding the plate from the
    point of the focus of the nose to the focus of the furthest point
    of the <U+FB01>gure.      It   is evident that during the movement of the
    plate   the various   planes   of the <U+FB01>gure will have been consecutively
    in focus and out     of  focus during one part of the exposure, and
     all in the same degree.          Thus we have           very simple contri

    vance found the means to realize the wish of true artists, viz. to
     take a   photographic portrait without hard lines, but with the
     light and shades blended in the most artistic harmony.
        We now arrive at the most important part of the discovery.
     The result may be obtained in greater perfection without having
     to move the frame holding the plate in order to adapt                consecu

     more conspicuously than when these parts were out of focus the
     exaggeration of perspective which             inherent to all photographic

     an exaggeration,  I    may remark, so disagreeany apparent in all

     the plate should not have to be moved forward or backward for the
     adaptation of the various foci according to each distance of plane.

focus of every plane to the immoveable frame holding the plate;
and we are enabled thus to represent consecutively on the plate
an image of every plane, with a less reduction or increase of size
than when the power of the double combination remains the
same; for it happens fortunately that, to reduce the focus, we
must separate the lenses, by which the power is increased.       The
alteration of the distance which separates the two lenses is effected
by a rack and pinion acting upon a tube containing the back
lens, that tube sliding into another containing the front lens,
which remains <U+FB01>xed during the adaptation of the focus to the
distance of every plane by means of a gradual m0vement com
municated to the back lens during the sitting.       The inspection
of the apparatus, which I submit to the Meeting, will enable
any visitor interested in the question to understand its action.
    It is marvellous when we re<U+FB02>ect that there is nothing to wish
for in the shape of contrivances having for their object the percep
tion of vision, and that from time to time man invents, or thinks
he invents, what nature had done in the most perfect manner. The
 eye is supplied with a lens in the same way as the camera obscura ;
 the retina is the screen on which, like the ground glass of the
 camera, the light re<U+FB02>ected by all the natural objects form their
 image.    By various humours through which the light is refracted,
the spherical aberration is corrected and the most perfect achro
matism is produced; the eye is endowed with muscles which
enable it to alter the focal distance of the lens according to the
various distances of the objects.       Optics is able to imitate all
these beautiful contrivances except the last, which           ’is
                                                            available
only  on   account of the way  in which  we  exercise the perception
of vision.    We see at once only    very small part of the image——
                                     a

eye can adapt its focus to the distance of that part, and, as ra
pidly as thought, when directing its attention to another part               it
adapts its focus to that new distance.    Therefore    matters not

of what we want to see, and,    by
                                the proper adaptation, that sensa

be so with the camera obscura, because, the photographic image
produced by    it being at once permanently <U+FB01>xed entire        the      by

only thing we can do   to impress
                         is            stronger image on fainter    a
image.    The artificial optical instrument being destitute of               a
self-acting changing adaptation to the focus of all the other
planes, can represent only one plane in focus    but;    had that

adaptation, the surface receiving the impression of the image in
a permanent manner (not like the retina, which does not retain
the impression), that impression would consist of      number of

           Mr. A. Claudet          on the Optics    of Photography.   219
images superposed one upon another.           For this reason nobody
would ever have thought of proposing to employ a lens which,
moving during the exposure, would adapt itself consecutively to
the foci of all the other planes of the image.     But from the fact
that the eye can easily and usefully alter its focus according to the
distance of the plane it wants to examine, and unconsciously dis
card the image‘of the other planes while they are out of focus, it is
possible to learn what may be a very useful modi<U+FB01>cation of the arti
<U+FB01>cial optical'instrument called the camera obscura.       If we cannot
discard the superposed images out of focus, and see only among
them the one in focus,it happens fortunatelythat the image in focus
is stronger, better de<U+FB01>ned, and consequently more conspicuous
than all the others.    ‘If we cannot discard entirely the images out
of focus, they at all events appear only like a number of blended
shades of the principal image.         Therefore in this process for
changing the power and the focus of the double combination of
lenses according to the distance of the various planes, we do no
thing but imitate one of the most' beautiful and indispensable of
natural contrivances, by which the eye is so wonderfully well
calculated to perform all the exigencies of perfect vision, and is
one of the most marvellous and splendid works of the Creator.
   This new plan of operating not requiring a longer sittingthan
the old process, the interposition of the usual diaphragms will,
by cutting off the oblique rays, increase the de<U+FB01>nition of the
compound image.        It follows that, as much as the intensity of
light  will allow, the  smaller the aperture of the diaphragm            is,
the more perfect will be the result.
   One of the great advantages of the methodI have described             is
that the various planes of the <U+FB01>gure are represented with the
same intensity of light, which    not the case when the rays are
                                         is
more condensed on the plane of exact focus than on the other
planes.   For   it  obvious that the difference of intensities of
                     is
light on the various planes produces an unnatural effect, and de
stroys so far the harmony of the picture.
I    have felt justi<U+FB01>ed in bringing this matter before the Associa
tion, from the con<U+FB01>dent hope that,             by
                                          the examination of scien
ti<U+FB01>c photographers,      new era may henceforth begin in the art of
                               a

                     the plan   propose

cient in many practical points, as must be the case in almost all
new inventions,  I   am sure that, with the cooperation of so many
ingenious and active minds which are constantly engaged in the
task of progress, the science of optics will be able to supply
photographers with     camera obscura which in its working
                               a                                      will

of carbonates, magnetic oxide, and an unknown silicate of alu
mina and soda; it therefore varies considerably according to the

 No.  XVI.     On     the Chemical Composition of four Zeolites, pre
    sented by Colonel Montgomery to the Geological Museum of
    Trinity College, Dublin.
    Some months ago, Colonel Montgomery presented to the
 Geological Museum of Trinity College some <U+FB01>ne specimens of
 Zeolites found by him in the Bombay Presidency, four of which
 seemed to me worthy of chemical analysis and of being recorded.
                                No. 1. Apophyllite.
    This mineral occurs in <U+FB01>ne clear crystals coating the foliated
 Stilbite No‘.. 2.
    These crystals occur in the dimetric system.
    Its chemical analysis gave the following results :—

    This analysis       agrees very       well with those  of Apophyllite giVen
 in the books, but it is very dif<U+FB01>cult to assign its rational for

Valley, which was published by me in Note V. on Mineralogy,
in the Philosophical Magazine for July 1857.
    The next mineral to be described is especially interesting,
because it seems to set at rest the controversy as to the speci<U+FB01>c
identity of Hypostilbite, and fully establishes the title of that
mineral to be regarded as a distinct species, and not a degrada
tion of Stilbite produced by hydrous metamorphism.                 It occurs
in large, <U+FB01>brous, transparent masses, radiated like Natrolite or
Thomsonite, and <U+FB01>lling globular cavities in green trap.

THE“ The        Calculus of Chemical Operations, being a Method for
the Investigation, by means of Symbols, of the Laws of the Distri—
bution of Weight in Chemical Change—Part I. On the Construction
of Chemical Symbols.”         By Sir B. C. Brodie, Bart., F.R.S.
   In chemical transformations the absolute weight of matter is un
altered, and every chemical change, as regards weight, is a change
in its arrangement and distribution.       Now this distribution of weight
is subject to numerical laws; and the object of the present method'
is to facilitate the study of these laws, by the aid of symbolic pro
cesses.    The data of the chemical calculus, as indeed of every other
application of symbols to the investigation of natural phenomena,
are supplied by observation and experiment; and its aim is simply
to deduce from these data the various consequences which may be
inferred from them.       The province of such a method commences
where that of experiment terminates.
   This part comprises the consideration of the fundamental princi
ples of symbolic expression in chemistry, and also the application of
the method to the solution of perhaps the most important of all
chemical problems, namely, the question of the true composition, as
regards weight, of the units of chemical substances.
   Section I. In the <U+FB01>rst section certain de<U+FB01>nitions are given of those
weights, and relations of weight, of which the symbols are subse
quently considered.      It may be regarded as containing an analysis
of the subject of chemical investigation.       The de<U+FB01>nitions are, of “a
chemical substance,” “9. weight,” “ a single weight,” “ a group of

228                                          Royal Society    :—
weights,”   “identical weights,” “a compound weight,” “a simple
weight,” and “an integral compound weight.”
   The unit of a chemical substance is de<U+FB01>ned as that weight of the
substance which at 0° Centigrade and 760 millims. pressure, and in
the condition of a perfect gas, occupies the volume of 1000 cubic
centimetres.    This volume is termed the unit of-space.
   Section II. The second section treats of s mbolic expression in che
mistry. A
            “ chemical operation” is de<U+FB01>ne as an operation of which
the result is a weight.    These operations are symbolized by letters,
x, y, &c.   An interpretation is assigned to the symbols'+ and -- as
the symbols of aggregation and segregation—that      of the mental opeis,
rations by which groups are formed.    The symbol =      selected as the    is
symbol of chemical identity; the symbol         as the symbol of the
                                                                 0
absence of     weight, this symbol being identical with x—a'.

symbol (.r-l-w)     the symbol of two weights collectively considered
                       is
and as constituting    whole.    a
    The symbols           .ri/   and   2    are   selected   as the symbols      of compound

weights   ;   and   it    is     proved that with this interpretation these symbols
are subject to the commutative and distributive                laws
                                            xy=y.r,
                                           a0(y+2/1)=wy+avp
and also to the index law
                                            m" = 22”“.
   Section    III.
                 treats of the properties and interpretation of the che
mical symbol       which
                     1,     selected as the symbol of the subject of che
                                       is
mical operations, namely, the unit of space.      With this interpreta
tion the chemical symbol       has the property of the numerical symbol
                                            1
1  given inv the equation 11 =x.
   Section IV. Chemical symbols are here shown to be subject to a
special symbolic law, given in the equation
                                                  ey=w+zh
This preperty, by which chemical symbols are distinguished from
the symbols employed in other symbolic methods,        termed the “    is                 lo
garithmic” property of these symbols.       consequence of this pro
                                                              A

he added to      chemical function without affecting its interpretation
                   a
as regards weight.
   Section V. relates to the special properties of the symbols of
simple weights, which are termed prime factors, from their analogy
to the prime factors of numbers. These symbols di<U+FB01>'er, however, from

these  factors in that, like the numerical symbol 1, they are inca
pable of partition as well as of division, which is a consequence of
the condition xy=x+y.
   The symbol of the unit of a chemical substance, expressed as a
function of the simple weights of which it consists, is identical with
the symbol of a whole number expressed by means of its prime factors,
a", b"), 0",. . . . - A general method is given for discovering the
prime factors of chemical symbols.                                       '
   Section VI. is on the construction of chemical equations from
experimental data.
   Section VII. On the expression of chemical symbols by means of
prime factors in the actual system of chemical equations.           The object
of this section is to prove that the units of weight of . chemical sub
stances are integral compound weights, and to discover the simplest
expression for the symbols which is consistent with this assump—
tion.
   Such an expression cannot be effected unless some one symbol
be determined from external considerations.           The unit of hydrogen,
therefore, is assumed to consist of one simple weight, its symbol
 being expressed by one prime factor, a, which is termed the modulus
of the symbolic system. This assertion is the expression of an hy
 pothesis which may be proved or disproved by facts, and the con
 sequences of which are here traced.
   The symbols of the elements are considered in three groups :—
 1. The symbols of the elements of which the density in the gaseous
condition can be experimentally determined, and which form with
one another gaseous        combinations.      2. The symbols of carbon,
 boron, and silicon.      3. The symbols of other elements, which are
 determined with a certain probability by the aid of the law of
                            "

   For the method of constructing          these   symbols, which depends
 upon the solution in whole numbers of certain simple indeterminate
 equations, we must refer to the memoir itself.
    The following symbols (p. 230) may serve as an illustration of the
general results.

       June 20, 1866.—Warington W. Smyth, Esq., M.A., F.R.S.,
                               President, in the Chair.
      The following communications were read :—
      l. “ On the Structure of the Red Crag.” By S.V. Wood, Esq.,
   F .G.S.
      The Rev. 0. Fisher having lately published a paper in which he

        The Rev. O. Fisher    on the Warp    of Mr. Trimmer.       231
 endeavoured     to show that the Chillesford beds were beneath the
 Fluvio-marine Crag, Mr. S. V. Wood in this paper <U+FB01>rst drew atten
 tion to certain facts which appeared to him to prove the contrary
 view, especially the relations of the deposits as exhibited in pits at
 Wangford and at Thorpe, near Aldborough.         The author then drew
 attention to the character of the fossils of the Red Crag as affording
 evidence of one of the most rapid changes in fauna that Geology
 affords; and he showed that this deposit contains the evidence of a
 transition by stages, from the oldest—where the af<U+FB01>nities of the
 fossils are to a great extent with those of the Coralline Crag, and to
 a greater extent with the existing fauna of the Mediterranean—to    the
 newer stages, in which the shells are very few, and con<U+FB01>ned to types
 peculiarly northern.
     2. “ Note on supposed Remains of the Crag on the North Downs,
 near Folkestone.”      By H. W. Bristow, Esq., F.R.S., F.G.S.
     An examination of these sands at Paddlesworth had convinced the
 author of their similarity to certain ferruginous clayey sands with
 masses of ferruginous grit, which occur in the Hampshire Basin
 and belong to the Woolwich and Reading series; and he therefore
 concluded that if the Kentish beds can be proved to belong to any
  other member of the Tertiary series, it is only to be done by the
  evidence of the fossils.
     3. “ On the Warp of Mr. Trimmer, its age and probable con
 nexion with the latest geological events and changes of climate.”
  By the Rev. 0. Fisher, M.A., F.G.S.
     The author commenced by referring to the opinion of the late
  Mr. Trimmer respecting the origin of soils, that they are composed
  of the débris of the underlying rocks, together with transported
  materials.   He then showed that the adventitious matter usually
  occurs <U+FB01>lling furrows in the subjacent rock, and appears to have
  been carried forward in a plastic state, and not water-drifted.   The
  author named it “ trail," and explained that the variation of soils
  arises from its incorporation with the disintegrated matter.      The
  furrows were considered to be indications of the last denudation of
  the surface, and it was suggested that they may have been formed
  by land-ice. The ice-sheet having <U+FB01>nally disappeared, the formation
  of the warp with its basal pebbles was considered to be due to
  meteoric action.    The warp was then stated to be older than the
  last depression of the land, and to underlie the Scrobicularia-clay,
  while the gravels beneath the submarine forests at the mouths of
_ many valleys
                  were also supposed to be trail.
     In conclusion, Mr. Fisher discussed the theories of M. Adhémar
  and Mr. Groll, showing that the events as traced in the former part
  of the paper agree with their views, and that their determination of
  the date of the commencement of the alluvial period (the period of
  the retirement of the sea from our lower valleys) coincides remark
  ably with that assigned to it on totally different grounds by Mr.
                                                     '
  Prestwich, of from 8000 to 10,000 years.

      4. “ On Faults in the Drift-gravel at Hitchin, Herts.” By    J.  W.
  Salter, Esq., F.G.S.
      The author described some faults exhibited in a cutting of the
  Great Northern Railway, passing through the Chalk and Boulder
  clay gravel, and remarked that whatever system of movements
  a<U+FB02>'ected Tertiary rocks disturbed also the deeper-seated strata, and
  assigned this as a reason why the older rocks are more faulted and
 jointed than the newer.
     5. “ On some Flint Implements lately found in the Valley of the
  Little Ouse river, near Thetford.” By J. W. Flower, Esq., F.G.S.
     The sands and <U+FB02>int-gravel on the right bank of the river Ouse at
  Thetford form a terrace 8 to 10 yards above the river, and about
  40 yards distant from it; at a spot called Red Hill a large number
  of <U+FB02>int implements have lately been obtained from this gravel, at
 from 12 to 15 feet below the surface, and within a foot or less of the
 chalk on which the gravel rests ; and some were found in the same
 gravel <U+FB01>lling pot-holes in the chalk.
     The author pointed out the exact correspondence, as regards geo
 logical position and relations, between the Thetford gravels and the
 <U+FB02>int-implement-bearing    beds of Amiens, Abbeville, Fisherton,     Ick
 lingham, Hoxne, &c.       He further noticed the close resemblance
 which these implements and some others discovered in England
 bear to those of the valley of the Somme; and concluded by ex.
 pressing his dissent from Mr. Prestwich’s conclusions, and stating
his own views on their mode of accumulation, remarking that, in
his opinion, these implements were manufactured prior to the sever
 ance of this island from the continent.
     6.
        “ On some evidences of the Antiquity of Man in Ecuador.”
 By J. S. Wilson, Esq.
     The western slope of the Cordilleras was stated by the author to
 be occupied with projected volcanic matter distributed in terraces,
the most recent of which is but slightly above high-water mark; the
second rises in some places 10 feet above the former, and is well
seen in the lower part of the Esmeraldas river and in the valleys of
its lower tributaries; above this rise four ether terraces, respectively
8, 15, 12, and 6 feet above one another.
    The second terrace contains in many places remains of articles of
human art, broken pottery, earthen <U+FB01>gures, and fragments of gold
ornaments._ This pottery stratum is traceable along a line of 80
miles of coast, and, by partial observations, is determined to occur
under corresponding conditions for a distance of 200 miles more.
     A section at Chancama was also described; it is 24 miles from
the coast, 180 feet above the sea, and 50 feet above the Esmeraldas
river, and exhibits undisturbed sea~distributed gravel and sands,
 6 feet 6 inches in thickness, containing fragments of pottery.
         “ On the relations of the
     7.                              Tertiary Formations of the West
 Indies.” By R. J. L. Guppy, Esq., F.G.S.
     In this paper the author <U+FB01>rst brie<U+FB02>y noticed the present state of
 our knowledge of the different formations occurring in the Caribbean

          Mr. A. L. Adam     on Bones   of Fossil  Chelonians.       233
 area,  which he named respectively Eocene, Lower Miocene, and
 Upper Miocene, these names having reference to their relative posi
 tion rather than to their positive age. It was stated that Eocene
 strata were as yet known to occur only in Jamaica; and the author
 then described the Lower Miocene deposits of Trinidad, Anguilla,
 and Antigua, and the Upper Miocene of San Domingo, Jamaica,
 Trinidad, and Cumana, giving sections illustrating the nature and
 position of the beds, and lists of the fossils found therein.       Mr.
  Guppy then discussed the age of the Caribbean Miocene deposits of
 the different islands, giving the evidence on which the above-men
 tioned classi<U+FB01>cation is founded, and a sketch of the deposits in other
 islands not included in it.     In conclusion the author discussed the
relation   of the West-Indian   Miocene   deposits to the Tertiary strata
of other regions, especially with regard to the migration of species
 and the Atlantis hypothesis; and he inferred that the Miocene of
the West Indies must be included in the same great period of time
 as that of Europe, and may therefore be considered, in a geological
 sense, synchronous,    that it is highly improbable that the West
 lndian Miocene forms reached the localities where they occur as
 fossils by way of the Isthmus of Panama, or by an easterly route
 from Europe or from the Indian sea, and that it is probable that
 during the early and middle Tertiaries such a connexion existed
 between the shores, of the Atlantic as admitted of the migration of
 organized beings from one side to the other, although the continents
 may not have been absolutely joined.
        “ On the
    8.             discovery of new Gold-deposits in the district of
Esmeraldas, Ecuador.” By Lieut.-Col. Neale, Her Majesty’s Chargé
 d’Affaires in Ecuador.
    The author stated that unworked and hitherto unknown golds
deposits had been discovered in the district of Esmeraldas, Ecuador,
and that the President of the Republic, who had received specimens
 of the gold of a very pure quality, pnrposed sending a scienti<U+FB01>c com
 mission to report on the probable yield of the gold-district.  Further,
 he recorded a recent in<U+FB02>ux of immigrants from California and Ne
 vada to the gold-mines of Barbacoas in New Granada.
    9. “ On bones of fossil Chelonians from the Ossiferous Caves
and Fissures of Malta.”      By A. Leith Adams, M.B., F.G.S.
    The remains of more than one species of River-Tortoise,'agreeing
in their characters with the Helodians and Potamians, were stated to
occur in the Maltese caves and <U+FB01>ssures associated with exuviae of
the fossil elephant, Hippopotamus Pentlandi, Myomus Melitensis, and
birds (the last chie<U+FB02>y aquatic, including Cygnus Falconeri), a lizard,
and one or more frogs.      The author considered that the nature and
 arrangement of the deposits and the conditions of their fossil fauna
 clearly show that they had for the most part been conveyed into the
 above situations by the agency of large bodies of water, which at
 one time over<U+FB02>owed the greater portion of the eastern half of the
island.

    10. “ On the discovery of remains of Halitllerium in the Miocene
beds of Malta."        By A. Leith Adams, M.B., F.G.S.
    The four upper beds of the Miocene formation of the Maltese
group, more especially the Sand-bed and Nodule-bands of the cal
 careous sandstone, have yielded several forms of Cetaceans, teeth
 of Zeuglodon, one or more species of Dugong allied to recent forms,
 and Bala’nte; to these the author has added a tooth, an ear-bone,
 and some caudal vertebrae of the Halitherium.
    11. “ On the     af<U+FB01>nities of Chondrosteus,   Ag.”    By John Young,
M.D., F.G.S.
    The object of this communication was to show, from the cha
racters of the skeleton, that Chondrosteus belongs not to the Chon
 drostean division of the Ganoids, as stated by Agassiz, but to the
 Holostean division, since it possesses a well-ossi<U+FB01>ed basioccipital;
and the lateral wallsof the cranium are composed of bones answer
ing to the cartilage bones of ordinary Teleosteans.
    12. “ On new Carboniferous genera of Crossopterygian Ganoids.”
By John Young, M.D., F.G.S.
    In this paper the following new genera were described z—Rlzizo
 dopsis, Strepsoa'us, Dendroptycltius, and Rhomboptychius, all of which
were provisionally named some years ago by Prof. Huxley.           Their
generic distinctness has been fully established by specimens recently
 discovered.     The relation of Rhomboptychius to Megalichthys, and
the position of Holoptychius and Rliizodus in this subdivision of the
 Ganoids, are discussed in the latter part of the communication.
    13. “ On supposed burrows of Worms in the Laurentian Rocks
of Canada.”       By Dr. Dawson, F.G.S.
    The author communicated the discovery of perforations, resem
bling burrows of worms, in a calcareous quartzite, or impure lime_
stone, of Laurentian age, from Madoc, in Upper Canada, but belong
ing to a somewhat higher horizon than the Eozoon~serpentines of
Grenville.

  OBSERVATION       ON THE PASSAGE OF THE SPARK OF AN INDUC
             TION-COIL THROUGH FLAME.            BY A. KUNDT.
IF     the current of sparks of an induction-coil be passed through the
     luminous <U+FB02>ame of gas or of a. candle, no alteration is seen in the
<U+FB02>ame, excepting that in the path of the sparks the <U+FB02>ame is intensely
luminous, and, under certain circumstances, this brightly luminous
path of sparks is traversed by dark cross hands.          When the polar
wires are suitably introduced, it appears constant and steady.       Yet
if the <U+FB02>ame is viewed in a slowly rotating mirror, or in one which is
moved to and fro in the hand, this apparent constancy is found really
not to exist; for, looked at in the mirror, the image does not seem
constantly broadened, but the part above the spark appears alterna_
ting, like the <U+FB02>ame of a. chemical harmonicon when looked at in a. ro

                 Intelligence  and Miscellaneous   Articles.            235
tating mirror, From the upper point of the <U+FB02>ame to the spark, the
image in the mirror appears to have serrate incisions, and at the
lower point of each dark incision there is a passing spark. During this
transition of an individual spark, the <U+FB02>ame, therefore, is always extin
guished above.         The part below the spark is constant and steady.
    The reason of this extinction of the upper part of the <U+FB02>ame by the
spark is due to the fact that the spark causes a very rapid combus
tion of the gases on its path, and then by the mechanical pressure
which the spark thereby exercises on all sides, the access of gas
from below is prevented for a moment.
    The extinction of the upper <U+FB02>ame at each spark which passes is
also seen by another mode of investigation,in the following manner:—
    While the sparks pass through the <U+FB02>ame, and in such a manner
that the latter is apparently quite steady, it is viewed through a rota
ting disk in which there are several narrow slits. Viewed at right
angles to the direction of the passing spark, the <U+FB02>ame above the
spark seems formed of bright and dark layers; viewed in the direction
of the spark, layers in the proper sense are not seen, but dark circles
rather continuously rising on the <U+FB02>ame.        It is best for the latter ob
 servation if one electrode is in the <U+FB02>ame, the other remaining out
 side, and this latter is looked at from the side.
    It is not necessary here to explain minutely in what manner this
 production of bright and dark lines by the cooperation of the alter
 nating <U+FB02>ame and momentary observation is brought about. The
 phenomenon depends essentially on the same principle as that on
 which an emerging jet of water, when looked at through a rotating
 disk, seems formed of individual drops.       It is clear that the number
 and motion of the dark and bright layers of the <U+FB02>ame alter with the
number of slits of the rotating disk, and with the velocity of rota
 tion.—-—Poggendori¥’s      Annalen, May 1866.
 ON    THE DEPORTMENT OF SOLUTIONS OF GLAUBER’S SALT ON RE—
     DUCTION OF TEMPERATURE.            BY DR. F. LINDIG OF SCHWERIN.
    As the physical processes in the so-called supersaturation of
 Glauber’s salt solutions have as yet found no suf<U+FB01>cient explanation,
 either from physicists or chemists, it will not be uninteresting if I
 communicate a few observations on this subject.
     If a solution of Glauber’s salt, whether saturated or not, is allowed
 to cool slowly, it contracts with diminution of temperature, like any
 other body, as long as there is no crystallization. But as soon as
 the <U+FB01>rst crystals form in the clear solution, instead of contracting, it
 begins to expand, and continues to do so in proportion as the crys
 tallization proceeds. Hence the density of the crystals forming is
 less than that of the solution from which they form*.
     Surprising as is this deportment of a gradually crystallizing solu
 tion of Glauber’s salt, that of a so-called supersaturated solution is
    * With this the circumstance seems to disagree, that detached crystals
did not swim in the liquid, but sank to the bottom.

 still more surprising and remarkable.        If such a one by careful treat
 ment is cooled dowa to 0°, and then made to crystallize suddenly,
 the crystal cake formed, which constitutes a compact solid mass,
 exhibits an extraordinary increase in volume, and on further cooling,
 to about 10° C. below zero, contracts more and more.               As in this
 condition of the original solution there can be no question of a sepa
 ration of crystals as in the former case, it seems (like water below
 4°) not to follow the law according to which bodies contract by di
 minution of temperature.
    The experiments in question, which any one can easily execute,           I
made with a glass <U+FB02>ask of about £0 cubic centims. capacity, into
which in di<U+FB02>‘erent experiments I poured solutions of Glauber's salt of
various strengths, covered them with a layer of petroleum, and closed
the <U+FB02>ask with a perforated caoutchouc stopper. Through this stopper
passed a glass tube of 30 centims. in length and 2'09 cubic centims.
in capacity, provided with a paper scale and reaching down to the
layer of oil.    To vary the temperature, the <U+FB02>ask could be placed in
a beaker containing       either a freezing-mixture     or warm water.      If
the crystallization of the enclosed solution did not take place spon
taneously at the proper moment, it was immediately produced by a.
small particle of crystal projected through the open tube.               The
sudden change of temperature was frequently so energetic that
the <U+FB02>ask was cracked if the glass tube was accidentally stopped
and presented no outlet for the displaced covering layer.                The
whole apparatus could be used as a thermometer (only in an inverse
manner), and indicated a change of temperature of not too brief
duration in a tolerably delicate manner. If, for instance, the strongly
cooled apparatus was warmed with the hand for a few moments, a
depression of the covering layer was distinctly perceived.—Poggen
dorlf’s Annalen, May 1866.

    The question of the correctness of the simple and direct applica
 tion of the method of least squares to the determination of the <U+FB01>gure
 of the earth, which is controverted by Archdeacon Pratt, is an im

 of opinion.    As, however, it cannot be of great interest to the ma
jority of your readers, I shall only ask leave to remark here that, so
 far from having vindicated the legitimacy of his

                                   “ improvement upon his correction” is
 not only expressly hypothetical and arbitrary, but is a still further
 departure from simplicity and truth.        The values which Archdeacon
 Pratt, in his work ‘ On the Figure of the Earth,’ had obtained for
                                                    "

ON   THE ROTATORY ACTION WHICH QUARTZ EXERCISES ON THE
    PLANE OF POLARIZATION OF THE LEAST-REFRANGIBLE RAYS
    OF THE SPECTRUM.          BY M. P. DESAINS.
    In  a memoir inserted in the Annales de Chimie et ole Physique, 3e
sér. vol.  xxx., De la Provostaye and I investigated the rotatory action
which active substances exert on the calori<U+FB01>c rays of the visible spec
trum.     I have extended these researches to the obscure part of the
solar radiation, and beg leave of the Academy to communicate the
results which I have obtained.
    At <U+FB01>rst, working with rays which, in the spectrum I used, occupied
'a position beyond the extreme red almost corresponding to the yel
       I
low, observed that the plane of polarization of these rays only ex
perienced a rotation of 19° when they traversed at right angles
a plate of quartz capable of imparting a rotation of 52° to the mean
red of the same spectrum.
    This <U+FB01>rst fact obtained, I worked with rays still less refrangible,
in the position on the side of the extreme red corresponding to the
blue on the other side ; Ifound heat-rays the plane of polarization of
which only underwent a rotation of 8 or 9 degrees under the action
 of the quartz plate previously de<U+FB01>ned.        Under equal conditions, the
rotation of these rays was thus about one-sixteenth that of the ex
treme violet of M. Biot.         Their wave-length would thus be four
times that of the violet, if it be true that up to these extreme limits
 we could, as a just approximation, assume that these rotations are
                                                                  ’
inversely proportional to the squares of the wave-lengths.
    To observe conveniently the very feeble rotation whose value I
have given, it is not necessary to work with rays isolated in the dark
part of the spectrum.       If a solar beam is serit through a pretty thick
layer of solution of iodine in bisulphide of carbon prepared by Pro
fessor Tyndall’s method, rays only are left which quite resemble
 those on which the observations above described have been made.
    On this new point I have made a considerable number of experi
 ments, of which I will describe one series.
    A well-polarized solar ray, which had passed through a layer of
 iodized bisulphide, was quite extinguished when my analyzer indi
 cated 45 degrees. The interposition of the quartz brought about an
 action on the rheometer; but this action again disappeared when
 the analyzer was brought to the division 55, and all observations
 made in other azimuths agreed in proving that the rotation was in
 deed 10 degrees.      Here are the observations :—

 equal to that obtained at —35, as it ought to be.            The division of
 the scale employed in these measurements goes up to 180 on each
 side of zero.      The quartz was always the same.
     I shall <U+FB01>nish this note by adducing some observations of a totally
 dilferent nature, which appear to con<U+FB01>rm my previous results.             M.
Dumoulin-Froment had the goodness to lend me a grating which he
himself had constructed.           On this delicate apparatus I let fall a
solar pencil, transmitted through a narrow aperture, and concen
trated by a lens; at a suitable distance I obtained, on a screen and
with great distinctness, the phenomena of Fraunhofer.              By placing
the pile in the dark spaces which extend from one side to the other
of the central pencil, I obtained no de<U+FB02>ection.           The needle, on the
contrary, was sometimes de<U+FB02>ected as far as 15 degrees by the action
of the green, yellow, or red rays of the <U+FB01>rst spectrum.             The limit
of the extreme red of this spectrum touched the violet of the second.
Receiving in addition the rays within this region, I obtained 10 de
grees more of deviation ; at a greater distance the effects rapidly de
creased, and in the conditions of my experiments            I only obtained a
de<U+FB02>ection of 2 to 3 when I received on the pile the orange and the
yellow of the second spectrum, with the portions of red and of teen
the nearest these colours; but (and this is the point on which              I
dwell) by interposing in the path of the rays the trough full of io
dized sulphuret, I extinguished all the effects produced by heat
which are found in the visible part of the <U+FB01>rst spectrum, and as far
as the violet of the second; while, when the pile was so placed as to
receive the green, the yellow, and the orange of the second spectrum,
the interposition of the sulphuret did not completely extinguish the
calori<U+FB01>c action.       Such was then, in the <U+FB01>rst spectrum, the position
of the obscure rays transmitted through the sulphuret.           These latter
results were obtained with a very delicate pile, constructed by M.
Ruhmkor<U+FB02>' according to the recent directions of M. Edm. Becquercl.

   ON   THE USE      OF NITROGLYCERINE IN THE QUARRIES OF V08
        GESIAN      SANDSTONE NEAR. SAVERNE.           BY M. E. KOPP.
    The fulminating properties of nitroglycerine, C“ H5 (NO‘)3 O“, and
the experiments made with this substance in various localities of
Sweden, Germany, and Switzerland, have led MM. Schmitt and
Dietsch, proprietors of the great quarries of sandstone in the valley
of the Zorn (Lower Rhine), to try its use also in their workings.
    The succe5s has been so great, both as regards economy and faci

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous     Articles.              239
lity and rapidity of working, as to lead temporarily, at any rate, to
the disuse of gunpowder,      so that for the last six weeks quarries are
wgrked with nitroglycerine only.
    I‘Yom the Commencement we thought it necessary to prepare this
substance on the spot ; the carriage, whether by ship or by rail, of
such a substance, so explosive and of such frightful power, appeared
inadmissible.    The great misfortunes which have occurred at As
penwall and San Francisco have shown that these fears were well
founded,    and that the carriage of nitroglycerine ought to be abso
lutely forbidden.
    After studying in my laboratory, with the aid of M. Keller, the
various modes of preparing nitroglycerine (mixtures of glycerine with
concentrated sulphuric acid and nitrates of potash and soda, or with
nitric acids of di<U+FB02>'erent degrees of concentration), we have adopted
the following method of manufacture, which has been established in
a wooden cabin, constructed in one of the quarries :—
    1. Preparation     of Nitroglycerine.-—In a vessel of sandstone
placed in cold water, fuming nitric acid of 49° or 50° Beaumé is
mixed with double its weight of the most concentrated sulphuric acid.
(These acids are prepared expressly at Dieuze, and sent to Saverne.)
On the other hand, glycerine of commerce,but free from lime and lead,
is evaporated in an iron pot until it marks from 30° to 31° Beaumé.
This concentrated glycerine should be syrupy when quite cold.
    The workman places then 3300 grammes of the mixed acids, well
cooled, in a glass <U+FB02>ask (a sandstone pot, or a porcelain or sandstone
basin may also be used), dipped in a bath of cold water, and pours
slowly, with constant stirring, 500 grammes of glycerine.            The im
portant point is to avoid a perceptible heating of the mixture, which
would occasion a tumultuous oxidation of the glycerine with pro
duction of oxalic acid.      Hence the vessel in which the change of
glycerine into nitroglycerine is effected, should be constantly cooled
on the outside by cold water.
   The mixture having been completely effected, the whole is left
for from <U+FB01>ve to ten minutes, then the mixture is thrown into cold
water which has been previously agitated.            The nitroglycerine is
rapidly precipitated as a heavy oil, which is collected by decantation
in a tall vessel ; it is then washed once with a little water, which is
decanted; then the nitroglycerine       is placed in bottles, where it is
ready for use.
   In this condition the nitroglycerine is still a little acid and aqueous ;
but that is not inconvenient, for it is used a short time after its pre
paration, and these impurities by no means prevent its detonation.
   2. Properties of Nitroglycerine.-——Nitroglycerine           constitutes a
yellow or brownish oil, heavier than water (in which it is insoluble),
soluble in alcohol, ether, &0.
   Exposed to even a feeble degree of cold. provided it is prolonged,
it crystallizes in elongated needles.       A very violent shock is the
best mode of exploding it.        It is, moreover, managed easily, and
without danger.       Spread on the earth, it is only di<U+FB02>icultly in<U+FB02>amma
ble by a body in combustion, and only burns partially; a <U+FB02>ask con
taining nitroglycerine can be smashed on the stones without the

240             Inlelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
liquid detonating;      it may be volatilized without decomposition by
a   regulated heat ; but if the ebullition becomes brisk, explosion
ensues.            -
y A drop of nitroglycerine       falling on a moderately hot plate vola
tilizes quietly ; if the plate is red-hot the drop in<U+FB01>ames immediately,
and burns like a grain of powder without noise; but if the plate,
without being red, is hot enough to make the nitroglycerine boil
immediately, the drop decomposes suddenly with a violent explosion.
    Nitroglycerine, especially when it isimpure and acid, may decom
pose spontaneously at the expiration of a certain time, with disen
gagement of gas, and production of oxalic and glyceric acids.
    It is probable that to some such cause are due the spontaneous
explosions of nitroglycerine of which we read in the papers.         The
nitroglycerine being enclosed in well-stoppered bottles, the gaseous
products of decomposition,not being able to escape, exert a very great
pressure on the nitroglycerine; and under these circumstances the
least shock and the slightest motion may bring about an explosion.
    Nitroglycerine has a taste at once saccharine, piquant, and aro
matic; it is a poisonous substance ; in very small doses it provokes
strong headaches.         Its vapour produces similar effects; and this
circumstance might be an objection to its use in the deep galleries of
 mines, where the vapour cannot escape as easily as in the open air.
    3. Mode of using Nitroglgcerine.-Suppose it is desired to detach
 a layer of rocks.      At a distance of from 2'5 to 3 metres from the
outside, a mine-hole is dug of about 5 to 6 centimetres diameter, and
 2 to 3 metres depth.
     After having cleaned this of dirt, water, and sand, 1500 to 2000
 grammes of nitroglycerine are introduced by means of a funnel.
    A small cylinder of wood, of cardboard, or sheet iron about 4
 centims. in diameter, and 5 to 6 centims. in height, is then introduced
 <U+FB01>lled with ordinary powder.          This is <U+FB01>xed to a wick or ordinary
 mine fuse, which penetrates into it to a certain depth, to assure the
 in<U+FB02>ammation of the powder.         By means of the match on the fusee
 the cylinder is lowered; and by the feel the moment can easily be
judged at which the cylinder reaches the surface of the glycerine.
 The match being then held <U+FB01>rmly, <U+FB01>ne sand is run into the hole until
 it is quite full. It is useless to compress or tamp the sand. The
 match is cut a few centimetres above the ori<U+FB01>ce, and set <U+FB01>re to.      In
 eight or ten minutes, the burning of the wick having reached the
 cylinder, the powder in<U+FB02>ames.         A violent shock ensues, which in
 stantaneously explodes the nitroglycerine. The explosion is so sudden
 that the sand has no time to be projected.
     The mass of the rock is seen to rise, become displaced, and settle
 down quietly without any projection; a dull sound is heard.
     It is only on reaching the places that an idea is formed of the
  great force developed.       Formidable masses of rock are displaced
 and <U+FB01>ssured in all directions, ready to be worked mechanically.
     The principal advantage consists in the fact that the stone is but
 slightly bruised, and that there is little waste. With the charges
 mentioned, 40 to 80 cubic metres of very resisting rock can be de
 tached.—Comptes Rendus, July 23, 1866.

.             results of the beautiful researches made, almost simul
  THEtaneously,          by Professor Magnus of Berlin and Professor
  Tyndall    of London-1', on the absorption of radiant heat by different
  gases, agree on the whole as closely as could be expected, consi
  dering the delicacy of the measurements.             Hence it is the more
  striking    that  these  investigators   differ so widely in their state
  ments concerning the absorption by dry and by moist atmo
  spheric air.                                                                _
      Whilst Professor Maguus maintains, in the most recent pub
  lication known to me, that the moisture which, under ordinary
  circumstances, is mixed with air has only a very tri<U+FB02>ing, if any,
  in<U+FB02>uence on the absorptive power of the latter, Professor Tyndall
  infers from his old, as well as from his recent experiments, that
   the absorption is sensibly increased when dry air is mixed with
   aqueous vapour.
      The decision of this disputed point has manifestly a consider
   able interest for meteorology ; hence, on occupying myself during
   the past winter with the new phenomena             of radiant heat, and
   after arranging an apparatus by means of which it was possible
   to demonstrate      satisfactorily, according to a slightly modi<U+FB01>ed
   form of Tyndall’s method, the most important facts connected
   with the absorptive power of gases (even in my lectures on experi
   mental physics), I felt myself induced to enter more closely into
   an examination of the point in question.             The following de

Professor Magnus concludes, for instance, from his experiments
with dry air and with air saturated at 16° C. with aqueous ~va
pour, that the aqueous vapour existing in the air at this tempera
ture exercises no perceptible in<U+FB02>uence on the absorption*.               The

tions of the galvanometer-needle amounted respectively to 12°‘5
and 12°‘6   ; the di<U+FB02>'erence therefore falls below the mean error of

numbers, 10 per cent. of the whole            radiation;    and    moreover
this number holds good for the experiments where the tube was                   '

feebly absorbing moist     air;  then,   according   to  this,  out of  every

were, in fact, exactly opposite to those which Professor Tyndall
observed under like circumstances,            so that they corresponded
to a diminished absorption due to the moisture of the air.
Professor Magnus therefore held to his previously expressed
view, that no difference exists between the absorption by dry
and by moist air; and he sought to explain the opposite effect by
the fact, recently established by him with greater accuracy*, that
all substances are heated when air reaches them which is moister
than that which surrounds them, and that they are cooled when
impinged upon by air which contains less moisture than that
in which they are immersed.           Since the principal contradiction,
therefore, lies in the experiments          made according to Tyndall’s
method, it was this method that I first employed.
            1. Experiments by Professor Tyndall’s Method.
    The apparatus (without rock-salt plates) which I employed in
this part of the investigations di<U+FB02>'ers but slightly from that of
Professor Tyndall.        It consists of a thermopile of <U+FB01>fty bismuth
antimony elements collected in a brass cylinder of 2 centims. in
diameter, which is provided at both ends with conical re<U+FB02>ectors 12
centims. in length and having an external opening 6'5 centims.
in diameter.       Placed on its feet, the thermopile can be moved
vertically and turned around a horizontal and a vertical axes. Its
soldered parts are, of course, covered over as evenly as possible
with lampblack.        The poles of this thermopile are connected by
conducting wires, <U+FB01>rst with a gyrotrope, and afterwards with a
Meyerstein’s electro-galvanometer.           This instrument differs from
the one described       in Poggendor<U+FB01>’s Annalen, vol. cxiv. p. 132,
inasmuch as Herr Meyerstein, at my wish, has <U+FB01>xed the two
auxiliary magnets      underneath    the wooden plate which carries the
multiplier (forwhich purpose the feet of the plate were considerably
lengthened),      and has suspended the magnet, with its mirror,
by   a silk  thread  60 centims. in length, which at its upper end is
fastened to a glass tube carried by a copper stirrup.              Besides a
multiplier consisting     of many windings      of a thin  wire, the instru
ment is provided with a second one, which was employed in the
following     experiments,    and which consists of only twice 150
windings of a wire 1'5 millim. in thickness.             Finally, in order
more easily to obtain suf<U+FB01>cient           inertia, Herr Meyerstein has
<U+FB01>xed a holder for a second magnet to the mirror-frame above
the multiplier.       This was likewise used in these experiments,
by which means the greater of the auxiliary magnets could be
dispensed with. By the approach of the small auxiliary magnet,
the moment of inertia was increased so far as to obtain, without
damping, a time of oscillation of the system of magnets amount
mg to 25 seconds in one set of experiments, and to 50 seconds in

24.4                  H. Wild    on the Absorption  of
the other.     By means of the thick copper frame upon which the
wire of the multiplier is wound, the oscillations of the magnet
were very quickly damped.            Finally, the observations of the
 de<U+FB02>ections of the magnet were made either directly by means of
 a telescope and superjacent millimetre-scale, placed at a distance
 of 3 metres from the mirror, or by exhibiting the de<U+FB02>ections in
 a dark chamber objectively upon a translucent scale.           This was
 done by allowing the light from a gas-lamp, surrounded by a tin
 cylinder in which a slit was made, to fall upon the mirror, and
by collecting the re<U+FB02>ected light by means of a lens of great focal
distance, so as to produce an image of the slit upon the translu
cent scale.     The scale and slit were 2'3 metres from the magnet
mirror.
    On each side of the thermopile a Leslie cube was placed at a
proper distance, its blackened side being turned thereto, and in
each cube water was kept boiling by means of a gas-lamp placed
underneath. The vapour generated in the two cubes was con
ducted through glass and caoutchouc tubes into large vessels of
cold water.      The direct in<U+FB02>uence of the gas-<U+FB02>ames on the ther
mopile was prevented by the interposition of a tin screen.           Be
tween the thermopile and the two sources of heat the tubes for
the reception of the absorbing gas were placed; and these tubes,
except in a single instance, were quite symmetrically arranged
on the two sides of the thermopile; so that from them no inequa
lities whatever in the action of the equally distant sources of heat
upon the thermopile could arise.
                      First  Series  of Experiments.
    On each side of the thermopile was placed a brass tube, bright
inside and out, 60 centims. in length and 6 in width, the ends
of which were provided with perforated thin brass dish 12 cen
tims. in diameter and placed perpendicularly to the axis.          These
disks did not diminish the opening itself, but were merely in
tended, in place of special screens, to prevent a direct radiation
from the cube outside the walls of the tube to the thermopile.
The ends of the two tubes were 10 centims. distant from the.
Leslie cubes, as Well as from the funnel-shaped openings of the
thermopile. Each of the tubes likewise possessed two lateral
apertures, 15 centims. from the ends, both of which were pro
vided with side tubes in order to introduce and carry away the
gases.
    To this end,   each  of the lateral  apertures nearest to the ther;
mopile   were connected,     by means    of caoutchouc tubing, with a
Wohler’s drying-tube; one of the         latter was <U+FB01>lled with pumice
stone moistened with concentrated         sulphuric acid, whilst the pu
micestone   in  the other was moistened with distilled water. These
two            tubes were also connected by means of a fork-shaped
      Yvohler

               Radiant Heat by Dry and by Moist      Air.         245
 tube   with a small compression-pump provided with bellows
 which could be worked by the foot, just as in a blowpipe-appa
 ratus.   The current of air which this pump yielded divided itself
 at the fork and entered both tubes; it became saturated in the
 one with aqueous vapour, and in the other deprived by the sul
 phuric acid of all its moisture; consequently moist air was con
 ducted to one of the tubes placed between the thermopile and the
 source of heat, and dry air to the other.   In order that these cur
rents of air might traverse the tubes and not at once escape at their
 nearest open ends, the most distant lateral apertures were con
nected with each other by a forked caoutchouc tube, and put in
communication with an ordinary air-pump.          In order to show
the effect to several persons at the same time,    I  chose the objec
tive representation    of the position of the magnet-mirror.        As
soon as the magnet-mirror had quite come to rest (which always
followed very quickly after the water in the two cubes had com
menced boiling) and the pumps had been set in action, a motion
of the image of the slit took place on the scale, amounting to
about <U+FB01>ve divisions of the latter, each division being equal to a
centimetre.     The image remained in this position as long as the
pumps were allowed to work (sometimes, with very short inter
ruptions, for a quarter of an hour), and it returned slowly to its
original position when the currents of air ceased.          On inter
changing the caoutchouc tubes leading from the two Wiihler
tubes to the apparatus,     so that the moist and dry air changed
sides relative to the thermopile, a de<U+FB02>ection of the magnet-mirror
took place in the opposite direction.      Through the momentary
introduction of a metal screen on one side between the tube
and thermopile, it was easy to recognize that the motion of the
image on    the scale always indicated that the absorption of rays of
heat by moist   air exceeded that by dry air.   On repeating these
experiments more than twenty times in the presence of several per
sons, I always obtained the same result, with very slight differ
ences in the magnitude of the de<U+FB02>ections.        Professors Valentin
and Schwarzenbach, moreover, were obliging enough to examine
the direction of the de<U+FB02>ections of the magnet-mirror, and thus to
corroborate the above statement.        The correctness thereof was
likewise proved by the circumstance that a motion of the image
of the slit in the same direction, but far beyond the limits of
the scale, occurred when coal-gas instead of moist air was in
troduced into one of the tubes.        Again, on several occasions,
before the commencement         or at the end of the observations,
the Leslie cubes were removed, and the action on the thermopile
was observed when, without any source of heat being employed,
the pumps were put in action.         When this was done energeti
cally,  a motion  of the  image, amounting to about one division

    246                 H. Wild   on the Absorption    of
    of  the scale, always occurred in the opposite direction to the
    former one; that is. to say, this motion indicated that the side
    of the thermopile upon which moist air was driven through the
    tube was most heated.      It is doubtless this phenomenon which
    Professor Magnus    also observed, and which has already been so
    well explained by him; nevertheless it appears to me to be
    more than probable that, in his experiments conducted accord
    ing to this method, some action of the above kind prevailed over
   the absorption and produced the result opposed to the state
   ments of Tyndall.       The above experiment, however, removes
   another objection which perhaps might be raised against Tyn
   dall’s method.    It might be supposed, for instance, that in the
   tube containing sulphuric acid, a development of heat takes place
   in consequence of the chemical action which ensues when the
   moist air gives up its vapour t0 the acid, and that this heat
   serves to warm slightly the dry air which issues; that, further,
.  on the other hand, the evaporation of the water in the othertube,
   through which a current of air is passing, is accelerated, and that
   in consequence thereof an appreciable cooling takes place of the
   moist air which issues therefrom.       According to this view, the
   observed de<U+FB02>ection of the galvanometer-magnet would merely be
   a consequence of the lower temperature          of the moist, and the
   higher temperature of the dry air. The same de<U+FB02>ections, how
   ever, ought also to occur when, after removing the sources of
   heat, the forcing of air through the tubes is continued; but
  this does not take place.          Nevertheless,    in order to clear
  up this point quite satisfactorily, the gases were conducted
  in some experiments through pretty long thin metal tubes, in
  terposed betweenthe apparatus          and the Wiihler tubes, and
  immersed in one and the same water-bath ; this disposition of
  the experiment caused no change, however, in the above-described
  results.    Since, lastly, in all the experiments the apparatus de
  scribed was placed quite freely on a table in the middle of the
  room, all disturbing re<U+FB02>ections of air-currents proceeding from
  lateral screens, and so forth, are out of the question.
      After these more qualitative experiments I proceeded to exact
  measurements.
                      Second Series of Experiments.
      The apparatus was, in the next place, arranged in precisely the
  same manner as before, with the exception that the air was in
  troduced into the tubes by the lateral apertures furthest from
  the thermopile, and the nearest apertures were connected with
  the air-pump.      By this modi<U+FB01>cation the disturbing action of
  air-currents upon the ends of the thermopile was quite avoided,
  as the following will show.       The observation of the position of

   the magnet-mirror was now made with telescope and scale, and
  in such   a manner that the position was always read off on the
   scale as soon as, by continued pumping, the magnet was brought
   approximately to rest.            The position of the magnet previous to
   the forcing-in of air was not noted, but instead of this the de<U+FB02>ec
   tion to the oppoaite side was observed, consequent upon the pre
   viously-described interchange of the caoutchouc tubes, whereby
   the nature of the air in each of the two experimental                        tubes was
   altered. In this manner the following numbers were obtained :—

      Decimetres rather than millimetres were noted here, since
  the magnet never came quite to rest.                         A heating of the right
  side of the thermopile produced a de<U+FB02>ection towards the higher
  divisions of the scale.           Lastly, the temperature of the room, and
  therefore also that of the air saturated with aqueous vapour, was
   18° C.     Assuming that the air on entering the tubes spreads
  solely to the side where the auction by the air-pump takes place,
  and that it there immediately leaves the tube, the interposed
  strata of moist and of dry air in the tube                            would each be
  only   30  centims.      thick   ; from      the     foregoing experiments, there
  fore,  it would    follow     that   by replacing a stratum of dry air 30
  centims., or 1 foot thick, on one side of the thermopile by
  air saturated with aqueous vapour at 18° C., the thermal action
  of the source of heat at 100° on the corresponding end of the
  thermopile would be so far diminished as to cause a de<U+FB02>ection of
  the magnet of our galvanometer amounting to 55 millims. of the
  scale, or, hearing in mind the stated distance of the scale from
  the mirror, to about
      In order to be able to compare this absorption by aqueous
  vapour with that by coal-gas, for which purpose the above-men
. tioned experiments with coal-gas could not serve, the position
  of the magnet-system was so changed, by means of the auxiliary
  magnets, that the zero of the scale nearly appeared in the tele
  scope when both tubes were <U+FB01>lled with the air of the room.

248                   H. Wild   on the   Absorption of
When coal-gas was now introduced on the left-hand side and the
air- pump allowed to work there only, a de<U+FB02>ection of about 800
millims. occurred, which corresponds to a de<U+FB02>ection of 8°.              The
substitution of ordinary coal-gas, therefore,       on  one  side   of   the
thermopile in place       of  a stratum  1  foot in thickness   of the    air
of the room, caused a de<U+FB02>ection of the magnet amounting to 8°,
and corresponding to a diminution of thermal action.           According
to our experiments, therefore, the absorbing effect of a stratum
of moist air 1 foot in thickness, and saturated with aqueous va
pour at 18°, is only sixteen times smaller than that of coal-gas.
It is self-evident that this number is only a rough approximation,
since in such tubes, open at both ends, we cannot speak of a per
fectly de<U+FB01>nite length of an interposed stratum of gas. Accord
ing to the statements of Professor Tyndall, a stratum of coal-gas
4 feet in thickness absorbs 81 per cent., and one 1 foot in thick
ness absorbs 61 per cent. of the total radiation.            Taking into
account, therefore, the above given absorptions by moist air under
similar circumstances, the absorption by coal-gas            according to
                                                           is,
him, only eight times as great as that            by  moist air when the
stratum      is  feet thick, and twenty-four times as great when the
          is 4
thickness       only  1  foot.   According to our experiments, there
 fore, the absorption     by   aqueous vapour    is relatively somewhat
 greater even than Professor Tyndall has estimated          it to be.
    Moreover, with the above disposition of the apparatus no de
 <U+FB02>ection whatever of the magnet-mirror could be observed when
 the two Leslie cubes were removed and the pumps again allowed
 to play. In fact the effect of the currents of air on the thermo
 pile was rendered inappreciable by allowing these currents to
 enter at the most distant ends of the tubes.
    With  a   second similar experiment we obtained 98 millims. as
a   mean of the difference of the readings of the scale, instead of
 110.    The temperature of the air at the time was 16° C., and in
 order to dry and to moisten       it, two sets of four U-shaped tubes
 were employed    ;   the tubes of each set were connected        by means
 of caoutchouc tubes and <U+FB01>lled with pieces of glass, pure concen
 trated sulphuric acid being poured into the four tubes of the one
 set, and distilled water into those of the other.
     In one of the following experiments, the above-described dis
 position of the apparatus was so modi<U+FB01>ed as to obtain            a  single
 tube, 120 centims. long, on the left side of the thermopile, by
 placing both tubes end to end in this manner the lateral aper
                                   ;
 tures near the ends of the compound tube were at            a distance of
 90 centims. from one another.          The lateral apertures near the
 middle of the long tube were connected with each other          bya   short
 caoutchouc tube.       Finally,  in order to produce  perfect neutraliza

                         Third Series             of   Experiments.
     In the
          new disposition of the apparatus, two new tubes, each
15 centims. long, but in other respects constructed similarly to
the tubes 60 centims. in length already described, were intro
duced on opposite sides of the thermOpile, and in such  manner                          a
that on the left, at distance of 10 centims. from the funnel
                            a
shaped opening, the longer tube was placed; and then at 10 cen
tims. beyond     came the shorter tube
                  it                       and lastly, at  distance
                                                             ;                          a
of 10 centims. from the last, the Leslie cube was placed.    To the
right, on the contrary, came <U+FB01>rst the smaller and then the greater
tube, the intermediate distances being the same.        Each of the
short tubes was also provided with alateral aperture.     The three
lateral apertures of the two tubes nearest to the thermopile, that
is to say, of the long one on the left and the short one on the

250                    H. Wild    on the Absorption  of
right, were put, by means of fork-shaped caoutchouc tubes, in
communication with one and the same caoutchouc tube, and
the two most distant tubes were imilarly connected with another
caoutchouc tube.         In this manner the same kind of air could
be introduced on both sides into tubes of different lengths.   The
current of air was now furnished by a larger pair of bellows
<U+FB01>lled with air and pressed by weights ; and in order to dry this
air or to saturate it with aqueous vapour, four U-shaped tubes
were employed, containing either concentrated sulphuric acid or
distilled water.
    A preliminary experiment was made by conducting alternately
dry and moist air only into the two most distant tubes on oppo
site sides, so that each time on the right the stratum of air ex
perimented upon was 45 centims. thicker than on the other side.
For the sake of comparison, the tubes were lastly <U+FB01>lled with coal
gas.    The observations with telescope and a scale gave the fol
lowing positions of equilibrium of the magnet-mirror :—

   The differences are formed by comparing the mean of two
readings for dry air, with the intermediate reading for moist air.
The temperature of the air was 20° C. Now, since by heating
the right-hand side of the thermopile (where the thicker gas
stratum was interposed) a de<U+FB02>ection towards the smaller numbers
of the scale ensued, these experiments also establish the greater
absorption by moist air.
   In order to increase the action, and in all cases constantly to
maintain on both sides a current of the same kind of air towards
the thermopile on the one hand, and the sources of heat on the
other, dry air was conducted in a subsequent experiment into the
outer tubes and moist air into the two inner ones, and these con
ditions were again reversed. In this manner the following results
were obtained :—

   In these experiments the temperature was 19° C. It follows
therefrom that moist air absorbs dark rays of heat more strongly
than dry air; and        by
                       comparing the <U+FB01>rst differences with those
given  in the last experiment, where coal-gas and dry air were
alternated with each other,   will at once be seen that the sub
                                          it
stitution of coal-gas in place of stratum of dry air 45 centims.
                                                a
in thickness, causes an absorption about <U+FB01>fteen times as great
as did the substitution of air saturated with aqueous vapour at
19° in place of an equally thick stratum of dry air.
   This result, however,      only an approximate one; and not
                                     is
withstanding its agreement with results previously obtained,                              it
ought, strictly speaking, not to be compared therewith, because,
as Professor Tyndall has shown, the absorption     coal-gas  not        by          is
proportional to the thickness of the stratum passed through, but
is much stronger in the <U+FB01>rst strata traversed than in the subse
quent ones.
   At all events, in these and in the former experiments no
question can be raised as to whether      partial condensation of
                                                          a
aqueous vapour or formation of dew may not have caused an in
creased absorption.   It was the air proceeding from the bottom
of the room which was always introduced into the apparatus;                               it
must consequently have always had        lower temperature than

                        radiation.  Besides this, as already men
tioned, unchanged results were obtained when the gases, before
entering the tubes, were led through      water-bath whose tempe

the members were able to verify the fact of the greater absorptive
power of moist air compared with that of dry air.
                    I
   In conclusion, may say that in all my experiments conducted
according to Tyndall’s method, which included more than a
hundred distinct observations,    I have never obtained de<U+FB02>ections
of the galvanometer-needle     in contradiction to the statements of
Professor Tyndall, that, further, my measurements give approxi
mately the same ratio of the absorption by moist air to that by
coal-gas, and that, lastly, I consider that certain objections
which might have been raised against the conclusiveness of Pro
fessor Tyndall’s experiments have been removed by means of ap
propriate changes in his method of experimenting.
   This complete veri<U+FB01>cation of Tyndall’s results rendered it more
desirable to investigate the absorption by dry and by moist air
by the method of Professor Magnus.
         2. Experiments by Professor Magnus’s Method.
   The characteristic features of Professor Magnus’s method are
that the thermopile is altogether within the tube destined to re
ceive gases, and that this tube is closed at its ends by the sources
of heat themselves.      By this means we at once secure a contact
between the gas and both sides of the thermopile, as well as be
tween the gas and both the sources of heat ; and, moreover,
quite de<U+FB01>nitively de<U+FB01>ned strata of gas can be interposed between
the sources of heat and the thermopile without using plates of
rock-salt or other closing plates, which might disturb by their
own absorption.
   In order to combine the advantages of this method with those
of Tyndall’s, 1 had in the <U+FB01>rst place a tin tube prepared, about
4 feet long and 9 centims. wide; each of its ends was closed
by one of the sides of a cube-shaped vessel of zinc, in which
water was kept boiling by means of the introduction of vapour.
At a distance of a foot from one end of the tube the above-de
scribed thermopile, deprived of its conical re<U+FB02>ectors and its foot,
lay freely in the horizontal axis of the tube, held by the pole
wires.    Between the pile and the nearest end of the tube were
a diaphragm and a disk, of which the latter could be turned from
the outside, in order, when requisite, to weaken the radiation of
the nearest source of heat ; on the side of the other source of
heat were four similar diaphragms at about equal distances from
one another.    These diaphragms, as well as a vessel surrounding
the tube up to near the sources of heat, and containing cold water,
were intended to prevent heat being imparted to the thermopile
by conduction or convection.       In reality, however, this was so

                                                                  ’
               Radiant Heat by Dry and by Moist          Air.         253
ine<U+FB02>ectually done that no (even approximately) constant position
of the galvanometer-needle      could be secured. Besides this, strong
motions of the needle were caused whenever, by working the
pumps, dry or moist air or coal-gas was allowed to enter or leave
the tube through a lateral aperture.
    In order to avoid currents of heated air,             I arranged the
 apparatus for the following experiments more accurately,             like
 that of Professor Magnus.        In the <U+FB01>rst place the tube was placed
 vertically; the vessel in which water was boiled was placed at its
 upper end, and its lower portion was immersed in water contained
 in a large vessel of zinc.     Within the tube and near the bottom
 the thermopile was again placed; andin so doing its lowest end
 was left free, whilst on its upper end the conical funnel of
 metal was replaced.       This upper end was at a distance of 3 feet
 from the vessel in which water was boiled, and the radiation of
 the side walls was diminished by two interposed diaphragms,
 The lateral aperture for introducing and expelling the' several
 gases lay between the boiling vessel and the uppermostdiaphragm.
 The water in the zinc vessel, from which of course the pole wires
 of the thermopile were properly insulated, reached in the <U+FB01>rst
experiments to a little above the lower diaphragm, and in the
 later experiments to the neighbourhood of the lateral aperture,
and consequently to a little above the upper diaphragm.
    The observations      with this apparatus again showed, in the
<U+FB01>rst place, strong de<U+FB02>ections of the magnet-mirror of our galva
nometer when air was leaving or entering the tube; and in
fact in the former case these de<U+FB02>ections indicated a cooling of the
upper side of the thermopile, and in the latter an opposite effect.
These de<U+FB02>ections were much more intense than those produced by
the total radiation of the upper source of heat of 1000 upon the
thermopile. These are the well-known thermal effects conse
quent upon compression and dilatation, and accordingly they
manifested themselves when the boiling water was removed from
the upper vessel.       The in<U+FB02>uence of a compression or a dilata
tion of the air is always, in fact, <U+FB01>rst exerted on the upper side of
the thermopile, since the latter is nearer to the place of entrance
or exit*.     To these thermal actions is probably due, to some
extent, the circumstance that        I  never, even when the water in
the upper vessel had been maintained in a boiling state for three
hours, could obtain a stationary condition of the temperature,
and consequently an approximately constant position of the mag—
net-mirror.     As   a consequence     of this, no well-marked difference
   *
      The thermal effects of the compression and dilatation werein our case
so  powerful and constant, that I found it most convenient, when showing
the same in my lectures, to employ an apparatus constructed         on this
principle.                    ,

 254                  H. Wild   on the Absorption   of
 was apparent from the observations between the absorptions by
  dry and by moist air. And in fact such a difference could not
 have been detected, in consequence of the unsteadiness of the
  magnetic needle, since its effect would have corresponded at
  most to a few scale-divisions; for when       I  introduced coal-gas
 in place of dry air, the diminution of the de<U+FB02>ection which the
 latter had produced did not amount to more than about forty
 scale-divisions. It was the more surprising to me, therefore,
 that even after waiting for a long time subsequent to the intro
 duction of air or to its exhaustion down to a pressure of 16 mil
 lims., the de<U+FB02>ection caused by the radiation of the source of heat
 in the latter case was always from 100 to 200 scale-divisions or
 millimetres greater than in the former one. Now since the diifer
 ence of the absorptions by very rare and by dense air can certainly
 not have caused this large difference between the de<U+FB02>ections, we
 must conclude that in these experiments also conduction and
 convection had not been quite removed.           It is true that, ordi
 narily, we assume that when heat is applied from above, as in the
 present apparatus, no currents of heated air can occur; to me,
.however, this assumption       does not appear to be well founded.
 In the neighbourhood of the source of heat the surfaces of the
 tube, or at least theinterior one, must gradually acquire a higher
 temperature by conduction, as well as by the effect of radiation,
 even when the tube is constantly cooled by contact with water;
 the heated sides of the tube must soon raise the temperature of
 the adjacent air, which thus becomes speci<U+FB01>cally lighter, rises, and
 gives place to other air ; land this process must continue until the
 horizontal stratum of air under consideration has the same tem
 perature as the sides of the tube.      As soon as this occurs, how
 ever, the temperature of the sides of the tube at this height may
 again rise a little, or the same temperature may establish itself
 at a lower place, and thus, under the in<U+FB02>uence of the sides of the
 tube, the heat may gradually be propagated downwards from
 stratum to stratum, more through the mechanical motions of the
 heated air than through a proper conduction of the latter.
    The insuf<U+FB01>cient sensitiveness on the one hand, and the above.
 described currents on the other, at length induced me to abandon
 the experiments by Magnus’s method.
    Although, therefore, this method of investigating absorption
 may, in the hands of so experienced and expert an experimenter
 as Professor Magnus, be an appropriate one for determining ab
 solute values with great certainty,     I feel bound, from my own
 experiences, to give a decided preference to Tyndall’s method,
 not only on account of the greater facility with which it fur
 nishes qualitative results, but also in consequence of its greater
 delicacy.   It is principally in consequence of this greater delicacy

               Radiant Heat by Dry and by Moist        Air.          255
that, notwithstanding the negative results furnished by Magnus’s
method,    I  maintain that the greater absorptive power of moist air,
as compared with dry, has been fully established by the experi
ments made according to Tyndall’s method; and           I  am of opinion
that meteorologits may without hesitation accept this new fact in
their endeavours to explain phenomena which hitherto have re
mained more or less enigmatical.          It appears to me to be desi
rable, however, to determine still more accurately the relative
values of these two absorptions.
                                 APPENDIX.
    After the above had already been sent to press,       I received the
April Number of Poggendortf’s Annalen, wherein Professor Mag
nus, in a paper “ On the In<U+FB02>uence of the Absorption of Heat on
                          ”
the Formation of Dew *, seeks to decide the above-disputed point
relative to the absorption by dry and by moist air, by comparing
experimentally the powers of emission of heated dry and moist
air, and afterwards employing the principle of the equality of the
ratio, in all bodies, between the powers of emission and absorption.
 From this comparison he found that air, saturated with aqueous
vapour at the ordinary temperature of 15° 0., emitted when
heated to 200° only from two to three times as much heat as dry
air, and that air passed through water (durchWass-er gastric/zen)
at atemperature of from 60° to 80° C. radiated only from six to
seven times as much heat as dry air ; he found, however, that
dry carbonic acid and ordinary coal-gas radiated from thirty to
forty times as energetically as dry air.
    In my opinion, the disputed question is not only left un
decided by these experiments,           but is rendered thereby more
complicated.      In the <U+FB01>rst place, the results of these experi
ments are in contradiction to the statements of Professor Frank
land, who on a former occasion stated that with a similar ap
paratus he had obtained a very strong radiation from heated
aqueous vapour, as compared with that from dry air.                 Even
if we assume, with Professor Magnus, that condensed vapour
had here been produced, and that this had been the chief cause
of the increased radiation of aqueous Vapour, another pecu
liar divergence from the results of Professor Tyndall’s and my
own experiments still exists; for, on the one hand, it follows
from the experiments of Tyndall that at ordinary temperatures
air saturated with aqueous vapour absorbs heat from thirty to
forty times as strongly as dry air does, whilst, according to Mag
nus, the latter radiates only from one-half to two-thirds as much as
the former; on the other hand, however, Professor Tyndall’s and
my own measurementsaccord in giving a sixteen times as great

absorption to ordinary coal-gas as to moist air, and the same
ratio of the radiating powers of these two gases is very nearly
given by the above-mentioned           results of the observations of
Professor Magnus.        In the last place, it must be observed that
such experiments on radiation are not of themselves suited to
decide de<U+FB01>nitively the present disputed point; for whilst the
dry and the moist air, in the experiments of Professor Magnus
on radiation, had a temperature of about 200°, the experi
ments on their absorption were instituted at the ordinary tem
perature of 15° C.      The principle, however, according to which
the ratio between the powers of absorption and radiation is the
same for all bodies, is only true when the latter absorb and ra
diate at the same temperature.         It is conceivable, therefore, that
the absorption or radiation of the non-luminous rays by dry and
by moist air may be very different at ordinary temperatures,
although at a temperature of 200° they may be very nearly
equal.

            XXXII.    On an Air-pump without Clearance.
                           By ROBERT GILL*.
                               [With a  Plate]
       1TH air-pumps       as ordinarily constructed,    it is impossible
          to obtain a perfect vacuum, for two reasons.              First,
because the pump at each stroke can extract only a certain por-_
tion of the air contained in the receiver, and it follows evidently
that another portion must always remain ,- but this consideration
is not of practical importance, as, if we had a pump capable of
extracting air from the receiver at each stroke without ceasing,
 we should soon reduce the pressure so much as to make it im
possible for our instruments to indicate it.         A second and more
important reason is the following :—The air which the pump ex
tracts from the receiver is of a tension lower than that of the
atmosphere, and it loses more and more tension in proportion as
the rarefaction becomes more perfect; this air enclosed in the
pump~barrel must be discharged at each stroke either into the
 atmosphere   or into a space in which the pressure. is kept lower
 than that of the atmOsphere: the valves which close the dis
charge ori<U+FB01>ces must have a certain weight, as, if they were in
equilibrium, they would have no tendency to close the apertures‘;
the rare<U+FB01>ed air must be compressed so much as to acquire a pres
sure capable of raising the weight of the valves, in order to escape ;
and in ordinary air-pumps, not only must it overcome the weight

  of the valves, but also that of the atmosphere which presses upon
  them.      If the space in the pump-barrel could be diminished
  inde<U+FB01>nitely, it is clear that the air contained in it would acquire
  a pressure equal to lifting any weight of valve, even if extremely
  rare<U+FB01>ed at the beginning of the stroke.         But this is far from
  being the case in our air-pumps; it is impossible that the
  piston should <U+FB01>t so perfectly the sides and the bottom of the
  cylinder as to <U+FB01>ll entirely its capacity 3 and consequently a certain
  quantity of air must remain in the pump-barrel, which, expand
   ing as the piston is raised, <U+FB01>lls the pump and maintains in it a
   certain pressure which prevents other air entering from the re
   ceiver: the exhausting action must then necessarily cease.
       To avoid this dif<U+FB01>culty, Torricellian air-pumps have been con~
   trived, in which a vacuum is obtained by <U+FB01>lling a receiver with
   mercury and then allowing the mercury to run out through a
.  vertical tube of such a: height that the column of mercury con
   tained in it overcomes the pressure of the atmosphere.      It would
   be inconvenient to <U+FB01>ll the principal receiver itself, so that an ar—
   rangement has to be made equivalent in action to the pump
   barrel; this renders the apparatus complicated and dif<U+FB01>cult to
    manage.      Besides, it is well known that, in order to expel the
    air completely from a receiver, it is not enough simply to <U+FB01>ll it
    with mercury: as this liquid does not wet glass or metals with
    which it does not amalgamate (and these substances only can be
    practically used for the construction of such receivers), a stratum
    of air remains interposed between the liquid metal and the walls
    of the receiver, which of course prevents a perfect vacuum being
    formed when the mercury is run off; and this circumstance is
    demonstrated by the fact that barometer-tubes can be properly
    <U+FB01>lled only by boiling the mercury in them.         Moreover it has
    been proved that the Torricellian vacuum is not perfect, as it
    contains the vapour of mercury.
        In order to remove these dif<U+FB01>culties, the following apparatus
    has been contrived, in which clearance is totally avoided by <U+FB01>ll
    ing the interstices between the cylinder and the piston with an
    inevaporable liquid, and in which all the joints are kept covered
     with liquid, so that no hiding-place is allowed to the air, which
     consequently must be expelled entirely at every stroke of the
    piston.    Instead of the ordinary arrangement of two cylinders to
     balance the atmospheric pressure, I have preferred using only one,
     provided with a cover which prevents the atmosphere from press
                                         f
     ing upon its piston. The bottom , (P1. IV.), of the cylinder is bell
     shaped and ascends into the cylinder, leaving between 1ts outer
     surface and, the interior of the cylinder an annular space, bb;
     0n the upper surface of this bottom is <U+FB01>tted the valve 1;, which
     alternately closes and opens the passage, 9, to the receiver to be

 exhausted ; to the valve v is attached the rod s2, which termiq
 nates in the leathern piston q, <U+FB01>tted to a cylindrical hole bored
 out in the piston-rod ; by means of this arrangement the valve v
 is opened by the ascent of the principal piston, and closed again
 when the piston descends.      As will be seen further on, it is ne
  cessary that the valve 11 be kept closed until the piston have tra
 versed a certain part of its upward stroke; this is accomplished
 by means of the spring s, which, while compressed, overcomes
 the friction of the small piston and keeps the valve from opening;
 but after the piston has ascended the given portion of the stroke,
 it remains expanded and ceases to act upon the valve, which
 therefore opens in obedience to the efforts of the piston q.     The
 piston pp is similar in shape to the bottom of the cylinder, and
 its tubular portion works in the annular space left between the
 cylinder and its bell-shaped bottom ; into the upper part of the
piston is screwed the rod a, which also serves to <U+FB01>x the inner
edge of the leather ring dd, covering a series of apertures bored
in the <U+FB02>at top of the piston. As mentioned above, the piston
rod is bored to receive the small piston q: as this last is required
merely to open and close the lower valve, and as the compression
of the air in the upper part of the hole would interfere with its
proper action, there are channels cut uPon its surface which
allow the air to pass freely from one side of the piston to the
other.     The small piston-rod z is not <U+FB01>tted perfectlyto the
hole in the large piston-rod ; so that a narrow passage is left be
tween the space under the piston and the small cylinder in the
piston-rod, and by means of the apertures y a communication is
made between the said small cylinder and the space above the
principal piston: the effect of this arrangement is that a slight
leakage is always maintained downwards through the piston.
On the cover of the cylinder is <U+FB01>tted the self-acting valve .22, of
common construction, opening outwards, and surrounded by a
vessel containing oil so as to ensure its perfect action.
 . To prepare the machine for work, the cover of the cylinder is
removed, the piston is lowered to the bottom of its stroke, and
then, opening the cock i, oil or other inevaporable liquid is poured
through the funnel it into the cylinder, so as to cover the piston
completely; the cover being replaced and the cock shut, the ap-.
paratus is ready for action.     On moving the piston upwards, the
yalve n, if free, would also move upwards and open; but the
spring s, being in a state of tension, keeps it upon its seat : and
this is necessary, as, if the valve were free to rise, the apparatus
being full of oil, some of it would enter the tube 9, and might
pass on to the receiver; the valve is therefore kept closed by the
spring.     But as the piston is raised still higher, its tubular por
tion emerging further from the annular space bb, causes the
       u

level of the oil under the piston to lower, and consequently the
valve is left uncovered ; the spring is so arranged that, as soon
as this happens, it will have expanded so much as to be incapable
of resisting the upward effort caused by the friction of the piston
q against the principal piston-rod, and the valve 12 is therefore
carried upwards and opened.        The apparatus is now in the posi
tion shown in the <U+FB01>gure: the space below the piston was com
pletely full of oil, and the joints through which air might pene
trate are all covered with this liquid ; consequently the space left
by the motion of the piston must remain perfectly empty, at
least as regards air, as it is possible that even <U+FB01>xed oils might
emit vapour of exceedingly low tension.   The vacuous space
below the piston being now in communication with the receiver
through the tube 9, becomes <U+FB01>lled with air more or less rare<U+FB01>ed;
at the same time the air contained in the upper part of the cy
linder being compressed by the ascent of the piston, raises the
valve .z', and escapes into the atmosphere through the aperture e.
As the pressure above the piston is greater than that below            it,   a
small leakage of oil takes place downwards through the interstice
round the little piston-rod z, and dropping upon the hield
attached to the valve v, falls into the annular space bb, and
there accumulates during the ascent of the piston.         The inter
stice for leakage allows only   small quantity of oil to pass other
                                    a                              ;
wise the valve        11
                    might be over<U+FB02>owed before the piston begins
to descend, and consequently before the valve was closed.            It
will be seen that in every part of the piston’s motion its lower
edge       immersed in the oil, which prevents any lodgment of
          is
air between        and the sides of the cylinder—a circumstance

which          next to impossible to obtain in common air-pumps,
          it
          is
as the piston cannot be in perfect contact with the cylinder;      and
it   is evident that any such lodgment of air must prevent the
total exhaustion of the receiver, as     will maintain in the cylinder

the space below being full, and in fact more than full, of oil,        it    is
evident that the air extracted from the receiver must be com

small quantity of oil which passed downwards through the in
terstice around the rod 2 during the ascent of the piston.         The

space below the piston is thus reduced absolutely to nothing, and
consequently the air contained in that space is completely ex
pelled, however rare<U+FB01>ed it may have been on entering from the
receiver; and it follows that the ascent of the piston will again
leave a space perfectly empty, so that air will continue to <U+FB02>ow
 into it from the receiver so long as it has a pressure suf<U+FB01>cient to
overcome its own inertia; and the action of the pump will con
tinue perhaps for an inde<U+FB01>nite number of strokes, so that the
pressure in the receiver must soon fall so low as to become inap
preciable to our most delicate instruments.
    All the metallic parts of the pump should be made of iron, as
brass or bronze would be rapidly corroded by the oil.             As has
been explained above, a slight leakage downwards takes place
through the piston at each ascending stroke: this circumstance
renders unnecessary that the piston should <U+FB01>t perfectly to the
cylinder; so that a metallic <U+FB01>t without packing would be practi
cally suf<U+FB01>cient,    as it is enough that the leakage during one stroke
 do not exceed the volume of the tubular portion of the piston.
 In order to be able to take the machine asunder, there should be
 a screw joint in the valve-rod s 2 close to the valve.        \th11 the
 cover is removed, the upper portion of the piston-rod a un
 screwed, and the piston brought to the bottom of its stroke, the
nut on the top of the piston g may be grasped by pincers and
the rod turned so as to unscrew the joint above mentioned.           The
lower portion of the valve-rod is prevented from turning by the
tail of the valve being square in section and <U+FB01>tted intoa guide of
 similar shape.      Once the small piston is removed, nothing hin
 ders the removal of the principal piston and of the cylinder, and
then the valve 12 remains free to be examined or cleaned.            The
joints above the piston do not properly form part of          the  pump,
and the cover is adopted merely to prevent the atmosphere from
pressing upon the piston; it is therefore unnecessary to have
these joints covered with oil.

muriatic acid, and conducting the sulphuretted hydrogen into

methods, 10'7' grs. of sulphate of barytes.
    There were left, after the treatment with iodine and dilute

    From the solution by iodine, and the determination of sulphur

    It  is not possible to form any opinion as to the mineral com
 position of the insoluble portion of the meteorite, as it is doubt
 less composed of more than one unknown mineral substance.

 mean of all, we obtain the following view of the mineralogical

                        Dhurmsalla Meteoric Stone*.
     On the 14th of July, 1860, at 2.15 mm, a remarkable me
 teoric stone fell at Dhurmsalla, in the Punjab ; a small specimen
 of which was forwarded to the Geological Museum of Trinity
 College, which       I have‘analyzed, with the results contained in the
                               ‘
 following paper.                                .
     The direction of the motion of the meteorite was ascertained
 to be from N.N.W. to S.S.E.
    The cold of the fragments that fell was so intense as to benumb
 the hands of the coolies who picked them up and who were
 obliged, in consequence of their coldness, instantly to drop them.
    The speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the Trinity College specimen was found
 as follows :—                     .   _

 .  The stone is grey, close-grained, and splintery in fracture, and
presents fewer specks of metallic iron and magnetic pyrites than
usual, and was coated with the ordinary black pellicle on its outer
side.
    From 100 grs. acted on with iodine, which dissolved the alloy
of iron    and nickel, there were obtained, of peroxide ofiron 9'85
grs., and of protoxide of nickel 1'96 gr. ‘ _ ’                                  '
    The portion insoluble in iodine was next‘ ac_ted_on_by dilute
muriatic acid and evaporated to dryness at 212°, then moistened
with muriatic acid and <U+FB01>ltered, by which process it was divided
into a soluble and insoluble portion; the portion left on the
<U+FB01>lter was boiled with carbonate of soda, so as to dissolve the free                       .
silica, which was found to be 18'95 grs. This was added to the
portion originally soluble in muriatic acid, so as to give the fol
lowing results :—

in this meteorite is Chrysolith, or the silicate of magnesia and
iron represented by the formula

     XXXIV.      On the Development            of Hydrogen from        the Anode.
                        By Professor           W. BEETZ‘I‘.
 IF     9. solution of an alkali or an alkaline earth be decomposed
       between magnesium          electrodes, the negative wire undergoes
 no change either in appearance or weight, whilst the positive
 wire is dissolved with simultaneous evolution of hydrogen. The
 development of this gas under such circumstances was observed
 byWiShler and Bu<U+FB01>'I in the case of another metal, aluminium ;
 the process, however, was rendered more intricate by the pre
 sence of a considerable        quantity of silicon, and the consequent
 formation of siliciuretted hydrogen. The greater simplicity of
 the action when magnesium is used recommends                           the employ
 ment of this metal for observations on this unusual electrolysis ;
 for by its means we may not only trace the causes which act in
 this case, but likewise those in<U+FB02>uencing the phenomena observed
 when the terminals consist of aluminium wires.
     The magnesium wire made use of in the following experi
 ments was from the works of Johnson, Matthey, and Co., of

 being represented by 2‘84 per cent. of Cr2 0”, and by 4'16 per cent. of

 fell at Nobleborough, Maine, U.S.A., on the 7th of August, 1823, Web

270               Prof. W.   Beetz on the Development        of
London.      Unfortunately     I
                               could not procure wire of any other
thickness than that of a moderate-sized         knitting-needle, one
metre weighing 0'44 grm.        When exposed to the action of the
current it was uncommonly quickly dissolve-d, so that I had to
construct a special voltameter in order to maintain the action for
a suf<U+FB01>cient length of time.       Two holes (a and b) were bored
through the under surface of a
glass vessel (see <U+FB01>gure), and
closed with tight-<U+FB01>tting corks.
A round piece of caoutchouc was
<U+FB01>rmly cemented on each of these
corks by means of gutta percha,
and on each of these india-rubber
plates was fastened a funnel
shaped cap (0 and d). The wires
(e and f) were passed through
the corks and caoutchouc plates from below, so that the under
surface of the vessel remained water-tight.      Over the two funnels
were eudiometers, held in their places by supports. A partition
of porous ware (g) divides the vessel into two cells. The posi
tive wire is quickly dissolved, and to replace it as fast as used,
fresh wire is pushed up from below.        Were it not surrounded
by the cap  (0)
              it  would be immediately eaten through at the point
projecting from the caoutchouc plate, where in fact the cur
rent  ismost powerful.      The piece thus separated         is
                                                          carried-away
by  the gas, and the experiment rendered useless for quantitative
purposes.     If an experiment      to be interrupted without leav
                                   is
ing the wires exposed to the action of the electrolyte, they must
be withdrawn, the edges of the holes in the caoutchouc plates
closing the opening.
   The gas from the anode never ignited spontaneously in fact     ;
the magnesium contained so small         trace of silicium that the
                                           a
formation of siliciuretted hydrogen was not to be expected. Ana
lysis of the gas showed       to consist of hydrogen alone.
                             it                                     The
 accompanying phenomena at the positive wire, and the relative
quantities of gas disengaged from the two poles, differed very
 greatly according to the nature of the electrolytes used;         was,
                                                                      it
 however, in these accompanying circumstances that the cause of
 the anomalous development of hydrogen was found.
    For most of my experiments         employed
                                       I              solution of sul

                                                    secondary action.
The action was very similar to that which Wiihler and Buff
observed in the case of aluminium in         solution of its chloride;

noticed, however, that as soon as the wire was dipped in the

particles of this coating  were thrown of, rendering the solution
in the eudiometer over the anode turbid.     But in this 02186 also
the ratio of the, quantities of hydrogen at the two poles was so
nearly constant that this could scarcely be looked upon as an
accidental coincidence.   The subjoined Table contains the results
of my determinations in seven        cries of experiments.     The
column headed Cu gives the weight in grammes of metal thrown
down in a copper voltameter introduced into the circuit; H__
and H+ show the number of cubic centimetres of hydrogen re
duced to 0° and 760 millims. pressure, respectively developed at
the negative and positive poles.    The columns superscribed Mg
denote the quantities of magnesium equivalent, as the headings
show, to the copper in the voltameter, to the hydrogen at the
negative electrode, to the hydrogen at the positive electrode, and
lastly to the sum of the two last mentioned, whilst the <U+FB01>nal
column (Loss) gives the decrease in weight of the positive wire
during electrolysis.

malous  development of hydrogen.       endeavoured, therefore, to       I
isolate               it,
          and succeeded to      certain extent in doing so.   Ifa                                                        a

nesium electrodes (the negative plate can be replaced by a pla
tinum electrode), a considerable quantity of black matter at once
deposits on the positive pole.     Part of this substance is swept
off by the current of gas, part falls to the bottom. A gas is con
tinually being developed from this substance, even when it is no
longer in contact with the plate on which it was deposited.
Collected in a eudiometer and analyzed, the gas proved to be
hydrogen.      If during the electrolysis the cudiometer be held
<U+FB01>rmly upon its caoutchouc plate so that none of the black
matter can fall out, the current of course not being stopped,
and     lastly, the measuring of the gas-volumes, when the current
       if,
has ceased, be delayed till there     no longer any gas disengaged
                                                         is

of hydrogen evolved from the two poles          again equivalent to        is
the magnesium dissolved; the ratio of the two gas-volumes,

    then be clearly distinguished by a pocket-lens.      Though     had I
    on this  account  to abandon analyzing this  body, its nature could
    be inferred from other circumstances.         If
                                                 the black precipitate,
    well washed, be placed in dilute acid, it dissolves with evolution
    of hydrogen.     The solution contains no chlorine, so that it was
    not necessarily the electrolysis of a chloride which had caused
    the formation of this body ; it is moreover identical with the in
    crustation formed in the solution of sulphate of magnesium.      A
     substance which by decomposition of water and development of
     hydrogen oxidizes to magnesia, could only be magnesium, or a
     lower Oxide of this metal, subozride of magnesium.           As the rela
     tion between the amount of the body dissolved and the volume
     of hydrogen generated could not be determined, this point could
     not be settled by analytical means.         But, apart from the fact
     that no cause at all can be found why a separation of spongy
-    magnesium should only take place at the positive pole, the pre
     cipitate in its electrical comportment resembled an oxide.              If
     the current of a battery be passed through very dilute sulphuric
     acid between magnesium       electrodes, the positive wire becomes
     immediately black. If the two wires be now connected with a
     galvanometer by means of the reverser, the positive wire is <U+FB01>rst
     positive and then becomes immediately powerfully negative, re
     maining so till the black incrustation has vanished.               In an
     experiment the image of the scale of my re<U+FB02>ecting galvanometer
     moved ten divisions to the positive side, but with the next swing
    'of the mirror went over to the <U+FB01>ftieth division on the negative
     side, remained motionless there, and then went very slowly back
     to zero, whilst the wire became <U+FB01>rst covered with white spots
     and then entirely white.      When I <U+FB01>rst observed this phenome
    non  I   thought     I
                        had to do with an action similar to that already
     noticed in the case of iron*, to which I gave the name of “ ano
     malous polarization,” but which Wiedemann-l‘ has called “ posi
     tive polarization.”      Isoon saw, however, that there were two
     different things to be distinguished here—a polarization, and the
     electromotive action of the black incrustation.             The <U+FB01>rst de
     <U+FB02>ection, the positive, is to be ascribed to a polarization.          This
     quickly vanishes, and is caused by the development of hydrogen ;
     for even in dilute acid hydrogen is evolved from the magnesium
     anode during electrolysis.     That the negative plate appears not
     to be the most strongly positively polarized,           but the positive
     plate covered with a negative layer of oxide, is not without pre
     cedent ; for the negative body covered with hydrogen is often
     more positive than the positive itself: for instance, platinum in
     a gas-battery, when covered with hydrogen, is more positive than

  copper*.      In any case, however, the second de<U+FB02>ection shows
  that the black precipitate is negative towards magnesium; the
  negative nature vanishes with the black body itself.             The entire
  proceeding is     moreover    independent     of the  closing of  the secon
  dary battery.      If  the  battery-current    be  broken   and   connexion
  with the galvanometer be made only after the lapse of some
  time, the blackened wire is immediately negative; if the mag.
  nesium wires be not connected with the instrument till the black
  incrustation is gone, scarcely any electrical difference is then
  observed between them.          Similar experiments can also be made
  with other conducting liquids; the process, however, is more
  intricate and furnishes no de<U+FB01>nite results, because hydrate of
  magnesia may be formed on both wires, which is not possible
  when dilute acids are employed.                                        p
      The <U+FB01>rst idea which presented itself with regard to the parti
  cipation of the suboxide in the development of hydrogen was,
  that the current only partly decomposed the salts of the solu
  tions in the normal manner, and partly the water itself.               If, for
  example,     mH   were   given  off  from   the  cathode   in a  solution   of
  chloride of sodium, and pH from the anode, the quantity of
  magnesium dissolved       is, according to the experiments described,
   =(m +p)Mg.         Let   the current so divide itself that     it   decom
  pose   .r equivalents   of  water, then   .20  and   (m—w)Cl    will  be set
  free.     The latter combines with (m—a') Mg, leaving (p+.'r) Mg,
  which forms an oxide with x0. When this compound has been
   completely oxidized to magnesia,        it   contains (p+.r) MgO.         If
   we could determine this quantity experimentally, we should also
   know .25 the portion of the current that decomposes water.              I
'
   examined therefore, <U+FB01>rst of all, whether the quantity of magnesia
   formed in the nascent state, in     a   salt liquid holding chloride of
   magnesium     in  solution, was    considerable.     0'067’ grm. of mag
   nesium wire, equivalent to 62'6 cubic centims. of hydrogen, was
   placed under   a  eudiometer in   a    solution of common salt which
   had frequently been used for electrolysis with magnesium, until
   the wire had crumbled away to      a    White powder.      The liquid was
   <U+FB01>ltered off from the precipitate; the latter was washed on the
   <U+FB01>lter, and then dissolved in dilute ulphurie acid. After evapo
   rating this liquid, 0'328 grm. of sulphate of magnesia remained,
   which  is  equivalent to 00656 grm. of magnesium, or 61'1 cubic
   centims. of hydrogen. 62'5 cubic centims. of hydrogen had
   been given off.      It thus een that no appreciable quantity of
                         is
 magnesia      had been dissolved.
    Solution of chloride of sodium was now decomposed between
 magnesium electrodes, and, after the black precipitate had been
 converted into the white powder, the above process repeated.

 Two experiments gave the following results :—

           Found.          magnesia.       Calculated.

    According to this, the quantity of sulphate of magnesia was
‘equivalent to the hydrogen evolved; that is to say, p+w=p,
  and consequently w=0.     The black precipitate was therefore
 not produced by the action of the current, but by a purely che
 mical process.
   The black incrustation nevertheless required the agency of the
 current  for its formation.         A bright magnesium wire, when
placed  in  distilled  water,   is but  feebly attacked; some hydrogen
is developed, and a thin <U+FB01>lm of hydrate of magnesia covers the
wire, protecting it from further change.           It was not noticed that
this oxidation is preceded by the formation of the suboxide.            If
the part not immersed be touched by a platinum wire, which
likewise dips into the acid, the magnesium then becomes black;
on stopping the current the incrustation dissolves.             In a solu
tion of chloride of sodium a magnesium wire long retained its
metallic lustre; when touched with a platinum wire, as above
described, it turns immediately black.           Moreover, even without
the use of platinum, black spots form on the wire, whence a
black incrustation soon spreads over its entire surface. A copious
quantity of hydrogen is now evolved from it. The <U+FB01>rst black
spot is due to local currents arising from small inequalities of the
surface: as soon as the <U+FB01>rst spot is formed, local currents of greater
intensity are produced.          But these currents do not, any more
than that of the battery, decompose the water, but the salt in the
solution; the part, therefore, which the current plays in the
formation of the 'suboxide is no other than that of continually
exposing fresh metallic surfaces to the action of the water.
   The several phenomena which different salt solutions present
are now easily to be explained.           In chloride of ammonium, the
suboxide dissolves immediately on its formation, with evolution
of hydrogen, because magnesia               is,
                                            as    rule, soluble in ammo
                                                  a
niacal salts.     In solution of chloride of sodium changes, with
                                                        it
out being dissolved, into hydrate of magnesia, because chloride
 ofmagnesium forms no basic salt with magnesia.              On the other
hand,     dissolves to
         it                  certain degree, and with evolution of hy

salt   isgenerated. This basic compound appears to be formed

     positive aluminium wire to the ready solubility of the basic chlo
     ride of aluminium.        This, though undoubtedly a true cause,
'
     is not the sole one.     It is to be presumed, from what has gone
     before, that the development of hydrogen from the aluminium
      and the magnesium has a common origin; besides, the positive
      aluminium wire also becomes black (luring electrolysis, and at
      the end of the process continues to give of hydrogen, like the
     magnesium wire, only not so abundantly.          All the cases of elec
     trolysis  examined    by   WViihler and   Buff furnished   a solution of
     basic chloride of aluminium; and it never occurred to them to
     investigate cases of a different kind, their interest being concen
     trated on the formation of siliciuretted hydrogen.          If in place
     of a strong solution of chloride of sodium a dilute one be em
     ployed, the alumina is no longer completely soluble, and the ex
     periment then bears a greater resemblance to that with magne
     sium. The wire not only turns black, but the whole of the liquid
  '
     in  the eudiometer becomes grey.         A grey powder separates from
     the wire, and continues to evolve hydrogen after the electrolysis
     is interrupted.    I have never seen it become entirely white.        If
     washed on a <U+FB01>lter and treated with dilute hydrochloric acid, it
     completely dissolves; it contained no silicium, or only tri<U+FB02>ing
     quantities, like the aluminium wire itself, which I obtained from
  '
     the same source as the magnesium wire used in the foregoing
     experiments.     The solution contained iron, however ; and to this
     the grey colour may possibly have been due.            The electrolysis
     observed by Wohler and Bud with concentrated solution of chlo
    ride of sodium between aluminium wires corresponds therefore
    entirely to that, examined by me, of solution of sulphate of mag
    nesium between magnesium electrodes; we ought consequently
    to <U+FB01>nd also in the latter case the nearly constant ratio of H._ : H+.
    The electrolysis of dilute solution of common salt no longer gave
    this preportion ; on the contrary, I invariably found the alumi
    nium dissolved to be equivalent to two-thirds of the quantity of
    hydrogen given off from the two poles.            I  believe, therefore,
    that in the case of aluminium also the formation of a suboxide
    precedes the evolution of hydrogen.           A peculiar circumstance
    prevents the separation of this suboxide.           On account of the
    solubility of the basic chloride, no great quantity of the substance
    could be obtained either from dilute solution of chloride of sodium
    or from dilute hydrochloric acid.        In other salt solutions and in
    dilute sulphuric acid, however, no evolution of hydrogen takes
    place; here, on the contrary, the phenomenon is that which has
    been already described by Bu<U+FB02>‘*.         The positive aluminium wire
   becomes covered with a dark incrustation, which is strongly
    electro-negative and a very bad conductor; it gives off a little

   nearly reduced to nil. Bu<U+FB01>' regarded this inclustation as sili
   cium.     The formation of a coating of silicium is undoubtedly
   quite conceivable; for our aluminium always contains some.                      I
  have, however, a reason for not regarding this <U+FB01>lm as silicium:
  pour some silicium powder into a glass tube the lower end of
   which is closed with parchment paper; dip this end into dilute
   sulphuric acid ; then place one aluminium wire in the acid and
  another in the silicium, and in every case the silicium is found
  to be positive towards the aluminium.           It matters not in this
  experiment which of the wires be <U+FB01>rst dipped in the solution,
  the aluminium wire immersed in the acid is invariably negative.
  If the current be weak on account of the bad conducting-power
'
   of the silicium, it is only necessary to press the aluminium wire
   strongly against the powder in order to bring its particles more
  closely in contact with one another—a method previously adopted
  by me when using substances in a pulverized state*. The sili
   cium which I employed was crystalline.           Amorphous silicium
'was not readily procurable at the time, though I had a body
  which comports itself in a precisely analogous manner—amor
  phous boron. This body, when treated in the same manner with
  aluminium wires, was also distinctly positive. The badly-con-'
  ducting incrustation therefore could hardly be silicium ; I regard
it,   on the contrary, as     asuboxide of aluminium.      At all events
  this suboxide        very bad conductor,        consequently does not

 XXXV.       On a Problem in the Calculus of Variations, in reply to
    Mr. Todhunter.          By Professor CHALLIS, M.A., F.R.S'.,
   F.R.A.S.*
 I   HAVE only
 which
       problem
         is
                 in
                       a few concluding words to say respecting the
                     the  Calculus of Variations, the consideration of
            resumed by Mr. Todhunter in the September Number,
the discussion of it having advanced to a stage at which, so far at
least as my views are concerned, a de<U+FB01>nite issue may be stated.
I  have all along understood the problem to be that which Mr.
Todhunter has thus enunciated : To determine the greatest solid
of revolution, the surface of which is given, and which cuts the
axis at two <U+FB01>xed points.         The generating line of the surface    I
suppose to be subject also to the condition of being continuous,
so far as not to change its direction per saltum.          It has been
shown in the course of this discussion that different lines ful<U+FB01>l
ling this condition, together with that of cutting the axis at the
two points, give solids having the same super<U+FB01>cies but different
degrees of magnitude.          As these gradations cannot go on unli-
mitedly, there must be a limiting or maximum solid the surface
of which ful<U+FB01>ls the same conditions.           Itv would be possible by
practical tentative methods, although it would be an unscienti<U+FB01>c
proceeding, to mould a given quantity of matter into the required
form.     The maximum, therefore, exists in rerum naturti ; and to
the discovery of its form by analysis all my efforts have been di
rected.     I cannot recognize as having any claim to be called the
solution of the problem a form which does not ful<U+FB01>l the above
conditions.
                             I
   In the July Number have given two investigations—one de
pending on the equation Ap=0, and the other on A=0.                    I
showed at the same time that the former equation could only
give a line symmetrical with respect to the axis of revolution,
and consequently, if any, only a conditional maximum, and that
the absolute maximum must be deduced from the equation           A:  0.
Further, it was inferred from the radical involved in A (assuming
always that the function or functions to be found admit of exact
algebraic expression), that the equation A=0 should be resolved

  into  A' =0 and A” =0, to meet the case of two ordinates to the
  same abscissa.     The equation Ap=0 did not require the same
  resolution, on account of its ful<U+FB01>lling the above-mentioned con
  dition of symmetry.       Having on these principles obtained, by
  processes which    will be presently again adverted to, two solids
  of de<U+FB01>nite forms, I proceeded to apply tests to ascertain whether
  they were really maxima.        It is well known that results given
  by the rules for <U+FB01>nding maxima and minima must satisfy certain
  criteria before they can be pronounced to be solutions of the
  proposed questions.      In default of general criteria, it is neces
  sary in the Calculus of Variations to have recourse to tests by
  trial of particular instances.     The tests   I  applied happened to
 accord with the supposition of maxima; and          I   concluded, it ap
 pears on insuf<U+FB01>cient grounds, that such was the character of the
 two forms. .Mr. Todhunter, by a more skilful application of
 tests, has proved (in the September Number) that the forms in
 question are not maxima. ' Of course I admit without reserva
 tion that all the inferences     I  drew from the supposed maxima
 fall to the ground. By availing myself of this correction of my
 mistakes I have been enabled to arrive at some de<U+FB01>nite conclu
 sions respecting the proper process for solving the problem, to
 which    I shall direct attention after giving a few preliminary ex-      '
 planations.
     Relative to the solution drawn from the equation A=O, Mr.
 Todhunter urges that “ we have to satisfy both A' =0 and
                                      I
 A”=0.” This I conceive that have done.                I   have employed
 integrals of these equations which may be written        s y'da'=M' + C'
 and     y”d.z'=M"+C”,      the  former of which satis<U+FB01>es      A'=0,  and
 the   other A”=0, as is    evident by simply differentiating them.
 Also the equations     are thus satis<U+FB01>ed by general or inde<U+FB01>nite in
 tegrals, which is an indispensable condition.         I  next proceed to
 use these values of Sy'alz and qud-Z' strictly according to the in
 dications of the analysis, always taking into account that y' and
g” are ordinates to the same abscissa, and        I obtain de<U+FB01>nite inte
grals between the values p = in<U+FB01>nity and          p:   O.    The result is
that the area cut off by the larger ordinate is equal to the length
of the bounding curve multiplied by the constant 7t.              As that
ordinate cuts the curve at right angles, this result indicates that
the curve is a circle of radius 7t.       Every step of this process is
legitimate if the next preceding step is legitimate ; and therefore
the legitimacy of the result depends on the equations A'=0 and
A" =0 having been both satis<U+FB01>ed.             All this argument, how
ever, presupposes that the equation of the curve admits of de<U+FB01>
nite algebraic expression, the resolution itself into two equations
being an operation performed on algebraic principles.

280                 Prof. Challis  on a Problem   in
    Up to this point the reasoning is the same as that in the July
Number.      The subsequent reasoning there proceeds on the as
sumption that the centre of the circle might be placed so as to
make the curve pass through the given points.          But Mr. Tod
hunter has pointed out that in that case the equation A=O is
not satis<U+FB01>ed.    I <U+FB01>nd, in fact, on making the trial, that the equa.
tion is satis<U+FB01>ed only when the centre of the circle is on the straight
linejoining the two points.      Hence it follows that the line is a
semicircle the extremities of which are coincidentwith the points.
But this cannot be the case unless the given surface is equal to
that of a sphere of which the interval between the points is a
diameter; so that we have thus solved only a very restricted
case of the general problem.      It is to be observed that this result
has been obtained by using exclusively the equation A=O, and
therefore without assuming, as is done when the equation Ap=0
is used, that the line is symmetrical with respect 'to the axis of
revolution.    Thus, considering the premises of the argument, we
may conclude from it that, so far as is indicated by the equation
A=O, the problem admits of no exact algebraic solution except
the restricted one just mentioned.
    lVith respect to the deductions I made from the equation
Ap=0, I have ascertained that a logical fault was committed
where Iused the equation y'=c instead of the equation y=0,
the latter having been obtained by the integration of the com
plete differential equation Ap=0, and therefore not admitting of
being superseded by integrating p=0. Also the before-men
tioned condition of symmetry would seem to require that the
 straight line should be coincident with the axis of .2“. Having
abandoned the solution depending on the equation g=c, I have
no occasion to meet the objection that it did not satisfy A=O as
well as Ap=0; but the present argument necessitates the re
mark that this objection remains valid against the solution
which Mr. Todhunter advocates in the Magazine for June, viz.
that in which the required line consists partly of a straight line
 coincident with the axis, and partly of a semicircle.     He himself
 shows that, so far as regards the straight line, A=2)~, and then
 proceeds to meet the dif<U+FB01>culty by arguing a posteriori that at any
 rate a maximum is obtained. ‘Vithout denying the truth of this
 conclusion,   I assert that the dif<U+FB01>culty is in this way evaded
 rather than met and overcome.          The real explanation may,     I
 believe, be derived from the result of the foregoing discussitn
 of the cquationA: 0. It is there shown that that equation is satis
 <U+FB01>ed by no de<U+FB01>nite algebraic integral ful<U+FB01>lling the condition of a
 maximum.       This being the case, suppose that we have obtained
 from the equation Ap=0 a de<U+FB01>nite algebraic solution; this £0
 lution cannot satisfy A=O throughout; for if so, the latter equa

tion would be compatible with a de<U+FB01>nite algebraic solution,
which is contrary to what was before proved.           Thus, under the
circumstances of this problem, Ap=0 and A=O are not equiva_
lent equations, only the former admitting of an exact form of so
lution; on which account I still think I am right in calling the
solution a conditional maximum, the condition in this instance
being that the line be symmetrical with respect to the axis of on
There can be no question that a maximum is in this manner
really obtained, if only for the reason that of all solids, regular
or irregular, of given surface, the sphere is the greatest; but evi
dently the maximum we are in search of must not be subjected
to that condition.     It may also be noticed that the solution,
since it gives a discontinuous line, is analogous to that of the
problem of the shortest course of a ship, and con<U+FB01>rmatory of the
principle that the Calculus of Variations is comprehensive of dis
continuous solutions.
    I  can see no good reason for the attempt (in the September
                          “
 Number) to show that a <U+FB01>gure formed of an arc of a semicircle
and a straight line which coincides in direction with the bound
 ing diameter” may be regarded as a continuous <U+FB01>gure, nor do            I
 perceive What bearing this idea has on the treatment of the pro
 blem. WVhat objection can there be to the common-sense view
 that such a <U+FB01>gure is discontinuous? Also       I   cannot forbear noti
 cing what strikes me as an inconsistency, where, at the close of
 his communication, Mr. Todhunter <U+FB01>rst expresses the opinion
 that the use of the equation Ap=0 may be dispensed with, and
 then states that he accepts, as the only true solution of the
 problem, one which is actually derived from the equation A])=O,
 and is not derivable from the equation A=O.           It cannot but be
 a right rule of analysis, to regard as non-equivalent expressions
 symbolically distinguished.
    The following are the conclusions I have come to from this
 reconsideration of the question :—
     (1) The Calculus of Variations furnishes no other solution in
 de<U+FB01>nite algebraic form than that which gives for the generating
 line of the surface a discontinuous line, consisting partly of a
 semicircle and partly of a straight line coincident with the axis.
 But this solution does not satisfy the conditions of cutting the
 axis at the given points, and of continuity of form.
     (2) In order to satisfy those conditions, it is necessary to inte
 grate the equation A=O by successive approximations; which
 being done, the value of y is obtained in a series which is not
 the development of a de<U+FB01>nite algebraic function of w.                    _
    The form of the surface might thus be obtained for different
 sets of numerical values of the constants.       I do not know what
 dif<U+FB01>culties would be met with in the attempt to effect such ap

proximate integrations, but         I   do not apprehend that they would
be insuperable.
  For the sake of further    illustration of the principles of the
Calculus of Variations, I propose to conclude with some remarks
on a problem similar to the one that has been under discussion,
but not to be confounded with it. Let it be required to <U+FB01>nd
the greatest solid of revolution of given super<U+FB01>cies, the genera
ting line of the surface consisting of ordinates perpendicular to
the axis at two given points, and of a curve connecting them.
Mr. Todhunter proposed this problem in p. 410 of his ‘ History
of the Calculus of Variations,’ and in all essential points effected
the solution of it by proving that the curve must join on conti
nuously with the ordinates, and that the ordinates must be equal.
In the Philosophical Magazine for August 1861,          found thatI
the relation between the ordinate y and the length 8 of the curve
could be thus expressed:

ni<U+FB01>cance here as in the former problem, and the curved line                      is
altogether continuous.     In the March Number of this year,                     I
have called in question the truth of this solution; but as this

 THE
   milar molecules    has already been considered(vol. xxx. p. 109).
 We must now contemplate it more in detail, and take note of
 certain distinctions and possible difference of result.   We have
 seen that two dissimilar molecules have an af<U+FB01>nity for each other
 when    their unequal molecular forces are so related that under
their mutual action the atmospheres become polarized—that                          is,
the electric tether accumulates  upon one of the two contiguous
sides, and    partly expelled from the other, so that the former
                 is
will be positive and the latter negative.      The attraction that
results from this disturbance of the electric equilibrium consti
tutes, as we conceive, the proper force      a<U+FB01>nity or chemical at
                                                       of
traction.   Itordinarily comes into operation beyond the outer limit
of the molecular attraction proper     0. beyond(i.   <U+FB01>g.    0 203,
                                                                 0,     1,   p.
vol. xxviii.), and draws the particles   nearer together until they
come within the range of this attraction, which then determines
their complete and permanent union.       The force of electrical
attraction or af<U+FB01>nity thus brought into play should ultimately
diminish,    not pass off entirely,
            if                                  by
                                      reason of the electric dis
charge that would ensue between the particles. Heat or the
electric spark  may increase the natural force of af<U+FB01>nity  auga          by
menting the natural polarization that the molecular forces may
have initiated.    In fact all the various circumstances upon
which the union of two dissimilar molecules depends are but
so many   different circumstances    under which the molecules
become polarized            by
                       their-natural mutual action more or less
modi<U+FB01>ed.
   We have seen (vol. xxx. p. 99) that compound molecule, when
                                                  a
formed, becomes invested with its own proper atmosphere, and                             v
so comes into special   relations with other molecules, whether
simple or compound, similar or dissimilar. The density and
extentof such an atmosphere may vary widely with the degree

284              Prof. Norton on Molecular Physics.
of approximation of the elementary       particles and. other parti
culars.
    The relations of heat to chemical phenomena may be deduced
from the' principles already stated.      The heat of combination
results from the condensation of the electric aether that takes
place between the uniting particles, and from the compression of
their individual electric atmospheres—one or both of these effects.
Both of these effects should give rise to an emission of universal
                                                      '
tether in heat-pulses.
    But, according to Favre and Silbermann, certain substances
combine with an attendant absorption instead of an evolution of
heat.    To understand how this may happen, we must observe
that, according to the received ideas of the true nature of che
mical processes, the molecules of all substances are composed of
two or more atoms associated together ,' and when two substances
combine, it generally happens that one or both of the two mole
cules presented to each other is decomposed, and two new com
pound molecules are formed by condensation.        Now the decom
position that precedes the combination should occasion a loss of
heat by reason of the expansion of the electric aether condensed
between the constituent molecules (or “ chemical atoms ”), and of
the atmospheres of these molecules; and the subsequent combi
nation by the reverse process should develope heat.       If the loss
of heat from the one cause exceeds the gain from the\ other,
there will be an effective absorption of heat as the result of the
combination.      On the other hand, when chemical combination
 occasions an evolution of heat, it is in general because the heat
absorbed while the decomposition        of individual molecules is
going on, is afterwards more than restored by the heat deve
loped in the combination that succeeds the decomposition.       Thus
when oxygen and hydrogen combine to form water, heat is
evolved because, as we conceive, much less heat is lost in the
decomposition of the binary molecule of oxygen than is pro
duced in the union of the two separated molecules          (chemical
atoms) of oxygen, each with a molecule of hydrogen.         In some
instances, as in the formation of the hydrate of lime, the mole
 cules would seem to combine without any previous decomposi
tion, and any tendency, therefore, to absorption of heat. In the
 decomposition of substances, as well as in their combination, it
 is found that heat may either be absorbed or evolved.          This
 fact admits of a similar explanation     to that just given.     M.
  Schroder Van der Kolk,' in a memoir “On the Mechanical
 Energy of Chemical Action,” a translation of which is given in
 the April Number of the Philosophical Magazine (1865), lays
down the following law of decomposition :—“ Bodies which evolve
 heat in being decomposed by heat are not again formed in the

                Prof. Norton on Molecular Physics.              _   285
subsequent cooling.”   According to what has just been stated,
all such bodies must evolve heat because of the electric conden
sation that attends the formation of new compound molecules
after the primitive molecules have been decomposed.      Now, if
these new molecules be cooled, the tendency would be to increase
the molecular        attraction by which their constituents are held
together,     rather   than to favour their decomposition. The in
stances cited,     viz.  protoxide of nitrogen, peroxide of hydrogen,
chlorous and chloric acids, the chloride, iodide, and sulphide of
 nitrogen, seem to sustain this explanation.
   -
     It is frequently found by experiment that if heat is absorbed
in the act of decomposition, the separated components will re
unite on cooling.         It is probable that in such instances there
is no formation of new molecules following the <U+FB01>rst decomposi-_
tion, and that the heat which may be absorbed in addition to
 that consumed in the act of separation, is due solely to an expan
sion taking place after the receding molecules have been urged
 beyond the limit of molecular attraction and become subject to
 molecular repulsion.          In that event a subsequent cooling, by
 contracting the atmospheres of the molecules and so increasing
 their attractive force, might favour a reunion.         Hydrate of lime
 may be cited as a case admitting of this explanation.
     We have seen that heat, by expanding and augmenting the
repulsive energy of molecular, atmospheres, tends virtually to
 polarize a surface positively, and that in this fact we have thc
 probable origin of thermo-electricity (l.    c.p. 276) and the explana
                                                   ,
 tion of the effect of heat in the development           of electricity

friction (l.   c.
               p.    108).     The same polarizing action of heat should
favour the oxidation of metallic surfaces.         The condensing action
of   platinum and certain other metals upon gases, and of sur-\
faces generally upon aqueous vapour with evolution of heat (see
 Silliman’s American Journal, vol. xxxviii. p. 109), may be referred
to   a polarization developed by the mutual action of the surface
and the gas 'or vapour.          The attraction thus resulting, we must
suppose, is     not in general suf<U+FB01>cient to bring the gases within the
range of the natural molecular attraction, and so into complete
union with the surface.
     Combination    by   Volume—The assumption     is     now generally
made, that the molecules of all substances in the gaseous state
occupy the same volume.             This conclusion, to which chemists
have been conducted, implies that there are the same number of
molecules in equal volumes of different substances, and therefore
that the elastic tension of the individual molecules      is    the same
for all gases.      This result corresponds with the determination of
the repulsive energy of molecules at the greater distances, as given.

depends upon the pressure to which the molecular atmospheres
are exposed (vol. xxx. p. 99, foot-note) ; and this, in gases, must
depend mainly upon the barometric pressure, and be constant for
the same pressure.   It is to be observed that the results given in
Table I. hold good for compound molecules, provided as they are
with their own especial atmospheres     c. p. 99), as well as for sim

   The received theory among chemists, of combination by volume,
is in entire accordance with these results derived from our theory
of molecular forces, and with the conception to which we have
been led of the constitution of simple and compound molecules
  (vol. xxx. p. 98, &c.).     If we suppose, with the chemists, that in
 general the ultimate molecule is'composed of two
                                                          “ atoms,” this
 is equivalent to saying,    in  the language of the present theory, that
 the ultimate molecule is a compound molecule consisting of two
 simple molecules united together, and provided with its own
                                       '
 proper atmosphere.
     All such binary molecules of elementary gases will occupy,
 as we have seen, the same space, which may be called the unit
 pf volume,      If 12 represent any given volume, as a cubic inch,
 and n the number of atoms in             then this unit of volume will

                     the general result   is
gas are formed.          This implies that each of the binary mole
cules     is   decomposed, each atom of the one combines with one
of the other, and thus two new compound molecules are formed,
each occupying one unit of volume.        If, as in the formation of
carbonic acid, one volume of one gas unites with one volume of
another, and one volume of compound gas            formed, we must
                                                         is
suppose that the two binary molecules unite, as wholes, and form
one new molecule containing four atoms associated in pairs.
Again,       as in the formation of aqueous vapour, two volumes of
               if,
one gas combine with one of the other, and two volumes are
formed, we now have two molecules         and    combining with one,

 with a, and another with I): thus each molecule of water con
 tains two atoms of hydrogen, associated with one atom of oxy
 gen.    If, as in the production of ammonia, three volumes unite
 with one, and two volumes are produced, three molecules must
 combine with one and two new compound molecules result.
 This implies that the single molecule and one of the three mole
 cules are decomposed, and that the disunited atoms combine
 with the other two.      If the molecules of the two gases, or va
 pours, that combine be ever so complex, and the same number
 of volumes unite as we have above supposed, with the same result
 as to the number of volumes produced, the processes will be es
 sentially the same as just indicated. Each compound molecule
[will occupy one unit of volume, whatever number of atoms, or
 groups of atoms,       may contain.

    The decomposition of molecules which occurs in such cases

288             Prof. Norton on Molecular Physics.
must be attributed to the molecular polarization that precedes
and accompanies the act of combination, in conjunction with,
under special circumstances, the exertion of a separating force
due to heat, light, or an electric current. We have seen already,
in considering the process of decomposition of a molecule of
water by the chemical action of zinc (vol. xxx. p. 110), that such
action upon one of the elements of a binary compound tends to
separate it from the other, if the two are in conducting commu
nication—as they would be in every true compound molecule, by
reason of the electric aether condensed between them.
    Chemical Action of the Actinic Rays—WVe understand by the
actinic rays, the solar rays of high ret'rangibility, which are capa-v
ble of producing chemical c<U+FB02>'ects entirely distinct from the effects
of heat.    From the view we have taken of the origin of rays of
heat and light (vol. xxviii. p. 430 866.) , we are led to conceive of all
the solar radiations as essentially of the same nature, and differing
only in the rapidity of vibration and in'the intensity of the im—
pulses propagated in the ray, and that they owe these differences
to the fact that they originate in the vibrations of the atomettes
of molecular atmospheres posited at various distances from the
central atoms of the molecules      c.
                                  (l.   p.430) . The most refrangiblc
actinic rays should then emanate from the atomettes that lie
at the greatest distances from these atoms.
    The chemical action of light, and of the actinic rays in general,
appears to be    a consequence of the feeble repulsive individual
impulses propagated in the rays that originate in the upper por
tions of molecular atomospheres.         Such feeble impulses cannot
penetrate far into the molecular atmospheres upon which they
fall, and must pass around them. They should accordingly tend
to urge aportion of the electric aether that may lie in their route
around to the further side of the molecule, and so to bring            it
into  a state of positive electrization.     The nature of the action
that will ensue in consequence, upon the next molecule beyond
that which receives the ray, must depend upon whether there            is
an electric conducting connexion between the two or not.               If
there be such connexion, the tendency of the action of the free
electricity set in motion will be to separate or decompose the
two molecules, which, in the case supposed, will be chemically
united.     The action here considered       isessentially the same as
that which occurs in the decomposition of water        by .zinc (vol. xxx.
p. 110). Most cases of the chemical action of light would seem
to be explicable upon this idea.    Thus, we may explain the action
of light upon an explosive mixture of chlorine and hydrogen by
the decomposition of the elementary molecules of the two gases,
 and the resulting formation of two molecules of hydrochloric
 acid.   The reduction of the chloride of silver to subchloride by

        Prof. Matteucci     on the Origin   of Muscular Power.                289
 the action of light might result from the same general tendency
 to effect a decomposition of united molecules.
    Heat may in some cases produce the same chemical result as
 light, or the actinic rays generally. For example, it explodes
 the mixture of chlorine and hydrogen. But the effect must be
 ascribed to the repulsive action of the heat-pulses taken up by
 the molecular atmospheres at considerable depths below their
 surface ; whereas the separating action of the actinic rays is pro
 bably due to a movement of the electric aether effected at the
 surface of the atmospheres.         It is questionable whether the
 actinic rays are capable of imparting any sensible polarization to
 molecules.     In this respect their tendency is the reverse of that
 of heat, viz. to impart a negative instead of a positive polarity ;
 for their impulses act directly upon the aether of the molecular
 atmospheres, but the heat-impulses, as we have seen, act indi
rectly, producing expansion.         The distinction is the same, es
 sentially, as. that  taken  between  the two modes of action of the
 external impulses exerted by electric currents        c. p. 280),--the

    gical investigations, and which appear to me to contribute at the
    present moment towards the completion of our knowledge on this
    important part of animal physics.
       In the <U+FB01>rst place I may remark, in reference to the Table of
    results of Dr. E. Smith’s investigations on the quantity of car
    bonic acid exhaled during rest, and during the muscular exertion
    of man in various kinds of work, that it may he of service, as
  regards the conclusion which it is sought to draw from these
    results, to call to mind some experiments of mine upon the ex
    halation of carbonic acid, by muscles deprived of blood, during
    repose and during contraction.      I believe, in fact, that in the
    experiments of Dr. E. Smith, the greater part of the carbonic
  (acid exhaled is derived from the carbonic acid dissolved in the
  'blood, and which is exhaled in abundance owing to the greater
  activity of the work of respiration during exercise; whilst, on
    the other hand, in the muscles of frogs prepared as in my expe
    riments, the greater part of the carbonic acid which is given 03
    by those muscles during contraction must be attributed to the
  ' oxidation of the muscular matter, or of the substances which are
    mixed with it.     I may add that in recently repeating, with the
    same results, these experiments     on the muscles of frogs which
    had been washed several times in water, it appeared to me that,
    whilst entirely admitting the accuracy of your conclusions, and
    of those drawn from the experiments of Pick and Wislicenus, one
    cannot avoid conceding that the muscular <U+FB01>bre itself is also oxi

       You say in your memoir, “ a command is sent from the brain
    to the muscle, the nervous agent determines oxidation ; the po
    tential energy becomes actual energy, &c.”        On this part of the
             I
    subject wish to mention a conclusion drawn rigorously from
    experiment, and which throws much light precisely upon this
 'point.       It is easy to imagine an experiment in which the
    crural nerve of a prepared frog is excited by the interrupted
'
    passage of an electric current, whilst the work of the muscle
    thrown into contraction by this excitation is determined in
    metrekilograms.      This experiment is doubtless not free from
    error, which, however, operates in the same direction, viz.
‘
    to diminish the total muscular work developed by the mus
    cular contraction. In fact it is known that there are muscles
    which, in the sum total of contractions, act to diminish the height
 7 to which the little weight attached to the leg is lifted. I    I have
-
    proved that there is also heat developed by the contraction of
v muscles deprived of blood.        1 repeat, then, the work calculated
    from the lifting of a weight, and the height to which it is lifted,
. is certainly inferior to the total work of muscular contraction.
    On the other hand, however, whilst employing the most feeble

sible to deny that there exists some connexion between the
quantity of zinc oxidized in the battery and measured in the
'voltameter, the electric current thus obtained, and the corre
sponding nervous excitation produced.        It results, from great         a
number of experiments of         kind admitting of no uncertainty,
                                     a
that the work produced          by
                                muscular contraction        enormouslyis
greater than the corresponding chemical or calorific work in the
battery.  It  necessarily follows from this, that the nervous irrita
tion cannot act without having previously given rise to the com
bustion of the organic matters, azotized or non-azotized, which
accompanies muscular contraction.
I     have still to adda  remarkable relation between these pheno
 mena and the electromotive       force of the muscles.      It may              be
illustrated   by one of the most beautiful and certain of electro;
physiological experiments, which consists in closing the circuit of
the galvanometer with two equal and opposed muscles, such as
the two half-thighs (demi-cuisses) of frog, which touch each other

   XXXVIII.       Sixth Memoir on Radiation and Absorption—In<U+FB02>u
      ence  of Colour and Mechanical Condition on Radiant Heat.        By
      Professor J. TYNDALL, LL.D., F.R.S., Q-c.*
                       placed cloths of various colours upon snow and
   FRANKLINallowed the   sun to shine upon them.      They absorbed the
   solar rays in different degrees, became differently heated, and
   sank therefore to different depths in the snow beneath them.
   His conclusion was that dark colours were the best absorbers,
   and light colours the worst ; and to this hour we appear to have
   been content to accept Franklin’s generalization without quali<U+FB01>
   cation. In my last memoir         I brie<U+FB02>y, pointed out its probable
   defects.    Did the emission from luminous sources consist exclu
   sively of visible rays, we might fairly infer from the colour of a
   substance its capacity to absorb the heat of such sources.         But
   the emission from luminous sources is by no means all visible.
   In terrestrial sources by far the greater part, and in the case of
   the sun a very great part, of the emission consists of invisible
   rays, regarding which colour teaches us nothing.           _
       It remained therefore to examine whether the results of
   Franklin were the expression of a law of nature. Two cards
   were taken of the same size and texture ; over one of them was
 _ shaken the white powder of alum, and over the other the dark
   powder of iodine. Placed before a glowing <U+FB01>re and permitted
   to assume the maximum temperature due to their position, it
   was found that the card bearing the alum became extremely
   hot, while that bearing the iodine remained cool.          No thermo
   meter was necessary to demonstrate this di<U+FB02>'erence.            Placing,
   for example, the back of the iodine card against the forehead or
   cheek, no inconvenience was experienced ,- while the back of the
   alum card similarly placed proved intolerany hot.
      This result was corroborated by the following experiments :—
   One bulb of a differential thermometer was covered with iodine,
   and the other with alum powder.            A red-hot spatula being
   placed midway between both, the liquid column associated with
   the alum-covered bulb was immediately forced down, and main
   tained in an inferior position. Again, two delicate mercurial
   thermometers had their bulbs coated, the one with iodine, the
   other with alum.       On exposing them at the same distance to
   the radiation from a gas-<U+FB02>ame, the mercury of the alum-covered
   thermometer rose nearly twice as high as that of its neighbour.
   Two sheets of tin were coated, the one with alum, and the other
   with iodine powder.        The sheets were placed parallel to each
   other, and about 10 inches asunder; at the back of each was
            * From the Philosophical Transactions  for 1866, Part I.

              Prof. Tyndall on Radiation and Absorption.         293
soldered a little bar of bismuth, which with the tin plate to
which it was attached constituted a thermo-electric couple. The
two plates were connected together by a wire, and the free ends
of the bismuth bars were connected with a galvanometer. Placing
a red-hot ball midway between both, the calori<U+FB01>c rays fell with
the same intensity on the two sheets of tin, but the galvano
meter immediately declared that the sheet which bore the alum
                                                        -
Was the most highly heated.
     In some of the foregoing cases the iodine was simply shaken
through a muslin sieve; in other cases it was mixed with bisul
phide of carbon and applied with a camel’s-hair brush. When
dried afterwards it was almost as black as soot; but as an ab
sorber of radiant heat it was no match for the perfectly white
powder of alum.
    The dif<U+FB01>culty of warming iodine by radiant heat is evidently due
to the diathermic property which it manifests so strikingly when
dissolved in bisulphide of carbon.     The heat enters the powder, is
re<U+FB02>ected at the limiting surfaces of the particles, but it does not
lodge itself among the atoms of the iodine. When shaken in
su<U+FB01>icient quantity on a plate of rock-salt and placed in the path
of a calori<U+FB01>c beam, iodine cuts the latter off. But its opacity is
mainly that of a white powder to light; it is impervious, not
through absorption, but through internal re<U+FB02>exion.         -Ordinary
 roll sulphur, even in thin cakes, allows no radiant heat to pass
 through it; but its opacity is also due to repeated internal re
 <U+FB01>exion.     The temperature of ignition of sulphur is about 2449
 (3.; but on placing a small piece of the substance at the focus
 of the electric lamp, where the temperature was suf<U+FB01>cient to heat
platinum-foil in a moment to whiteness, it required exposure for
 a considerable time to fuse and ignite the sulphur.         Though
 impervious to the heat, it was not adiathermic. The milk of
 sulphur was also ignited with some dif<U+FB01>culty.      Sugar is a much   7
 less in<U+FB02>ammable substance than sulphur, but it is a far better
 absorber; exposed at the focus, it is speedily fused and burnt
_up.     The heat moreover which is competent to in<U+FB02>ame sugar is
 scarcely competent to warm table-salt.
   I
      A fragment of almost black amorphous phosphorus was exposed
 at the dark focus of the electric lamp, but refused to be ignited.
 A still more remarkable result was obtained with ordinary phos
 phorus. A small fragment of this exceedingly in<U+FB02>ammable sub
 stance could be exposed for twenty seconds without ignition at
 a focus where platinum was almost instantaneously raised to a
 white heat.      Placing a morsel of phosphorus on a plate of rock
 salt and holding it before a glowing <U+FB01>re, it bears, as proved by
 my assistant, Mr. Barrett, an intense radiation without ignition ;
 but laid upon a plate of glass and similarly exposed, the phos

phorus soon fuses and ignites; its ignition, however, is not en
tirely due to radiant heat, but mainly to the heat imparted to it'
by the glass*.
   The fusing-point of phosphorus is about 44° C., that of sugar
is 160°; still at the focus of the electric lamp the sugar fuses
before the phosphorus.     All this is due to the diathermancy of
the phosphorus: a thin disk of the substance placed between
two plates of rock-salt permits of a copious transmission.     This
substance therefore takes its place with other elementary bodies

sweep the snows of winter from the slopes of the Alps.       Every
glacier-stream that rushes through the Alpine valleys       almost         is
wholly the product of invisible radiatibn.    It also the invisible
                                                            is
solar rays which lift the glaciers from the sea-level to the sum
mits of the mountains; for the luminous rays penetrate the tro
pical ocean to great depths, while the non-luminous ones are
absorbed close to the surface, and become the main agents in
evaporation.

    Ifany one point came out with more clearness than any other
-in my experiments on gases, liquids, and vapour,      was the pa it
-ramount in<U+FB02>uence which chemical constitution exerted upon the
phenomena of radiation and absorption. And, seeing how little
 the character of the radiation was affected      the change of

 cluion    we had the experiments of Melloni on chalk and lamp
 black, and the far more extensive ones of Masson and Courtépée
 on powders, which seemed clearly to show that in a state of ex
 tremely <U+FB01>ne division, as in chemical precipitates, the radiant and
  absorbent powers of all bodies are the same.                    From these expe
 riments it    was  inferred      that    the   in<U+FB02>uence      of physical condition
 was so predominant          as to   cause   that '
                                                      of chemical    constitution to
 disappear*.
      A serious oversight, however, seems to have connected itself
 with all the experiments of these distinguished men.                          Melloni
 mixed his lampblack and powdered chalk with gum                         or  glue, and
  applied them by     means       of a  camel’s-hair       brush  on  the   surfaces of
  hisradiating tube.          Masson     and    Courtépée      did the  same.     Mel
  loni, it is true, thus compared aiblack surface with a white one;
                                                                                        '
  but the surfaces were seen to be white and black through the trans-
  parent gum, which in both cases was the real radiator.                           The
  same remark applies to Masson                  and     Courtépée.        Every par
  ticle of the precipitates they employed was 'a varnished particle;
  and the constancy they observed was,                 I  imagine, due to the fact
“that the-main radiant in all their experiments was the substance
  employed to make their powders cling to the surfaces of their
  cubes.               -    -         ~    .
      Gum or glue is a powerful radiator—in fact, equal to lamp
  black; and it is a correspondingly powerful absorber; the par
  ticles surrounded by it had therefore but small chance of radia
  ting through it.       I    sought to remedy this by the employment
  of a diathermic cement.            Sulphur is highly diathermic; it dis
  solves freely in bisulphide of carbon ; and at the suggestion of a
   chemical friend   I   employed it to <U+FB01>x the powders.                      The cube
  was laid upon its side, the surface to be coated being horizontal,
  and the bisulphide,. containing the sulphur in solution, was
  poured over the surface.            Before the liquid <U+FB01>lm had time to eva
  porate,  the  powder     was     shaken    upon it through a muslin sieve.
   The bisulphide passed rapidly away in vapour, leaving the pow
   der behind imbedded          in the sulphur cement.                 Each powder,
   moreover, was laid on suf<U+FB01>ciently thick to prevent the sulphur
  from surrounding its particles.                 This, though not perhaps a
   perfect way   of determining         the  radiation      of powders, was at all
   events an improvement on former methods, and yielded different
                      ‘    '    ‘    '    '   ‘     '
  results.
      Ten or twelve oub'es 0f tin Were employed in the investigation.
   One side of each of them was coated with milk of sulphur, and
   this substance running through the entire series of cubes enabled
   me to connect the results of all of them together.                       The cubes

usual was well defended from air-currents and other extraneous
sources of disturbance.        Before giving the complete table of
results, I will adduee a few of them, which show in a conclusive
manner that in solid bodies radiation is molecular rather than
mechanical.                         _
    The biniodide of mercury and the red oxide of lead resemble
each other physically, both of them being of a brilliant red.
Chemically, however, they are very different. Examined in the
way indicated, their relative powers as radiators were found to
be as follows :—

    Mixed with gum and applied with a camel’ s-hair brush to the
surfaces of the cube, the radiation from the following two sub
stances fell out thus :—
                    Name.                                     Radiation.

    Here the in<U+FB02>uence of the gum entirely masks the difference
due to molecular constitution.
    The effect of atomic complexity upon the radiation is well
illustrated by the deportmcnt of these two substances.                      It is
further illustrated by the deportnient of two different iodides of
mercury :—

    Here the addition of a second atom of mercury to the mole
cule of the biniodide raises the radiation 7 per cent.                The expe
riment furnishes a kind of physical justi<U+FB01>cation of the practice of
 chemists in regarding the molecule of yellow iodide of mercury
to be Hg2 12, and not Hg I.
    The peroxide and protoxidc of iron gave the following results :—

    I  did not expect this, the protoxide being a less complex
 molecule than the peroxide.              On examination, however, the
 protoxide was found to be in part the magnetic oxide.                       The
 formulae of the two substances are Fee 03 and Fe 0, Fee2 08, and
the anomaly therefore disappears.

   As in all the other cases, the in<U+FB02>uence of chemical constitu
tion makes its appearance here.
   When held upon its cube by the sulphur cement, the chloride
of silver soon darkens in the diffuse light of the laboratory. It

    We have thus compared red powders with red, black with
black, white with white, and black with white; and the conclu

but do not <U+FB01>nd this to be the case.
    I                                         plate of glass was <U+FB01>xed

cement of any kind.     The cube. was <U+FB01>lled with boiling water and

the powder was removed with         camel’s-hair brush.

and the powder which had been strewn upon it. » Similar experi
ments were made with a plate of rock-salt, on which <U+FB01>nely divided
powder of rock-salt was shaken. The result was precisely similar
to that obtained with the glass powder.
   One side of a Leslie’s cube was covered with a sheet of bright
platinum-foil, and a second face by a similar sheet on which
black platinum had been" deposited by electrolysis. As radia
tors these two sheets of foil behaved in the following manner :—

   I  subsequently endeavoured to get rid of the sulphur cement
and to make the powders adhere by wetting them with pure bi
sulphide of carbon, applying them to the cubes while wet. Some
of the powders clung, others did not. My ingenious friend Mr.
Duppa suggested to me that the powders might be held on by

300               Prof. Tyndall               on the In<U+FB02>uence     of Colour
electrifying the cubes.                   I
                            tried this plan, and found it simple
and practicable.    It was, however, aided by a circumstance
which we did not anticipate.      The cube being placed upon an
insulating stand, the powder was shaken over        and electri<U+FB01>ed      it,
by   afew turns of machine.   a  It was found that the cube might
then be discharged and set upright, the powders clinging to                                    it
in this position. The results obtained with this arrangement
are recorded in the following Table :—

aggregation having been thus conclusively shown to depend
mainly upon its molecular character, the question as to the qua
 lily of the heat emitted next arises. In examining this point,                               I
 contented myself with testing the heat            its transmissionby
through rock-salt.     The choice of this substance involved the so
lution of the still disputed question whether rock-salt     equally                is
 pervious to all kinds of rays*.    For      absorbed the radiation
                                                        if  it
 from two different bodies in different degrees,     would not only     it
 show    adi<U+FB02>erence of quality in the radiations, but also demon
         its own incapacity to transmit equally rays of all de<
 strate
 scriptions.

able experimenter    Professor Knoblauch.   After discussing the results of
De la Provostaye and Desains, and of Mr. Balfour Stewart, he arrives at
a di<U+FB02>'erent conclusion—namely, that pure rock-salt      equally pervious to
                                                                       is

    The plate of rock-salt chosen for this purpose was a very per
fect one.     I  have never seen one more pellucid.           The thickness
 was O'8-of an inch, and its size, compared with the aperture in
 front of which it was placed, was such as to prevent any part of
 the rays re<U+FB02>ected from its lateral boundaries from mingling with
'the direct radiation.       M. Knoblauch has clearly shown how the
 absence of caution in this particular may lead to error.                The
 mode of experiment was that usually followed: the source was
 <U+FB01>rst permitted to radiate against the pile, and the deflection
 produced by the total radiation noted.               The plate of rock-salt
 being   then   interposed,    the    de<U+FB02>ection    sank, and from its new
 value the transmission through the rock-salt was calculated and
 expressed in hundredths of the total radiation.

    The transmissions here' are lower than when the sulphur ce
 ment was employed.        I do npt, :however, think that the differ
 ences are due to the employment of the cement, but to a slight
 source of disturbance, which was removed in the later expe
 riments.
    For the heat emitted by black platinum rock-salt manifests
 its maximum power of transmission, which would lead us to
 ascribe a maximum dissonance between the vibrating periods of
 rock-salt and of black platinum.       It will also be remarked that,
 as a general rule, the powerful radiator hasits heat more co
 piously~ transmitted by the rock-salt than ‘the feeble radiator.
 To render this clear, I have in Table III. appended to the trans
 mission the corresponding total radiation.          The only striking
 exceptions to this rule exhibited in Table III. are marked with
 asterisks.                  I
               This result, think, is what might fairly be expected ;
 for the character which enables a molecule of one substance to
 radiate a greater quantitylof heat than. another, may also be ex
 pected to in<U+FB02>uence its rate of oscillation.       Hence, as a general
 rule, a greater dissonance'will exist‘bet‘ween the vibrating periods
 of good radiators and bad_radiators than between the periods of
 the members of either class. _But t _ e greater the dissonance the
 less will be the absorption;       hence, as regards transmission
 through rock-salt, we have reason tp expect that powerful radia
 tors will <U+FB01>nd a more open door to their emission than feeble ones.
 This     is,
            as  have said, in general the case.
                I                                   But the rule    not      is
 without its exceptions; and the most striking of these        the caseis
‘of black platinum, ,which, though but,             moderate radiator,

   sends a greater proportion of heat through rock-salt than any
   other known substance.
      In his latest investigation, Knoblauch examined at great length
   the diathermancy of rock-salt.           With his usual acuteness, he
   points out several possible sources of error, and with his custo
   mary skill he neutralizes these sources.             His conclusion is the
   same as that of Melloni, namely, that rock-salt transmits in the
   same proportion all sorts of rays.         On the opposite side we <U+FB01>nd
   the experiments of MM. De la Provostaye and Desains, and
   those of Mr. Balfour Stewart*, both of which are discussed by
   Knoblauch.       He di<U+FB02>‘ers from those experimenters, while my
   results bear them out. Considering the slow augmentation of
   transmission which the foregoing Tables reveal, and the consi
   derable number of bodies whose heat is transmitted in almost
   the same proportion by rock-salt, it is easy to see that, where the
   number of radiants is restricted, such a uniformity of transmis
   sion might manifest itself as would lead to the conclusion of
   Melloni and Knoblauch.          It was only by the selection and ex
   tension of the substances chosen as radiators that the differences
   were brought out with the distinctness recorded in the foregoing
   Tables.
      The differences in point of quality and the absence of perfect
   diathermancy in rock-salt appear more striking when instead of
- the transmissions we'take'the         absorptions.       In the case of the
  .radiation from powdered rock-salt, for example, 37'2 per cent. of
   the whole radiation is intercepted by the rock-salt plate.             Ac
   cording to Melloni, between 7 and 8 per cent. of this is lost by
   re<U+FB02>exion at the two surfaces of the salt.             This would leave in
   round numbers a. true absorption of 30 per cent. by the plate of
   rock-salt.    In the case of black platinum, the absorption simi
   larly-deduced amounts to only 4 per cent. of the total radiation.
   Instead, therefore, of the radiation from those two sources being
 absorbed in the same proportion, the ratio in the one case is more
   than seven times that in the other.          For the sake of illustration
  there follow a few of the absorptions determined in this way :—

  304s            Prof. Tyndall on the In<U+FB02>uence of Colour
     These differences of absorption are so great as to enable every
  experimenter      to satisfy himself with the utmost ease as to the
  unequal permeability of rock-salt ; and this facility of demonstra
  tion will,   I trust, contribute to make inquirers unanimous on
  this important point.
     Theory alone would lead us to the conclusion that the absorp
  tive power of the substances mentioned in Table I. is proportional
 to their radiative power ; nevertheless a few actual experiments on
  absorption will serve as a check upon those recorded in the
 Table.      These were conducted in
 the following manner :-—AB is a
 sheet of common block tin, 5 inches
 high by 4 in width, <U+FB01>xed upon a
 suitable stand. At the back of A B
 is soldered'one end of the small bar
 of bismuth b, the remainder of the
 bar, to its free end, being kept out                H
 of contact with the plate by a bit
 of cardboard.        To the free end of    +/
 b is soldered a wire which can be
 connected       with a galvanometer.
 A' B' is a second plate of metal in
 every respect similar to AB. From
 one plate to the other stretches the wire W. C is a cube contain
 ing boiling water, placed midway between the two plates of metal.
     The plates were in the <U+FB01>rst instance coated uniformly with
 lampblack, and the two surfaces of the cube which radiated
 against the plates were similarly coated.         The rays from C being
emitted equally right and left, and absorbed equally by the two
 coated plates AB and A' B’, warmed these plates to the same
degree; it is manifest from the arrangement that, if the thermo
electric junctions were equally sensitive, the current generated
at the one ought exactly to neutralize the current from the other
junction.       This Was found to be very nearly the case. It is dif
<U+FB01>cult to make both junctions of absolutely the same sensitive
ness ; but the moving of the feebler plate a hair’s breadth nearer
to the cube C enabled it to neutralize exactly the radiation from
its opposite neighbour.            My object now was to compare the
lampblack coating of the plate AB with a series of other coat
ings, which were placed in succession on the other plate. These
latter coatings were the powders already employed, and they were
held upon A' B' by their own adhesion.
Stewart, of rock-salt radiating through rock-salt, is by
                                                         itself suf<U+FB01>cient to
demonstrate in the most unequivocal manner that this substance is not
equally pcrvious    to all kinds of rays.

                and Mechanical Condition on Radiant Heat.                   305
    When A B was coated with lampblack and A' B' with rock
 salt powder, the equilibrium observed when both the plates were
‘coated with lampblack did not exist.                 The lampblack, by its
 greater absorption, heated its bismuth junction most, and a per
 manent de<U+FB02>ection of 59° in favour of the lampblack was obtained.
 Other powders were then substituted for the rock-salt, and the
 diH'erence between them and the lampblack was determined in
 the same way. When, for example, sulphide of iron was em
 ployed, there was a de<U+FB02>ection of 30° in favour of lampblack.
 The results obtained with six different powders thus compared
 with lampblack are given in the following Table :—

     The order of absorption here shown coincides with the order
  of radiation of the same substances shown in Table III. But
  we can go further than the mere order of absorption. Removing
  the opposing plate, and allowing the standard lampblack to exert
 its full action upon the galvanometer, the de<U+FB02>ection observed was
                                  65° = 1 63 units.
     The numbers in Table VI. show us the excess of the lampblack
 over the substances there employed,—-its excess in the case of
 rock-salt, a bad absorber, being 112, its excess in the case of
  sulphide of iron being only 30. Deducting, therefore, the num
  bers given in Table VI. from 163, the total absorption of lamp
  black, we obtain a series of numbers which expresses the absorp
 tions of the other substances.            This series stands as follows :—

 PERHAPS
       ward to by geologists with such a' continuous and well-sustained
expectation as the memoir now before us.        The delay in its appear
ance has no doubt tended to render it more complete than it would
 otherwise have been; and we must now recognize it as being by far
the most complete exposition yet published of the Geology of North
 W'ales.
    Necessarily the memoir is chie<U+FB02>y descriptive, the principal design
                 “ such a detailed description of the Silurian rocks of
being to give
North Wales, that any one may ascertain the structure of any minor
area in which he may be interested.”       This description occupies the
bulk of the work; but it is prefaced by a general sketch of the Geo
logy of Wales, to which we must especially draw attention.
    The physical relations of the older rocks possess more general in
terest than the peculiarities of structure and extension of any one
division; and Professor Ramsay has therefore judiciously given a
brief description of them, being the result of a multitude of careful
observations wherever Silurian strata occur in Britain. We thus
learn that “ there is no sign of unconformity anywhere between the
Cambrian rocks and the overlying Lingula-<U+FB02>ags of Merionethshire,
Caernarvonshire, and the Longmynd;“ but that there is probably
an unconformity between the Tremadoc slates and the Lingula-<U+FB02>ags
beneath.     The Llandeilo <U+FB02>ags, which come next in the series, are
also in all probability unconformable to the Tremadoc slates; for
“in Anglesea strata of Llandeilo and Caradoc age lie directly on
Cambrian rocks, showing so great and rapid an overlap of the Lin
gula and Tremadoc series, that it seems to indicate unconformity
between these black slaty strata and the Tremadoc and Lingula-beds
below.“
    The lower Llandovery strata appear to be conformable to the
Bala or Caradoc beds, which are themselves conformable to the Llan
deilo rocks; hence the Geological Survey have retained the lower
Llandovery strata in the Lower Silurian division, while the upper

                    Notices respecting New Books.                   307
Llandovery, which are unconformable to the lower, are placed in
the Upper Silurian.     Ptofessor Ramsay, indeed, states that “ a great
physical break takes place at this point, all the lower members of
the Silurian series having been disturbed and planed across by de
nudation before the upper Llandovery       beds were formed.”       The
Tarannon shales are sometimes to all appearance conformable to the
upper Llandovery, but sometimes distinctly overlap them; but the
succeeding Wenlock and Ludlow beds are conformable to one an
other and to the Tarannon shales beneath.       In fact it appears that
there is an Upper Silurian series of conformable formations underlain
by three formations unconformable to one another, namely the Ta
rannon shale, and the upper and lower Llandovery ; and these again
are underlain by a Lower Silurian serieslof conformable deposits.
Professor Ramsay’s interpretation of these facts seems very probable—
namely, that the strata which “lie between the top of the Caradoc
or Bala beds and the base of the Wenlock shale . . . . were formed
during a period of frequent oscillation of the relative level of the
land to the sea.  .....   Three fragments of this episode have alone
been preserved ; and while the oldest, that of the lower Llandovery
beds, is somewhat closely connected with the Lower Silurian period,
the remaining two are more nearly related to the Upper Silurian age.”
   Though few geologists will be inclined to oppose this view, and
to give preference to that of a Middle Silurian epoch, there is another
question which we think will meet with a different reception.       We
refer to the propriety of continuing to include the Lingula-<U+FB02>ags      in
the Lower    Silurian series.    On this question, indeed, Professor
Ramsay seems to accept a conclusion diametrically opposed to his
own reading of the evidence, and consequently,         we imagine, to
his own convictions.     We <U+FB01>nd him chronicling the unconformity of
the overlying strata to the Lingula-<U+FB02>ags, and the conformity of the
latter to the Cambrians.      He mentions the absence of graptolites
from the Lingula-<U+FB02>ags, and their occurrence in the whole of the re
maining members of the Silurian system.       He also quotes Mr. Sal
ter’s determinations to show the almost entire distinctness of the
Lingula-<U+FB02>ag, Tremadoe, and Llandeilo faunas; and he even goes so
far as to say of the Cambrian deposits and the Lingula-<U+FB02>ags,       that,
"except for the convenience of a great lithological distinction, they
scarcely require separation by line and colour."      All these admis
sions make us wonder why it should be so vehemently insisted
 upon that the Lingula-<U+FB02>ags are Lower Silurian, not Cambrian.       The
                                                 “ convenience ” of the
only argument in its favour appears to be the
error.   And thus our arrival at a natural classi<U+FB01>cation must be post
poned until
              “ convenience ” holds a lower rank than truth.
   In the body of the memoir Professor Ramsay describes the Cam
brian and Silurian rocks of North Wales as they occur in several
typical areas ; but his method is neither quite geographical nor quite
stratigraphical.   He has, however, succeeded in bringing out the
chief features of the structure of the country, by avoiding irrelevant
matters, and by giving a summary of the facts advanced, and- infer

 Elements of Quaternions.        By the late Sir WILLIAM Rowan Ha
     MILTON, LL.D., 8:0.      Edited by his Son, W. E. HAMILTON, B.A.
     London: Longmans and Co.          1866.
     The method of Quaternions was <U+FB01>rst announced by the late Sir
 W. R. Hamilton in a communication made to the Royal Irish Aca
 demy in November 1843, in which the fundamental principles and
 formulae of the method were laid down.          Subsequently the subject
 was fully discussed and illustrated in his work entitled “ Lectures
 on Quaternions,” published in 1853.          For some years previous to
 his death he was engaged on the present work, which is an entirely
 new exposition of the method.          It is indeed (to use the author’s
 own words) “ founded on the same principles as the lectures, but
 the plan adopted is entirely new; and the present work can in no
 sense be considered as a second edition of that former one.”
    The arrangement of the work is as follows :-—The <U+FB01>rst Book treats
 of vectors, without reference to angles or rotations.           The second
 Book treats of quaternions considered as quotients of vectors.         The
 third Book treats of quaternions considered as products or powers
 of vectors. The object of this arrangement is to develope the method
from its simpler to its most general form.        It would, of course, have"
 been possible to have begun with the general principles of the sub
ject, and to have treated the less general parts as particular cases;
 and each way would have had its own advantages.                In the case,
 however, of a subject like quaternions, which might, without much
 inaccuracy, be described as a particular kind of algebra, the rules
 and symbols of which resemble, but are not identical in meaning
 with, those of ordinary algebra, it is, of course, a great gain for the
 student to see the method built up from its <U+FB01>rst principles, and to
 observe the way in which the necessity arises for interpreting sym
 bols and expressions in the particular mode required by the method.
     It is to be observed that the work was designed by Sir W. Hamil
 ton for the use of students ; and, apparently for the purpose of carry
ing out this design, he drew up a most elaborate table of contents to
the work. This Table occupies <U+FB01>fty-seven pages, and embraces a sort
of running comment on the leading portions of.the work, in some cases
directing the reader’s special attention to certain articles, in others re
commending the omissionof certain partson the <U+FB01>rst perusal, in others
explaining the relation in which the contents of one or more articles

                         Notices respecting New Boo/rs.                 309
     stand to the general plan of the work, &c. We are inclined to infer,
     from the author’s evident anxiety to assist the student, that he had
     not been altogether satis<U+FB01>ed with the progress hitherto made by the
     method of quaternions towards general use, and that he imputed this
    to the dif<U+FB01>culties to be encountered at the beginning of the subject.
    Every part of the subject is profusely illustrated by applications,
    showing, if any doubt existed on that head, the fertility of the me
    thod, and its applicability to every branch of mathematical science.
    Without attempting to enumerate these applications, but merely to
    give a notion of the varied contents of the work, we may mention
    that in the <U+FB01>rst book the method of vectors is applied to geometrical
    nets both plane and in space, to barycentres of systems of points, to
    anharmonic equations of curves and surfaces, 810., and that, besides
    other illustrations interspersed through the work, the last chapter,
    comprising near upon three hundred closely printed pages, is entirely
    taken up by applications of the method.         These are, in the <U+FB01>rst
   place, to purely geometrical questions—to tangents and to normal
    and osculating planes of curves in space, to geodetic lines, to invo
   lutes and evolutes in space, &c.; in the second place, to physical
   questions—amongst others, to the dynamics of a rigid body, to that
   of a system of mutually attracting points, to the undulatory theory
   of light, 810.
        With the commencement of an article “ On MacCullagh’s Theorem
   of the Polar Plane ” the work abruptly terminates.       The author was
   engaged on the work at the time of his death. and the editor rightly
,  considered that his duty both to the author and the public would be
   most fully discharged by simply giving to the world what had been
   written.    “ [ came to the conclusion,” he says, “ that my
                                                                  duty was
  to publish the work as I found it, adding merely proof-sheets parti
  ally corrected by my late father, and from which I removed a few
  typographical errors, and editing only in the literal sense of giving
  forth.”
       The work, though un<U+FB01>nished. will remain a monument both of the
  subtlety and originality of Sir W. Hamilton’s mind, and of his pro
  found and extensive knowledge of every branch of mathematical
  science. Whether the method he originated will ever be largely used
  by other mathematicians remains to be seen ; but that it is a calculus
  of enormous power and of inde<U+FB01>nitely extensive application cannot
  be doubted.      Indeed, in addition to the applications contained in the
  work, several others had       been contemplated by Sir W. Hamilton,
  though he well knew that      he would be unable to exhaust them. We
  learn this from the editor’s statement :——“ Shortly before my father's
  death    I had several conversations with him on the subject of the
  ‘
     ELEMEN'rs.’     In these he spoke of anticipated applications of qua
  ternions to electricity, and to all questions in which the idea of po
  larity is involved—applications     which he never in his own lifetime
  expected to be able fully to develope.”

         “ On     the Spectrum of a New Star in Corona B0realis”*.                      By
William Huggins, F.R.S., and W. A. Miller, M.B., Treas. R.S.
    Yesterday, May the 16th, one of us received a note from Mr. John
Birmingham of Tuam, stating that he had observed on the night of
May 12 a new star in the constellation of Corona Borealis.                         He de
scribes the star as “very             brilliant,      of about   the   2nd   magnitude.”
Also Mr. Baxendell of Manchester wrote to one of us giving the ob
servations which follow of the new star, as seen by him on the night
of the 15th instant.
    “ A new star has
                           suddenly burst forth in Corona.                It is somewhat
less than a degree distant from 6 of that constellation in a south
easterly direction, and last night was fully equal in brilliancy to B                       -
Serpentis or :1 Herculis, both stars of about the 3rd magnitude.”
    Last night, May 16, we observed this remarkable object.                            The
star appeared to us considerably below the 3rd magnitude, but
brighter than c Coronas. In the telescope it was surrounded with
a faint nebulous haze, extending to a considerable distance, and
gradually fading away at the boundaryT.                         A comparative exami
nation of neighbouring stars showed that this nebulosity really ex
 isted about the star. When the spectroscope was placed on the tele
 scope, the light of this new star formed a spectrum unlike that of
 any celestial body which we have hitherto examined.                        The light of
 the star is compound, and has emanated from two different sources.
 Each light forms its own spectrum.                    In the instrument these spectra
appear superposed. The principal spectrum is analogous to that of
 the sun, and is evidently formed by the light of an incandescent solid
 or liquid photosphere, which has suffered absorption by the vapours
 of an envelope cooler than itself.                  The second spectrum consists of

 is probable that this star will turn out to be a variable of long or irregular
 period, and it may be conveniently at once designated 1- Coronae.”               Sir John
 Herschel informs one of us that on June 9, 1842, he saw a star of the 6th mag
 nitude in Corona very nearly in the place of this strange star. As Sir John
                       was laid down merely by naked-eye allineations, the star seen
 Herschel’s position
 by him may have possibly been a former temporary outburst of light in this
 remarkable object.

 was not seen,

                   Spectrum of a New Star near 6 Coronas Borealis.
     Description of the spectrum of absorption—In the red a little
  more    refrangible than Fraunhofer’s          C are two strong dark lines.
  The interval between these and a line a little less refrangible than D
  is shaded by a number of <U+FB01>ne lines very near each other.                   A less
  strongly marked line is seen about the place of solar D.                 Between
  D and a portion of the spectrum about the place of b of the solar
  spectrum, the lines of absorption are numerous, but very thin and
  faint. A little beyond 6 commences a series of close groups of strong
 lines ; these follow each other at small intervals, as far as the spectrum
 can be traced.
     Description of the gaseous spectrum—A bright line, much more
  brilliant than the part of the continuous spectrum upon which it falls,
 occupies a position which several measures make to be coincident
 with Fraunhofer’s Ft.             At rather more than one-fourth of the
 distance which separates F from G, a second and less brilliant line
 was seen.        Both these lines were narrow and sharply de<U+FB01>ned.
 Beyond these lines, and at a distance a little more than one-third
 of that which separates the second bright line from the strongest
 bright one, a third bright line was observed.                The appearance of
 this line suggested that it was either double or unde<U+FB01>ned at the
    * The position of the groups of dark lines shows that the light of the pho
 tosphere, after passing through the absorbent atmosphere, is yellow.     The light,
 however,    of the green and blue bright lines makes up to some extent for the
 green and blue rays (of other refrangibilities)   which have been stopped by ab
 sorption.    To the eye, therefore, the star appears nearly white. However, as
 the star <U+FB02>ickers, there may be noticed an occasional preponderance of yellow
or blue.    Mr. Baxendell, without knowing the results of prismatic analysis, de
scribes the impression he received to be
                                            “ as if the yellow of the star were seen
through an overlying <U+FB01>lm of a blue tint.”
    1' On the 17th, the lines of hydrogen, produced by taking the induction-spark
through the vapour of water, Were compared in the instrument simultaneously
with the bright lines of the star. The brightest line coincided with the middle
0f the expanded line of hydrogen which corresponds to Fraunhofer’s F.            On
account of the faintness of the red and of the spectrum, when the amount of dis‘
persion necessary for these observations was employed, the exact coincidence of the
line in this part of the spectrum with the red line of hydrogen, though extremely
probable, was not determined with equal certainty.

edges.    ‘In the more refrangible part of the‘spectrum', probably not
far from G of the solar spectrum, glimpses were obtained of a fourth
and faint bright line.      At the extreme end of the visible part of
the less refrangible end of the spectrum, about C, appeared a line
 brighter than the normal relative brilliancy of this part of the spec
 trum. The brightness of this line, however, was not nearly so marked
in proportion to that of the part of the spectrum where it occurs,
 as was that of the lines in the green and blue. *.
    General C'onclusiona.-It is difficult to imagine the present phy~
sieal constitution of this remarkable object.         There must be a pho
tosphere   of   matter in the  solid  or liquid  state  emitting light of all
refrangibilities.  Surrounding   this  must  exist   also an atmosphere of
cooler vapours, which give rise by absorption to the groups of dark
lines.
    Besides this constitution, which it possesses in common with the
sun and the stars, there must exist the source of the gaseous spectrum.
That this is not produced by the faint nebulosity seen about the star
is evident by the brightness of the lines, and the circumstance that
they do not extend in the instrument beyond the boundaries of the
continuous spectrum. The gaseous mass from which this light ema
nates must be at a much higher temperature than the photosphere
of the star; otherwise it would appear impossible to explain the great
brilliancy of the lines compared with the corresponding parts of the
continuous spectrum of the photosphere.            The position of two of
      bright lines suggests that this gas may consist chie<U+FB02>y of hy
    She
  rogen.
   If, however, hydrogen be really the source of some of the bright
lines,the conditions under which the gas emits the light must be dif
ferent from those to which      has been submitted in terrestrial ob
                                 it
servations; for     it  well known that the line of hydrogen in the
                         is
green     always fainter and more expanded than the brilliant red line
           is
which characterizes the spectrum of this gas.     On the other hand,
the strong absorption indicated        by
                                      the line  of the solar spectrum,
                                                     F
and the still stronger corresponding lines in some stars, would indi
cate that under suitable conditions hydrogen may emit         strong lu
                                                                    a
minous radiation of this refrangibility       "I".
   The character of the spectrum of this star, taken together with its
sudden outburst in brilliancy and its rapid decline in brightness, sug
gest to us the rather bold speculation that, in consequence of some
   * The spectra of the star were observed again on the 17th, the 19th, the 21st,
 and the 23rd. On these evenings no important alteration had taken place.        On
the 17th and succeeding evenings, though the spectrum of the waning star was
fainter than on the 16th, the red bright line appeared a little brighter relatively
to the green and blue bright lines. On the 19th and 21st the absorption lines about
6 were stronger than on the 16th.    From the 16th the continuous spectrum di
minished in brightness more rapidly than the gaseous spectrum, so that on
the 23rd, though the spectrum as a whole was faint, the bright lines were bril
liant when compared with the continuous spectrum.

vast convulsion taking place in this object, large quantities of gas
have been evolved from it, that the hydrogen present is burning by
combination with some other element and furnishes the light repre
sented by the bright lines, also that the <U+FB02>aming gas has heated to
vivid incandescence the solid matter of the photosphere.              As the
hydrogen becomes exhausted, all the phenomena diminish in inten
sity, and the star rapidly'wanes.
    In connexion with this star, the observations which we made upon
the spectra of a Orionis and B Pegasi, that they contain no absorp
tion lines of hydrogen, appear to have some new interest.                The
spectra of these stars agree in their general characters with the ab
sorption spectrum of the new star. The whole class of white stars
are distinguished by having hydrogen lines of extraordinary force. It
may also be mentioned here that we have found that the spectra of
several of the more remarkable of the variable stars, namely those
distinguished by an orange or ruddy tint, possess a close general ac
cordance with those of a Orionis, B Pegasi, and the absorption spec
trum of the remarkable object described in this paper.           The purely
speculative idea presents itself from these observations, that hydrogen
probably plays an important part in the differences of physical con
stitution which apparently separate the stars into groups, and pos
sibly also in the changes by which these differences may be brought
about“.

this that my revised method for using the principle of least squares
introduces several unknown quantities instead of one, viz. the local
de<U+FB02>ections at all the stations of the arc instead of at the reference
station only. But as the difference of local de<U+FB02>ection at any two
stations on the arc     exactly measured by the difference between the
                          is
astronomical and geodetical amplitudes of the stations, one of which
is known by observation, and the second by calculation, the average
of all the local de<U+FB02>ections can always be expressed in terms of the
de<U+FB02>ection at the reference-station, or at any other single station of
the arc.

      ON THE SPECTRUM       OF AQUEOUS VAPOUR.        BY M. JANSSEN.
      I have the honour to communicate to the Academy the discovery
  of a new optical property of aqueous vapour, a property which would
  appear to lead to important results in celestial physics and in me
  teorology.    The optical study of this vapour shows that it possesses
  an elective power of absorption for light, or, in other words, that this
   vapour produces dark lines and bands in the spectrum of a luminous
   ray which traverses a suf<U+FB01>cient thickness of it. But before enter
  ing into the detail of my observations,   I shall request permission to
   give an abridged account of the researches which have led to the
                                                        “
   present investigation.
      We know that the illustrious Brewster discovered in 1833 what
   we call atmospheric or telluric rays of the solar spectrum. Brewster
   had observed that when the sun was near the horizon, its prismatic
   image became enriched by new dark hands.        This fact, in connexion
   with others of the same kind—that is to say, the action of nitrous gas
   and others which produce dark bands in the spectrum of a luminous
   beam which has traversed them—had led the English physicist to the
   extremely correct idea that our atmosphere might act like nitrous
   gas. and thus give rise to the dark bands observed when the sun is
   in the horizon; Brewster even had the idea that all the lines of the
   solar spectrum might be explained in the same manner.              This
   beautiful conception could not be demonstrated completely.            In

  316            Intelligence and Miscellaneous    Articles.
 fact these dark lines generally disappeared when the sun rose, and
  there were no appreciable traces when the sun passed the meridian.
     Subsequently, a direct experiment, in which Messrs. Brewster and
  Gladstone endeavoured to reproduce the gaps in the solar spectrum
  by analyzing at a great distance an arti<U+FB01>cial light with a continuous
  spectrum, did not give a satisfactory result (Philosophical Transac
  tions, 1860).
     The question of the origin of the dark lines and bands of the solar
 spectrum was not then resolved; but Brewster’s beautiful researches
 had nevertheless introduced into science very important ideas, and
 facts which were to serve as the basis of ulterior studies.
     Ashort time afterthe publication of the important memoirof Messrs.
 Brewster and Gladstone, a memoir which epitomizes the labours of
 these gentlemen on this question, M. Kirchho<U+FB01>' published his beau
 tiful investigations on the solar spectrum.     The result of these in
 vestigations is well known. The origin of spectral lines was referred
 to an atmosphere surrounding the sun ; and the investigation of these
 lines revealed the chemical composition of this atmosphere.          The
 general results of this theory will be a permanent acquisition to
                                                                          '
 science; but the object was even exceeded.          Between Brewster’s
 ideas seeking to explain the solar spectrum by the action of the
 earth's atmosphere, and those of M. Kirchhoff assigning its origin to
 a solar atmosphere, there was place for a doctrine less exclusive and
 more complete, which will take into account the two causes, and de
 monstrate the twofold origin of the lines which Wollaston and Fraun
 hofer had discovered in the prismatic image of the sun.
     The solar origin of a portion of the lines of the spectrum of this
 star being demonstrated, the action of our atmosphere remained to
 be proved by completing the researches of Messrs.           Brewster and
 Gladstone, Piazzi Smyth, &c.       That is the object of the investiga
tions I have been engaged on since 1862.
     By new optical arrangements I <U+FB01>rst established the fact that Brew
ster's bands were formed of a number of <U+FB01>ne lines resembling the
solar lines properly so called. Further, the study of these lines 'has
shown that they were constant in the spectrum, although incessantly
variable in their intensity with the height of the sun, that is to say,
with the thickness of our atmosphere traversed by the lines of this
star. These results demonstrated the action of our atmosphere. To
corroborate them, I have investigated the spectrum on a high moun
tain (the Faulhorn), September 1864.          There I  observed that the
lines of terrestrial origin grew weaker in proportion asI ascended-—
that is, in proportion as the solar lines traversed a smaller thickness
of the terrestrial atmosphere. Lastly, in an experiment made on the
Lake of Geneva (October 1864), I Was able arti<U+FB01>cially to reproduce
the same lines. The <U+FB02>ame of a large log of spruce-<U+FB01>r, which gives
scarcely any line but the brilliant one of sodium, exhibited, at a dis
tance of 21 kilometres, the atmospheric lines of the solar spectrum.
This accumulation of proofs showed, then, obviously the action of our
atmosphere, and the twofold origin of the lines of the solar spectrum.
I may add that this atmosphere, in spite of its small height and the -

                   Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.            317
low temperature of the gases which form it, acts on light as energeti
cally as, though in'a different manner from the sun’s atmosphere. The
earth’s atmosphere produces in the red, orange, and yellow of the
spectrum a system of lines ten times as numerous-as the solar lines
of these regions.        On the contrary, in the green, the blue, and the
violet, the lines of solar origin predominate.       Thus these two atmo
 spheres, so di<U+FB01>'erent in their own temperatures, are not less so in
 their actions upon light.       In a certain sense they divide the spec
 trum : the atmosphere of the earth, an atmosphere at a low tempe
 rature, acts speci<U+FB01>cally on the rays of great wave-length; the solar
 atmosphere, an atmosphere with a high temperature, exerts its rela
 tive action upon rays of short wave-length.         This subject will have
 to be reverted to.
     The action of ‘our atmosphere being demonstrated, it remained to
 inquire to what elements of this atmosphere this action must be at
 tributed.                         .
     An attentive study of the solar spectrum had led       me, a couple of
 years ago, to attribute to the aqueous vapour dissolved in our atmo
 sphere a very important, if not an entire part in the production of
 the telluric lines of the solar spectrum*.          _
     In fact, comparisons, followed for a long time, on the solar light
  during variousseasons of the year showed very clearly that for the
  same heights of the sun certain lines of the spectrum of this star were
  more pronounced as the dew-point was higher.
     Observations which I have made on the F aulhorn further con<U+FB01>rm
  this view; for on extremely dry days I have seen the lines in ques
  tion disappear almost entirely from the spectrum.
     Thus, in the experiment on the Lake of Geneva, I have been led
  to choose this place as the basis of experiments by the consideration
  that the luminous pencil, in grazing the surface of the water, must
  traverse layers of air which are necessarily more moist, which would
  add to the chances of success; and the result has con<U+FB01>rmed this
  notion.
      There could thus be little doubt as to the action of aqueous va
  pour; yet it was necessary, seeing the importance of the result, to
  submit this point of theory to a direct veri<U+FB01>cation, by investigating
  the modi<U+FB01>cations which a well-de<U+FB01>ned beam of light of known com
  position experienced by the fact of its passage through a tube of suf
  <U+FB01>cient length containing only aqueous vapour.
      This experiment presented, unfortunately, great practical di<U+FB01>icul
  ties.    Our atmosphere contains such a quantity of aqueous vapour,
  that to realize arti<U+FB01>cially the effects it produced on solar light, I was
  led to the use of apparatus of exaggerated dimensions and dif<U+FB01>cult
  to manipulate.                      -
       A <U+FB01>rst trial was made at the central workshop for lighthouses'f‘.

 lend me his help; but the tube of 10 metres which we put up for
 this purpose was not long enough to exhibit the phenomena suf
 <U+FB01>ciently.
     I was ultimately able to realize more favourable conditions. A
 friend of mine, M. Goschler, director of studies at the central School
 of Architecture, introduced me to the director of the Paris Gas Com
 pany, and to M. Arson, chief engineer.          These gentlemen placed
 at my disposal, with a kindness for which I am greatly obliged, the
 ample resources of this vast establishment.
     An iron tube 37 metres in length was mounted; it was placed in
 a wooden box of the same length, <U+FB01>lled with well-dried wooden sha
 vings, an arrangement which avoids all appreciable loss of heat. The
 vapour was furnished by a moveable steam-engine of six-horse power,
 and the light by a lamp of six jets placed in the direction of the axis
 of the tube. This light, which, as we know, gives a continuous
 spectrum, enables us to perceive the production of the feeblest dark
 bands.
    These experiments are now being continued, and I wish simply
 to communicate to the Academy the <U+FB01>rst results.              These results
 con<U+FB01>rm already, in the completest manner, what the study of the
 solar spectrum had already indicated.
     In one experiment (August 3, 1866), in which the tube, well freed
 from air, was full of vapour at the pressure of seven atmospheres,
 the spectrum was observed with <U+FB01>ve dark bands, two of which, well
 marked, spread from D to A (Fraunhofer), and recalled the solar
 spectrum seen in the same instrument towards sunset.
    From the <U+FB01>rst comparisons made between the spectrum of aqueous
vapour and that of solar light, the group A of F raunhofer, B (in great
part at least), the group C, and two groups between C and D are
 due to the action of the aqueous vapour of the atmosphere.
    This experiment has further given an interesting result. The
spectrum of the transmitted light was seen to be very dark in the
most refrangible part, while it was brilliant in the regions of red and
of yellow.      Thus, although aqueous vapour energetically absorbs
certain red and yellow rays, it is very transparent for most of these
rays, while it acts in a general manner on the more refrangible rays.
It follows from this that aqueous vapour would be of an orange-red
colour by transmission, and the redder the greater the thickness
through which it acts.
     This result will have to be veri<U+FB01>ed and established with the great
est care, and I only offer it with reserve. If it be <U+FB01>nally demonstrated,
we shall <U+FB01>nd in it an explanation of the red colour, so variable in its
tints, but always observed at sunset as well as at sunrise.
    The consequences of this‘discovery of the spectrum of aqueous
vapour will be overlooked by no one. We are <U+FB01>nally agreed as to
the origin of a considerable portion of the rays of the solar spectrum ;
and the knowledge of these rays will allow us to investigate the
higher regions of our atmosphere as regards their humidity, regions
which at present are inaccessible to our means of investigation.       But
it is more especially in astronomy that the results will be interesting

aqueous vapour, 'I calculate on soon being in a position to pronounce
on the presence of this principal element of organic life in the atm0~
spheres of “the planets and other stars.        I can at once announce
that this vapour forms no part of the solar atmosphere.—C0mptes

        ON THE PRODUCTION       OF OZONE.      BY M. G. PLANTlil.
    The inoxidizable   metals, such as gold and platinum, have hitherto
been regarded as those which alone can be used as electrodes in
obtaining ozone by the electrolytic decomposition of water. I have,
however, found that ozone can be obtained as well by electrodes of
lead as by electrodes of platinum, and even in greater quantity.
    This can be readily established by taking two voltameters, one
with platinum wires, the other with lead wires of the same length
and diameter, and passing the same current through them.          By sus
pending iodized starch-paper in open tubes placed over the positive
wire of each voltameter, both are at once seen to become blue, but
that placed over the lead wire more rapidly and with greater inten
 sity than that over the platinum wire.
    When ozonized oxygen is simultaneously disengaged in similar
solutions of iodide of potassium, the solution in which is the lead
wire becomes yellow more rapidly than that in which is the platinum ;
and taking the quantity of iodine liberated in the latter as unity,
that furnished by the ozone of the voltameter with lead wires is ap
proximately equal to 1'5.      In other words, the quantity of ozone
from the platinum is only two-thirds of that from the lead.
    In the smell also, and in the rapidity of the oxidation of silver,
there is also an appreciable difference.
                                             ‘
    This greater abundance in the production of ozone from electrodes
of lead than from electrodes of platinum is a dif<U+FB01>cult fact to explain
in the present state of our knowledge of ozone. When ozone is pro
duced by statical or induced electricity, the nature of the electrodes
 between which the spark passes has no appreciable in<U+FB02>uence.         But
when prepared by means of the pile, the nature of the electrodes
exerts a preponderating in<U+FB02>uence.      In the present case a metal more
 oxidizable than platinum produces the ozone.        The oxidation, it is
true, is merely super<U+FB01>cial; the thickness of the layer does not appre
ciably increase as the current continues, and the volume of oxygen is
not diminished as compared with that produced by platinum under
the same conditions.     Yet this layer of oxygen serves a double pur
pose; it is the source of a secondary energetic current, and at the
same time it facilitates the production of ozone.
    To account for the manner in which it acts in the latter case, we
can only make hypotheses, useless now to dwell upon. I shall limit
myself to saying that at present, to prepare ozone by the electrolysis
of water, wires of lead must be used instead of those of platinum.—

                            BY ARONSTEIN       AND SIRKS.
   Prof. Ryhe needed one day for a physical experiment a long con
tinuous current of pure hydrogen gas.      He noticed that, in spite of
                                                   '
all precautions, it always contained traces of oxygen, nitrogen,
and aqueous vapour. The connexions between the various apparatus
for drying and purifying were affected by means of caoutchouc tubes.            ‘
Hence he imagined the origin of the impurity must be sought in
adi<U+FB01>'usion of the gases through the caoutchouc.      As the statements
regarding the permeability of gases through caoutchouc are antiquated
and discordant, we investigated the matter, with the following results.
   In one neck of a <U+FB02>ask <U+FB01>lled with hydrogen a manometer-tube
was <U+FB01>tted air-tight; the other neck, by means of a glass tube <U+FB01>tting
air-tight, was placed in connexion with a caoutchouc tube, which
was closed by a sealed glass tube.     The height of the manometer
Was so regulated that the pressure for the same volume of gas in the
<U+FB02>ask could be read o<U+FB02>“.   The diminution of the volume in the <U+FB02>ask
is then calculated by the formula

                              [With a Plate]
      HELL-mounds,     since attention was <U+FB01>rst directed to them by
        the discoveries of the Danish archaeologists, have been
found on several parts of the coast of Scotland; and it would ap
pear that similar mounds have been also observed on the coast of
England. Previously to the discovery of shell-mounds, nearly all
the knowledge we possessed of the customs of the prehistoric in
habitants of this and other countries had been mainly derived
from their tumuli, cairns, cists, &c.      In some of these ancient
monuments we <U+FB01>nd a group of large cinerary urns containing
calcined bones only, or weapons and ornaments laid by the re
mains of the deceased.    Sometimes the 'small rudely made clay
urn is empty, occasionally containing fragments of bone; scat
tered about are the remains of the funeral feast, and in some
cases the relics of the human victims that had been sacri<U+FB01>ced to
the manes of the dead.        In these we recognize the sepulchral
customs that characterized the different epochs, and which were
perhaps gradually changed from time to time, in accordance with
the different phases of civilization and their modifying in<U+FB02>uence
on the saVage creed. Whether, however, we regard the different
kinds of tumuli and their contents as the remains of the same
race, whose ideas on the subject had undergone a change, or con
sider them an evidence          change of the races themselves, as

322              Mr. R. Walker       an Ancient Shell
but as to the social condition and everyday life, so to speak,
of the people who practised these rites they tell us little or no
thing.     In the shell-mounds, on the other hand, and more espe
cially  in  the lake-dwellings, we can see, to some extent at least,
the social condition attained by the people.         The animals which
they   had   captured  or   domesticated,  the  plants they cultivated,
their mode of treating the bones in order to extract the marrow
and animal juice, their culinary vessels, their domestic and war
like implements, are all brought to light.           Last, though not
least, we are in this way made acquainted             with the animals
and plants that were the contemporaries of primeval man, and
how far he' was then able to subordinate them to his wants at a
remote period of his existence, in the investigation of which
written history lend us no aid. The mound with which we are
more immediately concerned was discovered in the summer of
1864, during the cutting of a main drain along the scores on
the north side of St. Andrews.        The mound, at the place where
                               it,
the drain passes through       is   about 55 yards from the edge of
the cliff, which presents  a   perpendicular face to the sea of about
45 feet in height.      The sea washes against the bottom of           at
                                                                        it
half tides.    This kitchen heap lay at depth of feet from the
                                          a             3
surface; its greatest thickness was 18 inches; its length, so
far as exposed, about 70 yards; and        it was laid on   a stratum of
drift, sand, and gravel, which had evidently been the surface of
the ground previously to the accumulation of the shell-mound.
The superincumbent mass was chie<U+FB02>y black earth.            The contents      '
of the mound consisted of shells, broken bones, fragments of pot-
tery, and two or three stone weapons.          No metallic implement
or ornament of any kind was turned up, so far as        I   could learn.
About the same time some workmen, in digging the foundation
of two houses about halfway between the thickest part of the
deposit and the sea, cut through what appeared to be the thin
edge of the bed, and dug up       a   great number of fragments of
pottery, pieces of bones (some of them burnt), shells, and          con
                                                                    a
siderable number of broken and chipped stones; amongst them
there were  a   few better-shaped articles, which had evidently been
intended for weapons.        All these things lay from          t0
                                                                2   3feet
from the surface, and were somewhat mixed with the upper part
of the drift bed, which appeared to have been           a good deal dis
turbed at some former period. This appeared to me, from the
marks of <U+FB01>res at two or three places (and some of them were
pretty distinct), to be the place where the ancient mound-build
ers had had their dwellings. Whether the <U+FB01>res were kept out
side or inside may not be easy to say    ;   at all events, at one place
at least the <U+FB01>re had undoubtedly been kindled in            ahole dug in
the ground perhaps     a   foot or more in depth; the surrounding

                        Mounds at St. Andrews.                    323
  stones and gravel were cracked and run together by the heat,
  and of a somewhat darker colour than the rest of the bed: when
  struck by the workmen’s tools it rose in concrete masses.      The
  shells most abundant at both places, more especially at the former,
 were the Mussel (Mytilus edulis), the Cockle (Cardium edule),
 two species of Periwinkle (Littorina littorea and littoralis), and
 the Limpet (Patella vulgata). Besides these, there were a few
  specimens of Nassa reiiculata, Buccinum undatum, Venus striatula,
 and Venus casina.     The Buccina Were in general broken; and
 from the numerous fragments of the periwinkles, it would appear
 that a similar mode of treatment had been frequently applied to
 that shell. This may have been considered the most expeditious
 way of getting at the contents.     The mussels were very friable,
 and often went to pieces on being raised ; the rest of the bivalves
 were in good order.     The mammalian bones comprise two species
 of the Ox, the Horse, Pig, Sheep, Goat, Dog, Fox, Cat, and the
 Deer.    There were two or three pieces of the limb-bones of birds.
 Of the bones of <U+FB01>shes, although I diligently searched for them,
 I could <U+FB01>nd only two centra of vertebrae. Of the bones of these
 animals, those of the small Ox (Bos longifrons) were by far the
 most abundant; and although the bones of the large Ox, which
 from the horn-cores I take to be Bos frontosus, were not nearly
 so numerous as those of its smaller congener, still, so far as they
 go, it was mainly the same parts that have been preserved of
 both. These consist of the horn-cores, some of them broken off
 at the base; others have part of the bones of the skull attached,
 and look as if the cranium had been rudely torn asunder.          In
 one instance the horn-cores of the small Ox are held together by
 the intervening part of the skull, which has been broken away in
 front and behind to nearly a line with their base.      There were
 also parts of the upper and lower jaws, chie<U+FB02>y of the small Ox,
 some of them containing the teeth in situ.     The only other por
 tions of the cranium preserved were one or two fragments of the
 bony ring that surround the eye.        The vertebrae had likewise
 disappeared,  with  the  exception of  one or two of the cervicals.
 Of the limb-bones there were pieces of the tibia, the radius, and
ulna, the metacarpus, metatarsus, 0s calcis, astragalus, and some
of the phalanges, including the 0s pedis.      There were only one
or two pieces of the humerus, and one or two pieces of the femur;
in both it was the lower joint. Moreover, although the distal
end of the tibia was common enough, the proximal end seemed
to be altogether absent.     The scarcity of the upper bones of the
limbs, compared with the numerous fragments of the lower, was
not a little curious, more especially when we bear in mind that,
in this respect at least, the mound in question corresponds closely
with Danish kitchen-middens and the lake-dwellings of Switzer
                                 Y2

 324                 Mr. R. Walker     on Ancient Shell
 land, the corresponding bones being absent in all. Professor
  Steenstrup “thought that these curious results might perhaps
 be referred to dogs ; and on trying the experiment, he ascertained
 that the bones which are absent from the Kjiikkenmiiddings are
 precisely those which dogs eat”*. Whether the absence of these
 particular bones can in the present instance be entirely ascribed
 to the selective propensity exhibited by the dog, or not, might be
 somewhat dif<U+FB01>cult to determine.         At any rate we have conclusive
 evidence that the dog was then an inhabitant of the district ; and
 the gnawed appearance presented by some of the ox~bones show
 clearly enough that his bone-loving proclivities were as strong in
ancient times as they are now.
    The bones of the dog,moreover,were found mixed promiscuously
 with, and very likely had undergone the same culinary operation
 as, those of his larger and smaller contemporaries ; for, like them,
 he appears to have occasionally <U+FB01>lled a corner in the larder of his
 rapacious masters.      At the same time it seems not unlikely that
 the absent bones may have been pounded in some kind of mortar
 in order to extract the animal juices—a custom which is still prac
 tised by some savage tribes; and if this custom prevailed here
 during the mound period, doubtless it would be the more nutri—
 tious portions of the bones that would be selected for the purpose.
 With very few exceptions, all the long bones of the oxen have
 been split open for the purpose of getting at the marrow, and in
 most cases they are broken transversely.           Some of the bones
 show the marks of two or three blows struck by a blunt in
 strument in order to split them open.           The lower jaws have
 been broken apparently transversely by the angle of the ramus,
 and about the middle of the teeth, after which they have not
unfrequently been split open in order to get at the <U+FB02>uid con
 tents of the maxillary cavity.       The following Table contains the
 measurements of the bones of the large and the small Ox, so far
as their imperfect condition admits of their determination. With
 these are given the measurements of the correponding              bones
 of the Ox of the lake-dwellings of Switzerland as given by Riiti
 meyer'l', and those of the lake-dwellings of Italy as given by
 Gastaldi and translated by Chambersi.          The description of the
parts measured are taken from the latter writer.

    Of the remains of the Horse, there was the posterior part of
a  cranium    the anterior part had been broken off transversely in
                 ;
front of the orbital cavities the ethmoid bone seems to have been
                                          ;
then broken away, apparently for the purpose of gaining easy
access to the brain, which appears in this as well as in other ani
mals, to have been      material of considerable importance in the

there  was  dug up  the left ramus  of alower  jaw, broken across at
the symphysis, and containing all the molars in their places.
There were likewise pieces of the distal ends of the tibia, and of the
metacarpal and metatarsal bones.        Two of the large metatarsal
bones and some of the phalanges were entire; with these excep
tions, the long bones were all more or less broken      they had not,         ;
however, been so universally split open as those of the ruminants.
These bones, so far as they go, certainly indicate that the horse
was then much less than 'our modern species, and with smaller'
and more delicately formed limbs, which would undoubtedly have
rendered       unsuitable for most of the purposes to which the

    the antero-posterior diameter of the third molar is in a similar pro

    portions of the skull and jaw found are not so large as the same

       The bones of the Pig consist for the most part of pieces of the
    cranium, of the upper and lower jaws (containing some of the
    molar and other teeth), and a number of fragments of the leg
    bones.    All these bones, with one exception, have belonged to a
    small race of pig, closely resembling in size Riitimeyer’s “ Torf
   schwein,” or Pig of the Turbaries, an animal very considerably
   less than the wild boar, of the remains of which       I  could <U+FB01>nd no'
   trace, with the exception of a single fragment of a canine tooth.
   This is the more remarkable, because, according to tradition, the
   wild boar was common in this district in the early centuries of
   our era, and Alexander I. conferred upon the see of St. An
   drews the famous tract of land called the Cursus Apri, or boar’s
   chase, which is supposed to have extended from St. Andrews in
   land some four or <U+FB01>ve miles, and perhaps seven or eight miles
  across the country.      The wild boar, from his strength and fero

  his freedom long after his smaller relative was subdued.             How
  cVer this may be, I am persuaded that it will yet be found that
  ;this small race of pig was far more numerous, judging from its
 .l‘elnains, than the larger species, and at a period far beyond the
 ;reach of the most ancient tradition itself.      This will be found to
  be the case, I think, whenever the animal remains met with in
and around the various tumuli, cairns, Ste. receive more atten

           remains they contain shall be considered a matter of pri

  of the subject justly demands.              This must be done if we expect
  ever to arrive at anything like a correct knowledge of the kind of
  animals that surrounded man in the so-called ages of stone and
  bronze, and of the relation in which they stood to him, whether
  domesticated or wild, or if we would form any idea of the
  social and intellectual condition of man himself—whether in
  those ages he led the life of a mere savage whose existence de
  pended upon the success of the chase, who starved one day and
  gorged the next, or whether he possessed the prudence and fore
  thought necessary to manage domesticated animals and utilize
 them so as to meet his ever-recurring wants. These and other
  questions connected with the early condition of man in this
 country can only be solved by strictly examining and, as far as
 possible, identifying the animal remains, not of the shell-mounds
 only, but of the tumuli and cairns.                 I   am the more impressed
 with this, because all the bones of the pig from tumuli and old
 burying-places that have come into my hands have pertained to
 a small race.      To give one instance : some years ago a group of
 cinerary urns, each containing calcined bones, were discovered
 near St. Andrews.         In one of the trenches dug at this place a
 mass of broken bones of different animals was turned up;
 amongst them there were a considerable number of bones of the
 pig, and they appeared to me without an exception to belong to
 a small race.      Some of these remains presented the same marks
 of domesticity as those forming the subject of the present no
 tice, so far at least that the crowns of the third molars were
 much worn down: this is said by Riitimeyer to be a reliable
 mark in determining whether the pig to which they belonged
 had been in an independent or in a domesticated state.                                  The
 following measurement will show the relative sizes of the teeth of
 the pig of this mound and those of Riitimeyer’s pig of the Tur

    Of the bones of the Sheep, we have part of a cranium, which,
like that of the Horse, has been broken across by the orbits.
The greater part of the occipital has been torn away, and the
horn-cores are broken off near the roots.                      There is also a piece
of a lower jaw containing the molar teeth.                      Besides these frag

  328                 Mr. R. Walker  an Ancient Shell
  ments,    there are a number of pieces of the bones of the lower
  limbs of a small ruminant, consisting chie<U+FB02>y of the lower ends
  of the tibia, of the metacarpal and metatarsal bones, and some
  of the phalanges.      The humerus and femur were absent.       That
  these are bones either of the sheep or goat there can be no doubt ;
  but whether they belong to one or both species is a question that
   will scarcely admit of a very decided answer.      The dif<U+FB01>culty of
   distinguishing the bones of the sheep from those of the goat
  when in a detached state is well known.      The dif<U+FB01>culty, however,
  is still greater in cases like the present, when it is pieces only of
  the bones we have to deal with, and these pertaining to a remote
  period, when the sheep and the goat appear to have resembled
  each other more closely than our domesticated breeds do at pre
   sent.    Moreover the sheep of the shell-mounds and of the lake
   dwellings had horns like the goat; while both animals, more
-
  especially the sheep, had the limbs relatively longer and smaller
  than in existing races.      Presuming, in the meantime, that the
   most of these are the bones of a small and perhaps half-domesti
   cated race of sheep with goat-like horns, as hown by the frag
   ment of skull already noticed, and which it may be remarked
   that, although rather less, it agrees closely with Riitimeyer’s
   <U+FB01>gure of the skull of the “ Schaf aus dem Oberland von Gran
   biinden,” which he thinks may be the descendants of his “ Torf
   schaf,” or sheep of the lake-dwellings.     A similar race of sheep
  is said to be still preserved in some of the Shetland and Orkney
   Islands.    According to Gastaldi, sheep with goat’s horns are
   also to be met with in the island of Cyprus.     Beside these bones
  that we have ascribed to the sheep, there are a few others which,
  although they do not differ materially in size or shape, are of a
  closer and harder texture, and have altogether a smoother and
  more polished aspect, with the muscular ridges sharper and
   better de<U+FB01>ned.     These I think may with some probability be set
   down as the bones of a small goat.                         '
       The relics of the Dog, although not numerous, are character
   istic enough: they comprise a number of the molar and canine
   teeth and pieces of the bones of the legs, all more or less broken ;
   the lower end of the humerus is the only joint quite entire.
   These bones indicate a somewhat large dog with rather powerful
   limbs, perhaps an animal larger than the general size of our
   shepherd’s dogs.      Tlfe bones are too imperfect to admit of
   comparison with the measurements given by Riitimeyer of the
   bones of his “Torfhund,” which, he considers, resembled the
      J
  .“ agdhund
                 ” and the “
                                  Wachtelhund.”     I  infer, however,
   that the bones in question have belonged to a larger race than
   his “Torfhund,” which Lubbock says “ was of middle size, and
  appears to have resembled our present beagles.”          It seems to

have been larger, too, than the race of dogs that have left their
remains in the marl-beds of Italy.
   The bones of the Fox were scarcer than those of the Dog ; other
wise they were in much the same condition.              So far as the evi
dence afforded by a few bones, nearly all broken, can be relied
on, it seems that the Fox of the period was somewhat less than
the present species, as may be seen from the subjoined length of
the tibia, the only bone entire, compared with the length of the
tibia of the common fox :—

    It may be remarked that the fox of the lake-dwellings, accord
ing to Riitimeyer, was also smaller than the present species.
    Of the Cat there were only three bones unbroken; they con
sist of a humerus, an ulna, and a radius : the humerus and ulna
are those of the right side, and may be of the same individual.
The radius, from its length, has apparently belonged to a larger
specimen.      From their size and muscular ridges it is clear that
they   are the  bones of a larger and stronger species than the do
mestic cat, which is said not to have been known in Europe until
about the ninth century. The following are the lengths of the
bones   :—

blows struck by a cutting instrument.             The cuts are oblique,
but appear to have been deep enough to admit of the horn being
broken in two. The bones of the birds are all those of large
species: one or two of them appear to be parts of the shafts of
leg-bones ; another is the proximal end of an ulna, and has per

                                   PART  II.
    Having in the <U+FB01>rst part of this paper brie<U+FB02>y described the
animal remains found associated with stone implements and pot
tery in the shell-mound at St. Andrews, it is now of import
ance to direct attention more fully to the nature of these imple

330                Mr. R. Walker    an   Ancient Shell
ments and pottery than was compatible with the scope of the
 previous part of the paper.
    The stone implements are formed chie<U+FB02>y of clay-ironstone,
 a rock common nearly everywhere (along the shore, and where
 the sedimentary rocks crop out) in this locality.         The specimens
 showing any appreciable design or shape are few in comparison
 with the great number of broken stones and chips, which, in
most cases, are neither more nor less than pieces of stone broken,
many of them, to a sharp edge ; and although evidently broken
by the hand of man, they are in general so destitute of form,
that one would think, if they were intended for use at all, that
at best it would be the sharp edges only that could be of much
 service: these, of course, might be applied to various cutting
purposes, as seems to be still the practice of some savage tribes.
And it is very likely that a considerable number of these frag
ments are merely the refuse left from the manufactory of a better
shaped class of weapons.         However this may be, there are about
a dozen specimens made of the same material, which, although
rudely enough formed, evince a certain degree of care and
 skill in breaking and chipping them into the requisite shapes.
 None of these objects have been polished; but most of them
have undergone a grinding or rubbing process, extending an
inch or so up from the cutting edge, which it was meant, no
doubt, to improve.       The grinding appears to have been some
times con<U+FB01>ned to one side of the implement.              Some of the spe
cimens, however, are so much corroded, pieces about §th of an
inch in thickness having scaled off them, that it is impossible to           _
say with certainty whether they have been ground to an edge on
 both sides or not.      The largest of these articles, which seems
to be of the usual chisel shape, is 5 inches in length, and 12- inch
in breadth.      One of the smaller kind (<U+FB01>g. 1, Plate V.) is 3 inches
long by 1} inch in breadth, and is hollowed or ground out at the
cutting edge in the form of a gouge. 'Fig. 2 is another of the
chisel forms; it is 3% inches long by 1 inch broad at the cutting
edge, which is rounded. This specimen‘has split in two. Fig. 3
is 2%- inches long by 1 inch at broadest, and is bevelled o<U+FB01>' ob
liquely at the cutting edge. Fig. 4 is 2 inches long, at broadest
part 1% inch 3 it is concave at the cutting edge, and is hollowed
out toward the edge on both sides.           Fig. 5 is thin, blunt, and
circular at the lower end, and has the body of the implement
rubbed or ground to a nearly round form; it is 2% inches long.
Fig. 6 is 2% inches long, and is of the human canine tooth form,
but is somewhat blunt at the cutting edge, and tapers away to
a sharp point at the upper end.         Fig. '7 is 22- inches long by  11,
inch broad at the edge, which      is   straight transversely.     Fig.

  one side,      round on the other, and has both edges concave.
    Fig. 9 appears to be part of an axe; it is of a triangular shape,
    and is 3-21-inches broad at the cutting edge, and at the point
    where it is broken across (about 3% inches from the edge) it is
    1% inch broad by 12 inch thick.           Fig. 10 represents one of the
   thin disks of stone with a small hole pierced in the centre.
       There are two or three objects made of greenstone; one of
    these has been broken to a conical point, and may have been
   used as a mallet, <U+FB01>xed into a handle.             Another of these green
    stone article has been chipped into a round form, and in size is
   not unlike' the handle of a modern knife.
       That the Ancient Britons possessed some other and better
   implements than those under consideration,                 is,
                                                               Ithink, possible
   enough.       Steenstrup    is of opinion, according to Lubbock*, that
   the mound-builders of Denmark had likewise better implements
   than those generally found in their middens, and that                          it
                                                                                 is
   only those things which art could not make available and which
   were thrown away as useless, or accidentally lost, that we can
   expect to meet with in these deposits.              At the same time,              it
   must be borne       in'niind   that    the

   this district, is   not nearly so easily made into useful implements

 332                 Mr. R. Walker   an Ancient Shell
likewise exhibits bulges and an inequality of thickness of the
 walls suf<U+FB01>cient, I think, to militate against the idea of its having
 been shaped on a wheel.        The handle is not genuine, but has
 been restored from pieces of the handles of other vessels*.
      Of the numerous fragments of pottery met with, it is to be
 regretted that none are large enough to admit of a positive state
  ment as to what had been the prevailing size and shape of the rest
 of these ancient vessels.    There is one piece of the side of a vase,
 however, that may assist us in arriving at something like a near
  approximation to the size and shape of some of them at least.
  This fragment has belonged to a vessel evidently of a somewhat
  globular form, haying a diameter at the mouth of about 9 inches,
  from which it bulges out downward till it attains a diameter
  of nearly 12 inches, whence it appears to haVe contracted in
  wardly. There are a considerable number of the bottom pieces of
 these vases ; and although all are more or less broken, they show
 in general a diameter of about 6 inches.          If we were to assume
  that the vessel under consideration had a like diameter at the
  bottom, thus restored it would be a vase with a diameter at
  month of 9 inches, at bulge 12 inches, at bottom 6 inches, the
  height about 9 or 10 inches, with the lip projecting externally,
  and the proportions and shape such as may be occasionally met
  with in ancient pottery. The most, if not the whole, of this
  pottery has been hand-made ; the irregular thickness of the walls
 and its ‘rude unsymmetrical appearance suf<U+FB01>ciently attest this.
 There are two or three pieces, however, which, although too
  fragmentary to allow of a very decided opinion being pronounced

expected to occur on hand-made. pottery.            In these cases the
potter may have used, if not a wheel, a mould or gauge of some
kind to assist him in giving a more regular shape to the better
class of vessels. This ware varies from a yellowish to a blackish
colour; some examples are brown on the outside and inside
surfaces, and have the interior paste almost black. Some, again,
are brown on the outside, and the paste and inside black, while
other pieces are of a blackish colour throughout.             All this
earthenware has been made of very coarse clay full of small
stones, some of them one-fourth of an inch or more in size, and
from their number they give a rough, and in some cases a
porous-like appearance to the fractured edges.           There were a
number of pieces of handles found; and from the size of some
of them it is evident that they had pertained to vessels of consider
able dimensions.      Most of the handles are punctured in a very
irregular manner, the holes often extending right through ; this
is the only ornament observable on any of the fragments, if
ornament it can be called.        From the irregular way in which
this has   been   performed, and from the brims of some of the
utensils where the-walls are thickest being punctured in a similar
style, it is just possible that it may have been intended as much
to assist the baking as to improve the look of the vessel.         One
of the bottom pieces of a vase bears the impression of the pot
ter’s <U+FB01>ngers very distinctly on the lower side; the <U+FB01>ngers seem
to have been small.      According to Birch*, <U+FB01>nger-marks are not
unfrequently    met  with   on old Celtic pottery.     Two or three of
the shards have here and there patches of a greenish-coloured
 glaze on their surfaces, this appears to be the result of vitri<U+FB01>ca
tion ; for there is generally a small hole about the middle of
 each patch, out of which the vitrifying matter seems to have bub
 bled during the process of baking.         Miss Meteyard'l‘, speaking
 on this subject, says,
                          “ In Scotland, where rocks abound, mica
 or other fusible matter might be present in clay of which vessels
 had been formed, and yet be unperceived till, in some solitary
 instance, partial vitri<U+FB01>cation had ensued from a higher degree of
                                          ‘

    It is now necessary to say a few words touching the probable
 antiquity of this mound, so far as the remains found in it
 and their condition seem to warrant.         It may be observed that
 the species of animals are not numerous in this mound when
 compared with those of the Danish mounds and the lake-dwell
 ings of Switzerland, although the bones were broken apparently
 in a similar manner.       Whether this has been done by people

   belonging to the same or a different race may not be easy to
   determine; at any rate it indicates that in habits and customs
   they had much in common.         Still, irrespective of other matters,
   competent judges   tell  us that there are not remains of domesti
  cated animals found in the Danish middens; we are therefore
   bound to consider them the oldest deposits of the kind yet
  discovered.   During the earliest of the lake-dwellings, how
  ever, several animals are said to have been domesticated, such as
  the Ox, Pig, Sheep, Dog, &c.        These are the animals, it will be
  observed, whose bones were found in the greatest number here ;
  not only so, but the small Ox (Bos- longifrons) appears to have
  been as common during the period of the oldest of these lake
  settlements as it was at St. Andrews.             Lubbock says of the
  oxen *, “ the third or longifrons race is by far the most common
  of the three.   It occurs in all the Pileworks, and at Moossee
  dorf and Wangen (that is to say, in the settlements which are
  supposed to be the oldest), almost to the exclusion of the primi
                                                                                  '
 genius race.”     To these lake-dwellings, it appears to me, the
  St. Andrews mound makes a near approach in point of antiquity.
  Of course before a like antiquity can be satisfactorily established,
 other and more extensive investigations will require to be made
 in our Scottish mounds on other parts of - the coast.              And
 perhaps all that can be safely said on the present evidence                is,
 that, the deposits are not contemporaneous, that of St. Andrews

 other places on the eastern coast of Scotland, although, as yet,
 they are not numerous, and some of them not very productive;

 by expect to hear of others. Meantime those of the Moray

at considerable length by Mr. Laing*: the animals in the list
given by him are similar to those met with here; the main ex
ception seems to be the bones of two or three species of ceta
ceous animals.      There was only one species of 0):, however, the
 Bos longifrons; and the horse is described as a large-headed ani
 mal of small size, but considerably larger than the Shetland
 pony, corresponding perfectly with the Equus fossilis.                   Mr.
 Laing appears to be of opinion that none of the animals had
 been in a domestic state, with perhaps the exception of the dog.
 Should this be the case, then they would be considered of greater
 antiquity than the remains met with in the mound at St. An
 drews.     As already observed, however, more extensive researches
 are necessary before we can arrive at any reliable conclusions as
 to the relations of the Scottish mounds to each other, as well as
 to the continental deposits.          There is another matter in con
 nexion with shell-mounds on which              I  would venture to say a
 word or two: some people appear to hold the opinion that if a
 mound is found to contain the bones of domestic animals,
 such as the Ox, Pig, Horse, 860., it is very likely an accumulation
 of recent date, and not entitled to rank as a prehistoric deposit
 at all.   While this may in some cases be quite true, yet if it was
 to be generally acted on, and no mound examined that was found
 to contain the skull of a horse or ,the horn-core of a cow, it might
 be   the means of depriving us of much valuable information,
 because the most, if not all, of our domestic animals of that class
 are in all probability neither more nor less than the descendants of
 those races whose bones we <U+FB01>nd in the recent (geologically speak
 ing) clays and gravels of the country. Besides, we do not appear,
 during the whole of the historic period, to have succeeded in
 adding a single quadruped to the list of our domesticated ani
 mals.     All the animals of that kind worthy, or, at all events,
 capable of being domesticated, were brought into that condition
 long before the historic era of Western Europe at any rate. We
 have no doubt improved the breeds of our animals,                        and
 of course to some extent modi<U+FB01>ed their structure by means of
 arti<U+FB01>cial selection.    Nevertheless it is an open question whether
 we have done more than merely improve a race of animals who
 have descended to us in a domesticated            state from the men of
'the Neolithic age in Europe.

             XLIII.    On the Dispersion of Light in Gases.
                         By Dr. KETTELER*.
      HE livelier   the interest becomes which is now taken in the
         search after the laws whereby the propagation of light is
 connected with the density and chemical composition of the me
 dium in which it moves, the more <U+FB01>rmly shall we be convinced
 that it is only through a comprehensive study of the phenomena
of refraction and dispersion in gaseous bodies that the discovery
of comparatively simple laws is possible, and that the true path
by which to approach the incomparably more complex case of
 solid and liquid bodies lies through these.         I have therefore un
dertaken to submit the refracting and dispersive powers of gases
to a more accurate investigation.          The essential parts of the
physical portion of this investigation are already completed, and
I  therefore communicate in the following pages the results that
have been arrived at. '
    Thanks to the method       I  adopted, I have succeeded in deter
mining with precision the indices of refraction of the gases for
the separate Fraunhofer’ s lines, and in ascertaining the law which
connects these indices with the density.            I  have indeed aban
doned the method of prismatic analysis, which has hitherto been
adopted almost exclusively, and based my apparatus on the prin
ciple of interference.     If it be borne in mind that the excess of
the index of refraction above unity, which becomes in the interfe
rential method the object of direct observation, is, according to
the older experiments       of Arago and Biot, proportional to the
density—if it be considered, further, that the advantage just men
tioned is of still greater importance in the study of dispersion,
since exact coincidences of differently coloured fringes are very
easily established, and are moreover comparatively little affected
by changes of form in the closing plates, whereas the accurate
adjustment of an instrument upon the lines of a spectrum whose
entire length is measured by seconds must be nearly impossible,
it will be admitted that the method that has been adopted is the
only appropriate one.       Sources of homogeneous light of various
colours   were of course   necessary;   and the fringes had to be fol
lowed, when needful, by thousands, without the interposition of
compensators.      It will be seen that such a mode of operating
could not have been practically available but for the     '   discovery of
Professors Bunsen and Kirchhoff.
    The following experiments were made for the most part in the
new Institute of Natural Science at Heidelberg, where Professor
 Kirchho<U+FB02>" most liberally placed at my disposal the requisite space
 and apparatus, without which this dif<U+FB01>cult investigation would
 not have been possible.

          Dr. Ketteler    on the Dispersion      of Light in    Gases.        337
    The  complete     determination of the optical properties of the
gases required a connected and uniform measurement of all the
elements concerned.         In the <U+FB01>rst place it was needful to measure
more accurately than had hitherto been done the wave-lengths
of the three sources of homogeneous light which                    I  employed,
namely the lithium-, sodium-, and thallium-<U+FB02>ames.                       For this
purpose the method recommended                  by   Fizeau*     was   followed.
This consists in <U+FB01>nding the coincidences which occur when an
appropriate system of Newton’s rings is illuminated by each pair
                                                                                  '
of the above-mentioned <U+FB02>ames simultaneously. By help of an
apparatus in which the plates needed to produce these rings were
contained—the upper one being <U+FB01>xed but so arranged as to be
capable of assuming any required inclination to the lower one,
while the latter could be moved vertically up and down, without
the slightest twisting, by means of a lever worked bya micrometric
screw—the number of rings intervening between two coincidences
could be observed: the following, for instance, are examples of
numbers actually thus obtained :—
                __
         ,L_1._M,
                —

    The delicacy of the apparatus was such that, in moving the
lever, the <U+FB01>nger had to pass over a length of more than 10 milli
metres in order to cause a displacement to the extent of a single
fringe.     As the mean of twenty-three observations of this kind,
the following ratios were obtained :—
       12 =1-138953;            in =1-101568;            Q =1-254638.
       [Na                      lTl                      [Tl
    The product of     the <U+FB01>rst two numbers gives 1'254634.
    In order to obtain the absolute values of the wave-lengths, we
must adopt for ZN, Fraunhofer’s value = 00005888 millim.,
inasmuch as Fizeau’s contemplated repetition of this measure
ment has not yet been published, and to determine it myself lay
beside the scope of my investigation.             We thus obtain, in hun
dred-millionths of a      millimetre,
           lLi=67061'6, lNa=58880'0,                lTl=53451'0,
numbers which may be regarded as relatively tolerany certain,
as far as the <U+FB01>fth place.
    It was now possible to proceed to the determination of the
dispersive properties of gases.            The gases examined were the
<U+FB01>ve following':—air,        carbonic acid, hydrogen, cyanogen, and
sulphurous acid.
   The gases were placed in tubes between thick interference
plates, such as those introduced and several times described by

    pump, consisting of a metal cylinder in which there moved, with
    as much friction as possible, a piston capable of being slowly
    and continuously screwed in or out by a proper contrivance.
    The changes of pressure were read off by a cathetometer, on a
    manometer     consisting of glass tubes 15 millims. wide.       The
    pressure   could be augmented, if required,'from its ordinary

    to <U+FB01>nd the second, third, &c., noting at the same time the cor

 think, justify this assertion ; for the method employed has ren

the important law, that the dispersive power of a given substance
is a property depending rather upon its individual nature than
on the more or less dense state of aggregation of its molecules,
has thus been established.        I reserve to myself to pursue this
investigation    and  to extend  it  to homologous series.
    Finally,  as to the  formula    that has been proposed,      I think   I
have shown that it ful<U+FB01>ls its purpose in the simplest and most
comprehensive manner. But as long as it does not rest upon any
more direct theoretical basis, it may be regarded as a more or
less happy expression of the phenomena.
    On the other hand, the uneXpected result to which the fore
 going calculations have led, namely, that in isotropic substances
the constants of refraction and dispersion are independent of
physical constitution, but essentially connected with chemical
characteristics, cannot any longer be doubted.          The only excep
 tion to the above rule is presented by water, at least within cer
tain limits, inasmuch as its index of refraction increases belOw 4°
 (according to Jamin and others) as the density diminishes.

  XLIV.     On the Conversion    of Wind-charts into Passage-charis.

            most direct   line between two points of the ocean is
 THEseldom        the quickest route for sailing-vessels.     A compro
 mise has always to be made between directness of route on the
  one hand, and the best chance of propitious winds and currents
 on the other.      Hence it is justly argued that an inquiry into
 the distribution of the winds over all parts of the ocean is of
 high national importance to a seafaring people like ourselves.
 A knowledge of the distribution of the winds would clearly
 enable a calculation to be made which would show the most
 suitable passage in any given case.
     But as a matter of fact, no calculations have yet been made
 upon this basis ; much less have charts been contrived to enable

  346      .       Mr. F.  Galtion on the Conversion  of
  a navigator to estimate     by simple measurements the probable
   duration of a proposed passage.      The wind-charts compiled by
  the Meteorological Department of the Board of Trade are seldom
  used by navigators; for they do not a<U+FB02>'ord the results that sea
   men principally require; they only give data from which those
   results might be calculated by some hitherto unexplained pro
  cess, which, we can easily foresee, must be an exceedingly tedious
  one.
     To convert wind-charts, or the tables of wind-direction from
  which the wind-charts have been compiled, into passage-charts,
  we must ascertain the distances that ships of different classes
  would attain in an hour, if they made the best of their way
  under the same wind towards different points of the compass.
  With a moderate wind, a merchantman of the class that usually
  navigates the Atlantic will, by heating to windward, make 2%
  miles an hour, right in the Wind’s eye. At two points o<U+FB01>' the
  wind it will make 3 miles; at four, 41 miles; at six, 7 miles ; at
  eight, 8% miles ; at ten, 9 miles 3 at twelve, 9% miles ; at fourteen,
  82 miles ; and “at sixteen, or with the wind right astern, it will
  make 7% miles.      \Ve must next turn to the wind-charts, or to
  the Tables from which they were compiled, to ascertain the pro~
 portion' of the winds that blow from different points of the com
 pass, in the region we are investigating. Thus in one particular
  case we <U+FB01>nd, out of one hundred observations, that six referred
  to N. winds, fourteen to N.N.E., seventeen to N.E., six to
 E.N.E., three to E., two to E.S.E., two to S.E., <U+FB01>ve to S.S.E.,
  six to 8., six to S.S.W., six to S.W., three to W.S.W., three
 to W., three to W.N.WV., four to N.W., <U+FB01>ve to N.N.W., and
 nine calms.      The force of the winds was not recorded in this
 instance; we must therefore, for want of better information,
 assume them to be moderate.          We have now to calculate the
 progress that ships could make towards each point of the com
 pass, under the several in<U+FB02>uences of each of these winds. In
 the example taken, the N. wind will be reckoned as lasting 6
 per cent. of an hour, and therefore ships would be able to sail
 during its prevalence, '014 mile to the N., '018 to the N.N.E.,
 and so on.      The N.N.E. wind lasting 14 per cent. of an hour
 will enable ships to sail '042 mile to the N., '033 mile to
 N.N.E., and so on. The N.E., E.N.E., and all the other winds
 would have their in<U+FB02>uence similarly calculated.       We thus obtain
 a Table of sixteen lines (not reckoning the line of zeros that cor
               “
 respond to      calms”) and of sixteen columns, whose addition
 gives the total progress of one particular class of ships, in one
~hour, to all points of the compass, under the in<U+FB02>uence of the
 winds that blow in the ocean-district under consideration.

    We should not be justi<U+FB01>ed in usually adopting an “average
force” for the winds, though, for simplicity of explanation, we
selected the foregoing example, in which we were obliged to do
so.   If we con<U+FB01>ned our computation to the effect of simple ave
rages, then an alternation of squalls and calms would be impro
perly reckoned as moderate weather. We must therefore group
the winds, not necessarily to each degree of force, but,   may be,      it
in two or perhaps three groups. The Tables would therefore
consist not of sixteen lines, but of twice or thrice that number.
For the rapid performance of these calculations we should tabu
latc the passages of various classes of ships to each of the sixteen
points of the compass, under the in<U+FB02>uence of winds of, say, thirty
di<U+FB02>'erent degrees of duration, and six of force, making total of 180a
lines for each class of ships.     In each line the <U+FB01>gures should be
repeated,   so as to sweep  not  only once but twice round the com?
pass.    If these  are printed  on  separate slips of paper, the labour
of copying them would be wholly avoided; for the same slips

XLV. Description of         a new Proportion-Table     equivalent to a
                                             J
    Sliding-Rule 13 feet 4 inches long. By . D. EVERETT, D.C.L.,
    Assistant Professor of Mathematics in Glasgow University*.
        LOGARITHMIC scale is a scale of divisions with num
         bers written against them or otherwise indicated, charac
terized by the property that equal distances between divisions
correspond to equal ratios between the corresponding numbers.
With the aid of such a scale, a fourth proportional to any three
numbers can be found by measuring the distance between the
<U+FB01>rst and second, and setting off this distance from the third.
    The common sliding-rule consists essentially of two such scales,
which are perfect fac-similes of each other, one of them being on
the solid wood of the rule, and the other on a slidingpiece which
moves beside it.      In order to <U+FB01>nd a fourth proportional by means
of this instrument, it is only necessary to move the slide until the
<U+FB01>rst and second terms are opposite one another, and the fourth
term will then be found opposite the third.       Multiplication and
division can of course be performed in this way, since they are
reducible to proportions in which one term is unity.
    Each of the two scales begins with 1 and ends with 100 ; and
the <U+FB01>rst half, which extends from 1 to 10, is precisely similar to
the second half, which extends from 10 to 100; for the numbers
1, 2, 3, &c. having the same ratios to one another as 10, 20, 30,
860., must be placed at the same distances apart as these latter.
In general. the division which stands for any one number may
also stand for the product or quotient of this number by any
power of 10.      Eachof the two scales may therefore be said to
contain all numbers twice over, this repetition being adopted in
order to avoid passing out of range when the slide is moved from
its initial position.
    There is another form in use, consisting of two concentric
circles with logarithmic scales placed round their circumferences,
the inner circle being constructed to turn about the common
centre.     In this form of the slide-rule there is no necessity for
duplicates, as passing out of range is impossible; and the com
plete scale from 1 to 10 is made to extend once round each cir
cumference, the division for 10 being identical with that for 1.
    This arrangement effects so great an economy of space as com_
pared with the straight sliding-rule, that it is compatible with
the adoption of a much larger scale.       In fact the circumferences
of the circles may conveniently be made as much as 2 feet, which
implies the same size of scale as in a straight rule 4 feet long.
This advantage, however, is counterbalanced by some drawbacks,
of which perhaps the most serious is the position in which the

British Association at Nottingham.

                Dr. Everett      on a new Proportion-Table.        351
<U+FB01>gures are written, radiating outwards in all directions like the
signatures to a round-robin—an arrangement which prevents the
eye from gathering them in easily at one view, and renders it
necessary, after the <U+FB01>rst and second terms of a proportion have
been brought into coincidence,     to turn the instrument bodily
into a different position before the third and fourth terms can be
found.    This necessity for handling the instrument after it has
been set, demands a certain amount of stiffness in the turning of
the moveable circle, to prevent unintentional displacement, While,
on the other hand, too much stiffness retards the operation of
setting; and between these two extremes, with the swelling and
 shrinking of materials to increase the dif<U+FB01>culty, the true mean
 of convenient working is not often attained.
    The new arrangement which we have now to describe is free
from these disadvantages,    and at the same time permits of a
much greater enlargement of scale. Its distinguishing feature
consists in breaking up each of the two pieces which constitute a
sliding-rule into a number of equal parts, and arranging these
consecutively in tabular fashion in parallel columns, the columns
on one of the two pieces being visible through openings out be
tween the columns of the other.
    The arrangement of the columns is as follows. One of the
two pieces, that to which we shall give the name B, contains an
even number of columns, which, if placed in one continuous line
in the order of their succession, would form a logarithmic scale
in duplicate, like one of the scales of the ordinary sliding-rule.
    The other piece, which we shall call A, contains only half as
many columns, but these are of double the length.         They must
be so arranged that the numbers in any one column are conse
cutive, and that the lower half of any column is precisely similar
to the upper part of that which follows it.
   In one of these two pieces       theoretically indifferent which)
                                      (it
                                       is
openings are cut between the columns, and the arrangement           is
                        '
complete.
     It willbe observed from this description that the piece called
A    istwice as high as     B,
                            but only half as wide. When one piece
is laid upon the other, the portion common to both          rectangle
                                                              is
                                                              a
whose area      half that of either of the pieces; and this rectangle
               is
contains on each of the two pieces        complete series of numbers
                                            a
—that to say, series proceeding gradually from certain num
          is        a                                    a
ber up to another ten times as great.        All the numbers on one
piece have the same ratio to those which stand opposite them on
the other; so that we have thus       complete Table of proportional
                                       a
numbers for the particular ratio corresponding to the position in
which the pieces have been laid; and this ratio can be made
anything we please.      It of course necessary that the pieces be
                                 is

 so placed as to have their columns parallel.          In rapid working,
 this adjustment can be made with fair accuracy at a cursory
 glance; but in order to enable the operator to make it with the
 greatest possible nicety, both the pieces are ruled with lines at
 right angles to the columns, and these lines are placed about a
 hair’s breadth wider apart on one pieCe than on the other, so that,
 on the principle of the,vernier, one line can always be found
 which will extend continuously across both.
    The arrangement described will be best understood by inspect
ing the specimen which accompanies this paper*.              The material
which has been selected for the pieces is Bristol-board, on which
the numbers and divisions are printed from copper plates.            They
 are distinguished by the names A and B in the sense already
explained.      The card B contains twenty columns, each 8 inches
long,   which   if arranged inoue line would form a.logarithmic
scale in duplicate of the length of 13 feet 4: inches, precisely
similar to one of the scales on the common sliding-rule greatly
magni<U+FB01>ed,.and having a proportionately greater number of divi
sions.    Card A has ten columns, each 16 inches long, and con
tains precisely the same matter as B, only differently arranged, as
already explained.       In using the cards, B is laid uppermost, in
such a position that its columns alternate with those of A, the
latter being visible through the openings 01' slits which are out
between the former.        The divisions on A are on the right side of
its columns, and those on B are on the left, extending to the edge
of the slits, so that the divisions in those columns which work
together are in close juxtaposition.        In adjusting the cards, it
will be found that a movement left or right to the extent of one
column-breadth is equivalent to a movement of 8 inches up or
down.
    The largeness of the scale is such that, without undue crowd
ing,'the space from 1 to 1'1 is divided into a hundred parts; so
that every number from 1000 up to' 1100 has a division of its
own, the last and nearest of these divisions being about 312 of an
inch apart; On the best sliding-rules of the ordinary construc
tion, this interval, which is here divided into 100, is only divided
into 5.     From 1100 to 2100 there is a division for every even
number, from this point to 4800 a division for every <U+FB01>fth num
ber, and thence to the end of the scale a division for every three
<U+FB01>gure number.
    Again, whereas in the ordinary rule only the <U+FB01>rst <U+FB01>gure is
printed, the <U+FB01>rst three <U+FB01>gures are here printed as far as 47 9, and
thence to the end of the scale the <U+FB01>rst two <U+FB01>gures.
    Some persons can never use the common sliding-rule success

fully, on account of the dif<U+FB01>culty of setting it with suf<U+FB01>cient ex
actness, and of reading o<U+FB02>‘ correctly when the answer falls be
tween two divisions.     Such persons may content themselves with
reading o<U+FB02>' from the Proportion-Table to the nearest division
only, as the error thus involved averages considerably less than
1 part in a thousand.       To produce so great an error as 1 per
cent., there must be an error in setting or in reading of to the
amount of fully i, of an inch.      In fact if all the divisions were
erased and only the <U+FB01>gures left, the instrument would still work
as correctly as the ordinary slide-rule.
 - These considerations have not,
                                      however, operated as induce
ments to carelessness in the execution of the divisions. On the
contrary, every effort has been made to carry accuracy to the
utmost attainable degre'e.’    To this end the plates were <U+FB01>rst ruled
with equidistant lines bymeans of a dividing-engine, the dis
tance between the lines on plate B being equivalent to        l in the
third place of logarithms, and the distance between those on A
one-tenth greater.    Then, after proofs of these lines had been
printed, and the principal divisions <U+FB01>lled in with a pen to serve
as a check against mistakes, the divisions were executed on the
plates by means of the dividing-engine, the regulating wheel
having <U+FB01>fty teeth, and each tooth corresponding to two in the
<U+FB01>fth place of logarithms.     The lines which had previously been
ruled on the plates furnished a test of the equality of different
parts of the screw ; and the small inequalities, which were thus
with the aid of a magnifying-glass detected, amounting in their
greatest combined effects to three teeth of the regulating wheel,
Were in part corrected by advancing or retarding the wheel, the
correction thus applied being generally less than the observed
error, and never exceeding it; for it is obvious that the true cor
rection would be in general about half the observed error.
   It is considered certain that the distance of a division from its
true place in no instance amounts to so much as 2% teeth of
the wheel, or 5 in the <U+FB01>fth place of logarithms, with the excep
tion of the last two inches of the <U+FB01>rst column of B, where the
divisions seem to be placed too high by something more than
this amount, owing in part to an accident which occurred in this
portion of the work, and in part to the fact that this column was
the <U+FB01>rst executed, and that the corrections          above mentioned
were not applied until its completion. When great accuracy is
required in the use of the Proportion-Table, this <U+FB01>rst column can
always be dispensed with and the duplicate column (the eleventh)
used in its stead, as plate B contains one column more than ne
cessity  requiresz
   A  more serious source of error to be guarded against is un
equal stretching or shrinking of the material on which the Table

 is printed.    It is not found that any serious difference exists be
 tween different parts of the same card; but it is found that some
 cards stretch or shrink more than others.        This dif<U+FB01>culty has
 thus far been completely ovefcome by selecting and pairing
 together those cards which agree best.
    It is worthy of remark that, the breaking up of the scale into
 parallel columns goes far to diminish the injurious effect of ex
.pansion or contraction; for in a straight slide-rule this cause
 operates on the whole length, whereas in the present arrange
 ment it only operates upon a twentieth part of the length.
     Imay mention, as matter of curiosity, that in the case of a cir
 cular slide-rule it may be shown that, when expansion or con
 traction operates in one direction only and affects both circles
 alike, its injurious effect         is,
                                in the moSt unfavourable position,

is altogether dispensed with, and question and answer are read

     It would not be dif<U+FB01>cult to construct, on the parallel-column
 principle, logarithmic scales of sines and tangents to be used
 with the Proportion-Table, in the same manner as Gunter’s
 “lines of sines and tangents” are used with his f‘ line of lines.”
 But, on the ground of greater simplicity and intelligibility, it is
 considered better to dispense with these auxiliaries, and in their
                                                                              ‘

     While alluding to Gunter’s scale, we cannot forbear quoting
 from Mackay’s ‘Description and Use of the Sliding Gunter in
 Navigation’ (2nd edit., 1812) . He says in the preface, “Although
                                                                                ‘
 a scale 2 feet long may be su<U+FB01>icient for performing any dag/s
 work with all the accuracy that may be desired, yet its divisions
 are too small for obtaining with exactness the apparent time from
 the altitude of a celestial object, the latitude from double alti
 tudes and the elapsed time, or' for reducing the apparent to the
 true distance; and therefore it is to he wished that its length
 was increased to at least double its present size.”         What would
 he have said to the present “ Table,” which instead of being only
 double is seven* times the size of the old “ Gunter.”
     We may add, by way of appendix, that we are at present try
 ing the experiment of putting the Proportion-Table round a cy
 linder, the arrangement being so contrived that those divisions
 which work together will be in the sanie plane, and that the outer
piece can be either rotated about the inner or moved longitudi
nally without rubbing the divisions. This plan promises some
advantages,      among others the abolition of the parallel lines
which are now necessary for accurate adjustment ; but we
scarcely expect it will be found to admit of such rapid working
as the present arrangement.
     In concluding this paper, the author desires to express his
obligations to Messrs. Fulton Brothers, engravers to calico
printers, Glasgow, for the valuable assistance which they afforded
him in the mechanical execution of the Table, and for gra
tuitously allowing him the use, during a period of several weeks,
of the very convenient and accurate dividing-engine with which
the divisions were engraved.

If   the experiment be carefully conducted, and if there be no
error in the strength of the standard solution, the error in
the measurement made as above described ought not to ex
ceed 0'02 gr. per cubic inch for a single experiment.                  If the
mean of a number of experiments be taken, the error will of
course be still less*.
    The author has given to this instrument the name saccharo
 meter, derived from one important use to which it may be ap—
 plied. ,This, however, is but one of ,its applications ; and there
 are many others at least as important.           It may generally be de
<U+FB01>ned to be an instrument by which the ratio of the rotatory power
of any transparent <U+FB02>uid to that of a standard <U+FB02>uid may be accu
rately determined.
    It is not desirable to use a very strong solution of the sub
stance to be examined.           The reason of this is the imperfect
compensation which exists between <U+FB02>uids possessed of opposite
rotatory powers.        It is generally assumed that the ratio of the
rotation produced in the planes of polarization of any two of the
simple rays of which a white ray is composed is the same, what
ever he the substance causing the rotation.             It follows, indeed,
from the law of Biot, that this is not accurately true; but it has
been generally supposed that the error is too small to be per
ceived.     If this were true, it would always be possible to assign
to the lengths of two columns of oppositely rotating <U+FB02>uids such
a ratio that the effect of the one should be accurately compen
sated by the e<U+FB01>'ect of the other.         But the author has found that
in certain cases the error is very perceptible indeed.                This is
shown ’by the impossibility of giving to the tube           ff  any position

'in which the shades of colour are exactly the same in the tvvo
 parts of the circular image.           Suppose, for example, that the
 position of the tube is such that the plane of polarization of the
 mean ray has the same position as at <U+FB01>rst.              This plane is then
 equally inclined to the planes of analyzation of the two parts of
 the analyzing prism.           But this is not true of the planes of po
 larization of any of the other rays ; of these, the less refrangible
 will have their planes of polarization nearer to one of the planes
 of analyzation, while those of the more refrangible are nearer to
 the other.
    There will therefore be in the one half of the image a prepon
 derance of red light, and in the other a preponderance of blue
 light, when the densities of the two parts are equal.           The differ
 ence of colour, which makes it dif<U+FB01>cult to equalize these intensities
 with perfect accuracy, will evidently be greater the greater the
 amount of the rotations which the compensating <U+FB02>uids would
 severally produce, and therefore the greater the strength of the
 solution.
     On the other hand, it must be remembered that the error in
 the result, arising from an incorrect position of the tube, is in
 versely proportional to the length of the column of the compen
 sating <U+FB02>uid.        Thus, if the reading of the scale be '1, an error
 of one division, or '00], will have the same effect on the result
 as an error ten times as great would have if the readiiig were
 1'000.
     No general rule can be given for determining the strength of
 the solution which it is desirable to use.          If the law of Biot, sc.
 that the amounts of rotation produced by the same substance
 in the planes of polarization of the different simple rays are pro
 portional to the squares of the corresponding refractive indices,
 be strictly true, then, the more nearly these indices are in
 the same proportion for the <U+FB02>uid under examination and the
 compensating <U+FB02>uid, the stronger may be the solution used.
 If the <U+FB02>uid under examination be a saccharine solution, and
 the compensating <U+FB02>uid French oil of turpentine, a solution con
 taining in each cubic inch thirty grains of sugar may be used
 without inconvenience*.

XLVII.       On the In<U+FB02>uence of the Tidal Wave on the Motion of the
                         Moon.    By JAMES CROLL*.
                   “ On the In<U+FB02>uence of the Tidal Wave on the Mo
 IN tionpaper
         a
              of the    Moon,” which appeared in the Philosophical
 Magazine for August last, I inadvertently represented Professor
William Thomson as having come to the conclusion that the earth,
regarded as a time-keeper, is actually losing about four seconds
 in a year. This, however, is incorrect. In Professor Thomson’s
 paper on the subject a certain state of circumstances as to the
 tides is speci<U+FB01>ed, not as a probable hypothesis, but as one on
 which a superior limit of the amount of tidal in<U+FB02>uence on the
 earth’s rotation may be estimated.             On that hypothesis the
 earth would, one hundred years hence, be rotating so much slower
 than at present as to be then losing four seconds a year on a
 perfectly accurate chronometer regulated according to the earth’s
 present rate.
    In my two former papers on the in<U+FB02>uence of the tides, I en
 deavoured to show that the solar wave must exercise a retarding
 effect on the earth’s motion round the common centre of gravity
 of the earth and moon, similar to what the lunar wave exercises
 upon the earth’s rotation or motion round its own centre of gra
vity-1'.   This, as was pointed out, follows as a direct consequence
 from the fact that, supposing the earth to have no rotation, still
 the waters of the ocean would have to rise and fall in order to
 maintain the solar wave, which in this case would move round
 the earth, not once in twenty-four hours as at present, but once
 his month. And as this motion of the waters, slow as it no
 doubt would he, could not take place without heat being gene
 rated by friction and dissipated into space, the vis viva thus lost
 must be at the expense of the earth’s motion round the common
 centre of gravity of the earth and moon; for, by supposition,
 there is no other motion from which it could be derived.        It can
  be easily proved that this would tend to bring the earth nearer
  to the moon, and thus increase the moon’s angular motion.
     It has been shown by Professor William Thomson, and also
 by the Astronomer Royal, that, owing to the position of the
 tidal wave, the moon is drawn not exactly in the direction of the
 earth’s centre of gravity, but a little to the east of that centre,
  and that in consequence of this, she is made to recede from the
  earth.   Her orbit is enlarged, and her angular motion dimi
 nished.
     It  would therefore seem that the tides produce two distinct
 classes of effects, the one to a certain extent neutralizing the

Astronomer Royal does not, however, in the least degree pre
vent the consumption of the vis viva of the earth’s motion round
the common centre of gravity, although to a certain extent, at
least, it must prevent this consumption from diminishing the
moon’s distance and increasing her angular motion.        But as
this consumption of vis viva will go on throughout inde<U+FB01>nite
ages, if the present order of things remains      unchanged, the
earth and the moon must therefore ultimately come together.

       LL  the labours, all the tendencies of modern science lead to
         the identi<U+FB01>cation of the forces which come into play in
 the physical and chemical phenomena of nature; all the nume
 rical determinations which have been obtained tend to establish
 their equivalence in the most rigorous manner.             A<U+FB02>inity and co
 hesion cannot escape this identi<U+FB01>cation, and already the mecha
 nical theory encloses them within the circle of reasonings which
must soon dispel whatever vague and mysterious notions may
 still be connected with them.
    It cannot be concealed that the study of primary causes, in the
phenomena which we observe and measure, presents in itself a
 serious danger.      In the absence of .any precise and independent
 de<U+FB01>nition of special facts, the consideration of primary causes
leads us, oftener than we suppose, into really begging the ques

  tion and contenting ourselve with specious explanations which
  cannot stand a severe criticism.         Af<U+FB01>nity especially, de<U+FB01>ned as
  the force which determines chemical combinations, has been for
  some time and still is an occult cause, a sort of arche'e to which
  are referred all facts which are not understood, and which thence
  forth are considered to be explained, whereas they are only
  classed, and often badly classed.          Thus to the catalytic force*
  are attributed a host of phenomena which are very obscure, and
                      I
  will remain so, imagine, if they are referred in the lump to
  an entirely unknown cause.            It was certainly supposed that
  they belonged     to  the  same   category when the same name was
  given  to them.    But   the legitimacy of this classi<U+FB01>cation even has
 not been demonstrated.          What can be more arbitrary than to
 class together the catalytic phenomena which depend on the
 action, or on the presence of spongy platinum or of concentrated
 sulphuric acid when the platinum and the acid, so to say, take
 no part in the action ? These phenomena may perhaps be here
 after explained in an essentially different manner, according as
 they have been produced under the in<U+FB02>uence of an eminently
 porous substance like spongy platinum, or under the in<U+FB02>uence of
 a very energetic chemical agent like sulphuric acid.
     Hence in our investigations we must omit all those un
 known forces to which recourse has been had only because their
 effects have not been measured.           On the other hand, all our at
 tention ought to be <U+FB01>xed on the observation and numerical de
 termination of those effects, which alone are within our reach.
 By this work their differences and analogies are established, and
 new light results from these comparisons and these measurements.           ~
     Thus heat and af<U+FB01>nity are constantly concerned in our che

 mical theories.      Af<U+FB01>nity eludes us entirely; yet we attribute to
 it the combination which is the effect of this unknown cause.
 Let us then inVestigate merely the physical circumstances which
 accompany combination, and we shall see how many curious ap
proximations, how many measurable phenomena, present them
 selves to us at every moment.           Heat, they say,_destroys af<U+FB01>nity;
let us, then, persistently investigate the decomposition of bodies
 under the in<U+FB02>uence of heat estimated in quantity or work,
in temperature or vis viva ; we shall at once see how fruitful is
this study, and how independent of hypothesis, of any unknown
force, unknown even from the point of view of the kind of unit
to which its exact or approximate measure is to be referred.             It
is in this sense especially that af<U+FB01>nity, regarded as a force, is an

a quality of matter; in this case it should merely serve to desig

    One point is very urgent ; that      is,to de<U+FB01>ne combination itself.
 Seeking attentively    the  state  of our    knowledge in this respect,
I  <U+FB01>nd, in the <U+FB01>rst place, that the de<U+FB01>nition of combination must
comprehend solution, and can only exclude mixture.               In fact
the phenomena of solution and of combination are joined                      by   a
continuous chain which           impossible to break at any one point.
                           it
                           is
Every    one knows  that interminable   discussions have been raised on
this subject,—-for instance, in respect to metallic alloys and their
liquation; in reference to salts, acids, energetic bases, and their.
 action upon water, alcohol, Ste.        The most certain conclusion
 which can be drawn     is, that there are all possible intermediate
 stages between the phenomena of combination audit-he best-cha
racterized phenomena of solution.
    In endeavouring to formulate    in     the clearest manner the ideas
now current on combination,     I     <U+FB01>nd      cannot be better de<U+FB01>ned
                                               it
than by the fact of change    of   state.    When two substances put
in presence change condition, they combine.              This change of
condition, de<U+FB01>ned in the ordinary manner, shows itself             some by
new property, whether physical or chemical, which discloses new
 qualities of the combined substances—qualities, whether phy
 sical or chemical, which distinguish the combination from simple
 mixture. I    will give an example.
    The question has been asked, Is air           mixture or
                                                    a          combina
                                                                 a
tion? How has this question been solved? The physical and
chemical properties of the elements of air (oxygen and nitrogen)
and of air itself have been successively studied.        They have been
found to be identically the same, always equal in the case of air
to the mean of these properties determined upon each element
 singly.    Hence it  has been concluded that nitrogen and oxygen,
 coming into contact under ordinary atmospheric conditions, exert
no appreciable action on one another, that, therefore, the condi
tion of the gas has undergone no change—that, in short, air                  is
                                                                             a
mixture and not combination of nitrogen and oxygen.
                  a
    It must be observed that recourse has always been had suc
cessively to the physical properties of air to solve so important
a  question.    Biot went so far even as to adduce the equality
between the refractive indices of air and of the mean of the in
dices of oxygen and of nitrogen as       a   proof in favour of the opi
nion now generally admitted.       If,    in fact, there had been found
in constant manner measurable physical property, different in
    a                  a
air and in mixture of oxygen and nitrogen, the conclusion would
           a
have been immediately drawn that air was            combination. There
                                                        a

 368       M. H. Saints-Claire Deville        on A<U+FB01>nity     and Heat.
 would have been a' change of condition, owing to the mixture of
 the two gases ,- and the beautiful veri<U+FB01>cation of Lavoisier would
 have been invalidated in an irrefutable manner.               The argument
  drawn from the proportions of the two gases, oxygen and nitro
 gen, which are not in atomic proportion in the air, is without
 value.    One of the two elements might simply have been in ex
 cess over a combination of the two others.               There would have
 been mixture and combination, and therefore change of‘state for
 one portion of the air alone, which is not the case.
     Combination being thus characterized by change of state, and
  therefore well de<U+FB01>ned ; what is the particular form of com
 bination which merits more especially the name of solution ? I
'say especially; for it would be impossible to say now whether
 water and sulphuric acid, acetic acid, chloride of calcium, and
 many other bodies are combined with or merely dissolved in one
 another.      But there is a fundamental difference between the
 ejects produced when potash is thrown into sulphuric acid, and
 the effects observed when common salt is placed in water.
     In both cases the change of state is manifest; but when
 sulphate of potash has been obtained after the combination of sul
 phuric acid and of potash, new chemical properties have become
 strikingly evident.       It is in fact by these chemical properties
 that change of state is most clearly manifested at the time of
 energetic combination.         In the second place, when the solution
 of common salt in water is effected, the chemical properties of
 the elements in presence remain virtually unchanged.                   First a
 true fusion of the salt is noticed, which assumes the liquid state—
 a change of physical condition accompanied most frequently by
 an absorption and disappearance of heat,—theu variation in the
 density, or phenomena of contraction*, alteration in the volume
 of the elements, which, again, is a change of physical properties
 which essentially characterizes true solution.
    Yet an exclusive value must not be given to these differences,
 in the chemical properties to designate a combination, in the phy
 sical properties to designate a solution. We all know, from the
 beautiful experiments of Henry Rose, that very weak solutions
 of the alkaline carbonates of borax have reactions differing essen
 tially from those which their concentrated solutions present. This
 remark is suf<U+FB01>cient once more to show that the phenomena due
 to changes of state cannot be ranged in two distinct-categories,
 combination and solution. I shall recur to this once more, in refer
 ence to diffusion, or the inde<U+FB01>nite extension of matter in menstrua.
    What    I have said enables me to use the two words, combina
 tion  and   solution,  in a perfectly de<U+FB01>nite sense, without the risk
 of considering them to express an unknown cause, and cha
   * Contraction  is here a generic term; if it be negative, it is an expansion.

racterizing them simply by the effects which are manifested in
our daily chemical operations.       I hope, therefore, to be logical
in the following reasonings.
     When two gases are mixed which spread uniformly into one
another, can the phenomenon of what is called their di<U+FB01>'usion be
compared to the solution of two liquids in one another?          I do
not think so.
     §uppose we place together bisulphide of carbon and white
phosphorus at a temperature convenient for the melting of the
phosphorus, oil and sulphuric ether, chloride of calcium dissolved,
acetic acid and water; we might obtain very decided changes of
physical condition, characterized principally by an elevation or
 depression    of temperature, and by a change of density: in a
 word, the physical properties of 1 these solutions might vary
without the chemical properties being sensibly modi<U+FB01>ed.
     Is this the same with gases? Experiment shows us, <U+FB01>rst of
all, that gases frequently combine without apparent absorption
 or disengagement of heat (oxide of carbon and chlorine, chlorine
 and hydrogen in di<U+FB02>‘used light). .But whenever this disengage
 ment of heat can be con<U+FB01>rmed, the chemical properties have
 been profoundly changed.         Moreover Gay-Lussac’s law proves
 that gases which contract in combining do not change in volume
 in the same way as liquids which dissolve.      The volume of the
 combination is always a simple fraction, and often a very small
'one, of the volume of the elements of this combination.        Thus
 contraction, when it exists, not merely characterizes the combi
 nation of the gases, but allows the composition to be deduced
therefrom.
     Nothing of the same kind can be remarked in the solution of
 liquids, where the contractions follow no simple law, and do not
 enable us to foresee any change in the chemical properties of the
 elements which interpenetrate by solution; further, the ther
 mal phenomena which may be manifested at the moment in
which the liquids interpenetrate do not necessarily imply change
of their chemical properties.                            -
     Observing that the physical and chemical properties of bodies
  cannot be'separated in a more absolute manner than can the
  phenomena of combination and of solution, we conclude, <U+FB01>rst,
-that the diffusion of gases is essentially different from the solu
  tion of liquids, and therefore that whenever, from the mixture
  of two gases, there results a calori<U+FB01>c phenomenon, there is change
  of condition, and therefore combination.
      The phenomena observed on the contact of liquids and solids
  which mutually dissolve each other are far more complex, and
'deserve a special analysis.
      In attacking this  question  experimentally a large number of

   the physical properties of bodies must be known, and therefore
   be determined whenever they are unknown.                 Hence all the
   complications which would be a source of trouble in calculating
   the effects observed (for instance, the latent heat of the fusion
   of solids) must be removed at the outset in this investigation.
    Hence my researches have hitherto been limited to the determi
   nation of the calori<U+FB01>c phenomena manifested on the contact of
   liquids which combine or dissolve and produce a liquid.
      In general, two bodies which dissolve, contract.         I shall begin
   by  de<U+FB01>ning   what   I  call heat  of  contraction,  either in the parti
   cular case of liquids or in the general case.
      Supp0se we take a body whose weight is unity: knowing the
   law of its expansion as a function of the temperature, we can
   calculate the temperature at which this body would lose a given
   fraction of its volume; and knowing the speci<U+FB01>c heat of this
   body within the limits of experiment, we can calculate the heat
   of contraction corresponding to this diminution of volume.
   Hence we can obtain the quantity of heat necessary for a given
   variation of the density. That will be the heat of contraction.
      Suppose we take water and sulphuric acid at 0° superposed
   in a spherical <U+FB02>ask provided with a perfectly cylindrical narrow
   neck ; suppose that the two surfaces of contact are separated by
, an obstacle easy to break, such, for instance, as a spider’s web;
   and suppose, further, that the vessel is athermanous, and can
   neither. be heated nor cooled—in other words, that its speci<U+FB01>c
   heat is zero.
      The level of the upper of the two liquids being at A, they are
   mixed in an in<U+FB01>nitely short time, and in a complete manner.
   Heat at once manifests itself, and assumes a maximum value,
   which is indicated by a thermometer (whose weight can be neg
  lected) placed in the interior of the liquid; this temperature
  will be t degrees.
      At the same moment, the temperature being supposed to be
  equal and invariable, the liquid will sink in the narrow neck to
  the level B.      Finally, cooling the acid to its original tempera
  ture of 0°, its volume will again diminish until the surface is
  level with the point C.          The volume of the cylindrical space
  AC divided by the original volume of the elements (water and
  acid), which    I shall call V, will represent the contraction.      Call

of variations might be determined by observing the velocity of cooling of

replacing the compression of gases by the compression of liquids; the me-_

heat of contraction, which is very great, and then some sensible
heat taken from itself and from the adjacent bodies. MM. Bussy
and Buignet have recently observed the same fact and others of
the same kind, especially in the mixture of hydrocyauic acid and
water.
    It is very probable that the preceding considerations would
apply to solid bodies, if we knew their latent heat of fusion, to
calculate formulae which give the heat of contraction.
    When a solid dissolves in water, it <U+FB01>rst absorbs the quantity
of heat necessary to melt       it, then     certain quantity of heat
                                               a
which increases with the proportion of the solvent, and which
corresponds to the extension of the body dissolved in its men
struum.      These facts, which are of great importance, were deter
mined in the most rigorous manner              by
                                             M. Person, and deduced
from observations made more especially on nitrate of potash.
To these thermal units, expended in the work of solution, must
be added the heat of contraction absorbed and determined           bythe
methods I     have described.
    Thus the more       soluble substance       diffused in its solvent,

                                                    is
and extension.      Thus, thoughI    use an expression paradoxical in
form, it   may be af<U+FB01>rmed that every body which cools while               it
undergoes molecular modi<U+FB01>cation,          is
                                           really heated,     by
                                                              borrowing
heat from the adjacent bodies, and from itself <U+FB01>rst of all.          The
latent heat which    it  possessesis increased to the extent of all the
heat which. has disappeared either             by
                                              the fact of spontaneous
 cooling or    by diminution of the heat of contraction.        It  is,in
 fact, so much heat lost, and therefore changed into motion of
 the molecules, or,  if  we like, into a<U+FB01>'inity,      we thus designate
                                                         if
 the force which produces this motion.
     All this heat, lost apparently, will reappear completely when
 the solution  is made to undergo the phenomenon          the inverse of
 extension, that    is to say, concentration.       Hence, in the cycle
 comprehending the solution of        asalt at the ordinary tempera;
 ture and its crystallization   by  spontaneous evaporation      (suppo
 sing the salt to be anhydrous like nitrate of potash), all the quan
 tities of heat borrowed from without, and from the contraction
 during the period of solution and of extension, will reappear and
 be given out during concentration and crystallization.         Hence     it
 might be said that these solutions contain (and that will only
 be true potentially) all the heat which water and the salt have
 absorbed during the development of the phenomenon.
     Thus  a  body which cools spontaneously does really become
 heated by all the latent heatlwhich its molecules <U+FB01>x; and         itmay

         I
  374       M. H. Sainte-Claire Deville    on A<U+FB01>inity and Heat.
  be conceived   that in an almost inde<U+FB01>nite state of extension it
  might even be decomposed by the heat which it has absorbed at
   each addition of the solvent.   In this manner is to be explained
   the decomposition by di<U+FB01>'usion produced by Mr. Graham, and
   which servesas the basis of his admirable method of dialysis.
      If you put bisulphate of potash in the internal diffusion-ves
   sel (two cylindrical concentric vessels, Graham’s <U+FB01>rst apparatus),
  you know that the illustrious physicist shows you sulphuric acid
  separating from neutral sulphate of potash and passing into the
  external vessel.
      There we have a true decomposition which is necessarily ac
  companied by the absorption of a certain quantity of heat.
  Let us inquire to what it is due. If we add sulphuric acid to
  sulphate of potash, both in dilute solution, the liquid will become
  heated; but the quantity of heat thus produced will always be
  less than the heat of contraction calculatedin the manner     I have
  shown. In fact there will be a transformation of the heat which
  should have become sensible during the contraction, into latent
  heat; and when this has become coniderable enough, decompo
                                                i
  sition by diffusion will take place.                             .
   . In order that the inverse of the original effect may take place,
  the combination which is destroyed must take up the quantity
  of heat which became sensible at the time it was effected.      It is
 the latent heat stored up during solution which furnishes it ; but
 it is inadequate for completely producing this effect, and thus
  the phenomenon is only partial, as Mr. Graham has well observed.
     The phenomena of decomposition by di<U+FB02>'usion take place there
 fore in a continuous manner, like the decomposition of gases by
 heat, and all that   I am about to say respecting dissociation and
 its tension (which might here be replaced by the ratios of
 weights) is absolutely applicable to them.
     Whether diffusion takes place in two concentric vessels as       I
 have supposed, or in Graham’s new membrane apparatus, the
 process is the same.
     Suppose that a body with little stability, such as hydrochlo
rate of alumina, a body which is reduced to its elements by the
least heat, be introduced into the dialyzer, above the membrane
or parchment-paper which serves as a <U+FB01>lter with very close meshes.
Below this <U+FB01>lter_is water, which    I  assume to be constantly pure.
     The hydrochlorate of alumina absorbs the more heat the
greater the. quantity of water in which it is dissolved, so that
at a given moment it may be supposed to contain so much heat
that if this heat became sensible and were applied to its elements
they would. at once separate.     At this moment hydrochloric acid
becomes free, and hydrated alumina separates in particles ex
tremely divided, which occupy all the liquid in which the sepa

                                                                 4
       M. H. Sainte-Claire Deville     on A<U+FB01>m'ty   and Heat.         3’75
ration is effected.    Hence it ought to have all the properties of a
dissolved substance.     It will soon be seen that these properties
are only apparent.
   That is what takes place in the dialyzer ; moreover the hydro
chloric acid passes through the <U+FB01>lter, and alumina remains on the
surface in the state of apparent solution—or in the colloidal state,
to use the expression which Mr. Graham has adopted. . Yet in
practice this reaction does not take place exactly in this manner.
   We may suppose the permeable membrane divided into two
horizontal layers,—one the higher layer, where the hydrochlorate
of alumina penetrates (this has little thickness), the other the
lower layer, where water alone penetrates.       It is clear that in an
apparatus of this kind the solution of hydrochlorate of alumina
will very soon <U+FB01>nd a layer near the surface where the water, which
is renewed with rapidity, will be in considerable proportion as
compared with hydrochlorate.        In this layer the decomposition
of the salt will then take place by inde<U+FB01>nite di<U+FB02>'usion (conse
quently by the effect of heat), the hydrated alumina will remain
in the state of colloidal particles on the upper surface, and the hy
drochloric acid will be carried away by the water.       The colloidal
layer thus produced will itself become a true <U+FB01>lter, and the phe
nomena of decomposition may go on in its interior.                 ,
   Yet decomposition by diffusion cannot be complete ; for it varies
with the ratio of the quantity of water put in contact with hy
drochlorate of alumina, and with the quantity of hydrochloric acid
which this water contains.         In other words, the quantity of
water separated by diffusion will be the smaller the more this
water is charged with hydrochloric acid (this acid arising from a
portion of hydrochlorate already decomposed). Everything takes
place as if the heat necessary for entirely decomposing hydrochlo
rate of alumina could never be entirely equal to that which exten
sion furnishes to its molecules,within the limits of our experiments.
   Thus the phenomenon of dialysis is never complete ; a little
hydrochlorate of alumina always passes through the membrane,
and the colloids cannot be separated in an absolute manner by
means of diffusion.
   This principle has numerous applications._ If we admit gene
rally that all solutions are cooled on being diluted, as is shown
by a great number of experiments—if, moreover, we assume, as
my experiments seem to show, that in every change of state ac
companying solution there is a loss of vis viva, and hence a con
centration of latent. heat in the ubstances dissolved, and in their
menstrua, we can understand a great number of phenomena the
explanation of which escapes us, and bring them within the class
of known phenomena.
   Thus the sap of tre_es.is, so to say, pure water at the moment

it begins  to move, and contributes to the increase of the plant.
It  is a solution so diluted with carbonic acid and organic or
mineral substances drawn from the seed or from the soil, that
its molecules may be considered absolutely free, or separated
by the latent heat which is there accumulated.   When this solu
tion reaches the parenchyma of the leaves, where both its con
centration and its alteration on contact with the elements of the
air take place, it may      be said that    all molecular equilibria are
successively   possible ;   and   if circulation   raises them to concen
tration or to combination at       a given moment,       all the elements of
carbonic acid, of water, and of the mineral principles which the
sap contains may group themselves according to a formula de~
termined previously by the rapidity of the circulation, the nature
of the leaves, and the physical circumstances necessary for the
life of the plant. In this manner we can probably account for
the diversity which the act of vegetation imprints on the nature
of the products it forms with the elements of water, of carbonic
acid, of ammonia, and of some minerals.        >
    It is also in the heat stored up by solution that we must seek
the principal element of the decomposition by vegetables of car
bonic acid into carbon and oxygen—a phenomenon regarding
which we must confess our total ignorance.
    A most remarkable experiment which M. Berthelot has made,
by placing together carbonic oxide, water, and potash, belongs to
actions of this kind.
    Carbonic oxide dissolves in potash, and absorbs during its
extension* in the liquid a certain number of thermal units
beyond that which the loss of vis viva by contraction doubtless
allows it to retain at the moment of its liquefaction. This solu
tion, which takes place in very small quantity at a time, owing
to the slight solubility of the gas, is really a considerable exten
sion, which, thanks to dissociation by diffusion, gives to the mole
cules of carbonic oxide the heat necessary for entering into direct
combination with the elements of potash.         In this reaction            (it
is  moreover effected with the slowness which characterizes all
operations where solution         necessary when the solubility
                                  is                                         is

       Combination is almost always produced by the destruction of
    motion, sometimes by the transformation of heat into motion.
    In the <U+FB01>rst case there is a disengagement of heat, in the second
    a cooling or absorption of heat.        In the second category are to
    be included all'those bodies whichI have proposed to call explo
    sive, that     which render into sensible heat the motion they
                   is,
    have acquired in absorbing latent heat.          Formic acid,      greata
    number of organic compounds, as well as the explosive com
    pounds of nitrogen, are in the latter category; and these are
    rarely produced      bythe direct union of the elements, but are ob
    tained    bythe interchange of their elements in the body of more
    or less dilute solutions.
                                It    isassumed that then the molecules
    are in contact in the nascent state.         Here we must be on our
'   guard ;   this term still includes the idea of an occult cause.        It
    must be employed with extreme reserve; and                    bymust be

    may change     their  state of  equilibrium    on <U+FB01>nding about them
    latent heat or, in general, the causes of motion necessary for
    producing and exciting this change of state.          The origin of the
    expression which renders this idea implies an hypothesis which
    may give rise to     vicious circle in the minds 0f young ChemiStS,

    heat, arising either from gain         bycontraction, or by cooling by
    expansion.     Hence   most of the combinations which are due to the
    nascent state ought to take place in solutions—espeCiany those
    which take place under cooling—those which give eprOSive sub
    stances*.

    With each other.        In the latter case the heat of contraction
    has almost always been suf<U+FB01>cient, and more than suf<U+FB01>cient, to ac—
    count for all. As to gases, this heat of contraction, which may
    be
         calculated by formulae given above,           always very small as

    indeed, be zero, as in the case of hydrogen and chlorine, and,
    indeed, whenever gases combine in equal volumes, and hence
    without condensation. Therefore we must admit that gases con
    tain‘of themselves, and in the latent state, the principle of motion
    or of heat which     is manifested at the moment of combination.

     378     Mr. C. Brooke    on the Dynamical Theory      of Electricity.
     Lavoisier considered oxygen to be composed of a certain unknown
     radical and of this principle, which he materialized under the
     name caloric.      This point of view I shall develope in a follow
     ing chapter.
        In direct combinations the motion is destroyed and converted
     into heat: just as a <U+FB01>nite velocity can only be imparted to a
     body in a <U+FB01>nite time, so combination will always require for its
     production a greater or less time, but always a de<U+FB01>nite one.
        As the phenomena of indirect combination (or that produced
     by the nascent state) require (1) a solution, (2) an absorption of
    heat or a cooling, the time necessary for their development will
    be greater (1) as the solubility of the substances acting in the
     inenstrua is smaller, (2) as the absorption of heat is greater.
      - The action of time need not be
                                            mysterious ; we must always
    either explain it simply, or wait for facts to account for it.

                DEAR.
         HAVE      lately been led, in relation to a new edition of my

           ‘Elements of Natural Philosophy now in the press, to re
    consider the whole question of electricity, and I have become
    strongly impressed with the reality of the dynamical theory.            I
    have hence naturally been induced to look about for con<U+FB01>rmatory
    facts ; and a strong, and (to the best of my knowledge and belief)
    a new fact has presented itself to me.        It has long been known
    that if a bar of antimony and one of bismuth be connected, and
    a current be transmitted from antimony to bismuth, heat will be
    developed at the point of junction; and, on the contrary, if the
    current pass from bismuth to antimony, cold will be produced.
    Now it struck me that if in the former, as in all other cases in
    which heat is developed in the passage of a current, a portion of
    electric potential is (as I believe) converted into thermic potential,
    or heat, there ought in the latter case to be an inductive conversion
    of thermic into electric potential ; and if so, there shduld be a loss
    of current in the <U+FB01>rst instance, and a gain in the second: and
    such appears to be the fact.        On duly balancing the thermo
    element    above   mentioned  in  a Wheatstone’s bridge, the de<U+FB02>ec
    tion of the needle followed the direction of the current, and the
    anticipated loss or gain of current was fully realized. If you can

bonic acid was simultaneouslypassed through the solution. It was
dissolved in sulphuric acid, and then precipitated by ammonia.
The amount of oxide of indium obtained was about 0'1 per cent.
   Marignac gives an abstract* of recent researches on the com
pounds of tantalum. Former researches had led him to attribute
to niobic acid the formula Nb’z 951', and had taught him that
this acid and tantalic acid were constantly associated in the mi
neral kingdom, and that they replaced each other without change
of crystalline forms ; he accordingly undertook the investigation
of the principal compounds of tantalum, to establish for this metal
the existence of a modi<U+FB01>cation analogous to that proposed for
niobium.
   The <U+FB01>rst object was to redetermine the atomic weight of the
metal.    Analyses of chloride of tantalum executed by H. Rose
led to the number 172 (H=1, 9:16) for this atomic weight;
but probably these analyses, made on a product doubtless con
taining chloride of niobium (for the presence of niobic acid in
tantalates was at that time unknown), had given too small a
number.      The numerous analyses Which he had made of the
<U+FB01>uotantalates of potash and ammonia led him in fact to raise the
number to 182.
 _ These new determinations of the atomic weights of niobium and
of tantalum, compared with those of the two metals which have
the greatest analogy to each other (that           is,
                                            tungsten and molyb
denum), furnish new and remarkable example of the parallelism
                 a
which M. Dumas has noted between various series of simple sub
stances forming natural groups.     We have in fact, from his de

   The new composition     admitted  for  tantalic  acid  leads to very
simple  formulae for two  bodies which   appeared previously to have
Very complex compositions.        The    brown    oxide of tantalum,

Ta 8’.
   Tantalic acid appears capable of forming two distinct modi<U+FB01>
cations, analogous to those which Frémy’s beautiful researches
on stannic and antimonic acids have made us acquainted with.
In fact the best-de<U+FB01>ned salts of this acid belong to two series

      The second series comprises the perfectly crystallized tanta
  lates of potash obtained by melting tantalic acid with these
  caustic alkalies, or with their carbonates, in excess at a very high
  temperature.      They are represented by the formulae
          4K2 9,  3Ta‘2 95, 16 HQ 9  and 4Na2    9, 2Ta52 95, 24H2  9.
  The <U+FB01>rst    gives beautiful crystals, isomorphous with those of the
  ;
  corresponding niobate of potash.
       These two salts had been obtained by H. Rose; and the results
  which he had obtained by analysis agree better with the formulae
  which Marignac attributes to them than with those which he fan
   cied himself obliged to adopt.
       Fluoride of tantalum forms, with basic <U+FB02>uorides, <U+FB02>uosalts
   nearly all of which have the ratio 5 : 2 between the proportions of
   the <U+FB02>uorine of the two elements.         The constancy of this ratio
   leaves no doubt as to the necessity of attributing to this <U+FB02>uoride
   the formula Ta F5.
       Except the <U+FB02>uotantalates of potash, of soda, and of ammonia,
   the other salts of this kind which were prepared are so soluble
   and even deliquescent that their crystalline form could not be         _
   determined.
       The general analogy which exists between the compounds of
   niobium and those of tantalum ceases to be exhibited by their
   <U+FB02>uorides; for there do not appear to be any oxy<U+FB02>uotantalates.
   The correlation between these two groups of <U+FB02>uorized compounds
   is only established on a single point, by the existence of a <U+FB02>uo
   niobate of potash isomorphous with the <U+FB02>uotantalate.
       The principal characteristic by which ordinary phosphorus is
    distinguished from red phosphorus is its property of crystallizin g ,
   yet it is by no means easily crystallized, although it possesses the
   triple property of being fusible, soluble, and volatile.     Blondlot,
   having tried all the ordinary methods, had. recourse to that of
   sublimation*, which he describes as follows.
       The neck of a <U+FB02>ask was drawn out, at about an inch from the
   shoulder, to the thickness of a quill pen ; and phosphorus

384                   M. Lamy              on Tkallium-ylass.
was melted under       water in tubes of this dimension,~ and two
grammes     introduced in small fragments which were previously
dried.    That being done, the <U+FB02>ask being held in a wet cloth,
the neck was rapidly drawn out and sealed ; this could be done'
without the phosphorus taking <U+FB01>re provided the <U+FB02>ask was held
vertically.    The phosphorus was at <U+FB01>rst surrounded by whitish
vapours, and shone in darkness; the interior then became clear,
and the phosphorescence disappeared.          In twenty-four hours all
the oxygen was absorbed, and the phosphorus could then be
melted, which was done in a water-bath heated by means of a
small lamp. The <U+FB02>ask was kept always in the same position, <U+FB02>oat
ing on water, the neck uppermost, by its being placed in a hole
in the centre of a cork. Finally, to avoid the action of light,
the whole was surrounded by a cone of cardboard.
   After the lapse of a few hours, in the upper part of the <U+FB02>ask,
and even into the neck, small brilliant points are observed, which
slowly increase and in two or three days are changed into a mag
ni<U+FB01>cent crystalline arborization which covers all the surface, and
shines with all kinds of reflection and a lustre like that of the
diamond. The crystals evidently belong to the cubical system.
Many small crystals appeared to be regular cubes, and octahedra
could also be observed. Independently of crystals applied against
the sides, sometimes long salient needles having the aspect of
fern leaves were observed.
   In these experiments, if the phosphorus is suitably preserved
from light it is of a beautiful white ; but the moment it is struck,
not merely by the solar rays, but even by di<U+FB02>'used light, it passes
in a few minutes into a garnet-red. In this new condition it
retains its crystalline form, transparence, and its lustre; the
crystals might be said to be small rubies.        The crystalline form
is then so little altered that, if the apparatus is replaced in the
water-bath, new and perfectly white crystals are deposited on the

    The various specimens prepared were obtained by takingierdi
nary <U+FB02>int-glass as the type,-and successively replacing minium
0r carbonate of potash by carbonate of thallium in equivalent
quantities.     One specimen was made from sand, 300, pure car
bonate of thallium, 400. and carbonate of potash, 100.
    The glass resulting from this mixture readily fuses and re<U+FB01>nes,
but the cooled mass is not homogeneous.             The layers which oc
cupy the upper part of the crucible have a less-pronounced yel
lowish colour, and a lower density, than the inferior layers, which
are moreover richer in thallium.
    Another specimen was obtained with the proportions :-—-sand,
300; minium, 200; pure carbonate of thallium, 335.
    This mixture melts and is re<U+FB01>ned more easily than the prece
ding; the mass is perfectly homogeneous, but presents a yellow
ish tint, which, however, is agreeable and very brilliant.               The
density 4-235, and refractive index 1'71 (for the yellow ray), are
greater than the corresponding elements of all known glasses.
By varying the proportions in the mixture, Lamy obtained glasses
'whose densities varied from 4'235 to 5'625, and refractive in

    Lamy concludes, from the results of his experiments, (1) that
thallium replaces potassium better than lead in the composition
of glass, which is a new proof of the rank assigned to the new
metal in the classi<U+FB01>cation ; (2) that thallium gives to glass a yel
lowish, as sodium does a greenish colour; (3) that thallium-glass
is denser and more refringent than potassium-glass; (4) that
these properties of thallium-glass may doubtless be advanta-                 ‘‘

   4. That the phosphorescence is only the result of the decom-.
position of the colouring-matter, and does not belong to <U+FB02>uor
spar itself.
   It is commonly assumed that only distilled water attacks lead,
but that saline water is without action.               According to Stahl
mann*,    if such   a   water  contains    000001     to 00018 per cent. of
NH4 0, it attacks the lead, becomes active. With a percentage
of 00031 NH4 O and above, the water is again indifferent, and
no longer attacks the lead.           If active water is boiled for an hour
and a half, the attack on the metal is considerably weaker.                 If
it is boiled with carbonate of baryta, it is all but indifferent.
An addition of 0006 per cent. of nitric acid, and less, makes the
water active, any excess beyond that indifferent.                Active water,
neutralized with small quantities of ammonia and nitric acid, re
gained its former properties.
   The attack of active water on lead is connected with the access
of atmospheric air.         Also in the presence of free carbonic acid
access of air is a hindrance to corrosion ; on the other hand, the
contact of water with air appears to be insuf<U+FB01>cient if the air is
free from carbonic acid.         If a lead plate be placed in active water,
the corrosion of the plate starts preferably from the place where
the lead touches the bottom of the <U+FB02>ask. When the lead was
suspended in active water, it remained unattacked for a week.
The precipitate was a hydrated carbonate of lead, the composition
of which varied.
   In  the preparation of oxygen gas by the method of Fleitmann,

According to Stolbei, the tedious preparation of a clear solution
may, however, be avoided by adding to a thick magma of the
powder a few small pieces of parat<U+FB01>ne.                 This melts on being
heated, and covers the paste with a layer which prevents any
frothing or rushing over.            Instead of the peroxide of cobalt,
the author states that a small quantity of a solution of nitrate or
chloride of copper may be used, which, according to Bo'ttger,
acts just like the salts of cobalt.             The disengagement of gas
under these circumstances takes place very steadily and regularly.

   Gaseous hypochlorous acid was passed into subchloride of sul
phur holding sulphur in solution, and the operation interrupted
when the whole of the latter had disappeared.      The chloride of
thionyle, which boils at 78°, could be separated by fractional
distillation from the subchloride of sulphur, which boils at
139° C.                                                ~

that a decomposition   of the bodies takes place; and Deville has
endeavoured to effect this decomposition in a visible manner*.
If pentachloride of phosphorus is heated in a closed tube in the
oil-bath, and is thereby decomposed into PCl3 and Cl“, the green
colour of the gas must become visible. In order to show this,
Deville <U+FB01>lled two perfectly equal glass tubes, one with a mixture
of equal volumes of chlorine and air, and the other with some
pentachloride of phosphorus.      Both were heated in the oil-bath ;
the tubes only projected to a small extent from the bath, so that
a layer of gas 3 to 4 decimetres in thickness could be perceived.
From a certain range of temperature onwards, the tube with the
PCP is seen to be continually greener until it exhibits the same
colour as the tube containing air and chlorine ; but as long as
the perchloride remains colourless, no decomposition takes place.
Only then does dissociation occur; and from the known vapour
densities the tension of dissociation can be calculated.
    A similar deportment is exhibited by the vapour of iodide of
mercury.    If this body be heated in a <U+FB02>ask or retort above its
melting-point, at a certain stage violet vapours are observed on
the sides of the <U+FB02>ask, which disappear in the interior of the ves

 phenomenon     is at the same time an instructive lecture expe
 riment.
     The above observations of Deville led Cahours* to undertake
 new determinations of the vapour-density of PCls.        This body
 boils between 160° and 165°; and the density observed at 170°
 to 172°, though considerably greater than that at 182° to 185°T,
 'was considerably   below that calculated for a condensation   to 4
 volumes.    The author could not observe a decomposition         of
 pentachloride vapour     at this temperature.    Hence  he assumes
 that the normal vapour of P015 occupies 8 volumes, correspond
 ing to a union of PC13 and Cl2 without condensation.
    The vapour-density of acetic acid, determined at 350°, corre
  sponded   exactly to 4 volumes ; but at 440° a considerably
 smaller number was obtained.        It was found, however, that at
 this temperature a small quantity of marsh-gas and carbonic
 acid had been formed.        Hence the author assumes that only
 condensations    to 4 or 8 volumes occur.     In the cases of appa
 rent condensation to 3 or 6 volumes, it is only necessary to make
 the determination at a higher or lower temperature to obtain at
 once an alteration in the numbers.
    Devillei adduces a surprising instance of an abnormal vapour
 density. The double salt NH4I, 2HgI has, according to his
 and Troost’s experiments, at 350° the vapour-density 6'49, and
 at 440° 688, corresponding to a condensation         to 8 volumes.
 Assuming in the experiment a dissociation into NH’lI and HgI,
 a condensation to 12 volumes should result.

quantities of chloride of calcium be added, with an increasing
percentage      of lime in the solution the proportion of lime in the
precipitates also increases.      And conversely, when the lime and
the phosphoric acids are kept constant and the magnesia is in
creased, the percentage of magnesia in the precipitate increases.
     As regards changes in the composition of the precipitate,
Chizinski arrived at results differing from those which Debus
obtained from his experiments on the af<U+FB01>nity of carbonic acid
for lime and baryta.        Debus concluded that these changes took
place by starts; Chizinski that they took place gradually and
steadily.      The quantity of any of the bases present in the pre
cipitates increases if this is increased in the solution, but not,
as Berthollet taught, proportionally to this increase.       The com
position of the precipitate varies in a rather complex manner with
the composition of the solution.
     If in the solution there are equivalent quantities of calcium
 and magnesium, more lime than magnesia is precipitated.         Hence
it may be assumed that, cateris paribus, lime has a greater af<U+FB01>

 quantities    of  both  bases in  solution, according as the mass of
both as compared with the phosphoric acid is greater or smaller,
 the composition of the precipitate varies. If the solution for one
 molecule of phosphoric acid (H3 P94=98) only contains one mo
 lecule of each base (that       GaClQ= 11092 and Mg 012:94'92),
                               is,

 lent = half an atom of biatomic elements).            Hence the preci
 pitate must contain some ammoniacal phosphate of magnesium.
 If the quantity of bases in the solution increased, the mag

 together more than        4 equivalents of base.    These precipitates
 are basic phosphates, analogous to VVagnerite and Apatite, ex
 cepting that they contain no chlorine or <U+FB02>uorine, but oxygen
 instead.

1‘HE    “ On the Dynamical Theory of Gases.” By           J. Clerk Max
well, F.R.S.L. & E.
    Gases in this theory are supposed to consist of molecules in motion,
acting on one another with forces which are insensible, except at
distances which are small in comparison with the average distance of
the molecules.      The path of each molecule is therefore sensibly
rectilinear, except when two molecules come within a certain distance
of each other, in which case the direction of motion is rapidly
changed, and the path becomes again sensibly rectilinear as soon
as the molecules have separated beyond the distance of mutual
action.
    Each molecule is supposed to be a small body consisting in general
of parts capable of being set into various kinds of motion relative
to each other, such as rotation, oscillation, or vibration, the amount
of energy existing in this form bearing a certain relation to that
which exists in the form of the agitation of the molecules among
each other.
   The mass of a molecule is different in different gases, but in the
same gas all the molecules are equal.
    The pressure of the gas is on this theory due to the impact of the
molecules on the sides of the vessel, and the temperature of the gas
depends on the velocity of the molecules.
    The theory as thus stated is that which has been conceived, with
various degrees of clearness, by D. Bernoulli, Le Sage and Pre
vost, Herapath, Joule, and Krtinig, and which owes its principal
 developments to Professor Clausius.      The action of the molecules on
 each other has been generally assimilated to that of hard elastic he
 dies; and 1 have given some application of thisform of the theory to
 the phenomena of viscosity, diffusion, and conduction of heat in the
 Philosophical   Magazine for 1860.      M. Clausius has since pointed
out several errors in the part relating to conduction of heat ; and the
part relating to diffusion also contains errors.   The dynamical theory

   Mr. J. C. Maxwell                 on the Dynamical Theory      of   Gases.        391
of viscosity in this form has been reinvestigated by M. O. E. Meyer,
whose experimental researches on the viscosity of <U+FB02>uids have been
                                               ~
very extensive.
    In the present paper the action between the molecules is supposed
to be that of bodies repelling each other at a distance, rather than
of hard elastic bodies acting by impact; and the law of force is de
duced, from experiments on the viscosity of gases, to be that of the
inverse <U+FB01>fth power of the distance, any other law of force being at
variance with the observed fact that the viscosity is proportional to
the absolute temperature.        In the mathematical application of the
theory, it appears that the assumption of this law of force leads to a
great simpli<U+FB01>cation of the results, so that the whole subject can be
treated in a more general way than has hitherto been done.
    I have therefore begun by considering, <U+FB01>rst, the mutual action of
two molecules,-=—next that of two systems of molecules, the motion
of all the molecules in each system being originally the same. In
this way I have determined the rate of variation of the mean values
of the following functions of the velocity of molecules of the <U+FB01>rst sys
tem :—

   [3,  the square of this resolved velocity.
    7, the resolved velocity multiplied          by
                                               the square of the whole velo
city. It afterwards shown that the velocity of translation of the gas
              is
depends on as, the pressure on         and the conduction of heat on y.
                                           [3,
    The <U+FB01>nal distribution of velocities among the molecules             then    is
considered; and             shown that they are distributed according to
                           it   is
the same law as the errors are distributed among the observations
in the theory of “ Least Squares,” and that,            several systems of
                                                            if
molecules act on one another, the average vis viva of each molecule
isthe same, whatever be the mass of the molecule. The demonstra

     is is

the gas       then considered, and the following conclusions are arrived at.
             is
    (at) 1st. In     mixture of gases left to itself for
                       a                                     suf<U+FB01>cient time
                                                                  a
under the action of gravity, the density of each gas at any point will
be the same as        the other gases had not been present.
                       if
    2nd. When this condition          not ful<U+FB01>lled, the gases will pass
                                           is
through each other by diffusion.            When the composition of the
mixed gases varies slowly from one point to another, the velocity of
each gas will be so small that the effects due to inertia may be neg
lected.      In the quiet diffusion of two gases, the volume of either
 gas diffused through unit of area in unit of time             equal to the
                                                                       is
rate of diminution of pressure of that gas as we pass in the direction
 of the normal to the plane, multiplied by certain coef<U+FB01>cient, called
                                                        a
the coef<U+FB01>cient of interdiffusion of these two gases.        This coef<U+FB01>cient
must be determined experimentally for each pair of gases.           It varies
 directly as the square of the absolute temperature, and inversely as
the total pressure of the mixture.         Its value for carbonic acid and
air, as deduced from experiments given            Mr. Graham in his paper
                                                      by

392                             Royal  Society :—
 on the Mobility of Gases *, is
                                   D=O'0235,
 the inch, the grain, and the second being units.           Since, however,
 air is itself a mixture, this result cannot be considered <U+FB01>nal, and we
 have no experiments from which the coef<U+FB01>cient of interdi<U+FB01>'usion of
 two pure gases can be found.
    3rd. When two gases are separated by a thin plate containing a
small hole, the rate at which the composition of the mixture varies
in and near the hole will depend on the thickness of the plate and
the size of the hole.       As the thickness of the plate and the diameter
of the hole are diminished, the rate of variation will increase, and the
e<U+FB02>‘ect of the mutual action of the molecules of the gases in impeding
each other’s motion will diminish relatively to the moving force due
to the variation of pressure.        In the limit, when the dimensions of
the hole are inde<U+FB01>nitely small, the velocity of either gas will be the
same as if the other gas were absent.           Hence the volumes diffused
under equal pressures will be inversely as the square roots of the
speci<U+FB01>c gravities of the gases, as was <U+FB01>rst established by Graham'f;
and the quantity of a gas which passes through a thin plug into an_
other gas will be nearly the same as that which passes into avacuum
in the same time.
    ([3) By considering the variation of the total energy of motion of
the molecules, it is shown that,
    1st. In a mixture of two gases the mean energy of translation will
become the same for amoleculc of either gas.          From this follows the
law of Equivalent Volumes, discovered by Gay-Lussac from chemical
considerations——namely,         that equal volumes of two gases at equal
pressures and temperatures contain equal numbers of molecules.
    2nd. The law of cooling by expansion is determined.
    3rd. The speci<U+FB01>c heats at constant volume and at constant pressure
are determined and compared.             This is done merely to determine
the value of a constant in the dynamical theory for the agreement
between theory and experiment with respect to the values of the two
speci<U+FB01>c heats ; and their ratio is a consequence of the general theory
of thermodynamics, and does not depend on the mechanical theory
which we adopt.
    4th. In quiet diffusion the heat produced by the interpenetration
of the gases is exactly neutralized by the cooling of each gas as it
passes from a dense to a rare state in its progress through the mixture.
    5th. By considering the variation of the difference of pressures in
different directions, the eoe<U+FB02>ieient of viscosity or internal friction is
determined, and the equations of motion of the gas are formed.
These are of the same form as those obtained by Poisson by con
ceiving an elastic solid the strain on which is continually relaxed at
a rate proportional to the strain itself.
    As an illustration of this view of the theory, it is shown that any
strain existing in air at rest would diminish according to the values
of an exponential term the modulus of which is ,100,000-000  1
                                                                      second,

an excessively small time ; so that the equations are applicable even
to the case of the most acute audible sounds, without any modi<U+FB01>ca
tion on account of the rapid change of motion.
   This relaxation is due tothe mutual de<U+FB02>ection of the molecules
  from their paths.    It is then shown that if the displacements are
  instantaneous, so that no time is allowed for the relaxation, the gas
  would have an elasticity of form, or “ rigidity,” whose coef<U+FB01>cient is
  equal to the pressure.
     It is also shown that if the molecules were mere points, not having
- any mutual action, there would be no such relaxation, and that the
  equations of motion would be those of an elastic solid, in which the
  coef<U+FB01>cient of cubical and linear elasticity have the same ratio as that
  deduced by Poisson from the theory of molecules at rest acting by
  central forces on one another.    This coincidence of the results of two
  theories so opposite in their assumptions is remarkable.
     6th. The coef<U+FB01>cient of viscosity of a mixture of two gases is then
  deduced from the viscosity of the pure gases; and the coef<U+FB01>cient of
  interdi<U+FB02>'usion of the two gases.   The latter quantity has not as yet
  been ascertained for any pair of pure gases ; but it is shown that suf
  <U+FB01>ciently probable values may be assumed, which being inserted in
  the formula agree very well with some of the most remarkable of
  Mr. Graham’s experiments on the Transpiration of Mixed Gases*.
  The remarkable experimental result that the viscosity is independent
  of the pressure and proportional to the absolute temperature is a
  necessary consequence of the theory.
     (y) The rate of conduction of heat is next determined, and it is
   shown,
      1st. That the <U+FB01>nal state of a quantity of gas in a vessel will be
   such that the temperature will increase according to a certain law
  from the bottom to the top. The atmosphere, as we know, is colder
  above. This state would be produced by winds alone, and is no doubt
  greatly increased by the effects of radiation.   A perfectly calm and
   sunless atmosphere would be coldest below.
      2nd. The conductivity of a gas for heat is then deduced from its
  viscosity, and found to be

 portional to the absolute temperature.       Its value for air  is about
        of that of wrought iron as determined by Principal Forbes.

  THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES ON THERMO
       ELECTRICAL CURRENTS.  BY M. F. P. LE ROUX
     HE    investigation      I
                              have to submit to the judgment of the Aca
         demy is divided into nine parts.
     1. In the <U+FB01>rst   I investigate the conditions of a celebrated experi~
  ment by Becquerel relative to the production of a thermoelectric cur
 rent in a wire twisted in one place.               I
                                                then show that the condition
  necessary for the production of the current is the contact of two
 parts of the wire Whose temperatures are different—an opinion which
 indeed had been already expressed by M. Gaugain. The conclusion,
 then, to be drawn from the point of view of the possible cause of the
 disengagement of electricity by heat              that this cause would not

 both sides the heated point.                                                    7

 moelectric effects produced on the contact of two masses of the same
 nature and different temperatures.               point out
                                                    I           cause, not yet

 remarked, which evidently in<U+FB02>uences the disengagement of electri

                                            is

 tigate in this memoir, that two fragments of the same metal, one
 in the natural condition and the other stretched, present thermoelec
 trical effects when the temperature of their point of contact           raised.
                                                                               is
     3. In the third paragraph        give the results of experiments which
                                       I
I  have made on the thermoelectrical relations existing between two
 wires of different metals, one stretched and the other in the natural
 state.I     examined eight metals, Mr. W. Thomson three.                My re
 sults are in the opposite direction to his for two of the metals—iron
 and platinum.                                                         ’
     4. In the fourth paragraph           analyze
                                           I        the various   theories   pro
 posed to account for the effect of heat on the production of thermo_
.electrical currents;     I call to remembrance the important discovery
 made by Mr.W. Thomson, of the fact that when electricity traverses
a   conductor going from        hot to
                                  a        cold part,
                                            a           can, according to the
                                                              it
 nature of the conductor, disengage or absorb heat, and vice versd.
     5. The <U+FB01>fth paragraph commences by the establishment of spam
 graph formulated,    I  believe, for the <U+FB01>rst time :— When in dcircuit ab
 sorptions   or  disengagements    of heat are produced proportional to the
 simple power    of  the intensity      of
                                        the current, these effects correspond
proportionally to electromotioe forces promoted or overcome.
    This proposition opens new path for discovering the seat of elec
                                   a
tromotive forces and valuing their absolute intensity, while mea
 surementsof the intensity of currents only give us the algebraic
 sums of the various forces which may exist in           circuit. As regards
                                                               a
 thermoelectric currents,        must be concluded that the effects disco_
                                  it
 vered by Peltier and by Mr. W. Thomson point out the existence of
 electromotive forces and enable them to be measured.
    What  is   the part of each of these kinds of electromotive           forces
 (which shall speak of as Pelterian and Thomsonian)
        I                                                          This
                                                                      ?      exais

vby a current  of  the  same  intensity in a.sulphate-of-copper   element

can compare with the electromotive force of this element the elec
tromotive forces of the Pelterian kind which exist at the junction of
the copper with the metal after it.       I thus <U+FB01>nd that at a tempera

 I   then seek to know          for the couple copper-bismuth of M. E.
                               if,
Becquerel, the variation of this force between two temperatures, 25°
and 100°, can account for the electromotive force between the same
limits of temperature,         aforce which M. Becquerel estimated by
taking as unit sulphate-of-copper couple. With this view measure
                 a                                                              I
in an appropriate stove the Pelterian effects at the two temperatures
indicated;  I  <U+FB01>nd between the result predicted and that given by ex
periment   a slight difference.      But     not the less constant that in
                                                     it   is
this couple the electromotive forces of the Pelterian kind are much
predominant.

                                        is
 surement of the homsonian effect.
                   T
 I     have commenced by verifying that the Thomsonian effect was
proportional to the intensity of the current.
    The effect in question may be altered by several disturbing causes
—want of homogeneity, tempering, twisting, crystalline texture,
8w. These are effects of the Pelterian kind; they are proportional
to the intensity of the current, but they change the sign when, other
 things being equal, end for end the conductors are changed; hence
this gives a method of eliminating disturbing causes by two opera
tions made on the same conductors reversed.
    8. In the eighth paragraph      attempt to value the relative part of
                                             I
 the electromotive forces of the Pelterian and of the Thomsonian kind.
From the point of view of the direction,          found that in Becque
                                                               it   is
rel’s copper-bismuth couple and in the copper-iron couple(before inver
sion) these two kinds of electromotive force add on to one another.
    9. From what precedes, leaving aside the T homsonian effects,                                  it
 may be regarded as an experimental law that thermoelectric couples
 are proportional for all couples, between the same temperatures, to
 the electromotive forces which have their seat at the surfaces of junc
 tion.    In other words, the electromotive force    for each    function  is   a
 of the temperature; the ratio of <U+FB01>nite variation of the value of this

 function to the value of this function for determinate temperatures                                is
 the same for all couples, which requires that this function of the
 temperature be the same for all except for    very small factor.

   By placing     dark glass before the eyepiece, the eye

for the <U+FB01>rst few minutes against the intensity of the radiation; but
if  the observation be prolonged, and the object-glass has alarge

server being thus exposed to the direct action of the sun’s rays.
   Sometimes      has been attempted to remedy this inconvenience by
                       it
reducing the <U+FB01>eld of the object-glass by a diaphragm;             but this
method only injures the optical effect, and therefore will not bear
examination.

What must be avoided       we are to obtain from the use of large tele
                                if
scopes all they can teach us respecting the revolutions which take
place on the star.
   Having been led by my researches on the telescope to silver large                     a
number of glass mirrors,     have often had occasion to remark that
                                      1
the metallic layer whose lustre      so brilliant possesses at the same
                                                is
time     transparence and limpidity comparable to that of the most
          a
beautiful coloured glasses. The transparence         so great that, look
                                                                 is
ing at the sun' through the thin layer of silver, the least vapours
passing over its surface are seen distinctly and without the least
fatigue.      was naturally led to suppose that
                  1                                 silvered glass might
                                                                 a

replace coloured glasses, and that it would have over these latter the
great advantage of re<U+FB02>ecting all rays which do not pass through it.
Most certainly a glass plate silvered on one face and placed in the
body of the telescope in the path of the beam, would present a con
venient means of viewing the sun.
    But as this layer of silver might be regarded as a medium with
out thickness, I thought it would be better to silver the object-glass
itself, and to leave quite untouched the arrangement of the telescope.
                                     I
    I did not alter the eyepieces; left the micrometer in its place,
and con<U+FB01>ned myself to silvering the outside of the object-glass.        By
this means the instrument is protected against the ardour of the sun's
rays, which are almost entirely re<U+FB02>ected towards the heavens, while
 the small portion of bluish light which traverses the layer of metal is
 refracted in the ordinary manner, and forms in the focus a pure and.
calm image which may be observed without danger to the sight.
    The contour of the disk stands out distinctly on a dark sky, the
 spots are well de<U+FB01>ned, the faculae are distinctly seen as well as
 the decrease of light towards the edges, and the observer imme
 diately feels that he is provided with a powerful means of investi
 gation. The true tint of the sun is a little altered by the predomi
 nance of the blue rays; but the ratios of intensity are so well pre
 served that no detail is lost, and after a certain time the eye, accus
 tomed to this bluish colour, ceases to be conscious of it.
     It is true that a telescope thus prepared is an instrument sacri
 <U+FB01>ced, at all events for a time, to a-single object.    Perhaps it will be
 found that the object is worth the sacri<U+FB01>ce. At a time when the greatest
 questions are discussed regarding the physical constitution of the sun,
 when the newest and most ingenious lights tend to unveil the me
 chanism of such a prodigious effusion of heat and light, it will doubt
 less not be uninteresting to try an application on a large instrument.
     In reply to a question put by M. Chevreul as to whether in the
 case of gold-leaf blue light is transmitted through the substance of
 the gold, or simply passes through the numerous interstices of a
 plate reduced by mechanical means to so slight a thickness, M.
 Foucault said that in his opinion the blue coloration of light trans-      _
 .mitted through gold—leaf proves that this metal, like silver, can allow
 light to pass by a real transparence, but that this does not prevent
 the gold in this extreme degree of <U+FB01>neness from a<U+FB01>'ording numerous
  chinks invisible to the microscope, and which allow a certain quantity
  of direct light to pass.   Something of the same kind is met with in
 the case of silver deposited under certain conditions, although the
  microscope does not furnish a proof.       When the reagents are put
 together the proportions may be altered, and the layer ceases to pre
  sent its characteristic blue tint.  Everything leads to the belief that
  the layer of metal thus formed has not a perfect continuity ; for by
  rubbing the metallic surface with a skinits metallic lustre is increased,
  the quantity of transmitted light diminished, and the blue‘colour
  made to reappear.      Evidently under the pressure of the burnisher
  the silver is extended, the pores are closed, and the light can now
  only pass through the silver itself. What is here proved for gold
  and for silver would doubtless apply to all metals if they could be
  reduced into su<U+FB01>iciently <U+FB01>ne plates.~—Comptes Rendus, Sept. 3, 1866.

 ON THE PASSAGE OF              THERMAL AND LUM INOUS RAYS THROUGH
     INCLINED DIATHERMANOUS                    AND TRANSPARENT            PLATES.   BY
     H. KNOBLAUCH.                                                               .
    On the occasion of an investigation instituted by the author in the
year 1847 on the polarization of heat by simple refraction*, he had
 observed that solar rays traversed a number of parallel glass plates
 which originally were placed at right angles to them, the more copi
 ously the more they were inclined, which was the more surprising as
with an increasing thickness of the layer a diminished intensity
 would rather have been expected.
    This increase was still further increased if the thermal rays reach
ing the glass through a Nicol’s prism were polarized in such a man
ner that their plane of polarization was at right angles to the refrac
 tive indea- of the glass plates.            If, for instance, a Nicol placed in a
 window was horizontal, and hence the plane of polarization of the
rays passing through vertical—if,further',               the upright glass plates were
moveable about a vertical axis, the horizontally refracted thermal rays,
caught completely at each inclination of the glasses on a thermopile,
produced the following de<U+FB02>ections on a multiplierconnectedwith it :—

    Although these observations had not the object of ascertaining
those transmissions, and were not made in a series to be comparable
for the present case, they prove beyond doubt that, at all events
within wide limits,—
    I. The capacity of thermal rays of traversing parallel glass plates
increases with the angle which they form with the normal to the glass
plates.
    II. This capacity increases with the number of plates.
    If, owing to a rotation of a Nicol's prism through 90°, the plane
                                                                                     of

   These numbers, which also require a special revision, prove that
the passage of radiant heat under the present conditions is just the
opposite of the foregoing :—
   I. Decreases the more the angle of inclination increases.
   II. That this decrease is greater the greater the number of plates.
 _ In the year 1854 Professor        Schweigger* showed that an object
seen through several plates appears brighter if an acute position is
given to the plates, than if it is looked at through the smallest diameter.
In this manner the fact found for heat was shown for light.
   In making his experiment, Schweigger had been led by an obser
vation mentioned by Schiilen-I', according to which the image of a
telescope is made more distinct by placing the object-glass at an
acute angle ; this he proposed to strengthen by several glasses ac
cording to the principle of the electromagnetic multiplier, “ to form
from it a lecture experiment.”        Any further explanation or proof of
                                                                         '
a connexion with other optical processes is not met withI.
   To ascertain, if possible, such a connexion, and also to establish
the limits of the phenomenon as far as it overcomes the counteract
ing absorption of the irradiated substance, the author has since then
again taken up the subject.
   It has been established without any doubt that the maximmn in
tensity of thermal as well as lu/minous rags traversing colourless glass
pieces is attained at the polarizing angle—that        is,
                                                       at an inclination    of
about 55° to the normal     ; and from that point a rapid and increasing
diminution sets in.
   Thus with, twelve glasses, in the passage from 50° to 55° there
was an increase of the thermal action (which for measurements               is
far more certain than the optical estimation) from 1032 to 10-60—
that is, per cent. from 55° to 60°,
             3          ;                  diminution of 1060 to 925-?

plane    of
         refraction of the glass  piece, under  the  same angle of incli
nation, the de<U+FB01>ection of the galvanometer-needle increased from 9°
to 9°‘5—that is, per cent. with continued inclination
                    6           ;         a                   decreased

                                    8       Hence the increase in this
case    greater, the decrease smaller than in the previous case.

   When the original plane polarization and plane of refraction of

during the further inclination, although to        diminished extent.

neous absorption on account of the greater thickness, held one another
in check, so that the action of the rays was not perceptibly changed
until the angle of 55° was attained, upon which there was a sudden
 diminution of the transmission.        With a uniformly darker colouring
of the plates, the diminution in intensity might take place before
that angle was attained; yet the diminution then was never so
 sudden and considerable.
    A corresponding deportment was observed with other bodies.
 Gold, on account of its considerably larger angle of polarization, of
about 70°, was very characteristic.
    When there was no absorption, the thickness and number of plates
had no in<U+FB02>uence on the angle of 'inclination at which the transmis
sion attained its maximum, as this always occurred at the polarizing
angle of the substance in question.         Yet with absorbing layers it
depends on their thickness and the degree oftheir absorption, whether,
and at what number of plates an increase 'of transmission takes place
at all, and whether diminution only occurs at the polarizing angle,
or whether, when absorption preponderates, it occurs before.
    If it be considered that, from the observations communicated, the
rays are the more capable of entirely or partially traversing trans
parent or diathermanous plates, the more completely they are polar
ized in a plane at right angles to their plane of refraction, the greater
the number of these plates, and the more their inclination towards
the rays approaches the polarizing angle—and if it be assumed that
refracting plates polarize heat, as well as light, more completely at
right angles to the plane of refraction" the greater their number
and the more their inclination approaches the angle in question          1‘,   it
will at once be seen how the row of plates put the rays which enter
them more and more into the condition of penetrating the succeeding
ones with greater facility, and how the conditions for making the
rays in the given case more capable of transmission coincide with
those under which the layers themselves opposed to these become
more permeable.
    As polarization by simple refraction is, in the most favourable case,
most nearly complete by a Nicol's prismI,            it    always explicable
                                                          is
why polarization through a Nicol effects      a    greater increase of inten
sity of the transmitted rays when its plane of polarization coincides
with that'of the retracting piece, than does the glass piece alone.
    On the other hand, the difference between the increase on attain
ing, and the diminution on exceeding the angle of polarization, must
be smaller in the former case than in this; for in the former case
the polarization of the rays        throughout unchanged, and transmis
                                   is
sion  is  only favoured by the position of the plates; for instance, in
the case of glass  it    favoured between 50° and 55°, diminished from
                        is
55° to 60°; in the plane piece of glass the polarization of the rays and
the in<U+FB02>uence ofthe plates on the transmission are simultaneously
changed; at <U+FB01>rst both are increased, afterwards both diminished;
the passage through the polarizing angles       is  hence the more marked.
    But among the elucidations which refer the present case to more
general points of view,       itloses its surprising character; the more
copious transmission of the thermal or luminous rays incident in the
naturalcondition through inclined diathermanous or transparent plates
follows as adirect consequence.—-Poggendortf’s          Annalen, May 1866.

                    gases must differ considerably in                   and
    MIXED     speci<U+FB01>c gravity, in order to separate fromdi<U+FB01>‘usibility

    any great extent in their molecular passage into a vacuum
    through a porous septum, such as the plate of graphite or the
    walls of an unglazed earthenware tube.        The agency Of atmolysis
   is therefore very limited-in parting the oxygen and nitrogen of
    atmospheric air—gases which differ so little in density from
   each other.
       Substances existing in the liquid condition Often admit of
   being separated much more fully than gases, by the proper use
'
   of dialytic septa in addition to the agency Of liquid diffusion.
       Evidently there cannot be anything like the dialysis Of gases ;
   for dialysis involves the passage of a substance through a septum
   composed of soft colloid matter, such as must be wholly desti
   tute of open channels, and therefore be impermeable to gas as
   such.    Still liquid dialysis may be imported into the treatment
  of gases, in consequence of the general assumption of liquidity
  by gases when absorbed by actual liquids or by soft colloids.
  Water when charged with air holds liquid oxygen and nitrogen
  in solution; and the latter substances then become amenable to
  liquid di<U+FB01>'usion and dialysis, and so penetrate animal membrane
  in the act of respiration.

 or in the form of the little transparent balloons which Dr. Mit
 chell was the <U+FB01>rst to prepare from that substance.    He remarked
 in partieular'that such balloons collapse sooner when in<U+FB02>ated with
 hydrogen than with atmospheric air, and still sooner when <U+FB01>lled
 with carbonic acid; and he connected the latter fact with the
 observation that   solid piece of india-rubber
                            a                    capable of absorb  is
 ing its own volume of carbonic acid when left long enough in the
 pure gas. By means of          proper arrangement,
                                          a          Dr. Mitchell
 found that various gases passed spontaneously through the caout
 chouc membrane when there was air on the other side, with differ
                           “
ent degrees of velocity.     Ammonia transmitted in      minute as            1
much as sulphuretted hydrogen in 2% minutes, cyanogen in 3%
minutes, carbonic acid in 5% minutes, nitrous oxide in 6% mi
nutes, arsenietted hydrogen in 27% minutes, ole<U+FB01>ant gas in 28
minutes, hydrogen in 371; minutes, oxygen in         hour and 53         1
minutes, carbonic oxide in     hours and 40 minutes.”
                                          2                The rate
of penetration of nitrogen appeared to be even slower than that
of carbonic oxide*.
   It will be observed that those gases penetrate most readily
which are easily lique<U+FB01>ed                by                 “ gene
                              pressure, and which are also
rally highly soluble in water or other liquids,”   The memoir of
Dr. Mitchell was ably commented upon, shortly after its publi
cation,           by
            Dr. Draper of New York, who also added many new
observations on the passage of both gases and liquids through
membranous                septa-Ia   These    early    speculations,     however,   lose
much of their <U+FB01>tness from not taking into account the two con
siderations already alluded to, which appear to be essential to
the full comprehension of the phenomena—namely, that gases
undergo liquefaction when absorbed                      by
                                           liquids and such colloid
substances as indie-rubber, and that their transmission through
liquid and colloid septa     then effected
                                     is                        by
                                               the agency of liquid
and not gaseous diffusion.     Indeed the complete suspension of
the gaseous function during the transit through colloid mem
brane cannot be kept too much in view.
    Dr. Mitchell was led to infer, from single casual observation,
                                                       a

a  result to be expected from the porosity of the solid mass, then
assumed in explanation of the penetrativeness of gaseous <U+FB02>uids.

thickness, in carbonic acid over mercury, it was seen that the
rubber gradually absorbed 0'78 volume of gas in twenty-four
hours at 15°, of which 0'7 volume was taken up in the <U+FB01>rst
hour. The mass \of rubber was previously measured with care by
the displacement of mercury in a speci<U+FB01>c-gravity bottle, and again
when the rubber was charged with carbonic acid; it gave the
same displacement of mercury within a hundredth of a gramme.
No measurable change in the bulk of the rubber,‘ therefore, had
occurred. It may be added that the absorbent power of vulcan
ized rubber for carbonic acid appears to be less than that of
rubber in its natural state, being found only 0'57 volume in a

comparative    experiment.
    The penetration of rubber by gases maybe illustrated by their
passage into a vacuum, as well as into an atmosphere of another
gas in Dr. Mitchell’s experiments.       The diffusiometer, consist
ing of a plain glass tube of about 22 millims. in diameter and
nearly a whole metre in length, closed at the upper end by a thin
plate of stucco and open below, is taken advantage of in such
experiments. A thin <U+FB01>lm of ,rubber from a small balloon is
stretched over the upper end of the tube, where it is supported
by the stucco plate, bound with copper wire, and cemented at
the edges in contact with the glass with gutta percha softened
by heat.     If the tube be now <U+FB01>lled with mercury and inverted,
a Torricellian vacuum is obtained above, into which the air of the
atmosphere     gradually penetrates, passing through the <U+FB01>lm of
rubber and depressing the mercurial column in the tube.           In
order to compare the penetration of different gases, a hood of
thick vulcanized rubber, provided with a small entrance- and
 exit-tube for gas (such as is often used in gas experiments), is
placed over the upper end of the di<U+FB02>'usiometer described, and
 cemented to it by means of fused gutta percha.        The gas to be
 operated upon can thus be conveyed from the apparatus in which
 it is generated, or from a gasometer in which the gas is stored,
 into the hood or upper chamber of the di<U+FB02>‘usiometer, and the
 excess of gas supplied be allowed to escape into the atmosphere
 by the exit-tube of the hood.      The stucco plate used as a sup
 port to the <U+FB01>lm of rubber is so highly porous as not to add sen
 sibly to the resistance experienced by the gases in passing
 through the rubber, and, having no absorbent power of its own,
 may be left entirely out of consideration.

 nitrogen; barom. 773 millims., therm. 23c to 230'5 C. The,

    Considering the circumstances in which the gases pass through
the sheet of rubber into a vacuum, it is not to be expected that
any relation will be found among the preceding numbers, as be
tween the coc<U+FB02>icients of di<U+FB02>'usion in gases.                           The <U+FB01>rst absorption

406             Mr. T. Graham       on the Absorption and
 of the gas by rubber must depend upon a kind of chemical af<U+FB01>
 nity subsisting between the material of the gas and substance of
 rubber, analogous to that attraction which is admitted to exist
 between a soluble body and its solvent, conducing to solution.
 Carbonic acid being soluble in ether and volatile oils, it is not
 wonderful that it is also dissolved by the hydrocarbons of rubber.
 The rubber being wetted through by the lique<U+FB01>ed gas, the latter
 comes to evaporate into the vacuum, and reappears as gas on the
 other side of the membrane.           Now it is known that such eva
 poration  is the  same  into   a vacuum   and into another gas, being
 equally gas-di<U+FB02>‘usion    in   both circumstances.   It is not indispen
 sable, therefore, to have a vacuum on one side of the rubber mem
 brane as in the experiments detailed above.         A foreign gas will
 answer for the vacuum, as in the experiments of Dr. Mitchell.
    The numbers for the velocity of passage of the different gases
 in the last Table may be taken also as representing not remotely
 the relative absorption and liquefaction of the various gases by
 the substance of rubber.
    The passage of gases through rubber is also illustrated by the
 rapid collapse of the little balloon when <U+FB01>lled with carbonic acid
 gas, or even with hydrogen, or with marsh-gas, as compared with
 atmospheric air.     The converse fact is observed when the in<U+FB02>a—
 ting gas is pure nitrogen: then the balloon is found to become
further distended after a' few hours, in consequence of more
 oxygen entering from the atmosphere without, than of nitrogen
 escaping from the ba1100n during the same time ,- while the com
 position is being equalized on' both sides of the membrane, and
 the gas within the ba1100n' is <U+FB01>nally of the same composition as
 the external air.      A rubber balloon <U+FB01>lled with nitrogen was
found, when roughly gauged, to increase in diameter from 132
to 136 millims. in the course of twenty-four hours. On the
 other hand, a balloon <U+FB01>lled with pure oxygen fell in the same‘
time from 150 to 113 millims. in diameter.
    In forty-eight hours a balloon <U+FB01>lled with hydrogen 154 mil
lims. in diameter contracted to 8'7 millims., and then contained
250 cubic centims. gas, of which 53 cubic centims. were absorbed
by pyrogallic acid and potash, showing the presence of 21'2 per
cent. of oxygen, or sensibly the same proportion as in the ex_
ternal atmosphere.           .      .
    If the upper end of a diffusiometer be closed by a thin sheet
of rubber, and the instrument standing over mercury be <U+FB01>lled
with hydrogen gas, a contraction is observed to take place slowly,
but to a greater extent ultimately than could be due to the dif
fusion of hydrogen’as a gas.          Beginning with 249 volume divi-v
sions of gas in the tube, the rise of the mercurial column, orf
reduction of volume, Was 1'5 division in the <U+FB01>rst hour, 1'5 divi

together.    Then the rise in the following successive days was
42, 59, 37', 29, 13, 5, 1, 0'5, 0'5 (in two days), and 0'0, the
original volume of 249 volumes of hydrogen being <U+FB01>nally re
placed by 53 volumes of atmospheric air; barom. 747 millims.,
therm. 21°'1.     The ultimate replacing volumes are here as 1 to
4'7.   In’gas-di<U+FB01>hsion they are as 1 to 3'8.
   A balloon <U+FB01>lled with air subsided in forty-eight hours from
150 to 147 millims. in diameter, from the mechanical e<U+FB01>'ect alone
of the elasticity of the membrane in compressing the enclosed
gas.   These little balloons vary from 0'75 to 1 grm. in weight.
Supposing the form to be truly spherical, a balloon of 150 mil
lims. in diameter would have a surface of 00706 square metre
(5'905 inches in diameter and 00844 square yard of surface).
Supposing the balloon to be 1 grm. in weight, the thickness of
the membrane will be       _    of a millim., with a speci<U+FB01>c gravity

Yet such  a  <U+FB01>lm of rubber appears to have no porosity, and to
resemble  a  <U+FB01>lm of liquid in its relation to gases—differing en
tirely in this respect from    a thin sheet of paper, graphite, earth
enware, or even gutta percha, as will appear hereafter.             These
last enumerated bodies appear all to be pervaded             by
                                                              open chan
nels or pores, suf<U+FB01>ciently wide to allow gases to be projected
through    by their own proper molecular movement of diffusion.
But liquids and colloids have an unbroken texture, and afford no
opportunity for gaseous diffusion. They form even in the thin
nest <U+FB01>lm an impervious barrier to gas.
   The penetration of rubber        ismuch affected by temperature,
and apparently    in two  different  ways at the same time.        An in
crease of temperature    no  doubt   renders all gases less  easily lique
<U+FB01>ed by pressure, and consequently less considerably absorbed by
any liquid or colloid. But such an in<U+FB02>uence of heat appears to
be counteracted in rubber by the tendency of that colloid to be
come more soft when heated, and to acquire more of liquid
and, less of solid properties.        Certainly the rubber <U+FB01>lm be
comes more and more permeable to gases as the temperature              is
elevated, within moderate range.
                  a                 This was distinctly observed
in operating with silk cloth varnished on one side with rubber,
such as  is sold as  waterproof material. Without anticipating
                      a                                                a

    The volumes of gas are all reduced to barom. 760 millims. and
 therm. 20° C.
   Such numbers are probably not strictly constant ; for it appears
 that the effect Of temperature upon rubber is much in<U+FB02>uenced
 by the length of time that the temperature is continued, the
 change in degree of softness with change of temperature requi
 ring hours, or even days, fully to complete it. The rigidity Of
 rubber under cold and its softening under warmth are well
 known to take place in a slow and gradual manner.
    With the softening of rubber by heat, the retentive power of
 that substance for gases appears to be modi<U+FB01>ed.          Soft rubber,
 <U+FB01>rst charged with carbonic acid at 20°, and then made rigid by
 cold, appeared to lose its carbonic acid, when afterwards freely
 exposed to air, less rapidly than the same rubber equally charged
 but exposed from the <U+FB01>rst in its soft condition.        The quantity
 of carbonic acid retained in the former case was 10'76 per cent.,
 and in the latter 7'08 per cent. Of the volume of the rubber, after
 a similar exposure Of forty-eight hours.       This point, although
 not suf<U+FB01>ciently examined, is alluded to here on account of the
 analogy which appears to hold between rubber and the malleable
 metals in a power to absorb a gas when they are softened by
 heat, and to retain the same gas with great tenacity when they
 are afterwards made rigid by cold.
    The condensation of oxygen gas by masses of solid rubber
 punched out of a block was made the subject of observation, by
 placing 50 grms. of that substance within a jar of oxygen stand
 ing over mercury during a period of several days.          From the
rubber afterwards there was extracted, by the action of a vacuum
 continued for twenty-one hours, 6'21 cub. centims. of gas; of
 which 3'67 cub. centims. were oxygen, 0'14 carbonic acid, and
the remainder chie<U+FB02>y nitrogen.       Taking the bulk of the rubber
 at 538 cub. centims., the oxygen absorbed amounts to 6'82 per
 cent. of the volume of the rubber.          Oxygen then may be re
 garded as fully twice as soluble in rubber as the same gas is
in water at the ordinary temperature.       No experiment was made
at a higher temperature; but as the penetrativeness of rubber is
much increased by heat, the presumption is that the solubility
of gases in rubber is increased in the same degree.
    More than one attempt was made to identify the presence of
free hydrogen in the substance of rubber after being kept in that

latility.

    1.  A balloon of rubber <U+FB01>lled with              hydrogen and exposed to the
atmosphere, gradually        loses   the    former      gas, which is <U+FB01>nally re
placed by considerably
             a                  smaller       volume     of air, presenting a de
ceptive   resemblance     to   the   di<U+FB02>'usion        of hydrogen gas into air.
When the progress of the entrance of air was observed at differ
ent stages of the exchange, it appeared that after three hours,
when the balloon had fallen from 150 to 128 millims. in diameter,
the composition of its contents was—
                Oxygen       .   .    .        8'98           41'6
                Nitrogen .       .    .

    Setting aside therefore the hydrogen still remaining, the bal
loon now contained a portion of a mixture of oxygen and nitro
 gen in the proportion of 41'6 volumes of the former to 584
volumes of the latter. This was the largest proportion of oxygen
to the nitrogen observed ; for the former gas has a tendency to
 <U+FB02>ow back again to the external atmosphere when the hydrogen
becomes small in volume ; and the proportion of oxygen becomes
 eventually no higher than 21 per cent. of the whole gases remain—
 ing in the balloon, including the hydrogen. Thus after six
hours the proportion of oxygen was 33'63 to nitrogen 66'37' vo
 lumes, and after twenty-four hours oxygen 2648 to nitrogen
 73'52 volumes, the hydrogen constantly diminishing at the same
time.
    The entrance by in<U+FB01>ltration of atmospheric air into a balloon
 of rubber in<U+FB02>ated with carbonic acid gas brings us still nearer to
 a practical dialytic separation, as the carbonic acid can be with
 drawn entirely by means of caustic alkali, after a certain time
 has elapsed, and the in<U+FB01>ltered air enriched with oxygen be dealt
 with by itself. A balloon containing carbonic acid, when placed
 in the atmosphere, was reduced in four hours from 160 to 90
millims. in diameter, and it had now acquired 199 cub. centims.
 of gas not dissolved by alkali. This gas was capable of reviving
the combustion of wood burning without <U+FB02>ame, and was found

410             Mr. T. Graham      on the Absorption and
    To produce this _concentration of oxygen, it is quite necessary
that the operation be interrupted at an early stage, as was done
in the last experiment ; otherwise the oxygen diminishes again in
proportion to the nitrogen, falling at last to the normal propor
 tion of 21 per cent. as in the external air. Thus a balloon in
<U+FB02>ated by carbonic acid to 150 millims. in diameter, was found
to lose nearly all its carbonic acid in the course of twenty-four
hours.     It gave 150 cub. centims. of gas after treatment with
caustic potash.     This was air of the composition,

and exhibited therefore no material augmentation in the propor
tion of oxygen.
    It may be inferred from the familiar fact that air dissolved in
water contains so high a proportion as 30 per cent. of oxygen,
that if carbonic acid gas were divided from atmospheric air by a
<U+FB01>lm of water, the former gas would come to be charged through
the <U+FB01>lm with air bearing the same high proportion of 30 per
cent. of oxygen.      But it is not easy to imitate this experiment
unless the dividing <U+FB01>lm is supported by a membrane of some
sort.    The air from the atmosphere, which entered a fresh ox
bladder preserved humid and in<U+FB02>ated with carbonic acid, was
found to possess 24'65 per cent. of oxygen to 7535 of nitrogen,
which is but a small increase in the proportion of oxygen.      But
the thickness of the membrane here was too great, and other
circumstances of the experiment were unfavourable.
    A balloon of rubber in<U+FB02>ated to 150 millims. in diameter with
carbonic acid was submerged in water, at 22° C., for forty-eight
hours. Only a small portion of carbonic acid remained in the
residual gas, which, after being washed with potash, consisted of
                     Oxygen     .   .   .   .    25'77'

    2. With the colloid septum properly supported, as by a stucco
plate  in the di<U+FB01>'usiometer covered by a <U+FB01>lm of rubber (p. 403), a
considerable    separation of mixed gases can be effected.      The
constituents of atmospheric air appear to be carried through a
<U+FB01>lm of rubber into a vacuum, nearly in the same relative propor
tion as the same gases penetrate singly (p. 405).        The veloci
ties of nitrogen and oxygen passing separately were observed to
be as 1 to 2556, and hence by calculation,

       Hence air dialyzed by the rubber septum should consist of
  4046     oxygen and 5954 nitrogen in 100 volumes.              Now air from
  the atmosphere was found to enter the vacuum of the 48-inch
  di<U+FB01>'usiometer-tube, through a disk of rubber 22 millims. in dia
  meter, to the amount of 3'48 cub. centims. in twenty-one hours,
  under the pressure of the atmosphere; therm. 23° to 24° C.
   Of the 3'48 cub. centims. of gas so collected, 2 cub. centims.
  were absorbed by pyrogallic acid and potash, representing 4253
  per cent. of oxygen in the dialyzed air. Here the gas was trans
  ferred from the di<U+FB01>'usiometer for examination by depressing the
   di<U+FB01>'usiometer in mercury, and using a very narrow tube of rub
  ber as a gas-siphon communicating between the gas in the dif
  fusiometer and a jar inverted in the mercurial trough.                  The
  elastic tube is <U+FB01>rst <U+FB01>lled with mercury, and, being of considerable
  length, a portion of it is drawn repeatedly through the <U+FB01>ngers
  so as to throw the mercury and aspirated gas into the collecting
  receiver.    The transference of gases in such circumstances may
  also be e<U+FB02>'ected with much advantage by means of the vacuum_
  tube invented by Dr. Hermann Sprengel, as will immediately be
  shown.
       The process of dialytic separation by means of a rubber sep

  rubber septum, which may be a <U+FB01>lm of rubber formed from
   caoutchouc    varnish, as well as from distended sheet rubber;
   (2)  in the nature  of the support given to the septum, which may
  be a backing of cotton cloth or of silk (common waterproof
  cloth prepared by means of caoutchouc varnish, in short), as well
  as a plate of stucco, earthenware, or wood; and (3) in the means

   able degree of exhaustion,      on one side of the dialytic septum,

  lyzed, has access to the other side of the same septum.             Or the
  air to be dialyzed may be compressed on one side ofthe septum,
  and left of the usual tension. on the other side—inequality of
  tension on the two sides of the septum being all that is required
  to induce penetration.

    ing a good vacuum in E by means of this apparatus arises from
    the necessity of joining the glass tubes in more‘than one place

    Dr. Sprengel on this point require to be closely followed :-—“ The
    connexions between the glass tubes are made of well-<U+FB01>tting black
    vulcanized caoutchouc tubing, sold under the name of French
    tubing.     This is free from metallic oxides, which render the
    tubing porous. Besides this all these joints are bound with coils
    of copper wire, which is easily accomplished with a pair of pliers.”
    The joints should also be coated with gutta percha lique<U+FB01>ed by
    heat, or with fused rubber. An exhausting-syringe, or air-pump,

may often be used with advantage to begin the exhaustion, and
to withdraw the greater bulk of the air,     the receiver
                                                 if       large,       is
the Sprengel tube being reserved to complete the exhaustion.
The vacuum appears to be as .perfect as can be formed in     ba             a
rometer-tube <U+FB01>lled with unboiled mercury, and to come within
1  millim. of the barometric gauge.
   The following modi<U+FB01>cations of the experiment exhibit the dia
lytic action of caoutchouc in its various forms.
      1. India-rubber between       double cotton cloth vulcanized.
    This was a  common elastic carriage-bag 18 inches by 15. The
surface of both sides amounted to 034.82 square metre.              The
bag was pressed <U+FB02>at       by
                           the hands, and still further exhausted               by
means of Sprengel’s tube.        After all the contents of the bag
were extracted and the collapse complete, the Sprengel tube
began again to throw out air in         aslow but exceedingly regular
manner.     A   small portion of sawdust, or of sand, introduced
beforehand into the bag, appeared to be useful in preventing the
sides coming together too closely, but was not essential.           The
air thus extracted from the bag in one hour amounted to 15'65
cub. centims., or sensibly     1 cubic inch; therm. 23° to 24° C.
Such dialyzed air, from three successive experiments of one hour
each, contained 38, 403, and 41'2 per cent. of oxygen, the in
ferior proportion of oxygen in the earlier experiments being no
doubt due to     asmall residue of undialyzed air remaining in the
                             '
bag before exhaustion.         This dialyzed air rekindled glowing
wood, so as to illustrate the direct separation of oxygen gas from
atmospheric air.     For the purposes of combustion,             may be
                                                                      it
viewed as air from which one-half of the inert nitrogen has been
                                       '
withdrawn.
    It will be convenient to express the permeability of the colloid
septum with uniform reference to         a square metre of area, and to
an hour, or to single minute of time.
                 a                             Here, for    square metre
                                                              a
of cloth, the passage of air amounted to 44'95 cub. centims.                    (3
cubic inches nearly) per hour, or to 0749 cub. centim. per
minute.
    The view which the observation suggests of the nature of such
an air-tight fabric     is,
                         that      may be truly impenetrable to air
                                   it
when the composition and tension of the air are the same on
both sides of the cloth; but        it
                                    ispenetrable when        vacuum or
                                                               a                a
reduced state of tension       ismaintained on one side of the cloth
 and not on the other.      The compression of the air con<U+FB01>ned in               a
bag would no doubt have similar effect, and then the <U+FB02>ow would
                               a
 be in an outward direction.      But there      no evidence of
                                                is                porous
                                                                       a
 structure in the varnished cloth.        The gases of atmospheric air
 would pass through actual openings according to the law of

414           Mr. T. Graham       on the Absorption and
gaseous   di<U+FB02>'usion, which favours the nitrogen or lighter gas,
while it is the oxygen which is found to pass through the mate
rial most readily in these experiments.       The imbibition of the
lique<U+FB01>ed gas by    the substance  of the  rubber, with the subsequent
evaporation    of this liquid into  the  vacuum   on the other side, is
all the explanation required.
                2. Vulcanized india-rubber tubing.
    A stout caoutch’oue tube with an external diameter of 13 mil
lims. (half an‘iuch), an internal diameter of 9 millims., thickness
of 2 millims., and length of 3'658 metres       (41
                                              yards) was exhausted,
one end being closed and the other end connected with the
 Sprengel pump. The gas collected in thirteen hours amounted
to 11-25 cub. centims.; them. 200 to 23° C. This gas con-i
tained 378 per cent. of oxygen.      The gaseous penetration      not
                                                                  is
great   in so thicka tube, and  there   reason
                                       is      to fear the in<U+FB02>uence
of gaseous diffusion to     asmall extent.   The admission of air
would be equally sensible    ifthe tube were occupied        by
                                                            coal-gas,
or any other foreign gas, instead of being vacuous.     As the inner
surface of the tube amounted to 01034: square metre and the
passage of air to 08653 cub. centim. per hour, the passage for a
 square metre would be 837 cub. centims. per hour, or 0'14 cub.
 centim. per minute. The rate of penetration through the tube
 walls appears to be one-<U+FB01>fth of what was found for the rubber
 cloth.
              3. Sheet rubber,       millim. in thickness.
                                  1
   Although an increased thickness was no doubt attended by
slowness of passage,   it   was of interest to observe whether the
proportion   of  oxygen per cent. might not at the same time be
varied.    The sheet used was still, however, as thin as the manu
facturer could Succeed in cutting from solid cylinder of wrought
                                            a
rubber by the usual method.          The rubber was not vulcanized.
The sheet of rubber was made into        a   bag having 0'149 square
metre (231 square inches) of surface,       a  double thickness of felted
carpet  being   placed  within  the   folds of   rubber. A     glass quill
tube, cemented to the bag, communicated with the interior of
the cavity, and was connected at the other end with Sprengel’s
tube.    After the <U+FB01>rst exhaustion of the gaseous contents of the
bag, for which the aid of an exhausting-syringe or air-pump            is
useful, air continued to in<U+FB01>ltrate through the sheet rubber, but
very slowly.      Of the dialyzed air 11-45 cub. centims. were col
lected in four hours.        This air contained 4148 per cent. of
oxygen,   with a   sensible trace  of carbonic acid.     The penetration
for   asquare  metre   amounts   to 192   cub.  centims.  of air per hour,
or 0'32 cub. centim. per minute.

            Dialytic Separation  of Gases   by Colloid Septa.     415
    The same bag, left exhausted for eighteen hours, was found
afterwardsto yield at once 41'6 cub. centims. of air, containing
403 per cent. of oxygen, which had accumulated in the cavity Of
the bag; therm. about 20° C.
    From a larger bag of similar thin sheet rubber, having a sur
face of 640 square inches, distended by ten or twelve ounces of
sawdust, 21'35 cub. centims. of dialyzed air were Obtained in one
hour; barom. 761 millims., therm. '19°'5 C. This dialyzed air
appeared to consist of
                     Oxygen . .       .   .   .  41-80
                     Carbonic acid    .  .    .    0'94:
                     Nitrogen . .     .   .   .  5726
                                                10000
    It does not appear, then, that the increased thickness of the
rubber septum tends to increase the proportion of oxygen in the
dialyzed air, while this thickness causes the passage to be pro
portionally slower.      The oxygen appears to attain, but never to
exceed, at 20° C., the proportion of 41'6 to 58-4 nitrogen.
    The thick rubber brings notably into View the carbonic acid of
the air. The small proportion of this gas in air is probably in
creased in all experiments with the rubber septum, however thin.
It was observed to rise so high in a small crowded room, as to
negative the in<U+FB01>aming action of the oxygen on smouldering
wood. But rubber appears to have a power to charge itself gra
 dually from atmospheric air with about half per cent. of its vo
lume of carbonic acid.       This carbonic acid, accumulated in thick
sheet rubber, appears again to be carried on by the other gases
imbibed in a dialytic experiment.
                  4. Thin Balloons of india-rubber.
    These little balloons were made available for the dialytic pas
 sage of air into a vacuum by <U+FB01>lling them with sifted sawdust
 through a funnel, an operation which requires some address.
 The balloon collapsed upon the sawdust, which formed an inte
 rior ball, the sides of rubber still retaining a thickness of about
 one-<U+FB01>ftieth of a millimetre.    The rubber is not vulcanized. Such
 a ball, of which the original rubber weighed 0'76 grm., still re
 mained 95 millims. in diameter after the air was exhausted.         It
 was found, when exhausted, to admit 19'6 cub. centims. of dia
 lyzed air in forty-one minutes (barom. 5'79 millims., and therm.
 19° C.). The same air possessed 41-32 per cent. of oxygen. The
 ball had a surface of 00283 square metre, and it dialyzed 0'48
 cub. centim. of air in one minute.     For a square metre of surface
 this is a passage of 169 cub. centims. per minute.        The passage
 therefore is about <U+FB01>fty times as fast as through a sheet of rubber

 416            Mr. T. Graham      on the Absorption and
 of    1 millim. in thickness, while the high proportion of oxygen is
   sensibly the same.      Such a ball was found to dialyze air in the
   same manner for more than a month, if protected from mecha
   nical injury.
       Three such balls, each containing twenty-three ounces of sifted
   sawdust, were made to act together, by connecting them with
   three dependent branches from the same horizontal glass tube.
   The horizontal tube was connected at one end with an ordinary
   air-pump which produced a good vacuum by thirty or forty
   strokes of the piston. The other end of the horizontal glass tube
  was attached to a good Sprengel apparatus of the largest admis
   sible size, constructed by Messrs. Elliot of the Strand.           It was
  found, however, that the dialyzed air entered rather more rapidly
  than it could be extracted by a single Sprengel apparatus.            This
  was at the rate of 5 cub. centims. in one minute; therm. about
  200 C.      The dialyzed air contained 405 per cent. of oxygen.
      The greatest amount of aérial dialysis per square metre was
  obtained by means of a rubber bag, larger than usual, and weigh
  ing 1'55 grm. When <U+FB01>lled with the sawdust and exhausted,
  this bag still remained of 143 millims. in diameter, and with a
  surface therefore of 00642 square metre.           The air which passed
  through    amounted   to 170:") cubic centims.  in  ten minutes ,- therm.
  about 20°.      This air gave 407 per cent. of oxygen.              For a
  square   metre  of surface, this is the passage   of  26'?) cub. centims.
 per minute, the highest which has as yet been observed.
      In the thin transparent envelope of the little balloon of rubber
 we have a colloid substance in the most favourable form yet ap
 plied to the dialysis of mixed gases. But there is still much
 room for improvement in the mode of using the thin septum in
 question.      The balls are apt to contract considerably, owing to
 their elasticity, in the operation referred to, of <U+FB01>lling them with
 sawdust; their walls become at the same time thicker and less
 quickly pervious.       A mode of destroying the elasticity of the
 membrane when in its most attenuated condition, so that the
balloon might be cut open and the membrane spread out without
 shrinking, would be very useful. Instead of depending upon the
 interior support of sawdust, the membrane could then be stretched
 over a more convenient frame to support        it,  of thin porous deal,
of unglazed earthenware, and even of        a   felted fabric, or several
thicknesses of unsized paper supported by         a    slight frame, so as
to form  a    hollow cavity that admitted of being exhausted of air.
The attention of manufacturers of rubber might be advantage
ously directed to the preparation and proper support of the thin
nest possible septa of that material.
v    The varnish of rubber which appeared to offer the best septum
on drying, was   a    thin solution of rubber in 200 times its weight

             Dialytic   Separation of Gases by Colloid Sepia.       417
of chloroform.       Four or <U+FB01>ve coats of this varnish required to be
applied   to  a surface  of wood, or of unglazed earthenware, to form
an air-tight envelope.       The <U+FB01>lm appeared to exceed in thickness
the rubber balloons, and it dialyzed air less rapidly. But a better
result may be expected at the hands of experienced manufacturers.
    The thin rubber membrane of the balloons was stretched over
the ends of glass tubes already closed with a plate of porous
stucco—and also over the mouths of small glass bulbs or osmo—
meters, closed with a disk of porous wood or of un glazed earthen
ware, and which presented a surface of one-hundredth of a square
metre. The membrane of the balloon could only be applied
while double ;- but after the covering was securely bound to the
glass and cemented with fused gutta percha at the edges, the
outer coating was torn off, so as to leave only a single thickness
of rubber as the dialytic septum.       A bulb of the kind described,
when exhausted by a Sprengel pump, gave afterwards 16'36 cub.
centims. of dialyzed air in two hours, containing by analysis 41'?)
per cent. of oxygen, therm. 23° C. ; in the following two hours,
17 '35 cub. centims. of air, containing 426 per cent. of oxygen.
This last is at the high rate, for a square metre of surface, of
14146 cub. centims. per minute.
5.   Silk cloth varnished with rubber on one side, slightly vulcanized.
    This is a thin but close silk fabric, much used for waterproof
garments. It appears also to be employed, when dyed of afancy
colour, in the preparation of arti<U+FB01>cial <U+FB02>owers and for other pur
poses.     The silk cloth is of a single thickness; and the coating
of rubber, which is of a black colour, appears on one side only.
It is a much superior material to the ordinary cotton fabrics,
which are double, with the two varnished sides pressed together,
and is much more to be depended upon for being sound and free
from pores than the “ waterproof” cotton cloth. The silk cloth,
however,     should always be tested by examining air dialyzed by
means of it.      If the proportion of oxygen falls below 40 per cent.,
the silk is unsound at one or more spots.        These spots may ge
nerally be discovered by wetting one side of the silk with a
sponge and observing where the passage of water is indicated by
a visible stain on the other side.      The defective spot may be co
vered by a small disk of sheet rubber applied warm to the surface.
Such varnished silk, although not the most rapid in its dialytic
action, was more convenient in use than any other septum
hitherto tried.
    The varnished silk stretched over a disk of porous earthenware
 (for support) closing the mouth of the small glass bell-jar or 0s
mometer, which has an opening of one hundredth part of a
square metre, gave 10 cub. centims. of dialyzed air in one hour,

 418            Mr. T. Graham    on the Absorption and
 containing 422 per cent. of oxygen ; barom. 767 millims., therm.
 23°‘5. For a square metre of surface this is a passage of 2'77
 cub. centims. of air per minute.
    A small bag, useful for experimental purposes, was constructed
 of a portion of the same varnished silk, 0'53 metre in length by
 027 metre in width, which had therefore a surface of 0143
 square metre. The varnished side was turned inwards. Between
 the folds of the silk was placed a double thickness of common felt
 carpet or a piece of wadding, so as to occupy the interior of the
 bag.    A glass quill tube also entered the bag to the depth of a.
 few inches, and projected as much outside, so as to admit of
 being connected, by means of a sound adapter tube of French
 rubber, with a Sprengel pump, as shown in <U+FB01>g. 1 (page 412).
 The edges of the silk cloth were cemented round by caoutchouc
 varnish, to a depth of 10 millims., so as to close the bag ; and
 care was taken also to cement the glass tube well to the edges of
 the bag.    When the silk bag is exhausted of air, it remains
 nearly <U+FB02>at, and feels hard like a piece of cardboard.     Such an
 air-dialyzer is further improved by inter-posing a strong glass
 <U+FB02>ask or bottle, of one or two litres in capacity, between the bag
 and the pump, so that both are exhausted of air at the same time.
 The <U+FB02>ask must be strong enough to bear the full pressure of the
 atmosphere without breaking.        An auxiliary air-pump, to pro-l
 duce the <U+FB01>rst exhaustion, cannot well be dispensed with where
 the space to be made vacuous is so considerable ; the Sprengel
 tube is brought into action afterwards.      The advantage gained
 by the vacuous <U+FB02>ask, and even by the thick wadding placed
within the bag, is that they form a magazine in which the dia
lyzed air can be allowed to accumulate for several hours or a
whole day, and from which the air may afterwards be drawn
quickly by the Sprengel tube for the purpose of experiment.      A
narrow glass receiver tube, which can be cl0sed by the thumb,
may be used to take 5 or 6 cub. centims. for an observation on
the in<U+FB02>ammation of a chip of wood in the highly oxygenated air.
When the proportion of oxygen is under 33 per cent. the wood
is not rekindled; but in the ordinary action of this dialyzer
the oxygen is seldom found under 40 per cent.             The best
result is obtained when the exhaustion is within half an inch of
the barometric vacuum.       When the pressure was allowed to fall
to one-half or one-third of an atmosphere, the proportion of
oxygen was lessened by 2 or 3 per cent.
    The action of heat and cold on the penetrability of rubber is
considerable,   as has already been stated.     Operating with the
dialyzing-bag described, without any intermediate <U+FB02>ask, the vo
lume of air collected in twenty minutes was 6'35 and 6'57 cub.
centims. in two consecutive experiments; barom. 760 millims.,

           Dialytic Separation of Gases by Colloid Sepia.        419
therm. 20°. For a square metre the rate is 222 and 2'29, ave
rage 2'25 cub. centims. per minute. The proportion of oxygen
was, in the <U+FB01>rst experiment 425, and in the second 41-66 per
cent.
   WVhen the same dialyzing-bag was kept at a temperature of
60° C., the volume of air collected in seven minutes was 6'22
and 7 '06, cub. centims.     For the square metre this amounts to
6'21 and 7'05, mean 665 cub. centims. per minute. The pas
sage of air through rubber is therefore almost exactly three times
as quick at 60° as at 20° C.
   Again, the dialyzing-bag was kept at 4° C. by being sur
rounded by ice and salt.      The air now collected in seventy-two
minutes was 5'78 and 5'77 cub. centims. in volume—for a square
metre, 0'56 cub. centim. per minute.      The passage of air through
rubber thus appears to be four times as slow at 4°C. as it is at 20°.
The proportion of oxygen in the dialyzed air increased at the same
time. In the two portions of air collected at 4° the oxygen was
467 5 and 4743 per cent. The increase of oxygen at a low tem
perature was con<U+FB01>rmed in other experiments; but it appeared at
the same time that the rubber was liable to acquire a true poro
sity to a slight extent when retained for some hours about 0° C.
The rubber then allowed air to pass through it containing no
more than 28 or even 23 per cent. of oxygen, and in volume still
very small. The rubber has become rigid by the cold, and is
now acting feebly as a porous substance, allowing a little gas
diffusion to take place through its substance.    Such a condition,
which is accidental to caoutchouc at a low temperature, appears
to be constant with gutta percha, a harder material, at 20° C.,
and even higher temperatures.
   A large bag of varnished silk with a surface of 1'672 square
metre (two square yards) was found still more convenient.          It
Was, however, rather beyond the exhausting-power of the largest
 Sprengel-pump.      It yielded in eight minutes, without any col
lecting-<U+FB02>ask,   22,  21'55,  and 21'5, mean 21'68 cub. centims.
This was a supply of 2'71 cub. centims. per minute, and was at
the rate, for a square metre, of 1'62 cub. centim. per minute.
The supply would have been about a half more if the dialyzed
air had not gained upon the pump. The air of the <U+FB01>rst and last
observations   contained  respectively 4189  and  4185   per cent. of
oxygen. 7
   The usual proportion of oxygen in air dialyzed by rubber ap
pears to be about 41'6 per cent. ; and it may be described as
atmospheric air depriVed of one-half of its usual proportion of
nitrogen.    A single dialysis of air therefore carries the experi
menter already halfway from air to pure oxygen as the <U+FB01>nal
result.   But the gain by a second dialysis could not be so great,

after the <U+FB01>rst operation, a third dialysis one-half of the nitrogen
remaining after the second operation, and so on—each step of
the concentration of the oxygen being obtained at a greater cost
than the last, and the best conceivable result being only a good
approximation.     The practical problem which is suggested by
the air-dialyzer     to attain the means on

temperature of 212°.      In the former case the contact of ice with
overcooled water determines an instantaneous congelation of part
of the water with a rise of temperature to 32° 5 and in the latter
case the contact of steam at 212° causes a sudden ebullition of
the overheated water, with a fall of temperature to 212°, and so
of analogous experiments with other substances.         This, by the
 old school, might have been taken as a kind of negative proof,
—a repugnance on the part of Nature to permit an approach
towards the inversion or suspension of a physical law. The
immediate cause of the phenomena has been referred by modern
investigators to molecular conditions and polar in<U+FB02>uences in the
ultimate particles of matter; and as long as the phenomena
were con<U+FB01>ned to circumstances like those mentioned above, we
might perhaps rest satis<U+FB01>ed with such explanation. But in the
case of aqueous solutions there appears to be something like a
more positive proof of the above imagined law.
    A saturated solution of common salt in water boils, under
 atmospheric pressure, at 226°, and yet the steam which it emits
is only 212°; and so also of other solutions which boil at tem
peratures even beyond 270°. It is well known that though the
presence in a liquid of a substance dissolved in it may, to a con
siderable amount, raise the temperature at which the liquid boils
under a given pressure, yet, unless the dissolved substance enters
into the comp0sition of the vapour, the relation between the
temperature and pressure of saturation of the latter remains un
changed. It is not dif<U+FB01>cult to conceive that the af<U+FB01>nity or
attractive in<U+FB02>uence between the particles of the Water and those
of the dissolved body should hold down the water-particles in
close association with the solid particles against the force of heat
tending to separate them, and that thus the boiling-point of the
solution should be raised; but it is not so easy to conceive why
the steam-bubbles    rising from the bottom of a mass of a solu
tion of potash boiling at 272° should escape from the surface
as saturated steam of 212° without any indication of having
been superheated by contact with the liquid 60° hotter, and
by radiation during their transit through this liquid from the
bottom to the surface.      It seems very probable that, as sup
posed by   Regnault,   molecularly each particle of steam is formed
as saturated steam at a pressure actually corresponding to the
temperature of the boiling liquid, the chemical attraction of the
dissolved salt coercing it in the same manner as it holds down
the particles of water against the act of boiling through a
thermomctric range of 60° in the case under consideration
(from 212° to 272°); but when a number of steam-particles
coalesce to form a bubble, it is reasonable to suppose that the
smallest visible steam-bubble must be of enormous dimensions

422              Prof. Curtis on the Freezing of Water
compared with each individual steam-particle which enters into
its composition, and that the sphere of chemical attraction of the
salt cannot penetrate far into the interior of the spherical mass
of steam forming a visible bubble. Consequently it may be sup
posed that a steam-bubble of a given weight formed at the bot
tom of the solution should assume a size very nearly equal to
that of a steam-bubble of equal weight formed in pure water
boiling under the same pressure; and, unless there be some
special reason why steam should not be superheated by passing
through an aqueous solution considerably hotter than itself, it
might be expected that the steam-bubbles formed at the bottom
of a mass of a solution of potash or muriate of lime at a tempe
rature of upwards of 270° under atmospheric pressure would
show some sign of having acquired a temperature           somewhat
above 212° in their passage from the bottom to the surface of
the liquid.     The general accuracy of Regnault’s experimental
researches is universally admitted ; and his experiments have fully
proved the fact enounced by Rudberg long ago, that the steam
from aqueous solutions boiling at temperatures above 212° is
                                           I
 still only 212°. At the same time think it will be admitted
that Regnault’s explanation of the phenomena, though applicable
molecularly, does not satisfactorily apply to the passage of visible
steam-bubbles through an aqueous solution much hotter than
the normal boiling-point of pure water under a given pressure.
The subject seems to be still enveloped in obscurity, and requires
further investigation.

LVII.     0n the Freezing of Water at Temperatures lower than 32°F.
    By ARTHUR HILL CURTIS, LL.D., Professor ofNatural Phi
    losophy in the Queen’s Unioersity*.
                water   which has been reduced in temperature
'WHEN   -  below   the  ordinary freezing-point without becoming
solidi<U+FB01>ed is agitated, it is well known that a portion of it be
comes frozen ; and the question immediately arises, how much?
This question has been already answered, and the result arrived
at tested by experiment.      In obtaining the result, however, it
has been assumed that all the ice is formed either at the tempe
rature Of 32° F., or at the initial temperature of the water.
Now a little consideration will show that neither of these as
sumptions is true.       The congelation     commences at some one
point, or at a certain <U+FB01>nite number of points 3 certain small par
                     " Communicated  by the Author.

                               at Temperatures lower than 32° F.                    423
        ticles of ice are formed at these centres of congelation, a large
'
        quantity of heat is given out by each particle, and as water is a
        bad conductor of beat, this is principally communicated to the
    '
        adjacent particles of water, and when immediately afterwards
        these particles pass from the liquid to the solid state, this trans
        ition takes place at a temperature higher than the initial one.
        For a similar reason the liquid particles adjacent to these last
        pass into the solid state at a temperature still higher; and thus
        the process continues until, at last, all the ice formed and the
        surrounding water are raised to the temperature         of 32° F.
        The process of course would terminate here if the vessel con
        taining the liquid were a perfect non-conductor of heat, but as
        this condition is unattainable, the reduced value in water of the
        vessel must be found, and this included in the given quantity
        of water.
           As the consecutive portions of ice are formed at different
        temperatures varying according to a complicated law, which de
        pends on the conductibility of water, its latent heat, and the
        speci<U+FB01>c heat of ice, the exact determination of the quantity of
        ice formed would at <U+FB01>rst sight appear to be of considerable dif
        <U+FB01>culty; this dif<U+FB01>culty, however, as            I
                                                shall presently show, is

        only      apparent.
          Before proceeding to the consideration of the problem itself                I

LVIII.        Remarks suggesting doubts respecting the received value of
    1.4., the  Index of Refraction of the Lens.          By ROBERT TEM
    PLETON,      Esg.*
                                   [With  a Plate]
1.
     A        SERIES of    very small holes being perforated in a thin
              sheet of brass in a gradation of sizes varying from about
one-tenth of a millimetre to about <U+FB01>fteen tenths of a millimetre
in diameter, if minute dots on a slip of cardboard be examined
through them, a set of measurements can be taken of the dis
tances at which the most perfect vision of the dots is obtained.
A few trials will be required with an unpractised eye, as the ob
server does not at <U+FB01>rst feel quite sure at what distance the object
is  best seen; but very soon a set will be obtained such as is con
tained in the third column of the annexed Table :—
                                                                 d

    2. The measurements in this column are a single set, taken in
 a well-lighted room, at a time when the sun was high but not
 shining into the room.          As far as has been observed, they are
 constant for the same degree of light't.
     3. The diameters of the small holes given in the second
 column being divided by the distances corresponding to them in
 the third, the logarithms of the quotients are placed opposite to
 them in the fourth column.              These logarithms are perceived to
 be as nearly constant as can be expected, it being somewhat dif
 <U+FB01>cult to settle upon the precise point of perfect vision within a
 certain range of tolerably distinct vision; but the smaller the
 dot, consistent with exact de<U+FB01>nition, the more readily is the exact
 distance of perfect vision determined.               We <U+FB01>nd, then, that for
 each hole there is a distance of quite perfect vision, a nearer or
    * Communicated by the Author.
    1' Some of the experiments here repeated were made many years ago, in
 an attempt to show that the adaptation of the eye to vision at diiferent
 distances could only doubtfully be attributed to an exercise of muscular
 power, since a limit ought to he arrived at, at which the effort to maintain .
 vision would cause it to become more or less intermitting.

426            Mr. R. Templeton      on the received value      of   ,a,
further distance of more or less distinct vision, gradually dissol
ving into a diffused glare.
    4.. With larger holes it is not so easy to <U+FB01>x on the exact point;
but it may be remarked that with all eyes there is a point where
exact de<U+FB01>nition ceases; it is usually at about one and a half to
two and a half metres from the eye.
    5. The mean of the above logarithms is 7'7454, correspond
ing to an angle of 19' 8” ; and it may reasonably be assumed
that in a constant light the hole invariably subtends, at the dot
or other object looked at, such angle when the dot or object is
perfectly well seen.
    6. If the pupil be dilated with belladonna, extraneous light
carefully excluded, the other eye closed, and the experiment
again tried, vision is found to be perfectly restored with any one
hole at the distance corresponding tothat hole.
    7. When the edge of a little fragment of silvered glass is
brought up to the eye (that          is,
                                       held at about 10 to 15 centime
tres from it), so that the pupil can be examined while the eye runs
along vista of objects,.it will be found that the eye can be
         a
brought to bear on an object at any particular distance without
distinct vision occurring, unless the act be accompanied                   by
                                                                        voli
tion; but the moment the mind wills to see the object, the iris
obeys the impulse, contracts or expands as the case may be, and
the object       clearly seen. There
                   is                        noticeable interval between
                                            is   a
the exercise of the will and the movement of the iris.             The iris
would seem to exercise no in<U+FB02>uence on vision further than me
chanically controlling the brightness of the spectrum on the
retina.
    8. If     <U+FB01>nger

scape      not lost sight of, though not de<U+FB01>nitely seen; parallel

impressed upon       the retina at the same moment       yet the difference

                                                 is     millimetre.      The
depth of the rods and bulbs (the sentient portion of the retina)
is,  however, only '044 millim. or thereahouts.
    9.   Ithas been shown that, within ordinary reading-distance, in
a  good light, from any point of an object           conical pencil of rays,
                                                      a
the vertical angle of the cone being 19' 8”*, falls upon the
cornea and         transmitted through the eye, undergoing therein
                    is
refractions which bring the rays of which the pencil                 is

tow a  focus behind .the lens.        If the focus for parallel rays be
imagined to be at the retina,          it   utterly impossible that the
                                            is

                               a

                   more or less, varying with the individual and the light.

the object is  approached to the eye.
   10. When the human lens has been removed by the operation
of couching, the person operated on has sight so far restored that
he can go about*, distinguish clearly light from shade, and
be conscious of the presence of obstacles.         \Ve can realize the
condition of such persons by placing before the eye a glass lens
of 50 to 100 millims. negative focus; by, however, interposing
a small hole (Nos. 2, 3, or 4 of preceding Table) in a sheet of
brass between the glass and the eye,L vision is perfectly restored,
though for obvious reasons the objects regarded appear faint.
In these circumstances the focus of rays from a distant object is
                                    -
far beyond the retina.

cal pencils (that     one   making  is,
                                     an  angle of    34" with the axis              9'
of the eye),  we  <U+FB01>nd     come  to    focus

we have approximately the radius of the minute disk formed on
the retina                by

  428         Mr. R. Templeton      on the received value    of ,u,
      14. The human lens, owing to its being less refractive, is far
  the best to experiment on; but none being procurable, many
   experiments were made on ox-eycs to determine the position of
   the focus of parallel rays. The eyes vary much in dimensions,
   and therefore require the radii and distances to be carefully
   measured in each case of trial; the position of the focus varies
  also, in water from 40 to 48 millims. from the rear of the lens.
  The best observation in a medium-sized eye gave 44 millims.
  In air the focus would appear to be at 6 millims.; but there is
  great   dif<U+FB01>culty in measuring it; it is consequently doubtful.
  \Vhile the lens was in the water, the diaphragm which transmitted
  the parallel rays was shifted over different parts of the lens within
  a small com pass ; but the focus appeared to undergo no alteration
 thereby.
     15. Assuming that the aqueous and vitreous humours have
 in the ox-eye the same refractive indices as in the human eye,
 calculation gives 1'5066* for the index of refraction of the ox
  eye lens, and the focus for parallel rays entering the cornea is
 found to be 372 millims. from the back of the lens, or exactly
 4millims. more than the measured distance from the back of the
 lens to the retina. The air-focus gives a somewhat higher re
 fractive index, supporting the opinion that the central parts of
 the lens have a higher refractive power, since its focus was almost .
 exclusively of rays which passed direct through the centre, a
 small diaphragm having been used.             These results are not en
 titled to any particular     con<U+FB01>dence.
     16. From what has been stated above, it would appear to fol
 low that all that the retina requires for distinct vision is a cer
 tain amount of illumination on a certain-sized but minute disk
 of its surface,—-and, if so, that the eye is at all times prepared for
 vision at every distance, the size of the pupil determining what
 that distance shall be. To test this, a little frame was con
 structed to carry four diaphragms on the same imaginary axis
 and parallel to each other: to the
 <U+FB01>rst a small piece of sheet-brass was
 af<U+FB01>xed, in which, commanding the
 centres of the        diaphragms, some
small holes were pierced, all within
a space not larger than the pupil,—
the central hole just large enough
for accurate visionLof distant objects ; the others such as are, in
    * “ Dr.Wollaston has ascertained the refraction out of air into the centre
of the recent crystalline of oxen and sheep to be nearly as 143 to 100, into
the crystalline of <U+FB01>sh and into the dried crystalline of sheep as 152 to 100.”

the preceding Tables, numbered 1, 2, 3. The other three dia
phragms having threads stretched across them, were placed at
distances corresponding to the diameters of the holes.                  Bringing
the brass plate up to the pupil of the eye so that all the holes
could be seen through at once, it was satisfactorily determined
that each thread could be seen distinctly at the same moment
with a church at a considerable distance, not by successive <U+FB01>tful
glances, but all steadily and sharply discernible at the self-same
 moment,-—none, besides, seen distinctly (as was subsequently
 ascertained), except through its own hole and at its own parti
 cular distanee*.
      17. It will be gathered from the preceding remarks, that there
 are questions relating to the phenomena of vision open to still
 further investigation—that facts are wanted which can only be
 obtained by most delicate experiments and carefully conducted
 observations. It may, in truth, be said that nothing whatever
 has been done to make us better acquainted than we were half
 a century ago with the refractive densities of the humours,—-one
 value at the present moment being only guessed at, assumed, to
 satisfy previously adopted notionsT.               The law of decrease of the
     *  It follows  as a corollary from this, that in the case of persons with
                eyes, if a horizontal row of some half-dozen holes % millim. in
 sresbyopic
   iameter be pierced in a narrow sheet of brass at distances of 1% to 2 mil
 lims. from each other, and a similar set in the same line for the other eye,
 the lower edge of the little sheet of brass being curved to suit the contour
 of the face, bringing this close up to the eyes, vision at ordinary distance
 is so restored that the experimenter can read with tolerable facility; and
 that this is not due, as might be argued, to excluding all but parallel rays,
 is readily determined by using holes of sizes suited to other distances.
     When the pupil of the presbyopic eye is diminished by inserting beneath
 the lid paper prepared with the Obi bean (Phytostigma venenosa), vision at
 short distance is restored.      The effect does not last long, and is somewhat
 impeded by the lachrymation which accompanies the use of the paper; but
 of the fact there can be no doubt.
     1' “It is not my intention to subject anew to criticism the long series of
  incorrect views on the subject.      I am not writing a history of errors. We
 now know what change the dioptric system undergoes in accommodation;
  and the source of this knowledge alone. can be here sketched in its leading
 features. The change consists in an alteration of form of the lens ; above
  all, its anterior surface becomes more convex and approaches to the cornea.”
 --F. C. Danders, ‘ On Accommodation and Refraction of the Eye,’ Trans
  lation, p. 10.
     “ It was not until after direct proofs
                                                (within reach of every one’s obser
 vation and comprehension) of the change of form of the lens had been
 brought forward by others that Helmholtz placed the able investigation of
  Thomas Young in its proper light.”—Op. cit. p. 11.
     “ The subject is one of importance; for it is only by taking this higher
 index of refraction into account that we get rid of the paradoxical result
 that, in a well-formed eye, parallel incident rays should be brought to a
 focus behind the retina.        The coefficient of refraction is now <U+FB01>xed by Lis
  ting at 1'455.”-—Op. cit. p. 39.

430               Mr. R. Templeton             on the received value       of a,
value of p. from the centre of the lens to the surface is quite un
known*, the form of the caustic of refraction, as it really exists,
quite untraced ; we are hence unable to form the slightest con
jectures in explanation of the diversi<U+FB01>ed forms of the eye in the
lower animals, or of the extraordinary variety in the comparative
distances of the arched surfaces from each other, and that, too,
under circumstances in which no reason can apparently be as—
signed why they should not be as identical in form  i
                                                       and position
as they are similar in function.
   18. The curvatures which generate these surfaces are so nearly
circular arcs, in those portions at least which receive, or through
which pass the rays of light, that the eye, armed with powerful
glasses, can detect no deviation from perfect conformity; yet it
may readily be accepted that they are not so simply curved.
What, then, is their form? and what also are the modi<U+FB01>
cations which the index of refraction undergoes         as we pro
ceed from order to order, and family to family, in the brute
creation ?
   19. We <U+FB01>nd in the human eye'l' the retina comparatively far
distant from the back of the lens, and with a radius of curvature
about half the entire horizontal axis; in the elephant, with a
lens not much differing in form, the retina is half as close again
to the lens, and the radius of curvature considerably greater than
the entire axis.  Is the value of u, then, in this latter case, so
very much greater than in the human eye? or what can be its
law of decrease that will admit of a caustic of refraction of such
unwonted <U+FB02>atness? a <U+FB02>atness with nothing like          as far as           it,     is
known, except in the whale (Balwna Mysticetus), in which like

Fine  concentric lines were traced on aplate of glass at distances of  1 mil
   limetre from each other, beginning with     millims. radius and ending

  younger Soemmering’s work, and the curvatures, when accurately ad
  justed, read off. The distances of the surfaces were likewise read off.
  The numbers so read off were next reduced to common relation of 10
                                                     a

      LIX.   Remarks on the Dynamical Theory of Electricity.
                    By C. BROOKE, M.A., F.R.S.
     To the Editors of  the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.

    GENTLEMEN,                                      Nov. 10, 1866.
     INCE     I sent to you, thrdugh Professor Tyndall, a short
        notice of a fact in thermo-electricity, I have had under
revision my chapter on organic electricity, and have been for
cibly impressed by the harmony existing between obvious de
ductions from the dynamical theory and some recently observed
physiological results.
    The physiological effects of acting causes incidental to the
transmission of a continuous voltaic current through a musculo
motor nerve are of a complex character; they are universally
acknowledged to be manifested only at the moments of closing
and opening the circuit, but are modi<U+FB01>ed by the in<U+FB02>uence of the
current, during its prolonged continuous passage, on the por
tion of nerve-tissue included in the circuit.
    In order to interpret correctly all the observed physiological
effects, it becomes necessary to consider carefully the dynamical
consequences of the passage of a continuous succession of elec
tric waves, here assumed to constitute a voltaic current ; and it
will appear that the physiological results are remarkably in ac
cordance with the dynamical theory of electricity.      The passage
of a voltaic current, then, must comprise three distinct phases :
<U+FB01>rst, the momentary passage of the molecules of the conductor
from a state of rest to a state of motion; secondly, the inde<U+FB01>nite
continuance of molecular motion ; and thirdly, the return of
the moving molecules to a state of rest.
   The <U+FB01>rst phase will be accompanied by a rush, or sudden
impulse of increased potential, in the direction of the current,
because there must be a condensation or accumulation of motion,
in consequence of the inertia of the molecules at rest opposing
the transmission of the wave: this may be termed the initial
current.     During the second phase there will be (supposing the
potential of the current to remain constant for the time) con
tinuous and uniform wave-motion.        During the third phase, the
excitation of motion ceasing, the vis viva of the moving particles
will accumulate motion towards the termination of the conductor,
whence a re<U+FB02>ex motion may be expected to be propagated (as in
the case of a wave travelling from the hand along a stretched
cord, which reaching the <U+FB01>xed end, is re<U+FB02>ected back again),
giving rise to a momentary terminal current, inferior in intensity,
and opposite in direction to the initial current.
   These initial and terminal currents (or impulses, as they might

  434                   Mr. C. Brooke   on the Dynamical
   more appropriately be termed) have long since been recognized
   as the extra-currents 0f Faraday; but their relative direction and
   intensity have been assumed to coincide with those of the induced
   secondary currents, and therefore to be the reverse of what dyna
 imical considerations have suggested; it has,however, been demon
   strated by an experiment of M. Chauveau, that the dynamical view
   is the correct one.      It has been proved by numerous experiments
   that physiological effects are produced, and produced only, by a
   sudden e<U+FB02>iux of electricity from a nerve or muscle into a nega
   tive electrode, whether the active agent be a discharge of Frank
   linic electricity, or either the induced or the extra currents,
   already mentioned.         Starting from this as an admitted fact, the
   experiments of M. Chauveau appeal to the most sensitive of all
   tests of the direction of an electric impulse (using that term as
                                  ”     “
   synonymous with “shock or momentary current”)—a living
   nerve.    He places the electrodes of an electromotor over the op
   posite facial nerves of a horse, and, having duly adjusted the
   strength of the current, he <U+FB01>nds that, on closing the circuit that
   side of the face only is convulsed       (by the initial extra-current)
   the nerve of which lies under the negative electrode, and on
   opening the circuit the contrary side is less strongly convulsed
   (by the terminal extra-current), the nerve of which lies under the
 vpositive electrode.      M. Chauveau also found that with a still fur-
  ther reduced current, convulsion occurred in relation with the
 negative electrode only, the contrary or terminal extra-current
being then too feeble to affect the nerve.            And if several horses
  were similarly included in one circuit, the same results were ob
. served in each of them.
      The same fact has been observed by M. Claude Bernard * in
 ,a prepared frog’s limb in which the vitality of the nerve is
  unimpaired: with a su<U+FB02>iciently reduced current convulsion oc_
  curs on closing the circuit, and only then, whether the current
  be direct or inverse, because the terminal extra-current is then
  inoperative.
      It may here be remarked that the well-known relative direc
  tion and intensity of the initial and terminal secondary or in
  duced currents in a secondary coil are the necessary dynamical
  consequences of the above assumed conditions of the extra
  currents. The initial extra~current will excite a similar im
  pulsive motion in the secondary coil, just as one stretched chord
  will excite another capable of vibrating in unison with it (for
  electro-dynamic induction is probably quite analogous to the re
 ciprocation of sound) 3 and the recoil of this impulse (the initial
 induced current) will be weakened in opposing the continuous

motion induced by the continuous primary current. Again, the
recoil of the impulse induced in the secondary coil by the ter
minal extra-current in the primary (the terminal induced current),
will likewise be in a direction contrary to that of the inducing
impulse, but its potential will remain undiminished, as it is un
opposed by any continuous induction; and it will therefore           '
possess greater force than the initial induced current.
    But it may be asked by those who <U+FB01>nd a dif<U+FB01>culty in dis
possessing their minds of long-established and time-honoured
notions, Is not all this about “inertia” and “ vis viva
                                                             ” and
“impulses” sheer hypothesis?          Not so: the writer has long
since observed and recorded a precisely similar phenomenon (ap
parently an exact analogue of the initial extra-current) in an
unquestioned case of wave-motion—an experiment on the inter
ference of sound-waves, due in common with so many others to
the genius of Prof. Wheatstone.       Let the handle of a vibrating
tuning-fork, held obliquely, rest on the surface of a table: as
long'as it remains at rest, a loud resonance of the table is
audible; but if the tuning-fork be moved parallel to itself along
the surface of the table in any direction, the resonance of the
table immediately ceases, from the perpetual interference of the
vibrations in successive parallel planes with each other.       The
instant the tuning-fork stops, the resonance bursts out again
in a very striking manner. If the tuning-fork be held verti
cally, the planes of vibration coincide, and the resonance is not
interrupted by moving it. It can scarcely be doubted that the
impulsive recommencement of the resonance, after its interrup
tion by interference, is entirely due to the dynamical cause
here assigned to the initial extra-current.
    M. ChauVeau (no doubt correctly) ascribes the physiological
 effect of an electric impulse to the dynamical molecular disturb
 ance which it produces.
     It will naturally be asked if electricity be only wave-motion,
 what is the nature of that motion, and in what respects does it
 differ from the wave-motion of light and heat? It is evident
 that the existence of two opposite electrical states must involve
 some kind of polarity 0r directionality in the motion, not re
 quired to explain the phenomena of light and heat.       The pro-_
 bable dependence of magnetism on the circulation of electricity
 round the molecules of the magnet would seem to suggest the
 idea of circular waves,- and if these be supposed analogous to
 the waves of circularly polarized light, the phenomena           of
 electric polarity may be readily explained.     Moreover the state
 of mutual inductive constraint of the electricity of two opposed
 and oppositely electri<U+FB01>ed surfaces may be roughly symbolized by
 the condition of two spiral springs, mutually compressing each
 other against an intervening obstacle.

   But even without this check the false equations may be put
to the question and made severally to disclose their character
as such by applying any one of them to the limiting case of a
triangle on a sphere continuing of <U+FB01>nite radius, but in which the
angles become respectively 180°, 0, O, and consequently the side
opposite the <U+FB01>rst equal or capable of being equal to the sum of
the other tvvo.  Thus writing in the <U+FB01>rst and third of the last
written formulae C=lSO°, 13:0, A=O, we ought to be able to
derive c=a+b, but <U+FB01>nd instead         a=bic in the <U+FB01>rst, and
a=b + c in the third. And similarly in the second and fourth,

     —b+ c, or a+b+c= 360° in the fourth. We might easily
deduce other detective criteria from the reciprocal limiting case
of a spherical triangle in which one side is zero and the two
others each 180°, in which case the angle opposite the <U+FB01>rst aug
mented by 1800 will equal the sum of the other two. Further
more, using accents, as before, to denote polar reciprocation, the
false system takes the form

LXI.       On the Sources of      the  Fat of the Animal Body. By J. 13..
     Lawns, F.R.S., F.C.S.,           and   J. H. GILBERT, Ph.D., F.R.S.,
     F. C.S.*
         1842, Baron Liebig'i' maintained that the fat of Herbivora
IN must be derived           in great part from the carbo-hydrates of their          .
food, but considered that it might also be produced from nitro
genous compounds.               MM. Dumas and Boussingault              I   at <U+FB01>rst
called in question this view; but subsequently the experiments
of Dumas and Milne-Edwards§ with bees, of PersozH with geese,
of Boussingault<U+FB01>i with pigs and ducks, and of ourselves with
pigs**, were held to be quite con<U+FB01>rmatory of Liebig’s view, at
any rate so far as the formation of fat in the animal body from
carbo-hydrates was concerned.
     In 1864, however, at the Bath Meeting of the' British Asso
ciation for the Advancement of Science, Dr. Hayden, of Dublin,
read a paper before the Physiological Section, in which, basing
his conclusions upon certain physiological considerations of a
purely qualitative kind, he argued that fat was not producible
in the body from sugar and allied substances, but that both
eventually served for the production of carbonic acid and water;
 and sugar being the most readily oxidized, so saved the com
bustion, and favoured the storing of fat.
     Again, in August 1865, at a Meeting of the Congress of
 Agricultural Chemists, held in Munich (at which one of the
authors was present), Professor Voit'H', from the results of ex
periments with dogs fed on <U+FB02>esh, maintained that fat must have
been produced from the nitrogenous constituents of the food,
 and that these were probably the chief if not the only source of
 the fat, even of Herbivora.            In favour of the probability of this
view, Professor Voit refers to the formation of adipocere from
nitrogenous substance; but he mainly relies upon the fact that,
 in experiments by Pettenkofer and himself in which large quan
 tities of <U+FB02>esh were given to a dog, the whole of the nitrogen re

 appeared in the form of urea and in the faeces, whilst only
 portion of the carbon was recovered             in  the  urine,  faeces,  and  the
 products of respiration and perspiration, from which it was con—
 cluded that some had been retained in the body, and had con

440      Mr.   J. B. Lawes and Dr. Gilbert on the Sources
tributed to the formation of fat.       That animals nevertheless do
not become fat when fed upon very highly nitrogenous food,
Voit considers suf<U+FB01>ciently explained by the greater number of
blood-corpuscles, the result of such diet, and the greatly increased
activity of oxidation of nitrogenous substance under such con
ditions ; whilst, on the other hand, the accumulation of fat when
fat and carbo-hydrates are supplemented to a liberal nitrogenous
diet he considers to be connected with the much less active
oxidation of the nitrogenous substance and fatty matter that then
takes place, rather than attributable to the direct production of
fat from the carbo-hydrates.
    In the discussion which followed the reading of Professor
Voit’s paper, Baron Liebig forcibly called in question Professor
Voit’s conclusions, maintaining not only that it was inadmis
sible to form conclusions on such a point in regard to Herbivora
from the results of experiments made with Carnivora, but also
that direct quantitative results obtained with herbivorous animals
had afforded apparently conclusive evidence in favour of the
opposite view.
    Since the Munich Meeting, Hermann von Liebig, son of
Baron Liebig, has written a paper on the subject*, in which,
admitting the probability that fat may be formed from nitro
genous substance, he nevertheless concludes that this is neither
its only, nor even its chief source, in the ordinary feeding of
 Herbivora.
    After referring to the leanness of the South Russian shepherds,
 who consume very large quantities of dried meat, and to the
rotundity of the peasantry, especially the women, in districts
 where bread and fruits constitute the chief articles of food, H.
 von Liebig proceeds to illustrate the formation of fat from non
nitrogenous constituents of food by our domestic Herbivora, by
 the calculation of the results of numerous experiments made
 with cows in 1857, by Knop, Arendt, and Behr, in which the
 details as to food, live-weight, and quantity and composition of
 milk, were accurately recorded.       According to the mode of cal
 culation adopted, it appeared that, after deducting from the
 amount of nitrogenous substance taken in the food that estimated
 to be required by the system for other purposes, there was
 generally little or none remaining for the production of fat. In
 his calculations, however, H. von Liebig, besides taking into
 account the probable amount of nitrogenous substance stored up
 in increase with gain of weight, or set at liberty when there was
 less of weight, as the case might be, deducted from the amount
 of nitrogenous substance given in the food, not only that re
 quired for the production of the caseine of the milk, but also
             *

the whole of that estimated to be required for the mere suste
nance of the animal (according to its weight) independently of
gain or loss, or milk produced.
     It is obvious, however, as pointed out by Voit, and as after
wards admitted by H. von Liebig, that if nitrogenous substance
may break up into urea and fat (with other products), the amount
estimated to be required for the mere sustenance of the body
should not be considered inadmissible for the formation of fat
as one of its products, and therefore should not be deducted
 (with that appropriated for the production of increase and of the
 caseine of the milk) from the amount supplied in the food in
 estimating whether or not it provided suf<U+FB01>cient for the formation
 of the fat known or calculated to be produced.
     H. von Liebig states that he selected experiments with cows as
 the basis of his illustrations, considering that, when in a normal
 state, the change in the solid substanceof the body of the animal
 was comparatively small, if not indeed immaterial, and that the
 <U+FB01>xed products of the food, beyond what might be required for
 the mere maintenance of the body, were accumulated and easily
 estimated in the milk collected; whilst he considered, on the
 other hand, that the point in question could not be settled by
 reference to results relating to fattening animals, without the aid
 of an apparatus for the determination of theproducts of respiration
 and perspiration.     We believe, however, that with a proper selec
 tion of fattening animals it may be satisfactorily illustrated
 without the aid of any such apparatus ; and it is the object of
 this paper brie<U+FB02>y to discuss the question of the sources of the
 fat of the animal body by reference to the results of experiments
 with such animals.
      As already intimated, the objections of Dr. Hayden to the
  supposition that fat is formed from the carbo-hydrates of the food,
  were based upon physiological considerations of a qualitative, but
  not at all of a quantitative kind.    Voit’s argument was, on the
  other hand, founded upon strictly quantitative results, obtained,
  however, under conditions as to choice of animal and of food, in
  which the formation of fat, if it took place at all, must of ne
  cessity be attributed to the nitrogenous constituents consumed.
  H. von Liebig also relied upon quantitative results as the basis of
  his illustrations; but those selected, when properly considered,
  afforded, to say the most, only negative evidence on the point.
      The question arises—Vilhat description of animal is the most
  likely to yield the most direct and conclusive evidence as to the
  source of the fat stored up in its body?          Obviously the one
  which is fed more especially with a view to the production of
  fat, which consumes in its most appropriate fattening food a re
   latively large proportion of carbo-hydrates, and which yields a

 442          Mr.   J.  B. Lewes          and     Dr. Gilbert           on the Sources
 large proportion of fat, both in relation to the weight of animal
  within a given time, and to the amount of food consumed.                                         The
  following Table (1.), which'summarizes the results of a great
  many direct experiments of our own *, will show that of the ox,
  the sheep, and the pig—the most important of the animals fed
  and slaughtered as human food—the last pre-eminently supplies
  the required conditions.

Part II. 1859.       In the estimates given “ er 100 live-weight ” and “ er
100 dry substance of food,” it is assumed t Illt the oxen and sheep are Ii e
rally fed on oil-cake, clover-chaff, and roots, and the pigs on barley-meal
alone; with di<U+FB01>'erent foods the results will, of course, be different.

only slowly digestible, or indigestible, cellulose than the sheep,
and the sheep again very much more than the pig.              The usual
food of oxen and sheep, consisting as it does in large proportion
of unripened or imperfectly ripened vegetable matter,            is,
                                                                 in fact,
essentially   crude,  containing  not   only   considerable
                                                 a            amount   of
defectively    elaborated   and probably    unassimilable   nitrogenous
substance, but also     a large proportion of comparatively indiges
tible non-nitrogenous matter.            Accordingly complexity and
great capacity of stomach, and slow progress of the food through
the, organ, are characteristics of the structure and digestive pro 7
cess of the animals.
    Of intestines and contents, on the other hand, the ox has            a
less proportion than the sheep, and the sheep considerably less
than the pig.
    In fact, the relatively very small proportion of stomach and
contents, and relatively very large proportion of intestines and
contents in the pig are very striking.          But when we consider
that his most appropriate fattening food consists of ripened seeds
and highly starchy roots, containing little indigestible woody
 <U+FB01>bre, and their non-nitrogenous constituents almost wholly in
the form of starch, the primary change of which             is known to
take place almost throughout the length of the intestinal canal,
the reason of the relatively small proportion of stomach, and
large proportion of intestines, seems to be at once apparent.
    Passing from   a    consideration of the receptacles and, so to
 speak, <U+FB01>rst laboratories of the food, we will only remark, in refer
 ence to the remaining results given in the upper portion of the
Table, that, of what may be called the further elaborating organs
 of the body, and their <U+FB02>uids—the heart, liver, lungs, blood, &0.
——the proportion, taken in the aggregate,            strikingly similar
                                                      is
 in the three descriptions of animal.
    The second division of the Table shows that, notwithstanding
 its much larger proportion of stomach and contents, the ox con
 sumes, for a    given live-weight within       given time, only about
                                                 a
 three-fourths as much dry substance of food as the sheep, and
 less than half as much as the pig with its very small proportion
 of stomach and contents.       The 0x gives, too, in proportion to      a
 given live-weight within       given time, much less increase than
                                a
 the sheep, and only from one-<U+FB01>fth to one-sixth as much as the pig.
    Reckoned in proportion to         given amount of dry substance
                                       a
 of food consumed, the ox gives less both of total dry substance
 in increase, and of fat in increase, than the sheep, and only
 about one-third as much of either as the pig, whilst the ox voids
 of dry substance in faeces and urine the largest proportion, the
 sheep somewhat less, and the pig little more than half as much
 as the sheep, and less than half as much as the ox.

    444,      Mr.   J.   B. Lawes and Dr. Gilbert on              the Sources
         Lastly, the proportion of fat, whether reckoned in relation to
    .the total weight of the body, or to the weight of the increase
      whilst fattening, is greater in the sheep than in lthe ox, and
      greater still in the pig.
         W'hilst referring to the connexion between the weight and
      capacity of the stomach and the character of the food, it will not
      be withdut interest to call attention to the gradation in the pro
      portion from the ox to the sheep, from the sheep to the pig, and
      from the pig to man.      Below is given the approximate average
      proportion   of stomach,  by weight, in 100 live-weight of each.
                           Oxen.     l Sheep.        Pigs.     Man.
                              3-19      2-44             088   0'38
       Without assuming that relative weight represents with nume
    rical exactitude relative capacity or size, we nevertheless cannot
    doubt that these <U+FB01>gures have a very obvious signi<U+FB01>cance. Thus,
.   the 0x consumes the largest proportion of di<U+FB02>icultly digestible
    or indigestible woody-<U+FB01>bre, the sheep less, the pig scarcely any,
    but a much larger proportion of comparatively easily digest
    ible starch, whilst man, within certain limits, the better he is
    fed the less does the non-nitrogenous portion of his food consist
    of starch, and the more of the much more highly concentrated
    alimentary substance fat, produced for him from much less con
    centrated vegetable food-materials by the animals which he feeds
    for his own consumption.
        From the facts which have been brie<U+FB02>y stated, it will be obvious
    that, of the most important animals which we feed for human
    food, the pig offers many advantages as a subject for the consi
    deration of the source in the food of the fat which he yields.
    Thus, for a given live-weight he comprises a comparatively small
    proportion of alimentary organs and contents, and he consumes
    a large proportion of food, and yields a large proportion both of
    total increase and of fat, within a given time; his food                 as is,
    such,  of a   high character, yielding, compared       with that  of  oxen
    or sheep, for given weight of
                    a                       much more total increase, much
                                                it
    more fat, and much less excreted and necessarily etfete matter                    ,
    whilst his proportion of fat         the greatest, both in
                                         is                        given live
                                                                        a
    weight    and   in   his  increase  whilst  fattening.   It  results  that
    changes    in his  live-weight   are in    much  less
                                                     a    degree likely  to be
    in<U+FB02>uenced     by  variation in the amount of the contents of the
    stomach and intestines, and are therefore             much more direct
    indications of real increase of the substance of the body, and
    hence that there     is  much less probable range of error in calcu
    lating the amount and composition of the increase in live-weight
    in relation to the amount and composition of the food consumed.

                    V of the Fat of  the Animal Body.                  445
In    fact, from the very opposite characters of the ruminant in
these respects, it is very much less appropriate for the purpose
of estimating the sources in its food of the fat of its body. It
is true that there is the advantage with the cow, that that im
portant product of the food—the milk—is collected externally
to the body, and hence its amount and composition can be easily
 determined; but the changes of weight of the animal itself,
though comparatively small, are due to a greater variety of cir
 cumstances,      and can, therefore, with less of certainty be properly
 interpreted than even in the case of either the 0x or the sheep.
 Indeed, when experiments are conducted with cows or oxen, or
 even with sheep, for periods of a few weeks only, the variation
 in live-weight may in very great proportion be due to variation
 in   the contents    of the alimentary organs merely.
      The selection and calculation of results brought to view in
 Table II.‘ will show that, when experiments are conducted with
 pigs fed on good fattening food for periods of not less than
 eight or ten weeks, the amounts both of total increase and of
 fat stored up are so great in proportion both to the original
  weight of the animal and to the food consumed, that the data
  so obtained may be safely relied upon as a means of estimating,
  with su<U+FB01>icient accuracy for the purposes of the present discus
  sion, from what constituent or constituents of the food the fat
                                           ‘
  of the animals has been derived.
      Experiment 1 .—In this experiment two pigs of the same litter,
  of equal weight, and, as far as could be judged, of similar charac
  ter, were selected.       One was killed at once, and the amount of
  total dry or solid matter, nitrogenous substance, fat, and mi
  neral'matter, in its body, determined.          The other was then fed
  for a period of ten weeks on a good mixed food, containing,
  however, a more than usually high proportion of nitrogenous
  substance.       It was then weighed and killed, and its composi
  tion was determined as in the case of the other animal. The
  results so obtained supplied an important portion of the data
   requisite for the calculation of the composition of the increase
   in the other cases *. The food consisted of a mixture of bean
  nieal, lentil-meal, and bran, each one part, and barley-meal
   three parts, given ad libitum.

       Experiments 2 & 3.—-In both these experiments the pro
   portion of nitrogenous substance in the food was very large;
   the relation of non-nitrogenous to one of nitrogenous substance
   being in Exp.2 little more than half, and in Exp. 3 little more than
  one-third as much as is usual in the recognized good fattening
   food of the animal.       In Exp. 2 the food consisted of bran,
   bean and lentil-meal, and Indian-meal, each given separately,
'
   and ad libitum ; and in Exp. 3 of an equal mixture of bean and
   lentil-meal only, given ad libitum.
   :fExperiments 4 86 5.-—In Exp. 4 the food consisted of In
   dian meal only, and in Exp. 5 of barley-meal only, in each case
   given ad libitum.   Barley-meal is undoubtedly the most approved
   staple fattening food of the pig; and the result was, that in
   both these experiments the proportion of non-nitrogenous to
  nitrogenous substance in the food was very nearly, though
  rather higher than, the average in that which is recognized as
  the most appropriate fattening food of the animal.
      Experiments 6, 7, 8, & 9.—The peculiarity of this series
   was, that the food contained less ready-formed fat than was the
   case in either of the other experiments, and that a large pro
  portion of the non-nitrogenous substance supplied was in the
  form of either pure starch, pure sugar, or both. In Exps. 6,
   7 8t 8, a <U+FB01>xed quantity of lentil-meal and bran (averaging
  nearly 3% lbs. lentil-meal and about 9 ounces bran) was given
  per head per day, and, in addition, in Exp. 6 sugar, in Exp. 7
  starch, and in Exp. 8 sugar and starch, each separately, ad
  libitum.    In Exp. 9 lentil-meal, bran, sugar, and starch were
  each given separately, ad libitum.
      The <U+FB01>gures given in the Table show that the increase in
  weight was in no case less than 50, and in several nearly, and
  in one more than 100 per cent., upon the original weight of
  the animals, the amounts ranging from 51'?) to 689 per cent.
  when the experiment       extended over eight, and from 85'4: to
  1068     per cent. when it extended over ten weeks.
      The determined or estimated amount of fat stored up in the
  increase was also in all cases very large, amounting to 63 per
  cent. of the total increase in Exp. 1, in which it was experi
  mentally determined, and calculated to be even more than this
  in several of the other cases. The tendency to error in the cal
  culations would, however, be to give the proportion too low in
  Exps. 6, 7, 8 & 9, which were conducted over a period of
  ten weeks, and in which the proportion of increase upon the
  original weight was very high, and to give it too high in Exps.
  2, 3, 4 8: 5, conducted only over eight weeks, but more espe
  cially in Exps. 2 8t 4, in which the proportion of increase
  upon the original weight was comparatively small.          The rang

                                                             however,
   not such as in any degree to throw doubt upon the validity of
   any conclusions which will be drawn from the indications of
   the <U+FB01>gures as they stand.
      It seen that, of the determined or estimated total fat stored
      is
   up in the increase, the proportion which could possibly have
   been derived from the ready-formed fat of the food, even sup
   posing the whole of that supplied had been assimilated, was so
   small asto   leave. no doubt whatever that     very large propor
                                                     a
  tion of the stored-up fat must have been produced from other
   constituents than the ready-formed fatty matter' of the food.
  According to the <U+FB01>gures given in the Table, the proportion of
  fat which must have been so produced, ranged from about two
  thirds to about eight-ninths of the total amount stored up.
     Assuming    it,then, to be established beyond'doubt that there
  was a   very large formation of fat within the body from other
  constituents than the fatty matter of the food, the questions
  arise, whether this large amount of produced fat could possi
  bly have been derived from the nitrogenous constituents of the
  food? or whether         must of necessity have had its source, in
                            it
  greater  or less  proportion, in the carbo-hydrates at the same
  time supplied?      The results adduced afford conclusive evidence
  on this point also.
     The <U+FB01>gures show that, after deducting from the total amount
  of nitrogenous substance consumed for the production of 100 lbs.
  of increase in live-weight the small amount estimated to be
  stored up in the increase, there remains        very large propor
                                                     a
  tion available, it  may be, for the production of fat with other
 products.
     If we next compare the amount of carbon             in
                                                        the estimated
produced fat with the amount contained in the nitrogenous sub
 stance of the food not stored up as increase, minus that con
 tained in the urea which would be one of the <U+FB01>nal products of
 the breaking up of this nitrogenous substance (or its equiva
 lent given o<U+FB01>'), the result shows in some cases an excess, and in
others a de<U+FB01>ciency, of carbon possibly available from the nitro
 genous constituents of the food, com-pared with that required for
the formation of the fat estimated to be derived from other
constituents than the ready-formed fat in the food.
     Reckoned to the standard of 100 carbon in the estimated
 produced fat,   it     seen, as shown in the two bottom lines of
                       is
the Table, that in Exps.          1,   2   in which the proportion

of non-nitrogenous to nitrogenous substance in the food was
 (especially in Exp.        considerably less than in such food as
                             3)
experience has shown to be the most appropriate in the fatten
ing of the pig—that          to say, in which the nitrogenous sub
                             is

                          of   the   Fat of    the   Animal Body.                    449
  stance was in considerable   excess over the amount and propor
 tion usually supplied—there was, according to the calculation,
 more than suf<U+FB01>cient carbon possibly available from the nitro
 genous substance of the food for the formation of the fat esti
 mated to be produced.
     In Exps. 4     8r.however, in which the relation of the non
                          5,
 nitrogenous to the nitrogenous substance in the food was much
 more nearly that in the usual food of the well-fed fattening pig,
it   is reckoned that there was about 40 per cent. of the carbon
 of the produced fat which could not possibly have been supplied
 from the nitrogenous constituents of the food.
     In the other experiments (Nos.                  9), in which
                                                        6,   '7,   8   8t
 again   the proportion of the non-nitrogenous to the nitrogenous
 constituents of the food was lower than usual (though not so
 much so as in Exps.              3)—in which, in fact, the nitro
                                     1,
                                     2    85
genous constituents were in excess—there was still        consider          a
able proportion of the carbon of the produced fat which the
nitrogenous constituents of the food could not possibly have
supplied.
     It    hardly necessary to point out that, according to the
          is
mode of illustration we have adopted, the <U+FB01>gures show not only
the utmost proportion of the carbon of the stored-up fat which
could possibly have had its source in the nitrogenous substance
of the food, but even notably more than could possibly have
been so derived.      Thus, to say nothing of other considerations,
it  has been assumed for simplicity of illustration, and granted
for the ake of argument, that the whole of the ready-formed
fatty matter of the food contributed to the fat stored up, that
the whole of the nitrogenous substance of the food not stored up
as increase would be perfectly digested and become available for
the purposes of the system, and that in the breaking up of the
nitrogenous substance for the formation of fat no other carbon
compounds than fat and urea would be produced. It               ob              is
vious, however, that these assumptions are in part improbable,
and in part quite inadmissible, and that the tendency of each
of them       to show too large
               is                  proportion of the produced fat
                                               a
to have been possibly derived from the nitrogenous constituents
of the food.
     The amount of fat necessarily derived from other sources
than the nitrogenous constituents of the food must therefore
be greater than our mode of estimate can indicate; and                           it   is
obvious, from the <U+FB01>gures given in the Table, that the less the
excess of nitrogenous substance in the food, the greater was
the proportion of produced fat which must necessarlly have had
its source in the carbo-hydrates of the food, and that, at any rate
in those cases in which the proportion of non-nitrogenous to

nitrogenous constituents supplied was the more nearly that
occurring in the admittedly most appropriate fattening food of
the animal, the proportion of the fat which must necessarily
have been derived from the carbo-hydrates was very large, even
allowing all that was possible to have been produced from the
nitrogenous substance of the food.
    That, nevertheless, fat may be produced in the animal body
at the expense of nitrogenous substance, in greater or less
degree according -to the character of the animal and of the food,
not only chemical and physiological considerations, but direct
experimental evidence would lead us to conclude.         Indeed we
have, in former papers already referred to, called attention to the
fact that the results of our experiments with fattening animals,
when carefully considered, a<U+FB02>'ord evidence in favour of such a
conclusion. To discuss the point satisfactorily on the present
occasion, by the aid of <U+FB01>gures, would, however, unduly extend
the limits of our paper.
 \
    But, as indicating the bearing of the results referred to, it
may be stated, in passing, that in numerous cases, otherwise
comparable,    but in which the amount and proportion of the
nitrogenous constituents consumed varied very greatly, the
results clearly showed that neither the amount of food con
sumed, nor the amount of increase in live-weight produced,
bore any direct relation to the amount of nitrogenous substance
supplied.    On the other hand, both the amount of food con
sumed and the amount of increase produced bore a very close
relation to the supply of digestible non-nitrogenous consti
tuents, and even a closer relation still to the amount of total
 digestible dry organic substance (that      nitrogenous and non
                                               is,
nitrogenous taken together)      whilst, so far as could be judged
                                    ;
from careful observation, the proportion of nitrogenous to non
nitrogenous substance (fat) in the increase did not vary in any
thing like corresponding degree with the variation in the pro
               a
portion of the nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous constituents in
 the food.   The animals consuming excessive amounts of nitro
 genous substance did, indeed, show         greater tendency to in
                                              a
 crease in frame and <U+FB02>esh; but they nevertheless became fat.
 It would appear that the excess of nitrogenous substance had
 acted vicariously in defect of   greater supply of the non-nitro
                                     a
 genous constituents, contributing material not only to meet the
             exigencies of the animal, but also for the production
reispiratory
0   at.
   The main conclusions in regard to the sources of the fat of the
animal body to which the evidence adduced has led, may be
briefly stated as follows :—                                      -

vora fattened for human food must be derived from other sub
stances than fatty matter in the food.
   2. That when fattening animals are fed upon their most ap
propriate food, much of their stored-up fat must be produced
from the carbo-hydrates it supplies.
   3. That nitrogenous substance may also serve as a source of
fat, more especially when it is in excess and the supply of
available non-nitrogenous constituents is relatively defective.

           Resistance of Iron Bars.  By W. BEETZ*.
WIEDEMANNT
                         and Buff     I
                                     have both expressed opinions as
    to the molecular         actions which occasion a lengthening in
an iron bar when it is magnetized.       From these actions we may
expect   on  the one part a lengthening,  on the other part a short
ening of the bar.     For it may be supposed—
    (1) On the theory of magnetic <U+FB02>uids, that a shortening of
the bar occurs in consequence of the mutual attraction of mole
cules which have become magnetic.
    (2) On Ampére’s theory, that the parallel currents attract
each other, whereby the bars are shortened.
    (3) That the molecular magnets set with their long axis pa
rallel to the axis of the bar, and thus produce a lengthening of
the bar,——a view which De la Rive§ has expressed, and to which
Tyndall" and Bu<U+FB01>' adhere.
    (4) That, by magnetizing, a mechanical pull is exerted on some
parts of the bar, which lengthens             it,
                                           as was observed       Wer      by
theim<U+FB01>l'.
    (5) That the bar was previously twisted or bent, and that
magnetization stretches     it   by
                                 removing this.
    In fact, both lengthening and shortening action have been

452         Prof.   Beetz on the In<U+FB02>uence       of Magnetization
in regard   to the changes which the resistance of an iron wire expe
riences during magnetization. From the <U+FB01>rst two processes, which
are in fact identical, the conclusion must be drawn that the re—
sistance is diminished by magnetization ; for the contact between
the molecules in the direction of the length becomes closer, and
the entire length diminishes; by the third process the contact is
closer indeed, but the bar becomes longer and thinner; thus
there may be either an. increase or a decrease in the resistance,
according as one or the other action predominates.                 The fourth
action must necessarily increase the resistance; in the <U+FB01>fth there
appears no reason why the resistance which it produces should
be altered either in one direction or the other.
    The eXperiments of Wartmann*, MoussonT, and Edlundj;
have not shown any change in resistance during magnetization,
while Thomson§ observed an increase of resistance in the direction
of the magnetic axis, and a diminution in a direction at right angles
thereto. In discussing these discordant results, Wiedemannll
has suggested that in many of Thomson’s experiments it was
possible that the attraction of the poles had exerted a purely
mechanical pull on the iron between them, by which it would be
extended in an axial, but drawn together in an equatorial direc
tion ,' and   I must confess that in reference to the other experi
ments of the same observer 1 had from the <U+FB01>rst a suspicion that
the alteration in resistance is an entirely secondary phenomenon,
produced by the alteration in the length of the bars.                It is true
that the increase in resistance which Thomson observed is so
considerable that it cannot be directly explained on Ohm’s law
from that alteration in length, not even if we remember that
such an alteration in length must be accompanied by a diminu
tion of the section if the volume remains constant; and neither
Joule nor Wertheim nor Buff has been able to show that there is
any change in volume.          Yet Mousson’s experiments, in which
wires were stretched by weights, showed such an unlooked-for
increase in resistance, that its chief reason must be sought in the
removal of the molecules from each other.              Experiments which        I
have made on the alteration in length and in resistance have
shown that my supposition was not correct.
    The bars whose lengths were to be measured were fastened at
one end in a horizontal position, and were supported in several
places by easily moveable rollers.           From the free end of the bar
a string passed which was coiled round a vertical steel axis, then
Passed over a pulley, and was stretched by a weight.                    On the

 steel axis was a plane mirror, in which the image of a scale could
 be read off by means of a telescope and cross wires.                   The mag
 netizing spirals   were   those   belonging     to   alarge    Kleiner’s  electro
 magnet—two       of  53   millims.,    two  of   75    millims.    diameter,    and
 each 23 cubic centims. in length.            In case no other <U+FB01>xing was
 required, they   were    so arranged     that  the two outside spirals (the
 narrow ones) were flush with the endsof the bar, while the two
 inner ones (the wider) were at equal distances from each other
 and from the outer ones.          The scale was so divided that one di
 vision corresponded to 1270 millim., while the distance of the
 scale from the steel axis was 3220 millims.                   Hence a displace
 ment of one division of the scale corresponded to an angle of
 rotation of the mirror of 40” '71.          The radius of the steel axis,
 calculated from the weight and speci<U+FB01>c gravity of thewire and from
its length, =O-44072 millim. ; so that a motion-over one division
 corresponded to an increase in length of the bar of 0'00008698
 millim.     The magnetizing current was each time arranged in
 such a manner that very nearly the maximum magnetizing effect
was obtained.        The numbers given below for the elongations
 are the means of at least six observations in each case, which
 always agreed very closely with each other.
    From the length and width of my spirals, it might have been ex
 pected that small motions of the bars out of the axis of the spirals
 would have but little in<U+FB02>uence on the apparent change in length,
 which occurred in consequence of the tendency of the bar to go
 to the axis of the spiral. In order to settle this point              I  observed
 these changes, first when the bar was centred as completely as
possible, then when all the spirals were placed obliquely, again
when the bar almost touched their inner coils, and <U+FB01>nally when
it was again well centred.           The bar was a cylinder 1242 mil
lims. in length and 12 millims. in thickness.

   In all these measurements                the stretching was effected by a
weight   of 1   kilog.     N0.  6  was      a  four-edged steel- bar, which indi.

found by Joule, Wertheim, and Buff consists doubtless in the fact
that my iron bars were not specially heated and slowly cooled. As
the object of these experiments was only to test the applicability of
my method, and not to determine the absolute values of the angles
of rotation with greater accuracy than had been done previously,                       I
have made no further measurements in this direction; but                        I tried,
by various pesitions of the magnetizing spirals, to decide which
of the above processes are most favourable for stretching. For
this purpose the stretchings were observed when the four spirals
were spread, as above, over the whole bar, when, two being stuck
in each other, all four were placed in the middle, all four on the
<U+FB01>xed end, and all four' on the free end, each two on each end of
the bar, and, lastly, two on the middle and two on one end.
Besides this, the temporary magnetism of the bar was determined
while the spirals occupied the above position.                         The bar was in
an east-to-west direction, at a distance of et metres from the mag
netometer.       In the numbers given for the temporary magnetism,
the displacements due to the spirals alone, and those due to re
manent magnetism, have been already deducted.                               During the
whole range of the experiments the current was kept at a con-
stant strength.

     These numbers show distinctly how considerable is the part
which the mechanical pull exerts in the extension of the bars.                                       In
the position c the extension is much greater than in a, although
the momentum of the bar is less.                         In 9 the extension is almost
the same as in a, although the momentum is a third less.
the extension is inconsiderable, although the momentum is
                                                                                                 In   f
greater than in g. Bu<U+FB01>' has also called attention to the coope
ration of this mechanical pull.
     If, then, it has not only been shown that magnetizing lengthens
the bars, but also that that lengthening more especially comes
into play which tends to remove the molecules apart, it seems as
if the increase in resistance observed by Thomson might be very
easily explained. But the experiments with stretched wires do
not agree with this. For these, the arrangement formerly used
was applied without any change.                          The wires were surrounded
by a tube through which a current of water passed.                                      I obtained

was coiled about the axis of the mirror and supported the stretch

4207 millims. so that displacement on the scale amounting to

   The annealed wire 11 had already exceeded the maximum of
contraction at a tension of 100 grms.           It is possible that it still
contained small bendings, which could only be removed by greater
tensions; yet these bendings must always have occurred again
with smaller tensions, for the order of succession of the experi~
ments had no in<U+FB02>uence on the results.             On the other hand, in
the case of wire No. 10 it is Very distinctly seen how the mag
netization always e<U+FB02>'ects greater contractions             with increasing
tension, as Joule found to be the case.
   The experiments with stretched wires lead de<U+FB01>nitely to the
conclusion that in magnetization there is an approximation of
the molecules ,' and the supposition is obvious that there must be
a decrease of resistance     during this process.         To examine this
point, both the quadrangular pieces of brass through which the
wire was stretched were provided with binding-screws,from which
wires passed to a Siemens’s resistance bridge. The bridge, as in
former experiments*, was connected with a small rheochord, by
which, when the measuring-wires had the ratio 10 :1, a resist_
ance of 00005 could be estimated.           Immediately after the alte
ration in the length of the wire had been measured, its resistance
was determined ; the magnetizing current was then closed, and
the alteration of resistance observed.         Such an alteration always
occurred, and it was found that the resistance of the iron was
always increased by magnetization.            In each wire the increase
of resistance remained the same within the limits of observa
tion, whether the tension was small or large, which could be
recognized from the fact that the scale was always displaced
the same number of divisions. There were no in<U+FB02>uences which

 previous experiments shortened on being magnetized (10, 11,
 15), such as lengthen (12, 13, 14), bundles whose ends were

    Wires 10 and 15 were taken from the same coil, as also were
 wires 11, 13, and 14.               The increase in resistance for the <U+FB01>rst
 amounts on the average to                l  : 3070 (Thomson found 1 : 3000) ;
 for   the second, 1 : 1680.
     I  think these experiments            justify the conclusion that magneti
 zation in all      cases increases the resistance           of iron in the direction
of the magnetic axis. 1 think, further, that 1 can account for the
 process which brings about this increase.                       One consequence of
 magnetization must be an approximation of the molecules.                           If
 the molecular distances in all parts of an iron bar were the same,
 a necessary consequence              of this approximation would be a de
 crease    in   resistance.      But    the molecular distances are not every
  where    the    same;   the   molecules        are rather arranged in groups—
  in a line, for instance, thus :—
 and

the distances between the sets or groups being a little greater in
the latter than in the former line.                       ‘
    In magnetization, the nearest molecules will become still
nearer; and as the entire groups of molecules cannot have an
arbitrary free motion, in some places there will be greater breaks
even when the entire wire is shortened, as in the following scheme :
    The resistance must thereby be increased ; but to what extent,
depends on the nature of the iron.      If the groups of molecules
had free motion, the magnetization would necessarily induce a
decrease in resistance.    And in fact if a glass tube be <U+FB01>lled with
fresh iron <U+FB01>lings and the two ends of a battery placed in the ends,
scarcely any current passes through the <U+FB01>lings.         In an experi~
ment of this kind the current of two Daniell’s cells only de<U+FB02>ected
the mirror of my re<U+FB02>ecting galvanometer         about 45 divisions:
when the tube was magnetized in a spiral, the de<U+FB02>ection increased
to 120; on shaking the tube, to 450; on interrupting the mag
netizing current, it sank to 170; and by a second shaking, to 44.
    The decrease of resistance in the direction at right angles to
the magnetic axis still requires explanation.       The experiments
of Thomson are, indeed, such that a mere mechanical pull
must necessarily he succeeded by such a decrease; but they
prove nothing as to the speci<U+FB01>c action of magnetization.      I folded
a covered wire of 47500 millims. in length and 0'36 millim.
thickness in 332 coils about a rectangular glass plate, and placed
this in a magnetizing spiral. To prevent the excitation of a cur
rent of induction in the iron wire, 160 coils were passed in one,
and 166 in the other direction about the glass plate.        The wire
 interposed in the bridge offered the resistance 99'195 : when the
magnetizing current was closed, there was not the least mo
 tion in the mirror of the galvanometer, although the wire was
now magnetized at right angles to its length.        An alteration of
 00055 in the resistance would have displaced the scale by a
whole division ; hence if for these small values the displacements
 are assumed to be proportional to the alterations in resistance,
 a decrease of resistance in the proportion of 1 : 3000 would have
 effected a displacement of six divisions.     As a displacement of
0'1 division is very distinct, a decrease in the resistance in the
ratio of 1 : 180000 could not have been overlooked; so that          I
think I can fairly draw the conclusion that a decrease of resistance
 in a direction at right angles to the magnetic axis has not been
demonstrated.

  to Professor Cayley, to whom            I had communicated a sketch of
  the theory, and to myself, that the general conclusions contained

  class of operants than those there de<U+FB01>ned; and there can be
  little or no doubt that such is the case for all operants linea

  is most important in this theory                to   be able to distinguish
  between the corpus or root of an operator viewed as a function
  and the operator itself, and to be in possession of a single

_  number of fundamental invariants to a binary quantic of a given degree
   is reduced to a problem in the partition of numbers, it is but justice to
   M. Hermite to state, took its rise in that great analyst’s discovery of the
   octodecimal invariant of the binary quintic. So long as the existence of
   this fourth invariant to that form was unsuspected, it must have remained
   impossible to conjecture the su<U+FB02>iciency of the single partial di<U+FB01>'erential

general terminology     of  the  new algebra,      propose to substituteI
the  name  of Protractor   for Extensor    to signify the operator, so as
to be able to use the word Protractant to signify the corpus.
Also    I
        shall give the analogous names of Pertractant-l- and Per
tractor—the former to the lineo-linear function above referred
to, the latter to this function energized, i. e. converted into an

   We thus obtain           a   series    of pertractants,

may be termed the primitive and prime derivative  pertractants of
the family.
   Again, we may form any algebraical function of the primitive
and its prime derivatives, and such function may be termed                                               a
compound derivative of the family; this in its turn,               the                            by
addition of the symbol of operative power, may be energized

                            2          3
we obtain the prime pertractive derivants of various orders, with
the difference that there are now several of such prime derivants
belonging to each order.            Any function of these gives rise to a
compound-pertractive derivant, the number of which is of course
unlimited ; these may be energized into operators, subject inter se
to all the laws of algebraical operation, and any function of one or
more of such compound-pertractive derivators will be equivalent
to some single derivator belonging to the same family.                     In a
word, the theory may be extended from the case of Monocephalous
to that of Polycephalous pertractive functions and operators and
their derivatives.
    I will conclude for the second time with the statement of an
expansion in a series which, as far as            I have been able to ascer
tain, is new to writers on the differential calculus, to which                I
was led by applying the symbolical equation previously given in
a footnote to the operand a”. The equation in question may be
written as follows:

   The maximum prime in the denominator of the fraction which
expresses ¢,-_1(i) enters always as a simple factor, because, as we
know by M. Bertrand’s theorem, there is always a prime number
included between q+ 1 and 2q+2.         Consequently, supposing
to be 2g or 2q+ 1, since there exists a prime number p greater
than q+ 1, and not greater than 2q+1, this prime number
will appear in the denominator of Sw- with the exponent

       From the above the following conclusion is drawn—namely, that
 just as it may be said that the specific gravity of an alloy is approxi
 mately equal to the mean specific gravities of the component metals,
 so also from the foregoing we may deduce that the volume which an
  alloy will occupy at any temperature between 0° and 100° is approxi
  mately equal to the mean of the volumes of the component metals at
  the same temperature, or, in other words, the cubical or linear COQ<U+FB01>
  cients of expansion by heat of an alloy between 0° and 100° are
  approximately equal to the mean of the cubical or linear coe<U+FB02>icients
 of expansion by heat of the component metals.

       The specimen more particularly described in this paper is a

  may be safely assumed to have exceeded 30 inches in length.                   The
 peculiar form of the bone, and the characters and position of the
 trochanters, leave no doubt of the Dinosaurian af<U+FB01>nities of the rep

 in    the number of the zeros.     I have also preferred keeping the exponents con

To the former of these it possesses the closest af<U+FB01>nity, but differs in
the proportional size and form of its trochanters, and in its much
heavier proportions ; and the author proposes for it the name Ens/ce
losaurus Browni.
   A portion of the distal end of a femur indicating another genus of
large-sized Dinosaurian reptiles was also described, the characters

   The discovery of these remains in the Stormberg rocks was stated
to be by no means decisive of their geological relations, as Dinosau

existed during the Permian ; but it is interesting to observe that the
Stormberg rocks conformably overlie the Karoo beds, which have
yielded the Dicynodonts and so many other remarkable Reptiles and
Labyrinthodonts.
  2. “Additional Notes on the grouping of the rocks of North
Devon and West Somerset."    By          J.
                                     Beete Jukes, Esq., M.A.,
F.R.S., F.G.S.
    Commencing with the country around Wiveliscombe, near which
place Sir H. Dela Beche had indicated an east and west fault of
small extension on the maps of the Geological Survey, Mr. Jukes
described the rocks of the district reaching from that place north-west
to the Brendon Hills, and westwards to Dulverton, including the
valley of the Tone, more to the south.     From Dulverton he examined
the country towards Simonsbath, and then, proceeding to Barnstaple,
made traverses from that place to Challacombe and to Bittadon. Simi
larly, after examining the neighbourhood of Combe Martin, be pro
 ceeded along the north coast in an easterly direction, through
 Countesbury, Porlock, and Dunster, and across the Williton valley
to the Quanto'ck Hills. The observations made during these several
journeys were given in detail by the author; and the principal con
 clusions at which he had arrived in consequence were stated to
be the following :-(1) There are three areas of Old Red Sandstone
in this region, namely, a, The Quantock Hills;         1;,The Porlock,
Minehead, and Dunster area; and c, The Morte Bay and Wivelis
 combe ridge.    (2) Each of these masses of Old Red Sandstone dips
under a great mass of Carboniferous Slate.      (3) The Coal-measures,
 the Carboniferous slate, and the Old Red Sandstone of Devon are
contemporaneous with the Coal-measures, the Carboniferous Lime!
stone, and the old Red Sandstone to the north of the Bristol
 Channel. (4) That    if  the great fault which the author believes to
exist be proved to be absent, his other conclusions will not be
altogether vitiated, for the red rocks of Porlock and Dunster may
then be taken as the top of the true Old Red Sandstone lying under
neath a great thickness of Carboniferous Slate.     111'.
                                                       J  ukes had also
been able to construct  a  geological sketch map of North Devon in

   NOTE ON THE USE OF THE DIFFERENTIAL GALVANOMETER                    IN
       EXPERIMENTS ON RADIANT HEAT. BY M. P. DESAINS.
          sources  of heat    ordinarily used in investigating thermal ra
 THE  diation are never perfectly constant.      Hence special precautions
must be taken to exhibit with certainty the slight actions exerted on
rays from these sources by causes not acting with any great energy.
The di<U+FB02>iculty is usually resolved by repeating a great number of
times pairs of crossed observations—that is, those made alternately
on the direct and on the modi<U+FB01>ed pencil.          This mode has the dis
 advantage of greatly prolonging the duration of the operations.         In
 order to avoid this, which is frequently objectionable, Dela Pro
vostayc and I have used a totally different method, and one which
gives the means of directly calculating the in<U+FB02>uence of variations of
the source.     But this method (Comptes Rendus, vol. xxxviii. p. 440)
presupposes simultaneous observations, and hence the cooperation of
two observers; it is, moreover, ill adapted to lecture-experiments.
 On the other hand, I have found that great certainty can be ra
pidly obtained in the most delicate thermoscopic observations, or
manifestations, by using a kind of differential apparatus consisting
 essentially of a single source of heat, of two thermopiles, of a differ
ential galvanometer, and, lastly, of a rheostat.
   Each pile is connected with one of the two wires of the galvano—
meter, and the rheostat is interposed in one of the circuits.           By
this apparatus the actions of the two currents on the needle can be
equalized, and thus kept at zero of the scale if they are in opposite
directions.
    Once obtained, equilibrium continues in spite of variations in the
source ; but if from any cause whatever the intensity of one of the
radiations alters, the needle quits zero and sets in some other posi
tion. Both piles must be of the same construction if they are to be_
equally rapid in following the action of the heat. The difference in
dicated is <U+FB01>nally the greater the more energetic are each of the cur
rents which traverse the apparatus.
   The <U+FB01>rst phenomenon I have investigated by the method I have
described is that of the absorption of heat by transparent gases.       To
demonstrate in an easy and certain manner the very interesting re
sults obtained by Magnus and Tyndall, I worked in the following
manner :—                                                            ’
   The source of heat is a lamp. The piles are at a distance of about
1'8 metre from the <U+FB02>ame, to the centre of which their axes point,
making with each other a considerable angle.           Between the <U+FB02>ame
and each pile is placed a glass tube, about a metre in length by a.
decimetre in diameter, which can either be exhausted, or in which
the air can be compressed to two or three atmospheres.             Each of
these tubes is closed at the two ends by thick transparent glass
plates ; its axis is in the prolongation of that of the corresponding pile.
   The apparatus being thus arranged, one of the tubes is exhausted,

             Intelligence        and Miscellaneous      Articles.                  477
the other <U+FB01>lled with well-dried coal-gas, the lamp lit, and by means
of the rhe0stat the needle reduced to zero. Equilibrium being set
up, the lamp is masked by means of a semicylindrical screen.    The
tube originally full is exhausted, the other <U+FB01>lled with gas, and the
screen removed, on which the needle begins to move.       The de<U+FB02>ec
tion may easily amount to several degrees, and can be readily seen
in projection.
   The differential method is readilyzapplied to the investigation of the
rotations which the plane of polarization of a ray of heat undergoes
under the action of a substance which has but little activity.       The
polarized ray is divided by a plate of calc-spar whose principal section
makes an angle of 45° with the original plane of polarization.      The
two images have in that case the same intensity ; one falls on the <U+FB01>rst
pile, and the other on the other; and the needle is brought to zero.
If, then, the original plane of polarization is de<U+FB02>ected by a very small
number of degrees (a, for example), a difference is established be
tween two images that were originallyequal to one another and to I,
the measure of which is
 I|:sin2 (45+a.)   ——cos2   (45+a)] =l[4         sin2 45 sin 0! cos   a]=l   sin   20a.
   The corresponding deviation might be still quite appreciable, while
even with a more sensitive galvanometer the effect produced by the
reappearance of the extinguished image would only have led to a
much more feeble result.    I may add that            if,
                                               by means of    compen    a
sating plate or tube, the action of which can be readily estimated,
the differential de<U+FB02>ection whose relative value we have just calcu
lated be made to disappear, we shall thereby obtain the value of the
rotation originally produced.
 I    request permission from the Academy to communicate some at
tempts which    I  have made to transport into the domain of radiant
heat a beautiful optical experiment devised by Biot.
    When ray of rectilinearly polarized light, in which, for instance,
         a
the vibrations are vertical, traverses at right angles to one of its faces
a plate of glass untempered and suitably inclined, there        no special
                                                                       is
e<U+FB01>‘ect. If on emerging from the plate the ray passes through      plate of  a
calc-spar whose section       parallel to the plane of polarization,
                                                                                        is is

totally refracted in the ordinary manner, the extraordinary image
zero; but  if  the plate be then made to vibrate longitudinally, and
if the ray traverse     in the vicinity of
                       it                     nodal point, the extraordi
                                                  a
nary image will reappear and continue as long as the vibratory
motion continues.      I  have found that under these conditions the
calori<U+FB01>c image which       again formed may also be rendered visible.

             ON AQUEOUS VAPOUR         AND SOLAR RADIATION.
             [Extract of a Letter from  M.  Soret to Prof. Tyndall.]
    During the past summer I have made some experiments on solar
 radiation.    The bulb of a thermometer was placed in a. cavity sur
 rounded by ice, in order to prevent any agitation of the air, and to
 preserve the surrounding temperature constant.            The solar rays fell
 directly on the bulb of the thermometer, which was <U+FB01>rst varnished
 and then coated with lampblack.          In two comparative experiments
made within a few days at Geneva and Bologna, the most powerful
radiation was obtained at Geneva, although at Bologna the heavens
 were visibly purer.      The result appears to me to support your views
regarding the aqueous vapour of the air; for the tension of aqueous
vapour at Bologna. was 107, while at Geneva it was only 6'33.               I
have, however, made only one observation, my thermometer having
been broken in returning.        The single fact is not suf<U+FB01>cient to enable
me to draw a certain conclusion.‘

ON THE      INFLUENCE OF THE EARTH’S ROTATION ON THE DEVIA
    TION OF PROJECTILES FROM RIFLED CANNON. BY M. MARTIN
    DE BRETTES.
    The distinguished geometrician Poisson treated this question in
 1837 for the case     of spherical projectiles, and has drawn the follow
ing conclusions :—
    (1) The ranges vary with the azimuths of the plane of <U+FB01>ring, but
between very narrow limits; for the greatest variation would be two
decimetres for a. range of 1800 metres in <U+FB01>ring from a mortar.             It
would be still less in <U+FB01>ring point blank ; so that, practically, the in
<U+FB02>uence of the azimuth of the plane of <U+FB01>re on the ranges is zero.
    (2) The in<U+FB02>uence of the rotation of the earth in our hemisphere
causes a deviation of the projectiles to the right of the plane of <U+FB01>ring,
whatever be its azimuth.           This deviation, whose magnitude is
independent of the azimuth of the plane of <U+FB01>ring, may attain a con
siderable value.      Thus, from Poisson’s calculations, a bomb of 32
centims. {diameter at 4000 metres would deviate 8 metres in our
latitude, owing to the rotation of the earth.
    (3) The deviation increases with the latitude; it is greatest at
the poles, and zero at the equator.                                  -
    The in<U+FB02>uence of the earth’s rotation on the aim of the <U+FB01>rearms
then used was very small relatively to that of the accidental causes
which caused considerable variations in the direction and range from

                             Intelligence       and Miscellaneous Articles.                                                            479
one spot to another.     But these variations being now materially re
duced in the <U+FB01>ring of projectiles by ri<U+FB02>ed cannon, the in<U+FB02>uence of
the rotation of the earth should be taken into account. This is what
I shall show by comparing the deviation due to this motion with the
total deviation given by experiment.
   As the calculation of the deviation due to the rotation of the
earth at any latitude by Poisson’s method is very tedious and there
fore unpractical,               I
                     have used another, which is very expeditious and
is virtually as exact as the preceding, as a comparison of the results
obtained by each will show.
   This method consists simply :—
   ( 1) In calculating the azimuthal angle      described by the plane           0-,
of <U+FB01>ring about the vertical passing through the mouth of the piece,
 during the passage of the projectile.
                                                                          '
   This     performed by M. Foucault’s formula,

in which           a)  the velocity of rotation of the earth about its axis of
                        is
<U+FB01>gure,      it    the latitude of the place of experiment, both known quan
tities.
  (2) In multiplying the range given by experiment by sin 0.
  So that the deviation A due to the rotation of the earth   given                                                               is
by the formula

   The formulae of Poisson and this formula give the following results
for the <U+FB01>ring of mortars of 27 centims. at 1200 metres, and of
                                                                                                               Mi

     Thus the e<U+FB01>'eet of the earth’s rotation contributes half the total
de<U+FB02>ection of the projectile; hence this in<U+FB02>uence cannot be neg
lected.
     This deviating effect of the terrestrial rotation may give applica
tions useful in ballistics.
     Thus :
     (1) When in our hemisphere the effect of the earth’s rotation
amounts to half the deviation of a projectile to the right of the plane
of <U+FB01>ring, if the direction of the ri<U+FB01>ing of the cannon be changed, the
deviating action of the air changes also; the e<U+FB02>'eets of rotation
and of the resistance of the air destroy each other; so that the pro
jectile will fall in the actual direction of the line of <U+FB01>ring, and the
de<U+FB02>ection will be almost zero.
     (2) On passing from one hemisphere to the other, the direction
of the rotation        changes, and consequently that of the deviating                      ac
tion on the projectile.
     It follows that——
     If the  projectile does not deviate in our hemisphere owing to the
equal and contrary effects of the resistance of the air and of the
 earth’s rotation, these effects will be added to one another in the
 other hemisphere, and the projectile will deviate to the left.                         .
     [f the de<U+FB02>ection to the right in our hemisphere were double that
 due to the rotation of the earth, as this would change its sign in the
 opposite hemisphere, the deviating effects of this rotation,~and of
the resistance of the air, would destroy each other, and there would
he no apparent de<U+FB02>ection.
     Thus the in<U+FB02>uence of rotation on the de<U+FB02>ection of projectiles
may become so considerable as to be taken into account, and to re_
ceive useful applications in artillery.——Comptes Rendus, Sept. 1 7, 1866.
which the projectile falls from the trace of the plane of <U+FB01>ring. Projectiles

<U+FB02>ection depends on that of the screws and of the trace of the projectiles.
 It is on the right for the guns used in the French army.

 IN boiling
     treating           temperature
              solutions, it should of         course be assumed that the
steam consists of pure water free from any vestige of the dissolved
substance.   With this condition, if the steam at atmospheric
pressure is observed to be hotter than the boiling-point of pure
water under atmospheric pressure, it must evidently be super
 heated; and in investigating this subject experimentally it is
  essential to ascertain whether this superheat, if it exist, is im
 parted to the steam by the hotter boiling liquid itself, and not by
 conduction or radiation of the walls of the containing vessels.
 At <U+FB01>rst sight this condition appears dif<U+FB01>cult ; even in Regnault’s
 apparatus for graduating thermometers, if the boiling liquid were
 sensibly hotter than pure water boiling under the same pres
 sure, the conduction of heat upwards through the walls of the
 Vessel would communicate      some heat to the steam, though pro
 bably not of appreciable amount if the formation of steam were
 comparatively rapid. In the experiments of Professor MagnusT
 with solutions whose boiling-point was in some cases as high as
 118°, the conduction of heat upwards through the metal of the
 apparatus must have been considerable,        and could not fail to
produce marked effects on the thermometer, both by superheating
the steam by contact and radiation, and by radiation on the ther
mometer itself, if the current of steam were slow.
    Gay-Lussac enounced long ago that the temperature of the
vapoirr of any boiling liquid is the same as the temperature of the
liquid itself at the spot where the vapour is formed ; and Faradayi

482             Mr. J. Gill on the Temperature       the
con<U+FB01>rmed this opinion, which is no doubt correct for simple
liquids in general, and also for solutions as to molecular action
in the phenomena ; that is to say, each particle of‘ steam is
formed in a boiling solution under a tension corresponding to
the tension of the vapour of pure water boiling under pressure
at the same temperature, the di<U+FB01>‘crence between this higher tem
 perature and the common boiling-point of pure water being due
 to the attraction between the particles of the salt and those of
the water.     But it would naturally be supposed that, as soon as
the newly-formed particles of vapour broke through this sphere
of attraction in coalescing to form bubbles, they would at once
expand into steam of a tension corresponding to the pressure of
the general atmosphere under which they existed, and conse
quently would form (under atmospheric pressure) common satu
rated steam at 100°, unless they were superheated by the higher
 temperature of the boiling liquid.
    It seems probable that the smallest visible steam-bubble
formed in the mass of a boiling liquid should be composed of a
vast number of individual vapour particles.       It may be imagined
that the spherical layer of vapour particles forming the shell of
 the bubble in contact with the surrounding liquid is at the real
 temperature of the liquid, and under a tension corresponding to
 that temperature; but the mass of particles forming the body
 of the bubble should apparently be at distances from the liquid
 suf<U+FB01>ciently great to place them beyond the attractive in<U+FB02>uence
 of the dissolved salt; and if so, this small mass of steam may be
 supposed, at the instant of its formation, to assume a density
 and temperature corresponding to the local pressure.         If it re
 mained for some time imbedded in the mass of hotter liquid, it
 might naturally be supposed to become superheated; but the
 manner in which the communication of heat from the liquid to
 the vapour might be effected is not perhaps easy to be imagined,
 nor could the temperature of an individual bubble be practically
 ascertained.    But by surrounding a mass of steam with walls
 kept constantly wet with a <U+FB01>lm of the hot solution, it may be
 placed in circumstances nearly equal to those of a steam-bubble
 in the body of the liquid, and thus its thermic character may be
 more conveniently examined.       With this view I have used the
 simple little apparatus shown by the annexed <U+FB01>gure; and the
 results of some experiments I have made with it are, I think, suf
 <U+FB01>ciently remarkable to claim serious attention.
    The cylindrical vessel a of tin plate, 4 inches in diameter and 7
 inches high, has a moveable inner concentric shell b, open above
 and below, held in place by four slight elastic stays cc, leaving
 a free passage of about 1 inch between its lower edge and the
 bottom of the vessel a.    The position of the moveable cover 11 is

                   Vapours of Boiling Saline Solutions.            483
<U+FB01>xed by the stops 1' ; the
cover is _ conical, so that
any liquid        formed     from
condensed       vapour    on    its
 under surface may trickle
down       into the annular
channel which surrounds
it, and thence be discharged                 f \
 through the small tube 1,
 which also gives exit to the
steam.       Through the necks
f; f' thermometers <U+FB01>xed in
 perforated corks may be in
 serted.
    A saturated solution of
 common salt was prepared
 which was found to boil at
 109°.      The vessel a was
 <U+FB01>lled with this brine to the
 level of the dotted line g,
 andwas caused to boil gently
 by the spirit-lamp m.        The
       f
neck ' being closed with a
 cork, the thermometer 1 was
 inserted in the neck         The
 small conical screen of cork k
 <U+FB01>tting tightly on the stem of
 the thermometer, prevents
 moisture from above from
 trickling down on the bulb,
which it also shields in a degree from radiation in that direction.
 When steam was issuing freely from the small pipe I, the thermo
 meter indicated 1090. The liquid was now drawn o<U+FB01>' slowly by the
 stopcock e into a measure previously adjusted, so that the sur
face of the liquid in a would remain approximately at the level h,
 and thus the thermometer was left in an atmosphere of steam
 with the bulb and the lower part of the stem with its cork screen
 wet with brine.       The double screen 12, with holes not opposite to
 each   other,  shields the thermometer from particles of brine which
 may be     thrown    upwards by the boiling liquid.     The <U+FB02>ame of
 the lamp was now kept steady, so as to cause a constant current
 of steam to issue gently from the tube l. The surfaces of the
 shell 12 above the level of the remaining brine would also have
 been left wet with the same brine.       The upper part of the vessel
 a would now be full of steam under atmospheric pressure.
    Here we have a thermometer suspended in an atmosphere of

steam supposed to be at 100°, according to-Rudberg’s deductions
con<U+FB01>rmed by' Regnault.    According to the experiments of Pro
fessor Magnus*, the temperature of the steam should be about
106°.   The fact shown by the experiment I am describing     that                      is,
the withdrawing of the brine from the thermometer, and the con
sequent circumstance of its being left in an atm0sphere of steam
formed and forming from this brine under atmospheric pressure,
did not cause any marked e<U+FB02>'ect on its indication of temperature,
which remained during some minutes nearly steady at 109°.
The time could not be greatly prolonged, as the salt thrown
down from the evaporating liquid might cause the bottom of the
vessel   to get injured

                                          by            ;
 long enough to show that the thermometer indicated very little
 tendency to lower its temperature; and                 the initial circum

 stances of the experiment could be kept constant, there                 every        is
 probability that the thermometer would remain steady at the
 initial temperature of 109°, although surrounded                   steam at    by
 100°.       It

I)   isthe same as that of the thermometer,           at the moment when
 the boiling brine      run off.is   The sustained temperature of the
 thermometer must be attributed to the direct thermic action of
 the steam       contact, or to radiation, or to both these causes
                   by
 together;         probable, however, that the direct action of the
                  it   is
  current of steam, even with slow boiling, would greatly exceed
 that of radiation; and allowing that the steam might, on leaving
 the liquid, have     temperature of about 106° (as found
                            a                                            Mag          by

  only  obvious  explanation    would    be  to  suppose    the  steam   to  be
 actually superheated to 109°.           This point was decided as fol

  was some risk of the bottom of the vessel            getting injured from

                  Vapours         of Boiling Saline   Solutions.    485
meter (No. 2) was heated in an air-bath to 125°; and the cork '         f
being removed, the thermometer was instantly inserted in its
place.    The thermometer fell rapidly to 100°'5, and then began
to rise slowly; in two minutes it had risen to 102°'5. It was
deduced from this, that the real temperature of the steam was
most probably 100°, and that radiation produced some effect on
the dry thermometer, though apparently tri<U+FB02>ing as compared
with the direct thermic action of the steam.           The effect of
 radiation was also noticed on thermometer      N0.  1, which slowly
fell about half a degree, apparently from the proximity of the
colder dry thermometer No. 2.
    Here we have two thermOmeters in conditions apparently
equal at the moment when the falling temperature of No. 2 had
 reached the point of 109°, or, more correctly, when the tempe
 ratures of the two thermometers exactly coincided, excepting that,
 while N0. 2 is dry, No. 1 is supposed to be wet with saturated
 brine. It must have remained thus wet when the brine in which
 it was at <U+FB01>rst immersed was drawn off to the lower level 12; and
 being then at a temperature corresponding precisely with the
boiling-point of the liquid, surrounded by an atmosphere of sa
 turated steam* continually forming from the same boiling liquid
below, and comparatively isolated from other sources of heat or
cold, it could neither evaporate any of its own surrounding <U+FB01>lm
 of brine, nor yet condense any of the steam in which it was enve
loped.    The surfaces of the walls b would be in the same circum
 stances, and consequently might be supposed to remain wet with
a <U+FB01>lm of brine at 109° as long as the surrounding conditions
remained constant.      It was seen from the <U+FB01>rst experiment that
the thermometer N0. I remained at the constant temperature of
 109° in an atmosphere of steam which the second experiment
proved to be at the temperature of about 100°.          The thermo
meter No. 2 was carefully observed to have a temperature of 118°
at the moment it was <U+FB01>xed in the neck                 f'
                                               of the cover; and it
 not only fell rapidly to 109°, but continued to descend quickly
to near 100°, the fraction of a degree above this point being evi
dently due to the heating effects of radiation acting at the same
time with the cooling in<U+FB02>uence of the steam.      Here thermometer
No. 2 comports itself as the thermometer is supposed universally
to do ; that   is,   equalizes its temperature with that of the me~
                     it it

                             is
clearly that if  the thermometer No.       were now lowered

  its passage), it would take the temperature of 109°, and retain
 it after being again drawn up to its original position in the
  midst of the steam where just before it had shown a temperature
  of 100°. What mysterious virtue can be imagined to exist in the
 <U+FB01>lm of brine coating the thermometer which should, through a
 range of 9° in this case, render it insensible to thermic in<U+FB02>uence
  supposed to be universal? Does the phenomenon depend merely
 on the circumstance of the thermometer being coated with a <U+FB01>lm
 of some liquid in general? Certainly not; for if the thermo
 meter be heated in an oil-bath instead of an air-bath as described,
 and inserted in the neck       f' with the adhering <U+FB01>lm of oil, it shows
 very nearly the same as when dry; and no doubt similar results
 would be obtained with any liquid coating not evaporable in the
 steam, and between which and the steam no chemical action
 takes place.     It was known long ago that the action of the va
 pour of water at 100° on saline solutions, or on crystals of a salt,
 may produce temperatures           higher than 100° ; but it has not
 been supposed that any substance resulting from the combina
 tion of a salt with water should, after the chemical action had
 ceased, continue to retain its higher temperature during an in
 de<U+FB01>nite time in an atmosphere of steam at 100°.          M. Rudor<U+FB01>', a
 pupil   of Magnus,    who  revived   the method of experimenting with
 a hot thermometer on the vapours of solutions, used by Faraday
 more than forty years ago, conceived also the idea of <U+FB01>rst plun
 ging the thermometer into the boiling solution, and after a while
 raising it into the superincumbent steam ; but it appears, from
 the paper of Magnus above referred to, that he could deduce no
 certain results from this method.         Had he maintained his boil
 ing   solutions at  a  constant   degree of saturation, and kept the
 interior surfaces of his apparatus constantly wet with a <U+FB01>lm of
 the hot liquid, he might have been astonished to observe the
 paradoxical phenomenon of a body considerably hotter than 100°
remaining in a steam‘bath at 100° during an inde<U+FB01>nite time
without lowering its temperature.           -
     If the brine communicated heat to the steam (as we might
 suppose from the experiments of Magnus), the steam must be
 come superheated in proportion as the brine is cooled; and if
the masses of brine and of steam in contact (supposing them
isolated from all exterior causes of heating or cooling) were
exactly proportioned to their respective thermic in<U+FB02>uences, it
 might perhaps be imagined, on a super<U+FB01>cial view of the case,
that an equalization of temperature might take place between
them, the brine becoming colder and consequently tending to
condense steam, and the steam becoming superheated and con
sequently resisting the absorbent action of the brine.        But when
the <U+FB01>lm of brine is in permanent contact with an unceasing cur

                Vapours     of Boiling Saline Solutions.             487
rent of steam sweeping over the surface, and continually remo
ving the superheated particles supposed to exist, and replacing
them with particles of fresh saturated steam at 100°, it is evident
that the cooling brine must go on absorbing and condensing
more and more steam until in time it would become so diluted
as not to differ much from pure water; and, as an inevitable
consequence, the temperature      must lower in proportion.    Now
experiment proves that under the conditions mentioned the tem
perature does not lower; consequently we may conclude that no
communication of heat takes place between the brine at 109°,
and the steam at 100°.       There seems to be reason to believe
that similar results, varying in degree, would be obtained with
aqueous solutions of other salts, and with liquids in general when
 their boiling-point is raised by their holding some substance in
 solution,—probably also with any amalgam of mercury boiling
 at a higher temperature than pure mercury. It might also be
 fairly deduced from analogy, that hot aqueous solutions, though
 refusing to communicate heat to colder saturated vapour of water,
 would freely equalize their temperature with a saturated mixture
 of air and steam at 100°, the air alone receiving heat in the pro
 cess directly from the liquid, and communicating heat to the
                                                 '
 steam with which it is mixed.
     It is not easy in these experiments to maintain the requisite
 circumstances suf<U+FB01>ciently constant to obtain very precise results.
 In the apparatus described above, the cooling of the vessel (1 from
 exterior in<U+FB02>uences causes the <U+FB01>lm of brine with which its inner
  surfaces are coated at <U+FB01>rst to absorb and condense steam.       The
 outer surface of the shell I) would radiate heat to the colder walls
  of a ; and the <U+FB01>lms of brine with which it is coated on both sides
  would consequently absorb and condense steam, and so get gra
  dually washed, while the heat conducted upwards through the
  metal from the boiling brine below would then tend to dry the
  surfaces and thus superheat the steam.       In a variation of the
  experiment the bottom of a was enlarged, and a concentric case
  was soldered round  it,  which was kept full of brine maintained
  at the boiling temperature     by
                                  the lamp below     ;but   was per
                                                           it
  ceived that the slight hydrostatic pressure of the column of liquid
  was su<U+FB01>icient to make the boiling-point of this mass of brine
  higher than that of the brine boiling at h; and hence superheat
  ing of the steam would result directly from the drying of the
  inner surfaces of a. If the experiments are made as described
  in the preceding pages, the <U+FB01>rst trial generally shows         rapid
                                                                     a

  temperature the second time.     The brine should be removed each

  and the vessel <U+FB01>lled afresh for the next experiment.                 For more
  accurate investigation      the  <U+FB01>lm  of brine   on  the  surfaces    might be
  continually renewed by        mechanical   circulation   from    the   mass of
  boiling liquid below,      and  the  accumulation     of salt   might be fre

  by the lamp, by means of a wire passing through a cork or small
  stuf<U+FB01>ng-box or a bit of vulcanized rubber pipe.
     Before going further into this curious subject I should wish
 to see my simple experiments repeated by abler hands, with such
 ampli<U+FB01>cation as will naturally suggest itself to the intelligent
 physicist.      My own investigation of the subject has been in a
 manner guided by a train of reasoning ‘which would be out of
 place here, pointing to results of wide and varied interest; but
 I  imagine that the actual phenomena so far described should
 interest the experimental philosopher, at' least' as curiosities of

        GENTLEMEN,                                      September    28, 1866.
             augmentation of magnitude of the sun and moon at the
 THE    horizon has in all ages attracted the attention of philosophers,
and     received   various conjectural explanations, two of which,
ingenious but eminently unsatisfactory, have survived into the
present century; but          I am aware of none which have not re
ferred the phenomenon to causes extern to the eye of the ob
server, to physical rather than psychological agency.                    On the
last day      of February, while walking         in  the   church    avenue    .of
this Institution,     I  noticed the sun rising in <U+FB01>ery splendour be
hind some rather distant trees, and was struck with the distinct
ness with which the branches of these trees, and with which
objects in the horizon right and left, were seen—a peculiar state
of the atmosphere, always present on these occasions of aug
mented disk, favouring this acuteness of vision.                It occurred to
me at the moment, that my pupil must be dilated to very distant
vision; and      I observed that the light from the sun was so sub
dued as to interfere in no way, whether as regarded its own disk
or surrounding objects, with this condition of the iris: it also
came to my recollection that, at all times when the phenomenon

                the Disk   of  the   Sun near  the Horizon.         489
is   observed, the sun and moon are determinately red or red
dish orange.      It next <U+FB02>ashed across my mind that I had some
where read that Fraunhofer on one occasion had remarked, while
engaged in examining the spectrum from end to end, that the
focal distance of the telescope required to be shortened to a far
greater extent than could be accounted for by the refrangibili
ties. Could then the eye itself be thus singularly affected?
 It appeared to me there were present two unquestionable facts
——a dilated condition of the pupil, and a striking predominance
 of red rays. Were these conjoined in the production of the
 phenomenon? It has long been known that certain peculiarities
attach to the red ray: it possesses an extraordinary quality for
exact de<U+FB01>nition, it penetrate            to vast depths of sea, it can
 be discerned when no other colour can be seen, and a distin
 guished physicist informs me that its long-continued use in phi
losophical investigations produces on the retina an effect border
 ing on amaurosis.      Is it not possible, then, that the eye may be
 affected in certain states of vision in a way that would prepare
us for abnormal results? A consideration of the subject led me<U+FB01>rst
to the remarks contained in Phil. Mag. for December, p. 425 ;
 but having reached so far, no opportunity Occurred for my testing
the conjectures which      I  formed by observing the sun or moon,
 when augmented, through small holes pierced in a metal plate,
 until the 24th inst., when the moon favoured me with a trial.
      I
 As transferred my eye from hole to hole (beginning with the
 largest), the diameter became less and less, and the ruddy hue         ,
 less obvious,  till I reached     a  size (its ordinary size) when the
 holes diminished it no further, the only effect through the smaller
 holes being a diminution of brightness from exclusion of more
 and more rays. Trees and other objects glanced at were un
 affected by these holes in their relative distances, being only ren
 dered a little more obscure than when looked at directly.            I
 shortly afterwards examined stars through the holes, and found
 that they lost their spurious disks and became mere points, re
 markably ceasing to twinkle, the residuary effect on the retina
 appearing to be due to intensity of light as contradistinguished
 from quantity of light.        I  am most anxious that these observa
 tions should be repeated: in Ireland it is rare to <U+FB01>nd oppor
 tunities, and shall be glad to <U+FB01>nd in your pages communications
 con<U+FB01>rming or modifying the results I have myself arrived at.
                                            Yours faithfully,
                                                    ROBERT TEMPLETON.
    P.S. While the proof of the above was in my hands, tried      I
various combinations of coloured plate glasses, but could not
succeed in augmenting the disk to more than double size: the

  490              Mr. H. Holt      on a Method     of Calculating
  brightness of the sun was considerably subdued by proximity to
  the horizon.        I  suspect the ray I am in search of is but feebly
  transmitted through glasses so coloured.
        Having communicated the substance of the above letter to my
  friend Professor Stevelly, I received a reply (dated Belfast, No
  vember 29, 1866), from which I extract the following :—-“I am
  myself convinced it is the vera causa, and             I have for more than
                                                           '
  thirty years taught it as my own conviction, both in my optical
  and astronomical lectures.           What led me to it was exactly your
  own mode of observing; viz., I made with a needle a <U+FB01>ne hole in
  a piece of sheet-tin lead, laid on a smooth iron, small enough to
  give me distinct vision of very small print at 1% inch distance;
  this I found brought the setting sun on a very frosty evening to
  its ordinary apparent size.
    .    I
        “ am also convinced that
                                         your opinion as to the cause of the
  twinkling of the <U+FB01>xed          stars is the true one.      You mentioned it
  to me in the year 1828 when             we  were working together, and     I
  have    ever  since   given it  to my   class  as yours.”

               method of undetermined coef<U+FB01>cients, the application of
  THEwhich          to the calculation _of the lunar inequalities was <U+FB01>rst
  suggested by D’Alembert (see his Théorie de la Lune, p. 107), has
'
  been adopted by most writers on the subjects both of the lunar and
   planetary theories.       It is certainly (as D’Alcmbert himself states)
   “ sans
            comparaison la plus courte et la plus facile de toutes, puis
  qu’elle demande ni integration ni aucune adresse de calcul.”              It
  is obvious, however, that, whether the method of undetermined
  coef<U+FB01>cients be employed or not, much of the facility of the com
   putation must depend on the choice of the coordinates and on
  the selection of the di<U+FB01>erential equations on which the calcula
   tion is to be based.       Two different sets of coordinates and equa
   tions have been used for this purpose.              In one, the coordinates
  employed are the true values of the moon’s longitude, the reci
      rocal of her curtate radius, and the tangent of her latitude;
   and the differential equations are functions of these coordinates,
   the forces P, T, and S, and the time t.           In the other, the coordi
   nates employed are the mean values of the longitude, radius vec
   tor, and latitude; and the differential equations are functions of
   these mean values, the time t, and the disturbance-function R.
  The latter is the method usually adopted in the planetary theory;
   but it has been applied also to the computation of the lunar in

deavour in some degree to supply such a mode is the object of

avoiding the process of integration.

   The coef<U+FB01>cient of the annual equation thus found         not so                                    is
near the true value as that of the variation found in the last
article. It will be seen hereafter that the coef<U+FB01>cient of sin cat
receives some considerable corrections in the third approximation.
                                       Second Approximation.
   6. We have now calculated the approximate values of the two
chief inequalities of the moon’s motion (the variation and the
annual equation), which are independent of the excentricity of
the orbit and its inclination to the ecliptic.    to these two                           If
inequalities we add the principal term of the equation depend
ing on ,the excentricity (which has for its argument the
moon’s mean anomaly, and the coef<U+FB01>cients of which must be
found       by   observation),               the values            of   p   and     a   will    be    of these
forms,

cat denoting the moon’s mean anomaly, and F3, G3 being the
coc<U+FB02>‘icicnts of the principal terms in the equation of the moon’s
centre.
      7.   If
          these values of and     be substituted in the differential
                                           p        v
equations (7) and (8), there will arise   series of terms expound   a

                               the Coef<U+FB01>cients                   of   the    Lunar      Inequalities.                     497

of which will   be functions of the products of each pair of the
coef<U+FB01>cients Fl, GI, F9, G9, F3. Ga, and k.
   Referring to the above values of p and o, it will be seen that
the form of each of the inequalities of p is F, cos cit; and that of
the inequalities of v is G; sin clt ; or                                         if   we employ the characterZ

    Four of the above coef<U+FB01>cients differ considerably from their
values found by observation: it will be found that they receive
corrections when the approximation is extended to terms of the
fourth order.
    The facility of the method of computation above given can be
appreciated only by those who have actually gone through the
investigation according to the usual methods.           I purpose, in
a future paper, to carry the approximation as far as terms of the
third and fourth order, and to remark on one or two points
connected with the method which require elucidation.
LXIX.      On the Absorption and Dialytie     Separation of Gases   by

          PART  II.—Action of Metallic     Septa at a red heat.
                                Platinum.
           surprising passage of gases through the homogeneous
'r'rHEsubstance     of a plate of fused platinum or of iron at a red
heat, lately discovered by MM. H. St.-Claire Deville and Tr00st,
may possibly prove to be analogous in its mode of occurrence to the
passage of gases through the rubber septum.          At the same time
it must be admitted that such an hypothesis as that of liquefac
tion can only be applied in a general and somewhat vague man
ner to bodies so elastic and volatile at an elevated temperature as
the gases generally must be, and hydrogen in particular.         Still
some degree of absorbing and liquefying power can scarcely be
denied to a soft or liquid substance, in whatever circumstances
it may be found, with such a patent fact before us as the reten
tion by fused silver of 18 or 20 volumes of oxygen at a red heat.
 It may safely be assumed that the tendency of gases to liquefac
tion, however much abated by temperature, is too essential a
property of matter to be ever entirely obliterated.
    A little consideration also shows that the absorption of gas by
a liquid or by a colloid substance is not a purely physical effect.
The absorption appears to require some relation in composition
—as where both the gas and the liquid are hydrocarbons, and
the af<U+FB01>nity or attraction of solution can come into play.       May a
 similar analogy be looked for of hydrogen to liquid or colloid
 bodies of the metallic class?
    With reference to the mechanical pores of a solid mass, liquids
are probably more penetrating than gases.           The former show
 often a power of adhesion to solids, while gases appear to be es

  504             Mr. T. Graham    on the Absorption and
   sentially repulsive. A degree of minute porosity is conceivable,
  which will admit a liquid, but may be impassable to a gas, even
   under its molecular movement of diffusion.
      Finally, there is presented to us a bold and original conjecture
   by M. Deville, in explanation     of his own observations.       It is
  clearly expressed in the following quotation taken from the last
   publication of M. Deville on this subject :—
      “La perméabilité de la matiere est d’une nature toute dif
  férente clans les corps homogénes, comme le fer et le platine, et
  dans des pates plus on moins discontinues, resserrées par la
  cuisson ou la pression, comme la terre a creuset, la plombagine,
  dont M. Graham s’est servi dans ses mémorables experiences.
  Dans les métaux, 1a porosité résulte de la dilatation que la cha
 'leur fait éprouver aux espaces intermole'culaires ; elle est en rela
  tion avec la forme des molecules que l’on pent toujours supposer
  régulieres, et avec leur alignement qui détermine le clivage ou
  les plans de facile fracture des masses cristallisées.      C’est cet
 intervalle intermoléculaire que le phénoméne de la porosité des
  métaux purs et fondus accuse avec une évidence éclatante, c’est
  aussi par ce phénoméne qu’on peut espérer de calculer la dis
 tance des molecules solides aux temperatures élevées oil les gaz
 peuvent s’y introduire.”                                ,        _
     A new kind of porosity in metals is imagined, of a greater de
 gree of minuteness      than the porosity of graphite and earthen
 ware.      This is an intermolecular porosity due entirely to dilata
 tion. The intermolecular porosity of platinum and iron is not
 suf<U+FB01>cient to admit any passage of gas at low temperatures, but
 is supposed by M. Deville to be developed by the expansive
 agency of heat upon the metals, and to become sensible at the
 temperature of ignition.      Such a species of porosity, if it exists,
 may    well  be  expected to throw  light on the distances of solid
 molecules at elevated temperatures, when gases introduce them
 selves.     The ready passage through platinum of some gases,
 particularly of hydrogen, and the dif<U+FB01>cult passage of others ren
 der such molecular views the more remarkable.
     The passage of hydrogen through the substance of heated pla
 tinum appears in its most simple aspect when the gas is allowed
to make its way through the metal into a vacuous space.             The
experiment of M. Deville, where a tube of platinum charged
with nitrogen is placed within a large porcelain tube charged
with hydrogen*, was modi<U+FB01>ed by placing the platinum tube,
closed at one end, in communication by the other (open) extre
mity with the Sprengel pump, so that a vacuum was substituted
for the nitrogen.      It was then easy to observe that a vacuum in
the platinum tube was preserved for hour when the external
                    * Comptes Rendus, vol. lvii. p. 965.

             Dialytic  Separation  of Cases by Colloid Sepia.       505
  gas admitted into the annular space between the porcelain and
  platinum tubes was either atmospheric air or hydrogen at the
  natural temperature. The tubes being placed across an empty
  furnace, the latter was now lighted; and it was seen that, with
  air circulating outside the platinum, the vacuum remained undis
  turbed, even when the temperature of the tubes rose to a bright
  red heat.    But when dry hydrogen was driVen through the same
  annular space, the platinum, while continuingjmpermeable at all
  temperatures below a dull red heat, began to admit hydrogen to
  the vacuum as soon as the external porcelain tube became visibly
  red-hot.    In seven minutes the Sprengel pump now delivered
  15'47 cub. centims. of gas, of which 1527 cub. centims. ap
  peared, by explosion with oxygen, to be hydrogen.              -
      In a repetition of the last experiment, hydrogen dried by sul- ~
  phuric acid was again allowed to circulate in excess outside the
  platinum;     After a vacuum was once obtained ‘within the plati
  num tube, the gas delivered by the Sprengel pump, in the cold,
  during a period of forty minutes, amounted to no more than av
  bubble of the size of a pin-head, showing the tightness of the
. apparatus.     The Sprengel pump being constantly kept in action,
  the tubes were now heated to redness, and then gradually to a
  temperature approaching a white heat.         The gas delivered each
  fivev minutes was found to be 13, 15'5, 174, 169, 186 cub.
  centims. as the temperature rose. These volumes are referred to
  a temperature     of 20° and barometer of 760 millims.        The last
  observation gives a passage of 372 cub. centims. of hydrogen
  per minute. The platinum tube employed here was joined with
  out solder, having been drawn from a mass of platinum which had
  been aggregated by fusion.       It was similar in this respect to the
  tube employed by M. Deville.          The tube was 0812 metre in
  length (32 inches) and 1'1 millim. in thickness, with an internal
  diameter of 12 millims.       But only a portion of about 200 mil
  lims. (8 inches) of the tube was heated to redness in the fur
  nace experiment.      The inner surface of the heated portion had
  therefore an area of 00076 square metre.           Hence one square
  metre of heated platinum delivered 489'2 cub._centims. of hydro
   gen per minute.      This result admits of comparison with the
   passage of gases through a septum of rubber.         In the most fa
   vourable circumstances,     when the thin membrane of a rubber
   balloon was employed, the passage of air into a vacuum was at
  the rate of 26'5 cub. centims. per square metre in one minute.
  The passage of hydrogen may be taken as 4'8 times as rapid as
  that of atmospheric air, or at 127'2 eub. centims. per minute.
  But while the thickness of the platinum septum was 1'1 millim.,
  that of the rubber <U+FB01>lm was only one-seventieth part of a milli
   metre.    Hence we have the ultimate comparison :—

506           Mr. T. Graham    on the Absorption and
  Passage of hydrogen gas       in one minute through a septum of
1 square  metre,—
   Through rubber 0‘014 millim. in thickness, 127'2 cub. cen
tims. at 20° C.;
   Through platinum 1'1 millim. in thickness, 489'2 cub. cen
tims. at bright red heat.
   1f the permeation of hydrogen is due to the same agency in
both septa, can the vast superiority of the platinum septum be
connected with its greatly higher temperature?
   It was interesting now to turn from hydrogen to the passage
of other gases through heated platinum. The experiments were
all made in the same way, and at a full red heat.       The tempera
ture, it will be observed, was short of that at which the elements
of water and carbonic acid are partially dissociated.
    Oxygen and Nitrogen—Atmospheric          air, which may be taken
to represent both of these gases, was now allowed to <U+FB02>ow through
the annular space between the tubes, the interior platinum tube
 being kept vacuous as usual.        In one hour the gas collected
by the constant action of a Sprengel pump amounted only to 0'3
cub. centim.     Hydrogen in the same time would have given 211
cub. centims.     It is very doubtful, too, whether the tri<U+FB02>ing frac
tion of a centimetre of gas collected had all passed through the
platinum; a part (or the whole of     it)   may have entered  by  the
joints of the apparatus.      Platinum, then, cannot be said to be
sensibly permeable to either oxygen or nitrogen, even at a full
red heat.
    Carbonic acid—This gas was supplied from      a  bottle contain
ing   marble, by the action of pure hydrochloric acid, the gas being
afterwards washed with water and dried      by  sulphuric acid in its
 way to the exterior porcelain tube.       In one hour the interior
platinum tube yielded only three-tenths of cubic centimetre of
                                             a
 gas, of which, again, only an indeterminate small portion was
condensed   by  baryta-water and appeared to be carbonic acid.
The passage of carbonic acid   is  therefore incalculably small at a
full red heat.
   Chlorine—This gas, evolved slowly from glass <U+FB02>ask containing
                                            a
peroxide of manganese and hydrochloric acid, was washed            by
water, dried  by   sulphuric acid, and thrown as usual into the
porcelain tube so as to occupy the annular space between the
two tubes.  A   small tube containing slaked lime was interposed
between the end of the platinum tube and the Sprengel pump,
so as to absorb .the chlorine,if   any came through the substance
of the platinum.     After the tube had been heated for an hour,
the lime was examined for chlorine, but did not contain   a  trace of
that substance.    A  minute quantity of gas, probably air, amount
ing to 0'15 cub. centim., was collected during the time. Plati

num, then, is not sensibly penetrated               by chlorine at    a   red
.heat.
   Hydrochloric acid, dried over sulphuric acid, was passed for
one hour through the porcelain tube.     About 0'5 cub. centim.
of gas was collected from the platinum tube, which contained no
hydrochloric acid and no free hydrogen. The ignited platinum,
then, is not penetrated by hydrochloric acid; nor does it appear
to dissociate the elements of that gas at the temperature of the
experiment.
    Vapour of water.--A stream of steam was carried for one
hour through the porcelain tube.              During that time half a cub.
centim. of gas appeared to be'drawn from the platinum tube,
which gas contained no hydrogen.                There is no evidence of the
passage through the platinum of the vapour of water, nor of its
 decomposition.
    Ammonia.+This          gas appeared to be decomposed to a consi
 derable extent in passing through the heated annular space, hy
drogen passing freely at the same time through the ignited pla
tinum.       No trace of undecomposed ammonia, although the gas
was transmitted in considerable excess, was discovered accompa
nying the free hydrogen found in the platinum tube. When the
ammonia was evolved slowly, the quantity of hydrogen entering
 the platinum tube amounted to 16'4 cub. centims. in <U+FB01>ve mi
nutes, or was sensibly the same as when pure hydrogen was car
ried through the annular space. Ammonia, then, appears to be
incapable of penetrating the ignited platinum.
    Coal-gas—Vl'hen coal-gas was carried through the porcelain
tube, the following quantities of hydrogen came through the
platinum in successive periods of twenty minutes each—133
cub. centims., 5'2, and 8'8.           The <U+FB01>rst portion, when exploded
with oxygen,       did  not   disturb   baryta-water after condensation;
13'3   cub.    centims.   contained    13'16    cub. centims. of hydrogen.
It appears, then, that the permeating gas was free hydrogen
only, and that no compound of carbon present               in_  coal-gas was
capable    of passing through      the  platinum.      This   may be held as
excluding     the  passage   of  carbonic   oxide,  marsh-gas, and ole<U+FB01>ant
gas,  all  represented    in the  coal-gas.
    Hydrosulphuric acid—This gas, prepared from sulphide of an
timony and hydrochloric acid, washed, and dried over chloride of
calcium, was then circulated through the outer porcelain tube.
The hydrosulphuric acid was nearly all decomposed into sulphur
and hydrogen, the latter coming through the platinum at the
rate of  9   cub. centims. in <U+FB01>ve minutes.          A    trace of hydrosul
phuric    acid  may    also  have   passed   through,   as   the mercury of
Sprengel’s tube was slightly soiled; but no indication of this
gas could be perceived in the hydrogen collected.                 It appears,

    It remains to be discovered whether a sensible passage of any
of  these gases could be effected through a platinum septum much
 reduced in thickness, or through the same septum under the in
 <U+FB02>uence of a considerably higher temperature.              A fallacious ap
 pearance   of  permeation       is sometimes   occasioned  by the escape
 from the platinum itself of a small quantity of gas, particularly
 of carbonic oxide and hydrogen, as will immediately appear.
The permeation is in consequence never unequivocal for the <U+FB01>rst
 hour or two that the platinum septum is heated.
    One of the curious experiments of M. Deville was repeated, in
 which hydrogen appears to escape from the platinum tube pretty
 much as the same gas would escape from a graphite di<U+FB01>'usiometer
 —the platinum tube being full of hydrogen, while the annular
 space between the platinum and outer porcelain tube was occu
 pied by atmospheric air. At the maximum temperature the
 supply of hydrogen to the platinum tube was shut off, as that
 gas entered at one end of the tube, while the other end of the
 platinum tube was left in connexion with a barometer-tube dip
 ping into a cistern of mercury. Immediately the mercury began
 to rise in the gauge tube from the passage of hydrogen outwards
 through the walls of the platinum tube; and the latter in the
 end became nearly vacuous from the complete escape of the
 hydrogen.

hydrogen. Withdrawn by means of the Sprengel pump and ex
amined, the residual gas in the platinum tube amounted to 3'56

    The available capacity of the platinum tube was 113'1 cub.
 centims. ; and when the tube was heated, the gas driven out by
 dilatation measured in the cold 39'5 cub. centims., leaving in the
hot platinum tube 73'6 cub. centims. of gas estimated at 20° C.
 and barom. 760 millims.          It was found necessary in these expe
 riments to stu<U+FB02>' that portion of the platinum tube that was placed
 across the furnace and strongly heated, with asbestos, to give
 support to the tube when softened by the heat of ignition, and
to prevent the tube from collapsing.
    It is dif<U+FB01>cult to say where the small volume of nitrogen found
 in the platinum tube, amounting to 3'22 cub. centims., actually
 came from.     It appears too great in amount to have formed an
 impurity in the original hydrogen gas, or to have gained access
 to the vacuum through defective joinings in the apparatus.                 Its
 presence suggests the inquiry, admitting that nitrogen cannot
 pass alone through platinum into a vacuum, whether the same
 gas may not be enabled to pass, in some small proportion, while
 hydrogen is simultaneously travelling through the platinum in
 the opposite direction.        The liquid or the gaseous hydrogen oc
 cupying the platinum septum would thus form a vehicle or chan

     Absorption and detention of Hydrogen by Platinum—The pass
‘age of a gas through a colloid septum is preceded by the con
 densation of the gas in the substance of the septum, according to
 the views taken in this paper.          Is a plate of ignited platinum
 capable, then, of condensing and liquefying hydrogen gas? The
 subject could scarcely admit of experimental investigation without
 the application of the same useful air-exhauster that was em
 ployed with the non-metallic colloids.             The metal was always

 of one experiment will apply to all*.                             ,
     Platinum wire or plate being provided, the surface of the metal
 was <U+FB01>rst divested of all adhering oily matter, by boiling in caustic
 alkali and afterwards in distilled water.
     The platinum, generally in the form of wire, was then intro
 duced into a porcelain tube M, N (<U+FB01>g. 2), glazed both outside
 and inside, 0'55 metre in length and 23 millims. in internal
 diameter.     This tube could be heated either by means of the
 combustion-furnace used for organic analysis, or by placing the
 tube across the chamber of a small cylindrical furnace.                  The
 porcelain tube was <U+FB01>tted at both ends with perforated corks, well
 cemented with fused gutta percha, and provided each with a
 small quill tube.       Such may be described as the distillatory ap
 paratus employed.          It was connected at the end N with the
 Sprengel pump A B, to be used as an exhauster and transferrer of
 gas, by means of good caoutchouc adapters (not vulcanized), and
 at the other end, M, with the apparatus for supplying dry hy
 drogen, atmospheric air, or any other gas. By a screw clamp
 upon the adapter at M, the tube could be closed, and the gas
 producing apparatus then detached, leaving the porcelain tube
 shut at one end.       A tube of the hard glass used in combustion
 analysis may be substituted for the porcelain tube in many such
 experiments.      A less degree of heat suf<U+FB01>ces than was at <U+FB01>rst
 supposed.
     The porcelain tube is exhausted by continuing the action of
 the Sprengel for ten or <U+FB01>fteen minutes, till small bubbles of gas
 cease to be delivered      by the tube A B in the mercurial trough
below.      The suf<U+FB01>ciency of the joints is thus <U+FB01>rst ascertained.
 Heat being then applied to the porcelain tube, its impermeability
 at a red heat will also be tested.

now to be prepared exclusively from the fused metal.
   1. A quantity of clean platinum wire from fused metal, mea
suring 0'695 metre in length, 4'1 millims. in diameter, and 201
grms. in weight, was bent and introduced into the porcelain
tube, which was then exhausted.    The platinum was <U+FB01>rst heated

512               Mr. T. Graham       on the Absmption and
.alone for an hour to drive off any natural gaseous product ; and
 then dry hydrogen gas was admitted to the porcelain tube, the
 gas being evolved from pure sulphuric acid and pure zinc.    The
 hydrogen was conveyed in excess into the porcelain tube, at a
cherry-red heat, and the temperature was then allowed to fall in
a gradual manner—a procedure which was found to promote the
absorption of the gas. The platinum was thus retained for about
twenty minutes in an atmosphere of hydrogen, at a temperature
partly above and partly below dull redness, terminating with the
lower temperature.    After the <U+FB01>re was withdrawn and the tube
allowed to cool, air or nitrogen was driven through        and all  it,
free hydrogen thus expelled from the apparatus.
    The closed tube was now exhausted in the cold, but no hydro
gen came off.    The platinum being still retained in .a good va
cuum, heat was again very gradually applied, and the action of               ,
the Sprengel pump maintained.       Simultaneously with the <U+FB01>rst
appearance of visible ignition, gas began to be evolved.    In one
hour, the porcelain tube being heated to redness, 2'12 cub. cen
tims. of gas were collected, of which about one-third was col
lected in the <U+FB01>rst ten minutes.   It was found,              by
                                                   explosion with'

   Now, taking the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the platinum wire at 215,
the volume of 201 grms. of metal will be 9'34 cub. centims.
Hence one volume of platinum held, the gas being measured cold,
                           0207 vol. hydrogen.
   The platinum did not appear sensibly altered in lustre, or in
any other way,       by
                    its relation to the hydrogen.
   2. The ame piece of platinum wire was drawn out into four
times its <U+FB01>rst length, and the experiment of charging with hy
drogen was repeated.        The platinum gave up at       red heat, a
maintained  for one   hour,  1'8 cub. centim. of gas, of which  1'6
cub. centim. was hydrogen.        Here one volume of platinum ap
pears to have held
                       0171 vol. hydrogen.
   The absorption of hydrogen has not been increased  increa            by
sing the surface of the metal.
   In two further experiments upon the same platinum wire, the
volume of hydrogen retained    one volume of platinum was—
                                      by
   3.                     0173   cub. centim. hydrogen.

  There  isan evident tendency of the hydrogen taken up to di
minish in quantity.  These experiments have the advantage, for

            Dia'lytic Separation of Gases by Colloid Septa.         513
comparison with the earlier observations on the penetratiOn of a
platinum septum by hydrogen gas, that both wire and tube had
been drawn out from the same mass of fused metal.           No iridium
had been added to this platinum, as is sometimes done to increase
the elasticity of the metal.    The absorption of hydrogen is small,
amounting, according to the mean of the four observations, to
 17 per cent. of the volume of the platinum.       At the temperature
of a low red heat, when the absorption took place, the gas would
be considerably dilated, to the extent of at least three times its
volume stated above, or to about 51 per cent. (half the volume)
of the platinum.      It is to be considered whether an absorption
of half a volume of gas would be suf<U+FB01>cient to account for the
observed penetration of a septum of metal 1'1 millim. in thick
ness.    The data appear to favour an af<U+FB01>rmative conclusion; but
their  value cannot be very decidedly estimated.
    It appears necessary to recognize in platinum a new property,
a power to absorb hydrogen at a red heat, and to retain that gas
at  a temperature under redness for an inde<U+FB01>nite time.          It may
 be allowable to speak of this as a power to occlude (to shut up)
hydrogen, and the result as the occlusion of hydrogen by platinum.
   The observation was extended to platinum in other conditions
of form, but where, it is to be observed, the metal had not been
fused, but only welded, and was not of recent manufacture.
   5. Of the grey pulverulent spongy platinum, prepared from the
ammonio-ehloride,            grms. were heated by the combustiom
furnace, and for half an hour allowed to cool gradually in dry
hydrogen gas, as in the preceding experiments.          The volume of
the platinum is 1'032 cub. centim. by calculation.         In the <U+FB01>rst
experiment it yielded to heat and the action of the Sprengel
pump 2'2 cub. centims. of a gas which burned like hydrogen.
In a second experiment the platinum yielded in one hour (when
it appeared to be exhausted) 1'7 cub. centim. of- gas, found by
explosion to consist of hydrogen 1'52 cub. centim., and nitrogen
0'18 cub. centim. Here one volume of spongy platinum appears
                                                                      -
capable of occluding
                          1'48 vol. hydrogen.
   6. Wrought platinum, in the form‘ of plate from an old cru
cible cut up, after washing and ignition, was charged with hy
drogen three times in succession.        The weight of the platinum
was 211'1 grms., and its volume 1'12 cub. centim. It yielded in
seventy-<U+FB01>ve minutes 4'19 cub. centims. of gas, and in thirty
minutes further 1'5 cub. centim. more, making together 5'69
cub. centims.,of which 4'94 cub. centims. proved to be hydrogen ;
therm. 14°'2, barom. 760 millims.         Not a trace of carbonic acid
was found in the gas before or after explosion.          Again, after a

hour, of which 4'4 were hydrogen; and lastly, 3'76 cub. cen
 tims. in an hour, of which 3'42 were hydrogen. Hence, occluded
by 1 vol. wrought platinum—

                          553  vols. hydrogen.

    The volume of occluded hydrogen is much larger than in the
fused platinum, or even in the spongy platinum.            It exhibits a
tendency   to fall off on  repeating  the experiment.   The  decleusion
in absorbing-power may possibly be connected with the reduced
duration of the exposure to hydrogen of the metal while cooling.
    7. Wrought platinum, which had been formed many years
ago into a small tube, weighing 64.8 grms., 0'322 metre in
length and 5 millims. in diameter, was cut into three equal
lengths for convenience in placing the metal within the porcelain
tube, to be heated and charged with dry hydrogen.                By an
hour’s exhaustion afterwards the platinum yielded 9'2 cub. cen
tims. gas, of which 8'9 were hydrogen.          The volume of the pla
tinum itself was 3'9 cub. centims.; and one volume of metal had
therefore occluded 2'28 vols. hydrogen, measured at about 20° C.
In all such experiments, besides blowing out the free hydrogen
by air, the apparatus was also thoroughly exhausted by the
Sprengel pump in the cold, before the occluded hydrogen was
extracted.
    The lustre and appearance of the metallic platinum was not
altered by the ingress of the hydrogen ; but after the escape of
the gas the platinum appeared whiter in colour, and the surface
was covered by minute blisters.
    Repeating the experiment, the gas collected by an hour’s ex
haustion was 8'7 cub. centims., of which 8'46 cub. centims. were
hydrogen.      Here the metal occluded 2'8 vols. of hydrogen.
    The same platinum was a third time charged with hydrogen;
but on this occasion the platinum was placed in a tube of hard
glass, and the tube connected with the air-exhauster.         The glass
tube was heated by an oil-bath, and the platinum kept in vacuo
at a temperature of 220° C. for an hour.           Not a bubble of gas
was evolved.      The glass tube was afterwards heated by a small
Bunsen burner, which was calculated to give a degree of heat
little short of visible redness; still no hydrogen came o<U+FB01>'.        The
tube was now heated suf<U+FB01>ciently to soften glass (500°).              Gas
began to come off, of which 1'8 cub. centim., containing 1'72
hydrogen, were collected in ten minutes. The glass tube having
cracked, the whole apparatus was allowed to cool, and the plati
num transferred to a porcelain tube.          Further heated by a com

             Dialytic Separation of   Gases by Colloid Sqita.        515
bustion-furnace for one hour, the platinum gave o<U+FB01>' 8'6 cub.
centims. gas, of which 8'2 were hydrogen.          The platinum there
fore appears to have occluded altogether 3'79 vols. of hydrogen.
    The preceding experiment appeared to show a complete sealing
up of the occluded hydrogen at low temperatures, seeing that,
although nearly four volumes of gas were present, none escaped
below a red heat.       But to test the effect of time at the tempera
ture of the atmosphere, the platinum, again charged with hy
drogen, was sealed up hermetically in a glass tube, which it
nearly <U+FB01>lled, and not opened for two months. The air in the
tube was then transferred and examined.           It did not exhibit any
reduction of volume under the electric spark or a pellet of spongy
platinum.       The air therefore appeared to contain no hydrogen;
the latter had not di<U+FB01>'used out, but, it is to be presumed, was
retained by the platinum without loss.              These experiments,
although related last, were the <U+FB01>rst performed in this inquiry.
The included hydrogen was never entirely extracted in an hour,
and is probably understated.        The gas always came off gradu
ally, more than one-half of the whole in the <U+FB01>rst twenty or thirty
minutes.       The last results may be stated as follows :—
       1  vol. hammered    platinum occluded 2'28 vols. hydrogen.
                  ,1       J)        7,                      ,J
                  ,1       ,1        ,,                      ,,
    The high absorbing-power of the hammered platinum, or
rather the low absorbing-power of the fused metal, was ascribed
to a mechanical difference between the two—to a more open tex
ture in the former, permitting more free access of hydrogen
lique<U+FB01>ed, as it may be, to the interior of the metal.
    8. The extrication of occluded hydrogen from platinum had
always required a degree of temperature verging upon a red heat,
even when aided by a vacuum 3 and this remains true of hydro
gen originally absorbed at or near a red heat.          But the fact ap
pears    to be compatible with the absorption of the gas, under the
pressure of the atmosphere, at a considerably lower temperature.
Thin platinum-foil was <U+FB01>rst deprived of a little natural gas by
 ignition in vacuo in the porcelain tube.      The foil was afterwards
placed in a glass tube and heated again in a stream of hydrogen
 to a temperature not exceeding 230° 04, for three hours, by
 means of an oil-bath, and further allowed to cool slowly in an
 atmosphere of the same gas for several hours. A second glass
 tube receiver, to which the platinum-foil was transferred, was ex
 hausted, as usual, at 20° C. without any sensible evolution of
 gas. With a red heat superadded, gas came off in twenty minutes
  (but nearly all in the <U+FB01>rst seven minutes) to the extent of 0'75
 cub. centim., of which 0'56 cub. centim. proved to be hydrogen.
                                    2 L 2

516               Mr. T. Graham    on the Absorption and
The volume of 8'3v grms. of platinum is 0385 cub. centim.
Hence one volume of platinum-foil appears to take up, in three
hours,
                     1'45 vol. hydrogen at 230° C.
    9. The same portion of platinum-foil was again charged with
hydrogen at a still lower temperature, namely between 97° and
100°, for three hours.        Submitted to exhaustion at a red heat,
the platinum now gave off 05 cub. centim. of gas in thirty-<U+FB01>ve
minutes, of which about 0'3 cub. centim. were hydrogen.           One
volume of platinum-foil had taken up
                      0'76 vol. hydrogen at 100°.
    By this property platinum is connected with palladium, which
of all metals appears to possess the power of absorbing hydrogen
in the highest degree.
                                Palladium.
    Of   late years palladium has become comparatively uncommon ;
and some dif<U+FB01>culty was experienced at <U+FB01>rst in procuring more
than a gramme or two of the metal, in the form of thin foil.
The palladium-foil <U+FB01>rst employed weighed 1'58 grm., and mea
 sured 0'133 cub. centim. (taking the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the metal
at 11'86), and had a surface of 000902 square metre.           It gave
off, when heated in'aacuo for one hour, 1'50 cub. centim. of na
tural gas, containing no compound of carbon, but consisting of
hydrogen and air.
    1. As it appeared from preliminary experiments that the oc
 clusion of hydrogen by palladium was likely to be a phenomenon
exhibited at a comparatively low range of temperature, the metal
was heated in hydrogen no higher than 245° C., by an oil-bath,
and allowed to cool very slowly, so as to pass through still lower
ranges of temperature which might be favourable to the absorp
tion of hydrogen. The metal, when afterwards transferred to
the distillatory glass tube, appeared to give out nothing to a va
 cuum at l7°'8 C. and barom. 759 millims.            But the moment
the combustion-furnace was lighted under the tube, gas came off
most freely.       Of the <U+FB01>rst portion collected, 11'77 cub. centims.
contained 11'74 cub. centims. hydrogen.           The gas ceased to be
evolved in <U+FB01>fteen minutes, when 69'92 cub. centims. were col
lected, of which the greater part came over in the <U+FB01>rst ten mi
nutes.       Hence palladium had taken up a large volume of gas
when the temperatufe of the metal never exceeded 245° C.
               1 vol. palladium held 526 vols. hydrogen.
    2.   In a similar experiment the temperature of absorption was
       further lowered with good effect.        The palladium was ex
still

            Dialytic Separation   of Gases  by Colloid Septa-       517
posed to hydrogen between 90° and 97° C. for three hours, and
then allowed to cool in the gas for one hour and a half. Now
placed in a glass tube, exhausted, and heated by a gas-<U+FB02>ame, the
palladium gave off gas in a continuous stream for twelve minutes,
when it ceased. The gas amounted to 85'56 cub. centims., of
which 968 per cent. was hydrogen;           therm. 17°‘5, barom. 764
millims.
           1 vol. palladium held 643'?) vols. hydrogen.
   By the care of my zealous assistant, Mr. W. C. Roberts, the
hydrogen employed in these experiments was puri<U+FB01>ed to the
highest degree by passing it in succession through alcohol, water,
caustic potash, and tubes of 0'7 metre each, <U+FB01>lled with broken
glass impregnated with nitrate of lead, sulphate of silver, and oil
of vitriol. The gas was inodorous, and burned with a barely
visible <U+FB02>ame.
   No alteration was sensible in the metallic appearance of the
palladium-foil when charged with hydrogen, or when discharged.
The foil was much crumpled and rather friable after repeated use;
but this may have arisen from frequent handling.
  3. Palladium appears to absorb hydrogen largely,even at natural
temperatures, provided that the metal has been recently ignited
in vacuo.    The foil, without such preparation, was placed in a
bottle of pure hydrogen for several hours, but yielded nothing
when afterwards ignited in the Sprengel vacuum.               The foil,
however, being immediately      returned   after cooling to a stoppered
bottle containing hydrogen, and left in the gas for a night, ab
sorption now took place—air rushing in, on opening the stopper,
as into a partial vacuum; therm. 19°. When the palladium-foil
was afterwards transferred to a glass tube and connected with
the Sprengel pump, it was found dif<U+FB01>cult to obtain a vacuum
for some time, owing to hydrogen coming off at the temperature
of the atmosphere.      But after a fair vacuum was produced 6'96
cub. centims. were collected, of which 6'78 proved to be hydro
gen.     Heat was then applied, and 42 cub. centims. came over in
<U+FB01>ve minutes, making altogether more than 50 cub. centims., or
376 volumes of gas. The absorption of hydrogen appears, then,
to be suspended at a low temperature, unless the condition of
the metal be favourable.      The action of a plate of clean platinum
in determining the combustion of explosive gas is equally critical
at a low temperature.
   4. Adifferent specimen of palladium-foil, weighing 5'76 grms.,
and having a volume of 0485 cub. centim., was charged with
hydrogen, and discharged, more than once.            In the second ex
periment, the foil was heated in hydrogen at 100° for three hours.
Distilled afterwards in a porcelain tube at a low red heat in the

 518             Mr. T. Graham     on the Absmption and
 usual way, the palladium was found to have absorbed, at 100°,
    _ 347'7 vols. of hydrogen measured at 18°‘2 C. and barom.
            756 millims.
     5. So large an absorption of hydrogen should increase the
 weight of the palladium sensibly, notwithstanding the lightness
 of the gas.     One litre, or 1000 cub. centims., of hydrogen at
 0° C. and 760 millims. weighs 0'0896 grm. Of new palladium
 foil, believed to be from fused metal, 5'9516 grms. increased to
 59542, or by 00026 grm., when the metal was charged with
 hydrogen at 100C) for four hours. This amounts to only 2901
 cub. centims. of hydrogen at 0° C. and 760 millims. barom.
 The gas actually extracted afterwards from the palladium did not
 exceed 3452 cub. centims. at 19° 0., and barom. 758 millims.,
 equivalent to 3184 cub. centims. at 0° C. and 760 millims. ba
 rom. The whole gas extricated (68 vols.) seems unusually small,
 but it corresponds closely enough with the volume calculated
 from the increase of the palladium in weight. An inferior ab
 sorbing-power for hydrogen appears to be connected in both pla
tinum and palladium with the fusion of the metal.
    6. A portion of similar palladium-foil, charged with hydrogen,

30 grms. of the sponge were left in contact with 9'5 cub. cen
tims. of dilute alcohol of speci<U+FB01>c gravity 0893, for <U+FB01>fty-one
hours, in a sealed tube.       The supernatant liquid now drawn off
to the extent of 3'9 cub. centims. was of speci<U+FB01>c gravity 0901,
while the portion retained by the palladium was found when
distilled to be of speci<U+FB01>c gravity 0885, or it was sensibly con
centrated.     This chemical action of palladium sponge was more
than once veri<U+FB01>ed.       Platinum sponge, on the other hand, exhi
bited no indication of a similar separating-power; nor did the
sponge of iron reduced by hydrogen from the oxide.
    8. Connected, it may be, with this chemico-moleeular action
of palladium is the variable absorptive power for different liquids
exhibited by palladium-foil.        Immersed in various liquids for an
hour, and afterwards dried by pressure for a few seconds betweenv
folds of blotting-paper, a quantity of palladium-foil represented
by 1000 was found to retain in its pores——

    The superior penetrativeness of alcohol over water is well
marked; capillary action appears to merge into a chemical a<U+FB02>i
nity.     Liquid hydrogen would also appear as highly absorbable
by palladium-foil.       It would appear also to be separable from
other gases (or liquids), as alcohol is from water, by the palladium
pores.
    Alloy of 5 palladium and 4: silver.—The power to absorb hy
 drogen appears to extend to this alloy of palladium.           A plate of
 the alloy, about 180 millims. in length, 31 millims. in width,
 and weighing 743 grms., was bent, so as to be able to enter a
 wide porcelain tube that could be exhausted of air when required.
 The volume of the palladium alloy was 6'21 cub. centims.             The
 plate of metal being placed in the porcelain tube, had hydrogen
 gas passed over it at a low red heat for one hour, and was then
 allowed to cool slowly in the same gas. Taken out and examined,
 the metal was not visibly altered.         For the extrication of gas the
metal was distilled in the porcelain tube heated by jets of gas,
 and connected with the Sprengel pump, as usual. In seven
 minutes after the gas-furnace was lit, 24 cub. centims. of gas
 came off; in ten minutes more,- 80'71 cub. centims. ; and in

520             Mr. T. Graham       on the Absmption and
seventy-<U+FB01>ve     minutes more, 36'75 cub. centims., making alto
gether 141'46 cub. centims.          Of this gas 127'74 cub. centims.
proved to be hydrogen, the remainder being nitrogen, derived,
no doubt, from the large imperfectly exhausted porcelain tube.
The palladium alloy, in the form of a thick plate, appears there
fore to have held
205    vols. hydrogen, measured at 18°'2 and barom. 756 millims.
    This alloy of palladium becomes crystalline by heating, and
appears to lose much of its absorbent power at the same time.
   The conclusion, then, is that welded palladium, in the condition
of thin foil, readily absorbs hydrogen, to the extent of upwards
of 600 times the volume of the metal at a temperature under the
boiling-point of water, upwards of 500 volumes at 245°, and less
at higher temperatures, the metal being always surrounded by
hydrogen under atmospheric pressure.           Hydrogen is also largely
absorbed, although less constantly, at ordinary temperatures.
On the other hand, palladium already fully charged with hydro
gen at or under 100°, and under the pressure of the atmosphere,
begins to give out gas when exposed either to atmospheric air
or to a vacuum at the original temperature of absorption; and
the gas is freely discharged at 200° C.
    It is probable that hydrogen enters palladium in the physical
condition of liquid, whether the phenomenon prove to be ana
logous to the imbibition of ether, chloroform, and such solvents
by the colloid indie-rubber, or whether a certain porosity of
structure in the palladium be required.           The por0sity of the
metal    is supposed  to  be   of that  high degree which will admit
liquid    but  not  gaseous    molecules.    Now the numerous liquid
compounds      of  carbon    and  hydrogen have all a nearly similar
density, generally     a  little  under   that of water.  There is no
reason to suppose that the density of liquid hydrogen would
differ greatly from the hydrocarbon class; but then the surpri
sing lightness of hydrogen gas must cause liquid hydrogen to
yield a volume of vapour disproportionately large when compared
with the former class of substances, or, indeed, with any other
substance whatever.        The absorption of hydrogen by palladium
will appear, then, less extravagantly great when viewed as the
absorption of a highly volatile liquid capable of yielding an ex
ceedingly light vapour, rather than that of a gas.
    An excellent opportunity of observing the penetration by hy
drogen of a compact plate of palladium, 1 millim. in thickness,
was afforded by a tube of that metal constructed by Mr. Mathey.
This tube was said to have been welded from palladium near the
point of fusion of the metal.        The length of the tube was 115
millims., its internal diameter 12 millims., thickness 1 millim.

           Dialytic Separation of Gases   by Colloid Septa.       521
and external surface   00153 of a square metre.         It was closed
by thick plates of platinum soldered at both ends, one of the
plates being perforated by a long small tube of platinum, by
which the cavity of the palladium tube could be exhausted of air.
   Now the closed palladium tube remained air-tight, when ex
hausted by the Sprengel tube at the ordinary temperature,           at
260°, and at a temperature verging on low redness, the gas
without being atmospheric air.         Hydrogen being then substi
tuted as the external gas, the walls of the palladium tube still
remained impermeable       at a low temperature.        No hydrogen
gained the interior in three hours at 100°.      But the temperature
being gradually raised by means of an oil-bath to 240°, hydrogen
then began to come through, and at a gradually increasing rate
to 265°. Thehydrogen then entered steadily at the rate of 8'67
cub. centims. in <U+FB01>ve minutes.        This gives a rate of 327 cub.
centims. for a square metre of surface per minute.           Heated to
a temperature just short of redness, the passage of hydrogen was
increased to 112 cub. centims. in <U+FB01>ve minutes, or 423 cub. cen
tims. for a square metre per minute.
    With coal-gas as the external atmosphere the penetration of
the palladium began about the same temperature, and was con
tinued at 270° at the rate of 57 cub. centims. for a square metre
of surface per minute. The penetrating gas had no odour of
coal-gas, contained no trace of carbon, and appeared to be abso
lutely pure hydrogen.       The exact isolation of the latter gas by
septa of both platinum and palladium appears most extraordinary.
    A quantitative determination of the hydrogen in a gaseous
mixture could probably be effected by means of the hollow cy
linder of palladium.
    Is the power to penetrate   the metals    in question   con<U+FB01>ned to
hydrogen? It has been lately concluded by Dr. C. Wetherill
that the turgescence of the ammonium amalgam depends entirely
 upon the retention of hydrogen gas-bubbles* ; hydrogen, then,
appears to exhibit an attraction of a peculiar kind for mercury.
 The ready liquefaction of the same gas by the platinum metals
evinces also a powerful mutual attraction.       The only other vola
tile body which has been observed to pass, like hydrogen, through
 a plate of palladium is common ether—and that at the atmo
 spheric temperature, while a passage was denied to hydrogen at
 the same time. The palladium was in the form of foil. Although
 thin foil of this metal is generally visibly porous and allows air
to pass through like a sieve, a tube diffusiometer, covered with
a disk of the selected palladium-foil, and standing over mercury,
retained a volume of 405 millims. of air over a vertical column
 of 155 millims. of mercury for twenty-fours without depression
            * American Journal of Science, vol.     N0. 124.

522           Mr. T. Graham      on the Absorption and
of the mercury. The air was dried by sticks of potash; but still
it did not penetrate the palladium. Dry hydrogen was then
conducted to the upper surface of the palladium disk, but still
without any penetration by that gas after several hours. Cotton
wool moistened with ether was now placed upon the disk, when,
after eight minutes, the con<U+FB01>ned air within the tube began to
expand; and in the course of an hour longer, the 405 volumes
of con<U+FB01>ned air increased to 904 (thermometer 18°‘5, barometer
758), when the expansion ceased. The increase of volume ap
peared to be due entirely to ether-vapour, absorbable by a pellet
charged with sulphuric acid. Why hydrogen proved to be iuca
pable of penetrating the palladium in such circumstances it is
dif<U+FB01>cult to say. It can only be imagined that the palladium-foil
may have previously condensed on its surface a minute <U+FB01>lm of
foreign matter, which rendered the palladium inactive to hydro
gen but not to ether-vapour.
    On the other hand, the penetrating power of hydrogen, here
referred to the liquefaction of that gas, appears not to be solely
con<U+FB01>ned to metallic septa.        There is reason to suspect that in
diffusing through a plate of graphite hydrogen passes in a small
proportion as a liquid, without any counterdi<U+FB01>'usion of air. Hence
the constant excess observed of the di<U+FB01>'usive coef<U+FB01>cient of hy
drogen, which came out 3876, 3'993, and 4067*, instead of
the theoretical number 38, corresponding to the density of the
gas referred to air.    Such phenomena of gaseous penetration
suggest a progression in the degree of porosity.          There appear
to be (1) pores through which gases pass under pressure or by
capillary transpiration, as in dry wood and many minerals, (2)
pores through which gases do not pass under pressure, but pass
by their proper molecular movement of diffusion, as in arti<U+FB01>cial
graphite, and (3) pores through which gases pass neither by ca
pillary transpiration nor by their proper diffusive movement, but
only after liquefaction, such as the pores of wrought metals and
the <U+FB01>nest pores of graphite.

    A portion of small grains of osmium-iridium, amounting to
2528 grms.,     was exp0sed to hydrogen through all descending
temperatures from a red heat, as the preceding metals had been
treated.   The osmium-iridium was then heated again to redness
in the Sprengel vacuum, to extricate any hydrogen that might
have been    absorbed.     But only a bubble or two of gas, too
minute to be measured, passed over in 15 minutes, at a red
 heat.   Osmi<U+FB01>m-iridium,       then, exhibits no absorbent       power

                                   Copper.
    The power to occlude gases appears not be con<U+FB01>ned to palla
dium and platinum among the metals.               The exact experiments
of  M.   Dumas, by    which   the   atomic  weights of the leading ele
ments     were  de<U+FB01>nitely settled,  afford an  indication of the absorp
tion of hydrogen gas by spongy metallic copper reduced from
the oxide, su<U+FB01>icient to affect the weight of the metal to the extent
 of about 3 parts in 100,000*.
    1. With the view of applying the method of extracting gas
followed in the treatment of the preceding metals, so much oxide
 of copper was reduced by hydrogen as was calculated to yield
 50 grms. of metallic copper.           The reduced metal was again
 heated to redness and slowly cooled in a stream of dry hydrogen.
 After free exposure to the air for a few minutes, the metal was
 now submitted, at a red heat, to the action of the Sprengel pump.
 It then gave off in one hour 3'35 cubic centims. of gas, mea
 sured cold, which appeared to be pure hydrogen (the explosion
 with oxygen indicated 3'4 hydrogen).           Taking the speci<U+FB01>c gra
 vity of copper at 885, 50 grms. of that metal would be 5'65
 cub. centims. in volume, and the result is that
     1  vol. reduced copper sponge occludes 0'6 vol. hydrogen.
 Hydrogen being about 12,000 times as light as copper (at 15°),
 1  part of gas by weight has been taken up by 20,000 parts of
 metal.
    2. The same weight and volume of <U+FB01>ne copper, in the form of
 wire thoroughly cleaned, was exposed to hydrogen at a red heat,
 and then submitted to exhaustion for one hour. It gave 2'6
 cub. centims. gas, of which 2 cub. centims. were hydrogen, and
the remaining 0'6 principally carbonic oxide.           It may be repre
 sented that
        1  vol. wrought copper occludes      0306 vol. hydrogen.
    Where a metal, such as wrought copper, may contain small
 quantities of carbon and oxygen, an obvious cause will exist for
 the production and evolution of carbonic oxide under the in<U+FB02>u
 ence of heat.     Gas so generated appears to be added to the oc
 cluded hydrogen when extricated in the last experiment.
    * Annales de Chimie et de Physique, 3 sér. vol. viii. p. 205.  The ob
 servations of M. Melsens show that 240 grins. of copper may <U+FB01>x about
 0007 grm. of hydrogen, most being <U+FB01>xed when the oxide of copper is re
 duced by hydrogen at a low temperature.     In the subsequent oxidation of
 the copper the gas does not come out suddenly, but in a gradual manner.

                                    Gold.
    1. A quantity of gold was precipitated          from the assay cor
nettes used below by means of oxalic acid.             The gold weighed
93'3 grms., with a volume of 4'83 cub. centims., taking the spe
ci<U+FB01>c gravity of the metal as 1931. Exhausted at a red heat
Without any further treatment, the reduced gold yielded 3'4 cub.
centims. of gas, which may therefore be supposed to be gas
usually present in gold reduced in the manner described.              This
is 0704 vol. of the gold. The occluded gas in precipitated gold
gave to analysis

   2. Of the original cornettes of <U+FB01>ne gold, from gold-assays
conducted several months before, 93'3 grms., having a volume
of 4'83 cub. centims., were submitted without any further treat
ment to aspiration at a red heat.          The gold gave up in the <U+FB01>rst
half hour 9'45 cub. centims. of gas, and in the second half hour
08 cub. centim., making together 10'25 cub. centims.                 Hence
1 volume of the gold cornettes        appears   to hold  2'12   volumes  of
gas.   This  gas consisted   of.
                 6'70 cub. centims. Carbonic okide.
                 1'50 ,,         ,,       Carbonic acid.

               1025
   The cornettes do not appear ever to assume again so much
gas as they <U+FB01>rst acquired in the assay mu<U+FB01>e.                It follows that
the weight of a gold cornette is increased about 2 parts in
10,000 by the weight of occluded gas. As the gold also re
tains 7 or 8 parts of silver in 10,000, it follows that the ab
solute quantity of gold in a cornette is less than the weight
of the cornette as indicated by the balance by 1 part in 1000.
This does not disprove the accuracy of the usual gold-assay,
which is always made in comparison with gold of known compo
sition as a check, and is therefore relatively true.
   3. The same volume of gold cornettes, amounting to 4'83
cub. centims., heated again in carbonic oxide gas, gave up after
wards 1'6 cub. centim. of occluded gas composed of
                   1‘4 cub. centim. Carbonic oxide.

    The power of this metal to occlude hydrogen gas is very
sensible.    The metal here appears to hold 0'48 volume of hy
drogen gas. The same gold, when dissolved and precipitated,
was also found capable of holding 0'44 volume of hydrogen.
    5. The same mass of cornettes, heated in carbonic acid gas, gave
up afterwards in one hour 1'05 cub. centim. gas in which baryta
water showed the presence of
                   078      cub. centim. Carbonic acid.
    The charged cornettes were always freely exposed to air for
some time before occluded gas was extracted from them and
measured, so as to allow the escape of any loosely attached gas.
    6. The same cornettes were heated and cooled in a stream of
dry air, in like manner as they had been treated with other
gases.     The occluded air given out in one hour amounted in
two different experiments to 1'15 and 0'95 cub. centim. respec
 tively.   The gas of the second experiment gave
              0'82 cub. centim. Nitrogen            .    = 8623

    The whole occluded air amounts to 0'2 volume of the gold,
and is principally nitrogen.          The indifference of gold to oxygen
is remarkable, and contrasts with the power of silver to occlude
the same gas.

 the usual way.       The natural gas derived from this metal was
 small in quantity, and it appeared to come 06' almost entirely in
 one hour.     The silver wire weighed 108'8 grms., and had a
 volume of 1037' cub. centims., taking the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of
pure silver as 1049.          The gas extracted amounted to

 in the metal at all temperatures below an incipient red heat. It
 did not tarnish the bright metallic surface of the silver, or pro
 duce any appearance suggestive of the oxidation of a metal.

 precipitated as chloride, and reduced again, was exposed to atmo

    connected with the observed capacity of the colloid metal, soft

    The penetration of iron by hydrogen is demonstrated as clearly
by MM. Deville and Troost as that of platinum.            A thin tube
of cast steel, 3 or 4 millims. in thickness, already enclosing hy
drogen gas in its cavity, was surrounded by air or by nitrogen
gas circulating in an annular space between the steel tube men
tioned and a wider external porcelain tube. In the absence of
any visible pores in the steel, hydrogen made its way through
the substance of the metal, and escaped into the annular space
as soon as the system of tubes was exposed to a red heat.           A
nearly if not entirely complete vacuum was formed within the
iron tube*.     In another modi<U+FB01>cation of the experiment, carbonic
oxide from an uncertain source appeared within the iron tube,
particularly when the temperature was most elevated-I:
    Wrought iron, in the form of thin wire (N o. 23), about 0'4
millim. in diameter, <U+FB01>rst carefully cleaned with caustic alkali and
water, was heated alone in the porcelain tube exhausted of air,
for the purpose of eliminating any natural gases.
    1. Of the iron wire referred to, 46 grms., with a volume of
5'9 cub. centims., the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the metal being taken
at 7'8, were heated by the open combustion-furnace.         Gas came
off freely at a red heat,—
    (1) In <U+FB01>fteen minutes, 156 cub. centims., containing 3'5
 cub. centims. carbonic acid, or 224 per cent.
    (2) In <U+FB01>fteen minutes, 7'17 cub. centims., containing 0'52
 cub. centim. or 7'2 per cent. of carbonic acid.     The gas of this
 and the following stages of observation now burnt with a blue
<U+FB02>ame, and was principally carbonic oxide.
    (3) In thirty minutes, 104 cub. centims., of which 6'86 cub.
 centims. were carbonic oxide.
    (4) In thirty minutes, 8'16 cub. centims., of which 0'12, or        '
 1'4 per cent., was carbonic acid.
    (5) In thirty minutes, 5'52 cub. centims., of which 03 was
 carbonic acid—that      is,
                          0-5 per cent.
    Hence 46 grms. of wrought iron have in two hours given o<U+FB02>'
 46'85 cub. centims. of gas, measured at about 15°C. or       ;   1vo
 lume of iron has discharged 7'94 volumes of gas, of which about
 two-thirds was carbonic oxide; and the metal does not appear to
 be yet quite exhausted.    Iron      metal not unlikely to contain
                                     is   a
 small quantities of carbon and oxygen, both in chemical union
 with iron; and the gas extricated may partly be due to reac      a
 tion of these elements upon each other at      red heat.

in a small glass tube, to exclude the idea of the conceivable per

pretty    uniform   rate,  which  amounted   in an hour to 298 cub.
centims., of which 4'44 cub. centims. were carbonic acid, and
the remainder principally carbonic oxide, with hydrogen and a
trace of a hydro-carburet.          Here the iron wire gave 011' 7-27
volumes of gas.
    3. In a third experiment, on thin iron wire (No. 23), the ex
trication of the natural gases at a red heat was pushed to a greater
 degree of exhaustion.       The weight of the iron was 39 grms., and
its volume 5 cub. centims.         In the <U+FB01>rst and second hour the gas
 collected was 45 cub. centims.; in the third hour 10'85 cub.
 centims.,- in the fourth and <U+FB01>fth hours 5'65 cub. centims.; in
 the sixth hour 09 cub. centim., and in the seventh hour 0'7 cub.
 centim. The iron appears to be now nearly exhausted, after the
 extrication of 63-1 cub. centims., or 1255 volumes of gas.
     It is evident that iron cannot be safely dealt with in experi
 ments upon the permeation or upon the absorption of gases, till
 these gases, whether self-produced or preexisting, are <U+FB01>rst extri
 cated from the metal.        The carbonic oxide observed in the tube
 experiments of M. Deville may have been derived from the same
 source*.
     4. To observe the absorption of hydrogen, the mass of ex
 hausted iron wire remaining after the last experiment was heated
 to redness, and cooled gradually in the same gas.            The metal
 was afterwards freely exposed to air (as usual) to get rid of any
 loosely attached hydrogen.         Now exhausted again by the Spren
 gel pump at a low red heat, the iron gave 25 cub. centims. of
 gas in one hour, but the greater portion in the <U+FB01>rst ten minutes,

     Of this gas 20-76 cub. centims. proved to be carbonic oxide.
Pure iron, then, is capable of taking up at a low red heat, and bold
ing when cold, 4'15 volumes of carbonic oxide gas.            This fact was
con<U+FB01>rmed      in  various   other eXperiments.       It  explains partly, if
not entirely, the abundance of carbonic oxide observed among
the natural gases of iron in experiments 1, 2, and 3.                In the
course of its preparation wrought iron may be supposed to oc
 elude six or eight times its volume of carbonic oxide gas, which
is carried about ever after.      How the qualities of iron are affected
 by the presence of such a substance, no way metallic in its cha
 racters, locked up in so strange a way, but capable of reappearing,
 under the in<U+FB02>uence of heat, at any time, with the elastic tension
 of gas, is a subject which metallurgists may <U+FB01>nd worthy of
     a
 investigation.
     The relations of the metal iron to carbonic oxide gas appear to
 be altogether peculiar.       They cannot fail to have abearing upon
 the important process of acieration.       The intervention of carbonic
 oxide in the usual process of the cemeutation of iron with char
 coal, long recognized by accurate observers, may be said now to
 be placed beyond all doubt by the recent beautiful research of
 M. Margueritte*.         Hitherto the decomposing action of the iron
 upon carbonic oxide has been supposed to be exercised only at
  the external surface of the metal.       A surface-particle of the iron
 has been supposed to assume one-half of the carbon belonging
  to an equivalent of carbonic oxide (C2 0%), while the remaining
  elements diffused away into the air as carbonic acid (C 02), to
  reacquire carbon from the charcoal placed near, and to become
  capable of repeating the original action.            It is now seen that
  such a process need not be con<U+FB01>ned to the surface of the iron
  bar, but may occur throughout the substance of the metal, in
  consequence of the prior penetration         of the metal by carbonic
  oxide.    The direct contact and action of carbon (in the form
  either of diamond or charcoal) upon iron is allowed to produce
  cast iron and not steel.      It appears that the diffused action of
  carbonic oxide is the proper means of distributing the carbon
  throughout the mass of iron.        The blistering of the bar appears
  to testify to the necessary production and evolution of carbonic
                 " Annales de Chimie, &c. 4 sér. vol. vi. 1865.

acid, owing to the decomposition         of the carbonic oxide in the
Interior of the bar.
    The inquiry suggests itself whether acieration would not be
promoted by alternation of temperature frequently repeated. The
lowest red heat, or a temperature even lower, appears to be most
favourable to the absorption of carbonic oxide by iron, or for
impregnating the metal with that gas; while a much higher
temperature appears to be required to enable the metal to de
compose carbonic oxide, to appropriate the carbon and become
steel.    The action of a high temperature is made very clear by
 M. Margueritte.        The proceSs of acieration, it seems then,
          be divided into two distinct stages, conducted at very
should
different temperatures,——the <U+FB01>rst to introduce carbonic oxide into
the iron, and the second to decompose the carbonic oxide so in
troduced. The carbonic oxide once safely occluded b the iron,
 the metal might even be cooled and preserved in t e air, the
second heating being postponed for any length of time.           Such
 alternations of temperature are not unlikely to occur by accident
 during the usual long process of cementation ; but they might
 be properly regulated with advantage, and the process may ad
 mit of being abridged in point of time.

     To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
        GENTLEMEN,
  I   BEG leave to forward to you for insertion in your valuable
       Journal a few paragraphs on the physical properties of aether,
 about to be inserted in the beginning of my <U+FB01>rst chapter on Light,
 thinking that they may interest many of your readers, who would
 never dream of dipping into the pages of a professedly elemen
 tary work, for the remote chance of <U+FB01>nding some idea with which
 they were not already familiar; and       I do so the more willingly
 because I desire to court investigation of an important point in
 physics from those who are more competent than most of my
 ordinary readers to entertain the question at issue.
    That some material medium pervades in<U+FB01>nite space, as the means
 of transmission of the light- and heat-waves (as the case may be) of
 the heavenly bodies, is indispensable to the dynamical theory; but
 is it equally, or indeed at all, necessary to imagine that the portion
 of space within the con<U+FB01>nes of our atmosphere, which is occupied by
                                 2M2

   532            Mr. C. Brodke    on the Nature of Ether.
   ordinary matter, amenable to our senses, as well as to the universal
   law of gravitation, must be occupied by a strange and anomalous
  form of matter amenable to neither? Probabilities appear to negative
  this question.     But it will be immediately asked, how can aether be
  imagined to avoid pervading our atmosphere and all other kinds and
  forms of matter? Simply by ascribing to it a property of non-misci—
   bility with our atmosphere, like oil with water—a quality not entirely
   adverse to experience, nor repugnant to reason.      The question then
   naturally arises, what becomes of the waves of heat and light when
  they reach our atmosphere? and is ordinary matter suf<U+FB01>cient and
  effectual for their transmission ? This question can be answered only
  from analogy, which appears to infer an a<U+FB02>irmative.                ,
      That sound-waves are transmitted by air, and not by interstitial
  aether, is unquestionable;      and if air be capable of transmitting
   25,000 vibrations in one second, it would probably be dif<U+FB01>cult to
  assign any valid reason why the same medium is incapable of trans
  mitting the far more rapid waves of heat and light; and if capable,
  then where lies the necessity for assuming the presence of another
  medium ?
      Again, the refraction of sound, as demonstrated by the experi
  ments of Hajech and Sondhaus (563,564), is in exact accordance with
  the laws hitherto assigned to the refraction of light and heat.       But
  the phenomena of the refraction of light require a very forced ad
  dendum to the interstitial-aether hypothesis, namely. that the elasti
  city of the aether is dependent upon that of the medium which it pervades
  ——an unprecedented in<U+FB02>uence of one kind of matter on other merely
  contiguous matter. And it appears that the velocity of sound in solids
  and liquids is much greater than in air (545); in water it is nearly
.5000 feet, and in iron nearly 17,000 feet in one second :‘is there,
  then, any known fact whatever that tends to assign a limit to the
 possible velocity of transmission of wave-motion through these and
 other material media? if not, then the presence of aether, as gene
 rally assumed, cannot be deemed essential to the transmission of

  tained ?
               “ Nec Deus intersit nisi dignus vindice nodus
                 Inciderit."
     Moreover Professor Tyndall, to whom the progress of Dynamical
 Physics is indebted for many laborious and important researches,
 has observed that in various kinds of wood there is a remarkable
 harmony between their respective conductivities for sound and heat
 in three mutually perpendicular directions, namely, longitudinal,
 transverse-radial, and transverse-tangential (546). Now, although
 there is certainly no direct analogy between the conduction of heat
 and the radiation of light, beyond that of their common dynamical
 origin, a much closer analogy may nevertheless be traced through
 the phenomena of phosphorescence, <U+FB02>uorescence, and calorescence.
 Is it, in fact, generally believed that the transmission of heat-motion
 is effected by interstitial tether, and not by the molecules of the
 medium itself? If not, why should a hypothetical medium be as

                    Mr. C. Brooke    on the Nature szEl/lél‘.            533
    sumed for light-motion which is not required for that of heat, since
    the rapidity of the undulations and their velocity of transmission is
    so much the same in both? while at the same time the converse
    permeabilities to light and heat of crystals of alum, and those of dark
    smoky quartz, present striking examples of the existing yet unknown
    differences of physical constitution which are met with in the various
    kinds of matter.
       It may further be remarked that the dynamical theory of electri~
   city, if tenable, presents additional reasons for denying the necessity
   of the presence of aether in ordinary matter.     For if the molecules of
   a rod of copper can transmit an electric wave at the rate of at least
   250,000 miles in a second, why cannot those of a rod of glass trans
   mit a wave of light at about three-fourths of that velocity?
       It, then, these premises be established, it must be granted that the
   presence of aether is not essential to the transmission of any known
   kind of wave—motion; and if so, is it not more in accordance with
   the true spirit of philosophy, in default of positive knowledge, to
   abandon unhesitatingly the more violent hypothesis, and to adopt
   provisionally the more reasonable one above suggested ?
       The phenomena of phosphorescence present further evidence
  of   the intimate relations existing between electricity, heat, and
  light.      It has been observed that <U+FB01>uor-spar may be rendered
  phosphorescent       by a very moderate application of heat, but that
  it will not again phosphoresce under similar circumstances until
  an electric spark has been repeatedly passed over its surface.
  Is it not probable that the phosphorescence by heat of the
  minerals <U+FB02>uor and apatite and ordinary incandescence are simi
  lar phenomena, differing only in the temperature (amount of vis            .
 viva) at which heat-motion impressed on the molecules of different
  bodies is imparted as light-motion to the surrounding medium.
      Our ideas of vis viva and its relation to “ accumulated work ”
 are inseparably associated with that of gravitation; is it not,
 therefore, something like a contradiction in terms to speak of
 the vis viva of an imponderable body?          But if aether be not sup
 posed to be intermingled with palpable matter, then there is no
 object in attributing to it an exemption from the otherwise uni
 versal law of gravitation; and it will then be imperceptible only
 because it exists beyond our reach.           Moreover, as there are no
means of limiting the possible amount of molecular displace
ment in a medium so attenuated, an amount of vis viva is con
ceivable suf<U+FB01>cient to impart effective motion to inde<U+FB01>nitely denser
matter ; and thus this denizen of in<U+FB01>nity may be assumed capa
ble of executing its divine mission of imparting to material worlds
those essentials to corporeal existence, the very main-springs of
organic life—light and heat.

heat developed in a metallic disk rotating rapidly in the exhausted
receiver of an air-pump*. That the periodic retardation of Encke’s
comet is due to the resistance of the universal medium is highly
probable ; but this experiment, if it proves anything in the same
direction, proves a great deal too much: for if such be the vis
cosity of the medium h pothetically present in the receiver, that
the addition of a nota 1e quantity of air (5 or 10 per cent. as
was stated) makes no sensible difference in the heat generated
by friction, it is dif<U+FB01>cult to conceive how any of us have hitherto
escaped resolution into our gaseous elements.             On the contrary,
when our earth and its envelope enters a probable atmosphere of
orbitating fragments (of which we have recently had such a mag
ni<U+FB01>cent experience), some of these crumbs of the universe which
have for an inde<U+FB01>nite period harmlessly traversed the aethereal
medium of in<U+FB01>nite space, at the enormous velocity of perhaps
30 or 40 miles in a second, become immediately ignited, and
probably consumed by friction in the con<U+FB01>nes of our atmosphere,
which must there be attenuated to a degree never yet attained,
except perhaps in the vacuum-tubes of Mr. Gassiot.
    Permit me in conclusion to repudiate (needlessly perhaps) any
claim to originality in the general idea that the molecules of pal
pable mater are permeable to the undulations of light, which has
long since been ably advocated by Euler and by Mr. Grove'l'.

       HE brothers Weber, in their investigations into           the laws of
         waves, have described the following experiment §:-—“            If a
 tuning-fork is <U+FB01>xed in a lathe so that it can be made to revolve
 about the longitudinal axis of the stem, the sound of the vibra
 ting fork is observed to cease when the speed of revolution has
 reached a certain point, but it becomes again perceptible if the
 driving-wheel of the lathe is suddenly stopped.               This pheno
 menon cannot be explained by supposing it to be due to the
 drowning of the sound of the fork by the noise of the lathe; for
 even when one end of a cylindrical tube is brought near the
 prongs, and the ear is put at the other end of the tube, it becomes

evident that the rotation does not prevent the vibration of the
tuning-fork, but simply the communication of the motion to the
air. As yet we are unable to give any explanation of this re
                                                                  '
markable phenomenon.”
     I repeated    this  experiment   a long  time   ago,   but    arrived at a
quite    different   result, an account   of which   I laid  before    the Phy
sical Society of Berlin*.         I in fact never heard the sound of the
tuning~fork cease, but only become weaker; but I distinctly
heard at the same time a higher tone, as well as a series of beats
which coincided in number with the number of half-revolutions
of the tuning-fork.           MM. W. and E. H.cher, to whom I
communicated my discordant result, unfortunately could not
again <U+FB01>nd the tuning-fork which they had used.                  Professor W.
 Weber, however, wrote me that it was a common aa-fork, and
suggested that the reason why the higher tone had not been
 perceptible in their experiments was that they had employed a
slower and more noisy lathe. But a satisfactory explanation was
 still wanting.
     My attention was lately recalled to this almost forgotten ob
 servation by Konig’s beautiful experiment, in which the tone of
 a tuning-fork sounds higher when it is approaching the ear, so
 that the number of beats which it gave with another fork while
 at rest is altered by its motion-1‘.           The idea easily suggested
 itself that tones of different pitch must reach the car from the
 two prongs of the rotating tuning-fork, since one is moving
 towards the ear and the other away from it.                  I consequently
 took up my experiments again ; but this time they have led me
 to an entirely di<U+FB02>'erent view of the phenomenon.                               _
     The excellent tuning-forks which are now available allow of the
 experiment being made in a very decisive manner. I used prin
 cipally a “middle c”-fork (512 vibrations), by Lange of Berlin,
 and a cc-fork (1024 vibrations I) , by Konig of Paris ; the prongs
 of the former were 155 millims. long, and those of the latter
  100 millims.        The section of the prongs of both forks was rect
 angular,    as  is usually the case in tuning-forks; at the point, the
 prongs     of the  “ middle c”-f0rk measured 11 millims. by 6 mil
  lims., and those of the cc-fork 14 millims. by 6 millims., the
  smaller dimension being in both cases in the direction in which
 the fork vibrates when sounded.             When these forks were <U+FB01>xed
  in the lathe and set in rotation at the rate of about twelve turns
  in a second, after being caused to vibrate, the tone 0 rose about
  three-quarters of a tone, and so a little more than half a tone.

536             Prof. W. Beetz on         the Tones produced
At    the same time the beats already mentioned were noticed, two
 occurring in every revolution.         In order to make the rise of
 pitch distinct to those who have dif<U+FB01>culty in discriminating
 pitch, it is only necessary to place a sounding-box directly under
  the rotating fork.    If the box be tuned to the pitch of the fork, on
  slowly turning the latter the phenomenon of interference observed
  by the brothers Weber is perceived.        On turning more rapidly,
  the tone of fork makes a squalling slide upwards; but if the
  sounding-box is now tuned gradually higher, the tone becomes
  clearer and clearer until the pitch has been raised to the extent
 above stated.     The rise of pitch is likewise heard exceedingly
 well when a Helmholtz’ s resonator, tuned to the note of the ro
 tating fork, is put into the ear. This phenomenon, however,
 has nothing whatever to do with the communication of sound by
 the sounding body to the air, or with its propagation by the latter;
 for the rise of pitch and the beats are heard as well, or even
 better, when the ears are stopped and the head is rested against
 any part of the lathe.       The phenomenon is thus entirely objec
 tive, and consists in a real increase of the rate of vibration of
 the fork.    It is in fact only another form of Foucault’s pendu
 lum-experiment.       The vibrations tend to continue in the same
 plane as that in which they were produced; they are thus, as it
 were, transmitted to a thicker bar, and so produce ahigher tone.
 The amplitude of the vibrations at the same time becomes
 smaller,- gradually, however, it increases again, and reaches a
 minimum* every time that the fork returns to its original posi-.
 tion, or to one differing from it by 180°.          It is thus that the
 beats are produced ; the number of them is consequently of course
 only half as great as that of the beats heard in Weber’s inter
 ference-experiment.       If the fork turns only slowly, the plane of
 vibration turns with     it,and in this case the fundamental tone     is
heard alone without beats       ; on turning more quickly, objective
 beats soon arise, and the tone rises at the same time, but never
to an extent corresponding to the vibrations of rod whose thick
                                                         a
ness  is  equal to the longer cross section of the prongs of the
fork.
     In con<U+FB01>rmation of the correctness of this explanatiOn,        I also
made experiments with two smaller forks to which               could give

ran very noiselessly.      The prongs of one of the forks (gg) were
6   millims. wide and 1'5 millim. thick (the thickness being mea
sured in the direction in which the bow          applied to the fork to

wide and   6  millims. thick.     When the forks were set in rotation,
the tone of the gg fork rose         fourth, and that of the can fork
                                      a
fell half  a  tone.    In the case of the latter fork, a third and

somewhat       higher tone could be heard, due, no doubt, to the
 greatest   thickness   of the prongs being in the direction of the
 diagonal of their cross section, and the plane of vibration having
 to pass through this direction before it could reach that of their
 width.               .
     The experiment is much more striking, because simpler, when
  it is made with a single rod instead of with a tuning-fork.               I
 could not <U+FB01>nd a rod which would sound loud enough and long
 enough when <U+FB01>xed at one end ; but the experiment succeeds ad
 mirably with a rod which is free at both ends.             A steel rod 1
 metre long, 16 millims. wide, and 8 millims. thick was hung by
 one end to a thread which formed a prolongation of the axis of
 the rod.         I
              If now grasped any one of its nodal points gently
 between my <U+FB01>nger and thumb, and caused it to sound by a blow
 with a soft hammer, I obtained the note corresponding to its
 width or to its thickness, according to the direction in which            I
 struck it,—for instance, when it was vibrating with <U+FB01>ve nodal
 points in the direction of the thickness, the tone gg ; and when
 it vibrated similarly in the direction of the width, the tone g.
 If, however, the rod is struck in the former direction and then
 turned round through 90°, the tone g is heard distinctly and
 almost by itself; while, if it is struck in the latter direction and
 then turned through 90°, the tone gg is heard as distinctly.
 Here, then, the plane of vibration actually remains quite constant.
 If the thread is twisted and then let go after the rod has been
 struck, both notes are produced as the rod rotates, and in the
 intervals a droning of other tones corresponding to oblique di
 rections across the sectional surfaces.       A cylindrical rod treated
just in the same way, gave its fundamental note as a continuous
 steady sound.      If the parallelepipedic rod is allowed to hang
 quietly while sounding, and the ear is carried round               it, no
changes of tone are perceived        ; but if   it    hung by
                                                     is        a  twisted
thread held between the teeth, the ears being stopped, the alter
 nations of tone and the beats are at once heard.             The pheno
 menon  is   consequently here again completely independent of the
propagation of sound through the air.                                .
 I     attempted to make the phenomenon visible           by   means of    a
\Vheatstone’s kaleidophone, using for the purpose         a  beautiful in
strument     by  Konig, with six rods.    The experiment succeeds very
 well with the cylindrical rod, as has been already described              by
 Foucault*. The vibration-<U+FB01>gure as seen in the knob, whether
 the straight line, the ellipse, or the circle, remained quite sta
tionary, thus proving that the plane of vibration was really con
stant. I      hoped to see a   similar stability in the vibration-curves
of the other rods; but with these such entangled forms were
produced that     I   abandoned all the rest and
                                                      con<U+FB01>ned myself to

faces of the rods.   On setting the rod in rotation, this straight
line by no means remained at rest; on the contrary, <U+FB01>gures were
produced which I was surprised to <U+FB01>nd were alike for all the
rods, though their width and thickness bore the most varied pro
portions to each other, but which depended on the rate of rota

rates of rotation gave <U+FB01>gures formed by lines which did not re
turn into themselves, and which therefore had a less sharply
marked appearance.      All these <U+FB01>gures arise in the following
manner :—If the plane of vibration of a rod remained constant,
its vibrations would have a smaller amplitude in the direction
of its greatest thickness, and a larger amplitude in that of its
least thickness.    Hence we should see a stationary streak of
light, in which the turning points a, b, c, and d (<U+FB01>g. 5), Fig. 5.
where the knob is momentarily at rest, would appear
brightest.     Such freedom_of motion     is, however, only
partially possible in the case of the <U+FB01>rmly <U+FB01>xed pris
matic rod; and consequently the <U+FB01>gure turns round,
more slowly than the rod, but quickly enough to produce
the appearance shown in <U+FB01>g. 4!.       The more slowly the
rod rotates, in comparison with its number of vibrations,
the oftener does its shifting principal plane of vibration cross its
original position of equilibrium during one revolution ;    and thus
are produced knotted or looped <U+FB01>gures, among which <U+FB01>gs.

dily formed in proportion as the rod vibrates more slowly. The
<U+FB01>gures which    a rod which is not vibrating at right angles to one
of its faces exhibits on rotation are compounded of these and
the well-known kaleidophonic <U+FB01>gures.

  Note on the foregoing Paper.      By Professor G. C. Fos'ran.
    On repeating the remarkable experiment which forms the
starting-point of Professor Beetz’s interesting paper, I obtained,
as was of course to be expected, a result completely in accord
ance with what he has described.       A gg tuning-fork, by Konig,
making 384 complete vibrations per second (marked “$013 768”),
the prongs of which were 115 millims. long by 15 millims. wide
and 7'5 millims. thick, was set in rotation by means of a lathe
at the rate of from eighteen to twenty turns per second.      Under
these circumstances its tone rose almost exactly a minor third,
the alteration of pitch being judged of by comparison with an
organ-pipe whose note could be altered by means of a sliding
 paper tube put on at the top.      The effect upon the ear of the
rapid succession of beats which accompanied the tone of the ro
tating fork was exactly that of a harsh discord, thus affording a
 striking illustration of Helmholtz’s theory of the nature of dis
cords in general (Tonemp<U+FB01>ndunyen, pp. 251 et seq., also p. 293).
    The principle of Professor Beetz’s beautiful explanation of his
 experiments may be very simply illustrated by means of a pen!
 dulum whose time of' vibration is unequal in two planes at right
 angles to each other.     A ready and effectual means of construct
 ing  such   a pendulum   was  pointed out to me two or three years
 ago   by Professor  Sir William  Thomson : it consists in fastening
 the two ends of a piece of string to two points in the same hori
 zontal line, the distance between them being considerably less
 than the length of the string, and hanging a weight by a second
 string to the middle point of the <U+FB01>rst. The strings and weight
 thus form a pendulum of the shape of' the letter Y. The total
 length of the pendulum employed by me as an illustration of
 Professor Beetz’s experiments was 56 inches, and the length
 from the middle point of the line joining the two points of sus
 pension (which were 201} inches apart) to the bottom of the fork
 of the Y was 42 inches; so that its time of vibration in the ver
 tical plane containing the points of suspension was half as great
 as its time of vibration perpendicularly to this plane.   On giving
 the pendulum a small motion in the former plane and then sud
 denly causing the line joining the points of suspension to turn
 horizontally about its middle point through 90°, the pendulum
 still oscillated almost exclusively in its original plane, but its
 time of oscillation was doubled and the amplitude also increased
 on turning the line of suspension through 90° more, or back
 again to its former position, the pendulum oscillated as at <U+FB01>rst.
 In order that this experiment may Succeed well, it is needful to
'alter the position of the line of suspension as rapidly as possible;
 if it is turned slowly, the plane of oscillation of the pendulum
 turns with it,   and nearly to the same extent.

 of oxidation, which they sometimes make use of to aid in determi
 ning the structure of the substance and its place in the general

    Of late years increasing attention has been paid to these oxi
  dation-products, which, owing to the labours of Kolbe, Berthelot,
Wurtz,     and the researches which have been carried on in the la
 boratory of the London Institution, have assumed an unlocked
 for importance, and the study of which is so full of the promise
 of an insight into the mysteries of chemical structure.
     Notwithstanding all this, the processes of oxidation hitherto
 used by chemists are crude and wanting in precision—always ex

                      “

 tainty and precision.
    If we refer to Limpricht’s excellent Lehrbuch der organischen
  Chemie, 1862, p. 118, we <U+FB01>nd that when alcohol is distilled with
 bichromate of potash and dilute sulphuric acid, or with peroxide
 of manganese and dilute sulphuric acid, it gives aldehyde, acetic
 acid, formic acid, acetic ether, and acetal.    We read moreover
 that when the oxidation of alcohol is effected by means of nitric
 acid in the cold, glyoxal, glyoxylic acid, glycolic acid, oxalic acid,
 acetic acid, and' formic acid <U+FB01>gure as oxidation-products.          In
 fact, the prevalent idea of the oxidation-process,   as was well ex
 pressed by an eminent chemist on a recent occasion at the Che
 mical Society, is, that    by
                            applying the oxidizing agent one obtains
certain proximate products which undergo            gradual breaking

                             chemists towards the oxidation-pro

                          myself in 1863, when, in the progress of
the research on the hexyl group, working in conjunction with
Erlenmeyer, the observation was made that beta-hexyl alcohol'gave
acids of less complexity than caproic acid.    Before could attach

much value to the result,     took care to assure myself that there
                               I

                                      I
distilled rapidly with bichromate of potash and dilute sulphuric
acid, taking care that the oxidation was incomplete, and that an
oil distilled over along with an aqueous layer of liquid.       Potash
was added to the oil and the aqueous layer.       That portion of the
oil insoluble in potash was then put back and oxidized afresh, and
so the assurance was attained that,    caproic acid were formed and
                                           if

capable of even momentary resistance to the action of dilute chro
mic acid, it would have been preserved.       It is worthy of remark
that so successful was the effort to obtain the most complex fatty
acid which could result, that the butyric acid actually obtained
appears to be pseudo-butylic acid.
   These examples will serve to give an idea of the state of our
knowledge of the oxidation-process up to the present day.
    Before proceeding to describe the immense improvement which
has been made by Chapman and Thorp in the conduct of the
0xidati0n~process, it is only right to call attention to my own
oxidation of the propione got from carbonic oxide and sodium
ethyle.    Having totally failed to oxidize propione by distilling
it in an open retort with bichromate of potash and dilute ul
phuric acid, I sealed it up with excess of bichromate of potash
and dilute sulphuric acid, and heated for many hours in the
water-bath.     The propione slowly disappeared, but, in spite of
the prolonged action of the dilute chromic acid, n0 carbonic acid
made its appearance ; and after the termination of the experiment,
propionic as well as acetic acid was found in the tube.         This
result, by which the extreme persistence of propionic and acetic
acids was established, is the germ which, in the hands of my
friends Chapman and Thorp, has developed so magni<U+FB01>cently.
Chapman and Thorp have shown that, although strong chromic
acid, as is well known, performs an utter oxidation down to car
bonic acid and water, yet dilute chromic acid behaves absolutely
differently.    The current notion of the oxidation-process is ap
plicable  to strong  chromic acid, but not to dilute chromic acid.
In an aqueous solution of 8 per cent. of bichromate of potash
with just enough sulphuric acid to decompose it completely, che
mists are furnished with a reagent which is absolutely without
action on the acids of the fatty series at temperatures below
100° C. An exception is made for formic acid, which, as has
often been remarked, is not a characteristic member of the fatty
series.
    Not only are the fatty acids unattackable when ready formed,
but they are unattackable when nascent.         And besides the acids
of the fatty series, and benzoic acid and perhaps its homologues,
organic chemistry hardly includes a compound which is capable
of resistance to the prolonged action of this normal solution of
chromic acid.     It is hardly p0ssible to overrate the importance OI
this discovery of Chapman and Thorp. Before it all the crude
ness and want of precision vanishes from the oxidation-process.
We have a second order of combustion—a “limited oxidation "—
wherein the place of carbonic acid and water is supplied by the
different fatty acids which <U+FB01>gure as ultimate products, as unal
terable by the oxidation-agent used as are carbonic acid and
water by excess of oxygen at a red heat.

THE“Spectroscopic       Observations of the Sun.”               By   J.   Norman
 Lockyer, F.R.A.S.
    The two most recent theories dealing with the physical constitu
 tion of the sun are due to M. Faye and to Messrs. De la Rue,
 Balfour Stewart, and Loewy.        The chief point of difference in these
 two   theories is the  explanation    given by each of the phenomena of
 sun-spots.
    Thus, according to M. Faye       4“,  the interior of the sun         is
                                                                         ne    a
 bulous gaseous mass of feeble radiating-power, at          temperature of
                                                            a
 dissociation; the                  is, on the other hand, of       high ra
                                                                     a
 diating-power, an (photosphere
                        ata   temperature suf<U+FB01>ciently low to permit of
 chemical action.     In sun-spot we see the interior nebulous mass
                          a
through an opening in the photosphere, caused by an upward current,
 and the sun-spot    is   black, by reason of the feeble radiating-power
 of the nebulous mass.
    In the theory held by Messrs. De la Rue, Stewart, and Loewy'l',
 the appearances connected with sun-spots are referred to the effects,
cooling and absorptive, of an inrush, or descending current, of the
sun’s atmosphere, which        known to be colder than the photosphere.

    In June 1865 communicated to the Royal Astronomical Society
                I                                                                  I
some observations (referred to by the authors last named) which
had led me independently to the same conclusion as the one an
nounced by them.       The observations indicated that, instead of spot    a
being caused    by an upward current,      it  caused by
                                                is          adownward one,
and that the results, or, at all events, the concomitants of the down
ward current are     a dimming and possible vaporization of the cloud
masses carried down.      I    was led to hold that the current had                a
downward direction by the fact that one of the cloud-masses ob
served passed in succession, in the space ofabout two hours, through
the various orders of brightness exhibited by fat-alas, general surface,
and penumbra.
    On March 4th of the present year        I   commenced      spectroscopic

observation of sun-spots, with     a   view of endeavouring to test the
two rival theories, and especially of following up the observations
before alluded to.
    The method adopted was to apply

there was also a <U+FB01>ne slit corresponding to that of the spectroscope.
   By this method it is possible to observe at one time the spectra
of the umbra of a spot and of the adjoining photosphere or penum
bra; unfortunately, however, favourable conditions of spot           e. as (i.
to size, position on the disk, and absence “ of cloudy stratum”),

                              I

have had no opportunities of repeating my observations.          Hence            I I
should have hesitated still longer to lay them before the Royal So
ciety had not M. Faye again recently called attention to the subject.

the centre of the umbra of the small spot then visible fell on the
middle of the slit in the screen,- which, like the corresponding one in
the spectroscope, was longer than the diameter of the umbra, the
solar spectrum was observed in the <U+FB01>eld of view of the spectro
scope with its central portion (corresponding to the diameter of the
umbra falling on the slit) greatly enfeebled in brilliancy.
    All the absorption-bands, however, visible in the spectrum of the
photosphere, above and below, were visible in the spectrum of the
spot; they, moreover, appeared thicker where they crossed the spot
spectrum.
 I    was unable to detect the slightest indication of any bright
bands, although the spectrum was suf<U+FB01>ciently feeble,       think, to have

    The dispersive power of the spectroscope employed was not suf
 <U+FB01>cient to enable me to determine whether the decreased brilliancy
 of the spot-spectrum was due in any measure to greater number

 of the bands in the spot-spectrum, as compared with their thickness
 in the photosphere-spectrum, was real or apparent only*.

 that spectrum analysis has already been applied to the stars with
 such success,      it not too much to think that an attentive and
                         is
 detailed spectroscopic examination of the sun’s surface may bring
 us much knowledge bearing on the physical constitution of that
 luminary. For instance,       the theory of absorption be true, we may
                                  if
 suppose that in      deep spot rays might be absorbed which would
                      a
 escape absorption in the higher strata of the atmosphere; hence
 also the darkness of aline may depend somewhat on the depth of the

      l. “ On marine fossiliferous deposits of Secondary Age in New
    South Wales.”   By the Rev. W. B. Clarke, M.A., F.G.S.
      In Australia, until the year 1860, the existence of deposits of
    Secondary age had not been demonstrated, although Sir T. L.
    Mitchell, in 1846, collected Belcmnites and a few other fossils,
    which are now said to belong to a Lower Secondary formation.
    Since the year 1860, Secondary fossils have been collected by several
    explorers; and the author therefore gave a history of their discovery,
    with lists of the genera and of some      the species found in each
                                                _of
    locality.  His own investigations of the country near the Maranoa
    River, in Queensland, and the examination of collections sent to
    him from localities between there and the Flinders River, have led
    him to the belief there exist in that area formations ranging from
    the Trias up to the Cretaceous.     Mr. Clarke also stated that the
    deposits occurring on the eastern and western sides of Australia do
    not seem to be identical, fossils of the age of the Lias and Inferior
.   Oolite having alone been obtained from the latter.

         “ On the Madreporaria of the Infra-lies of South Wales."       By
    P. Martin Duncan, M.B. Lond., Sec. G.S.
       Referring <U+FB01>rst to Mr. Tawney’s paper on the Sutton Stone, and
    his own note on the Corals, appended thereto, as having been the
    <U+FB01>rstfruits of the recent researches on the Infra-lies in South Wales,
    Dr. Duncan stated that in preparing this communication he had
    been largely indebted to Mr. Charles Moore for the specimens
    which he had examined, as well as for a considerable amount of
    information embodied in the descriptions of the deposits.     He then
    described the strata of Brocastle and Ewenny, giving lists of their
    fossils, and especially of the new species of Madreporaria described
    in this paper, and illustrated by lithographs prepared for the Palae
    ontographical Society; he then stated his views of their geological
    position, their relations to, and differences from the zone of Am
    monites Bucklandi and the strata in France and Luxembourg which
    have the same homotaxis, and gave     ageneral view of the distribution
    of the Madreporaria from the Keuper to the zone of Ammonites
    Bucklandi.    The chief conclusions were :—(1) that the fossilifewus
    beds of Sutton, Southerndown, Brocastle, and Ewenny are important
    members of the series which intervenes between the Trias and the

         Mr. H. Woodward     on the Structure  of the Xiphosura.     545
 beds containing Ammonites Bucklendi, Gryphwa incurva, Lima gi
 gantea, &c., and which has been named the Infra-lias; (2) that the
  Mollusca and certain well-known species of Madreporaria, which
  are grouped together at Brocastle, have similar relations to each
  other in the Calcaire de Valogne, in the zone of Ammonites Moreanus
 of the Cote d'Or, and in the Grés de Luxembourg; and (3) that
 the above-mentioned beds in Wales, constituting         a coralliferous
 horizon, are the equivalents of the Upper beds of the French and
 Luxembourgian Infra-lias.
     3. “On some points in the structure of the Xiphosura, having
 reference to their relationship with the Eurypterida.”      By Henry
 Woodward, Esq., F.G.S., F.Z.S., of the British Museum.
     The author pointed out that Prof. M’Coy’s tribe Paecilopoda was
 intended to include the Limuli, with Eurypterus, Pterygotus, and
 Belinurus.    Prof. Huxley had already shown (in 1859) that this
 classi<U+FB01>cation was founded upon an erroneous interpretation of the
 fossils, then (1849) only known in England by extremely frag
 mentary remains.
    The object of this communication was to demonstrate that although
 Prof. M’Coy‘s classi<U+FB01>cation was based on conjecture rather than
 upon a minute acquaintance with the anatomy of these extinct forms,
yet the subsequent researches of Profs. Agassiz and Hall in America,
 Prof. Nieszkowski in Russia, and the independent investigations of
Mr.    J. W. Salter and the author in this country have shown that a
 close relationship actually does exist between the Xiphosura and
 the Eurypterida.
    The author then gave a detailed comparison of the structure of
 these two divisons, which he proposed to call suborders of Dr. Dana’s
 order Merostomata.      He also pointed out that the Xiphosura were
 divisable into three genera z—lst, Belinurus, Baily, having 5 freely
 articulated thoracic segments, and 3 anchylosed abdominal ones and
 a telson; 2nd, Prestwichia, a new genus, having the thoracic and
 abdominal segments anchylosed together; and 3rd, Limulus, Miiller,
 having a head composed of 7 cephalic and l thoracic segments,
followed by 5 coalesced thoracic somites bearing branchiae, and l or
more coalesced apodal abdominal somites, to which is articulated
the telson.    Although so great a dissimilarity exists between Ptery
gotus and Limulus, yet in the genera Hemiaspis, Erapinurus, and
Pseudoniscus we have forms which, in the number of body-rings,
are intermediate.                                            .
    The order Merostomata offers a parallel group to the Decapoda,
the Eurypterida representing the Macrura. and the Xiphosura the
Brachyura. The author did not, however, intend by this comparison
to indicate that Limulus was higher in the Crustacean scale than
Pterygotus, but rather that the former was one of those low but
persistent types (like the Brachiopoda) which have remained un
changed through long geological ages. whilst forms capable of
further development, like Pterygotus, have been modi<U+FB01>ed and swept
away.                          .

 circumstance that a transparent grease-spot on a sheet of paper
 disappears when both sides of the paper are illuminated with equal
 brightness.    In most cases the <U+FB02>ame of the normal candle, serving
 as unit of light, is directly compared with the light to be measured.
 In Desaga’s instrument, in accordance with the principle of double
 weighing, it is compared with a gas-<U+FB02>ame burning inside a case,
 which <U+FB02>ame is adjusted to the normal candle.          In all these instru
 ments a displacement of one or the other of the <U+FB02>ames is necessary,
 which carries with it many inconveniences.
    This displacement may be avoided by placing the screen on which
 is the transparent spot so that it can be turned, and providing it
 with an alidade, so as to read it oil”. The brightness of an illumi
 nated surface, independently of the intensity of the source of light
 and the distance, depends upon the angle at which it is illuminated :
 it is proportional to the cosine of the angle of incidence, to the
 sine of the angle which the rays make with the face. If, then, two
 sources of light to be compared are so placed that their rays cross
 at right angles, and if the rotating screen be so placed that it is
 lighted on both sides by these with an equal intensity of light, the
 angle of irradiation of each must be equal (that is, 45°) if the spot is to
 be invisible.   With unequal intensity of light, the screen of the bright
 <U+FB02>ame must be turned towards and that of the weaker away from
 their respective lights to produce disappearance in the spot.
     If the angle for the <U+FB02>ame of the brightness (I)=a, it is for the
 other, (I,),=90-—a, and we have the equations
                       I sin (i=1; sin  (90—0),
                       I tan (1:1,.
 Hence the intensity of the light of one source as compared with the
 other may be measured by the tangent of the angle of rotation.
    The premisses for the accuracy of this method :—
    (1) Absolute transparence of the greased paper,
    (2) Perfectly scattered re<U+FB01>exion of light—cannot be assumed with
complete accuracy.        The side directly illuminated always appears
 brighter than the transparent spot ; and hence a double placing of the
 screen and a twofold reading off are indispensable, the mean value
 of which gives the true position, and therewith the true value of a.
    The errors arising from the circumstance that the quantity of
 light not diffused, and also of the light passing through the paper,
 at di<U+FB01>'erent angular positions of the screen must differ are usually
 outside the limits of observation, and at most only deserve con
 sideration if the angle of inclination of the rays towards the surface
 is on the one side a very small, and on the' other a correspondingly
 large angle,—a case which cannot occur in the practical use of the
 instrument.                                  .
    It must <U+FB01>nally be mentioned that, when there is a very great
 difference of the intensities of light, the angle whose tangent is to

 serve as measure may easily be too large, and hence the accuracy
 of the observation be materially restricted.   In such cases it is best
 to place from the outset the stronger source of light at double or
 treble the distance, and to multiply the corresponding angles by
 4 or by 9.    For use in the determination of gas-<U+FB02>ames, which have
 usually  from  5 or 6 to 10 or 14 times the intensity of the normal
 candle, it is advisable, owing to the easiness   the multiplication, to 0_f_
 replace the distances   and by   2  and    310,—thus, for instance,

      CONDUCTIVITY 0F MERCURY FOR HEAT.            BY G. GRIPON.
   This was determined by the method of Despretz and Peclet.       Ex
pressed in Peclet’s unit      =1'67 (lead =3'S4).
                                      it   is         Hence the con
ductivity of mercury for heat    =0'407 that of lead. If the conduc

tivity of silver be made equal 100, that of mercury    3'54,—that is,            is
greater than that of marble, and somewhat greater than that of gas
coke. As the conductivity of mercury for electricity    = 1'80 (silver           is
=100),         seen that these two numbers do not coincide as
