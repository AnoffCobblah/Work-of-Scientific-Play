   I. Remarks on Dr. Mills's Researches on Thermometry.
By T. E. THORPE, Ph.D., F.R.S., and A. W. RücKER, M.A.”
     PAPER by Dr. Mills, F.R.S., entitled “Researches on
A. Thermometry,”       has recently been published in the Trans
actions of the Royal  Society of             for 1880. We are
ourselves  engaged  in a comparison   of the air- and mercurial
thermometers; and therefore, when Dr. Mills was good enough
to send us a copy of his paper, we naturally read it with con
siderable care and interest.  Of the labour which he has ex
pended on several difficult thermometer-corrections we cannot
speak too highly; but there are a number of points concern
ing which it would be desirable to have further information.
Some of the difficulties we have found may be due either to
errors, or to insufficient explanation of the terms and symbols
used; and in view of the latter possibility and to avoid mis
understanding, we have been compelled to discuss the very
simple mathematical formulae employed with what may be
thought excessive minuteness.     Dr. Mills divides his paper
into six sections; and we shall head our remarks concerning
any one of them by the title which he has affixed to      The  it.
sections   are:—
    I.     Calibration and the calibration unit.
    II.    The correction for the exposed thread.             -
  III.     The movement         of
                               the zero with (1) time and (2)
            temperature.

   IV.     Poggendorff's      correction.
     W. Comparison of the mercurial with the air-thermometer.
   VI. Effect of compression.
   In    the present paper we confine our observations to the
second and third of these points; in a subsequent communica
tion we may have something to remark on the others.
                       The Exposure Correction.
   An account is given of a very lengthy series of experiments
made to determine the correction due to the difference between
the temperatures of the mercury in the bulb and in the stem
of a thermometer when the latter is not immersed in the source
of heat. This has usually been expressed as follows:–If N
is the number of exposed scale-divisions,                          T-t the difference
between the      readings      of the          principal         thermometer and of a
 second thermometer attached halfway up the exposed column,
and ifyis the correction (of course expressed in scale-divisions),
then
                        y=.0001545 (T-t)N.
The number 0001545 is the coefficient of the apparent expan
sion of mercury in glass; but there is no doubt (as Holtzmann,
Mousson, and Wüllner have long since pointed out) that this
makes the value of y too great.
   Dr. Mills deduces from his experiments a corrected formula
of the form
                        y= (a+8N) (T-t)N.
 The expression     a +8N, for shortness, he indicates                    by e.   We
have here two      points   to notice.
   Dr. Mills finds that a has different values for different                     ther
mometers, and then says (on p. 571):-‘‘The values of y agree
§    e. in the case of the undernoted thermometers], first when
    has the following values:—
               Thermometer.                                         N.
                     2    - - - - - - tºa a- - - - - - - - - - -   0-0
                     6    .....................                  1232”
   It   is evident that y is here a misprint for w, as y must
vanish when N = 0, and can vanish for no other positive value
of N. Hence it is impossible for the correction for a thermo
meter with an exposed column 166 divisions long to be equal
to that of another when no part of the column is exposed; for
the former cannot (unless T=t), and the latter must, be zero.
   For equal values of         T-t,        the correction for thermometers 2

                                         Zero Movements.
  With regard to                    the investigation
                                     of the movement of the
zero, we would remark that it would have been simpler to use
a formula which expressed the use of the zero directly. The
expression adopted by Prof. Mills is
                                         y=Ax'+B8*,
where a measures the time, and A, B, a and 8 are constants.
The quantity y is called the total remaining ascent, and “A-FB
represents the total ascent,” i. e. the whole rise up to some
fixed time.
  The rise of the zero                   (Z) up      to the time         w   is therefore     evi
dently
                                         Z= A + B-y;
and the tables would have been more useful had this quantity
Z been given instead of y.
   The account of the movement of the zero with temperature
is so involved that it constitutes a riddle which it took us
some time to read.    We quote the opening sentence:—
  “It  has long been known that the immersion of a thermo
meter into boiling water almost invariably lowers the zero.
The only consecutive series of observations of the effect of
temperature that            I
                    have been able to find is due to Henrici".
His results are readily comprised in the equation
                       y=2.100(.981)*–099(1-360);
y being the total remaining ascent, and the unit of a being
10°C. The starting-point of the observations was 50° C.;
and the depressions were consecutively observed at every 10°
to 100°.

neither the formula nor the table gave any hint, viz. that
thermometer 455 behaved differently from                            and that
 the zero ascended under the influence of heat.                 As      what                to
 the nature of this ascent was we are             the dark.  in  Does Prof.
 Mills mean that the first heating depressed the zero, and that
 by   subsequent heatings this depression was diminished                   Or                      ?
does      hemean that the first heating raised the zero, and that
subsequent heatings increased this elevation? We presume
the former hypothesis           the correct one; but,
                                         is                   far     we can  as        as

cases heating raised the zero, probably supplies the reason
for retaining the name “total remaining ascent,”                     descent            a

and that the relation between y and the position of the zero, as
gathered from the table given above, is
                                               = –24-y,
we are at a loss to understand this remark.         The depression
of the zero Z becomes       greater as y becomes  less;  and this is
no way affected by the passage of y through the value 0.        For
numerically increasing negative values of y we get increasing
depressions.    It seems, therefore, that the statement that the
formulae  point  to a change in the direction of the motion of the
zero is due to a confusion between Dr. Mills's y and our Z,
and that, as a matter of fact, no such change is indicated.                                                    If
we are wrong in this conclusion, we can only apologize to Dr.
Mills and ask him to state what y really means.           we should                     If
                                                                                                      if all
turn out to be    right,   we are afraid this error   upsets     the
inferences drawn by him from his formulae.           But even     we

is enlarged by outward pressure due to that cause, and the zero
descends.       If the above view be correct, it would follow that
a thermometer open to the air and kept always in a vertical
position would always exhibit a descending zero; the descent
in the first stage being due to expansion and set as before, but
in the later stages simply to the weight of the mercury acting
upon a bulb now rendered partially plastic by heat.              I  cannot
find that other investigators have left any record of such an
experiment.”          Dr. Mills then gives the following table to
show that the zero of an open thermometer observed after
heatings to 50°, 100°, 150°, and so on up to 350°, fell more
and more after each heating:—
            Zero (therm. 20).            Scale.      Depression.

   “The first     seven observations were made consecutively on
one  day,   the  eighth       nearly two days later. The temperatures
are not corrected.”
   We may point out that observations 6 and 8 in the above
table are discordant, and that, if we have to reject one, it
should rather be the eighth, which was made two days after
the others, than the sixth, which is more directly comparable
with them.        If we therefore reject the last experiment instead
of the sixth, as Dr. Mills practically does, the table is in con
tradiction to his theory, and shows a maximum depression
after the thermometer was heated to 250°.
   In any case, as the increments of the depressions at higher
temperatures are less than for the lower, we think Dr. Mills
ought to have tried whether, if these results were expressed
by a formula similar to that employed in the preceding cases,
it would not have given a minimum at some higher tempera
ture. The fact that it is impossible to carry on the experi
riments much above 350° with mercury is no reason for
regarding the formulae as less trustworthy beyond that point
than the others which were treated in this way.
   If by a rising zero is meant a zero which is less depressed after
every heating, some observations of our own prove that it is
quite possible to obtain this with an open tube. The bulb of a
Jolly's air-thermometer of about 90 cub. centim. capacity,

the stem  of which was graduated in millimetres, was exhausted
by means of a Sprengel’s air-pump and filled with mercury.
It was then placed in melting ice; and when the position of
the mercury in the stem had become constant, it was noted.
The bulb and         its
                  contents were then immersed        boiling water,            in
and the reading       melting ice was again determined.

zero was found          considerably
                         to     be     depressed;   but    the bulb                  if
was left    the temperature
            at                    the air, this depression steadily
                                             of
diminished.    The experiments         heating the bulb once and
                                                    of
observing the zero were repeated after            interval     four,     an                     of

                                      thirteen days, with the result
that after the second and third heatings the zero fell           the                             to
same position        as
                     had taken

                                     after the first. The method
of  experiment was then changed.          The bulb was raised                                         to
about 100° C.; and the water with which           was surrounded,        it
having been allowed       boil for few minutes, was run off, and
                                      to           a
the bulb was left     cool for half an hour or thereabouts.

operation  was repeated during three consecutive days,                                           in   all
twenty times; and the zero-point was determined          before.                           as
The mean depression       the zero immediately after the three
                                      of
previous boilings had been 12:38 millim.;        was now found            it
to   beonly 9:35 millim.   Twelve  days afterwards the alternate
heating and cooling was again commenced, and         the course                      in
of five days was repeated fifty times.    The depression     the                                 of

had therefore been still further reduced.

   (3) In the investigation of the movement of the zero with

the formula for y, Dr. Mills has inferred the existence of
turning-points, of which in reality it affords no indication.
If, owing     the ambiguous definition
                   to                           we are wrong,

the above    supposition, we think that the supposed higher
turning-points are too far outside the range          the experi                     of

   (4) For the reasons given we consider Dr. Mills's ex

inference drawn from them        rendered still more doubtful by
                                                     is

 14      Prof. S. P. Thompson         on the Conservation     of Electricity,
     The experimental evidence which exists forbids us, more
over, to think that the absolute quantity of electricity within
a closed surface can be altered by the transformation of an
other physical quantity into electricity.              For, indeed, electri
city belongs to a category by itself. It does not possess mass,
and therefore is not a form of ordinary matter; it does not
conform to the same physical dimensions" as energy, and there
fore cannot be in itself a form of energy. Neither matternor
energy, then, can be transformed into electricity; nor can
electricity be itself transformed into either of these physical
quantities.
     Therefore any system of electric bodies—that is to say, any
system whose parts consist of definite quantities of electricity—
must be regarded as a conservative system, and therefore sub
ject, when regarded as a system, to a definite Law of Conser
vation.
      2. These considerations have therefore               led the present
writer to propound elsewheref, in general language, a doc
 trine of the Conservation of Electricity similar to those already
recognized as holding good in the case of two other physical
entities—Matter and Energy.
     The author proposes in        É.    present paper to trace out some
 of the bearings of the doctrine of the Conservation of Elec
tricity, particularly in relation to the questions of the Distri
bution of Electricity in Space and of the Absolute Scale of
Electrification.
     3. Although the late Professor Clerk Maxwell used the
clear and emphatic language quoted above, the idea of the
ultimate Conservation of Electricity appears to have been
rejected by him, in consequence of the negative results which
attended his experimental attempt to discover whether an elec
    *  Matter has dimensions [M], Energy [ML*T*], and Electricity

Law of Coulomb, that Qx0+L' = force =[MLT-"]; whence

But    the dimensions of self-attractive  matter may be similarly considered
by Newton's Law that      —M.M-L*=          force =[MLTT"),    whence
                              M=[–L*T**].                                       \
And if this    value be put in place of   M in  the dimensions of Q above, we
get   Q=[V-I(L*T*)],         a quantity whose dimensions differ, only from
those of M in being prefixed by the imaginary quantity            V-1.    This
seems to indicate an important relation.                                      -

    tric current possesses momentum". He expressed himself as
    of opinion that, were any such action to be discovered, we
    should be able to regard “one of the so-called kinds of elec
    tricity” as a “real substance,” and “we should be able to
    describe the electric current as a true motion of this substance
    in a particular direction.” The experiment which Maxwell
    chose wherewith to test this question consisted in starting a
    current suddenly in a horizontal conducting ring or coil, sus
    pended by a thin wire in a space in which the horizontal com
    ponent of magnetic force was absent.           He then expected to
     find that, “if electricity were a fluid like water,” then at the
     moment of starting the current, and while          velocity was        its                            in
     creasing, there would          mechanical reaction upon the con

                is                                  energy      the cur                     of to

 kinetic energy of a moving body is equal to the half-pro
duct of       its
                mass into the square         the velocity    of space              in                of    its
centre       inertia,

external conditions”.
  It    would appear, then, that kinetic energy may                    either            be    of
of    two kinds—ponderokinetic and electrokinetic; and that
potential energy may also               two kinds—namely, either the
                                              be    of

the three conserved physical quantities, Matter, Energy, and

                        zircon, rutile, and cassiterite have been long
         looked upon as isomorphous, zircon has been, till within
the last three years, remarkable for the absence of the twin
  rowth which is so usual a feature in the other two species.
  n 1878. Herr Otto Meyerf, in a paper relative to the rocks
met with in the St. Gotthard tunnel, called attention to the
fact that zircon was present in considerable quantity as a mi
croscopic constituent of some of the crystalline schists, and
further observed that the minute crystals were occasionally
twinned according to the same twin plane (10                   as the crys
tals of rutile and cassiterite.                            }
                                        In the same year Herr Hussakf
mentioned his discovery of simple microscopic twins of zircon
according to the same law in the eklogite from Styria, and
of both simple and polysynthetic twins in the mica schist of
the St. Gotthard tunnel. One of the crystals was measured
by him, and found to be 0.16 millim. long and 0.04 millim.
broad.
    Very lately large crystals of zircon have been found at Ren
frew in Canada. The largest specimen which has yet reached
this country weighs 408 grams: it is a simple crystal presenting
the forms 3110}, {111;, and $221}.                   A  second specimen,
weighing 52.785 grams, is of great              in

was found by measurement to be 44° 47', a result sufficiently
near to the calculated value 44°50' to prove that the growth is
really due to twinning about the above-mentioned plane (101).

    The experiments were actually made on a height of 11
 centim.; and the values obtained for t were half those given in
 the table.   Each result is a mean of seven determinations.
     From the above comparison, it appears that the product of
 the number of seconds t (less a constant t) into the square of
 the diameter d of the cylinder is a constant quantity c. The
 time of ascent through a cylinder of infinite diameter would
 have been t=6'10 seconds.            The law, however, shows indica
 tions of failure when the diameter is narrowed to 2.2 centim.
     5. Table II. contains the results of some experiments with
  recently-boiled water, at 15°, and another bulb. The time is
  calculated to seconds.      Each result is a mean of these deter

    Since, in the ice-water form of change of state, fusion only
takes place at the surface, it seems much more probable that
it is an exchange phenomenon analogous to the change which
takes place when water is evaporating, according to the kinetic
                                                                    it is now generally aban

reached when the number of molecules escaping from the sur

                                                                    ...
state (that is to say, the melting-point of ice) is probably
reached when the number of molecules passing from the ice
into the water is equal to the number passing from the water
to the ice.  For the analogue of the               type of melt

place in a liquid-gas above                         its

  this curvature of surface is a difference of pressure in the
                        I
  liquid; and suppose the variation of vapour-tension to be due
  to the difference of pressure.            A proof is given of Sir W.
  Thomson's     formula,    which seems to bring out more clearly the
  connexion of the phenomenon with the pressure, and which
  seems to apply to solids as well as liquids.           According to this
  formula, the steady state (the melting-point) may be reached
. at any temperature if the pressure can be so adjusted that the
  vapour-tensions in the two states at that temperature and
  pressure are equal.         The resulting lowering of the melting
  point by pressure agrees in amount with that given by the
  well-known formula of Prof.              Thomson.      J.
     It follows from this mode of         regarding   the subject, that, if
  in any way the ice can be subjected to pressure while the water
  in contact with it is not so subjected, then the lowering of the
  melting-point per atmosphere is about 11% times as great as
  when both are compressed.                              I
                                          give the results of some expe
  riments which              I
                        have made to test this, and which certainly
  seem to indicate that the fall of melting-point is much greater
 than the amount usually supposed if the ice alone becompressed.
     The isothermals for ice-water are then discussed.                 It has
 been   supposed     that,  if we could   employ   a sufficiently   low tem
    erature and high pressure, then ice would pass continuously
 into water; that                  is,
                            the isothermals would have            horizontal      no
 part corresponding                      to

 should have        critical point. Assuming, however, that mix

 probable that there           another critical point

Thomson has subsequently (Brit. Assoc. Report, 1872, p. 24;
Proc. Roy. Soc. 1873; ‘                  S.A.
                                    ix. p. 392) arrived at a similar
conclusion   independently.    A   proof  differing in arrangement
from   Kirchhoff's,  and  following   out rather the line indicated
by Thomson, will be given below:
   In a mixture, then, of ice and water below 0°, since the
water has the greater vapour-tension, more molecules will
cross the surface from the water to the ice than in the opposite
direction. The ice will therefore gain, while the water loses.
At the same time the molecules will possess less energy when
arranged as ice.     Hence the temperature of the whole will
rise, and this rise will go on till 0° is reached, when there is
once more equilibrium—or till the whole is converted to ice,
if that condition be previously reached. This seems sufficiently
to explain the action of a small piece of ice dropped into water
below 0°; and the fact that the change of state is a surface
phenomenon seems to show that the presence of some ice is
 necessary to commence change of state.
     Ifa mixture of ice and water at 0° be supplied with heat,
as soon as the temperature rises ever so little above 0° the
equilibrium of exchange is destroyed; for the vapour-tension
 of ice becomes greater than that of water, and therefore the
number of molecules entering the water from the ice is greater
 than the number going in the opposite direction.          But since
the water   arrangement   requires  more   energy, heat is absorbed,
and the mixture has a    tendency    to fall back to 0°.
    Before going on to discuss the effect of pressure on the
 melting-point,           I

 the liquid state as an exchange phenomenon in which the rate
 of exchange is indicated by the vapour-tension, we ought to
 be able to show that the pressure which lowers the melting
 point to a certain temperature will so alter the rate at which
 the two states of the substance give off molecules from their
 surfaces, that at that temperature there will be an equilibrium
 of exchange. That         is,

            a coil acts in many cases          a condenser, and pos
sesses   appreciable    electrostatic  capacity.    I am not aware,
however, of any experiments in                    this property pro
duced any very marked effect.         In the experiments I am about
to describe, where currents were induced in a secondary coil,
the secondary circuit was generally left open ; and it was
found that, under certain circumstances, the condenser-action
of the coil was great enough to produce local currents strong
enough to powerfully magnetize a sewing-needle placed              in
side a spiral through which these local currents passed.          The

by side on a bobbin : one of these wires was used as the pri
mary circuit; the other, which was cut into three pieces
each about 100 yards long, formed three separate coils which
could be connected up in a great variety of ways, and which
were used as the secondary circuits.         For convenience,  I shall
denote the electrodes of the first of these secondary coils by
the letters A and B; the electrodes of the second by C and D;
and the electrodes of the third by E and F. As it will be con
venient to have some notation to denote the way the secon
dary coils are arranged,       I shall signify the arrangement by
writing the letters denoting the electrodes in the order one
would meet with them if one were to travel continuously
along the wire of the coil. A small magnetizing-spiral, in
which an ordinary sewing-needle could be placed, was also
inserted in the secondary circuit.

denotes that the electrode B was connected with the electrode
C, the electrode D to the electrode E, while the ends A and
F were free ; the magnetizing-spiral was placed between D
and E.      Again, AB–CDEF denotes that the electrode B
was joined to D, the electrode C to E, while the ends A and
B were free ; the magnetizing-spiral         was placed   between   B
and D.

   The current through the primary circuit was produced
by three Grove cells connected in series.                The primary cur
rent was broken six times whilst the same needle was in the
magnetizing-spiral, in order to get rid of any irregularities in
the breaking of the contact.          It was found to be a matter of
indifference whether the needle was left in the spiral whilst
contact was made in the primary circuit, or whether it was
taken out for each make : this is doubtless owing to the make
being a much more gradual operation than the break. The
intensity of the currents through the spiral was estimated by
the magnetization of the needle placed inside                    which was       it,

So that in this case the effect of putting a condenser in the
primary circuit was not nearly so great as when the magneti
zation of the needle was due to the electrostatic capacity of
the coil itself. When the condenser in the secondary circuit
was taken away and the secondary circuit closed, a needle
placed in the magnetizing-spiral vibrated 23 times per minute,
and it was magnetized in the opposite way to what it was
when the secondary circuit was open : this, indeed, was found
to be a general rule; the magnetization of the needle pro
duced by any arrangement of the secondary coils when open
was always of the opposite character to that produced when
the same circuit was closed.   In the experiment just described
it will be seen that the needle vibrated about twice as fast
when the secondary was open as it did when the secondary
was closed, which shows that in this case the intensity of
magnetization was about four times greater with an open cir
cuit than with a closed one.

 circuit is closed.
    When, however, the coil is arranged according to the scheme
 ABCDEF, and the ends A and F are connected with the plates
of a condenser of large capacity, so that now the coil itself
possesses little or no electrostatic capacity, then the currents
will evidently be much less local than before, and will pro
bably be pretty uniform throughout the coil. Thus L3, the
coefficient of self-induction of the secondary circuit, will be
greater than it was, and will probably not differ very much
from Li, the coefficient of self-induction of the primary cir
cuit, as the coils are of approximately equal length; and
since the capacity of the condenser in the secondary is
large, C, will be greater than it was in the former case, when
it was the electrostatic capacity of the coil itself. Thus both
 L.,and     C,
             are larger than they were before, and consequently

showed that the diminution           the magnetization

56              Mr.   J. J. Thomson             on some Electromagnetic
do not know enough about the action on magnets of currents
first in one direction and then the opposite to say how much.
    The results obtained when the condenser was put in the
primary appear to have important bearings on the theory
of Ruhmkorff's coil. The secondary of a Ruhmkorff's coil
will no doubt possess very considerable electrostatic capacity;
this will, as we have seen, give rise to local currents, which
exist although the secondary be closed.    Now these local cur
                       º
rents will interfere with the main current, and will fritter
away energy. The experiments just described show that the
introduction of a condenser into the primary circuit will dimi
nish very materially the intensity of these local currents, and
so cause much less energy to be frittered away.        therefore                           I
think it probable that part of the cause of the superior effici
ency of a coil            with a condenser in the primary is due
to this effect of the condenser.
   Some points of interest arise when we keep EF out of the
secondary circuit, still keeping the magnetizing-spiral in the
secondary.    Thus, the intensity of magnetization of a needle
placed in the magnetizing-spiral is found to be different, accord
ing as the coil EF is closed, has     ends free,         its
                                                     has them con                or

Symbolic Logic.         By JoHN WENN, M.A., Fellow and Lecturer in the
   Moral    Sciences, Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge.        London:
   Macmillan and Co.
 M    R. WENN'S work forms                an important contribution   to the
        Modern      Logic,   and is destined to give a great impetus to
the study and development of that science.
   One excellent feature of the work is the amount of information
it contains about the results reached by the early mathematical
logicians.     These logicians flourished before logic had been divorced
from   mathematics;        and some of them had got a good way towards
establishing the science on an analytical basis—Lambert in parti
cular. Indeed, he appears to me to be quite sound on a nice point
with respect to which Mr. Wenn is inclined to think him not free
from error (p. 272). The question is as follows:–Given a y = zw,
where each of the symbols denotes a class of things, is it correct to
conclude that
                  := ; ? I illustrate the question        by the accompany
ing diagram (fig. 1). Suppose we
restrict our attention to the part of
the page within the square : let a
denote the part included in the one
circle, y the part included in the
other circle, z the part stroked
downwards from right to left, w the

nected with the view taken of the Universe of Discourse, to the dis
cussion of which our author devotes a chapter. Mr. Wenn does
not give an exact definition of the meaning he assigns to this term;
                                           I
but from pp. 128 and 185 gather that he considers it formed by
setting limits to the sum-total of logical existence. The conception
of a universe is held to be, strictly speaking, extra-logical,—a
question of the application of our formulae, not of their symbolic
 statement; and on the symbolic system it is said to be universally
admitted that the distinction between subject and predicate is lost.
                                                                                      Yº:
 “We may extend our universe so as to embrace the sum-total of
logical existence, in which case European includes things other than
men, and not-European includes the unlimited myriads of entities,
 which people that heterogeneous domain.”                                       is,

any limited portion of it:                 I

geneous subject. The term universe may be used to denote a more
exact and more useful idea, which is really the idea required to make
Boole's processes intelligible.        It may be used to denote a collec

ticular propositions) from our rules would only be a slightly greater
encroachment upon the full freedom of popular speech than has
already been brought about by the exclusion of such terms as ‘many,’
‘most,’ and others of a somewhat quantitative character.” Mr.Venn
consequently restricts himself generally to what may be called uni
versal propositions.      But suppose that we have the data wy=20
and w=20; from these numerical propositions, though each is despi
cable in itself, we obtain, when combined, the important universal
proposition was wy. To exclude number is to draw a very arbitrary
line. Connected with this is the standpoint involved in the title
‘Symbolic Logic,' a standpoint with which as it is explained in the
work we are not wholly satisfied. It appears to us that Boole's
work, properly understood, leads rather to the conception of an
Algebra of Logic; not an Algebra of 0 and 1, as Boole understood
it,             an
              Algebra                              an

  Professor Monck's work consists     two parts—the one devoted

But while Prof. Monck describes with exactness and precision the

a remarkable agreement, and strongly justifies the principle held
by many geologists, that the proper relative measure of geological
periods is the maximum thickness of the strata formed during
those periods.
    The fourth and fifth lectures are devoted to the distribution
and origin of the rivers and lakes of Europe, Asia, S. America, and
Africa, including details as to their drainage-areas, rate of denuda
tion of the different rain-basins, and matter discharged by the
rivers.    Orographical maps of the two latter continents are given,
in order to show the great superiority of S. America over Africa in
the manufacture of rivers, as fully explained (pp. 204–243).
   The geographical distribution of animals and plants forms the
subject of the concluding lecture, in which the author gives an out
line of the more important facts, and the attempts that have been
made to explain them. The groups of animals selected for illustra
tion are the King-Crabs, Ostrich family, non-placental Mammals, the
Edentates, Humming-birds, and the Monkeys and Apes.                 The dis
tribution of the subdivisions of the above groups is given, as also
of their fossil ancestors as bearing on the origin of the present
forms.
    The zoological regions are adopted from Mr. Wallace, but with
different names, viz. the Europasian, N. and S. American, African,
Australian. These five natural regions are related to the ancient
land-systems of the globe defined by the meridian axes of elevation,
 of which there are two in the northern and three in the southern
hemisphere, as described by the author (pp. 20, 29), and which date
 back as far as the earliest sedimentary deposits, modified, as in the
 case of Europasia, by an east-and-west small-circle chain, which is
only of Tertiary origin.      The characteristic animals of these differ
 ent zoological provinces are given, and their relation to the pre
 glacial fauna of the same regions.
    To the above five regions an Oriental, or supplemental one is
added, as it does not owe         origin   itsfauna   orany      the primary

Natural Philosophy, for  general readers and young persons. Trans
   lated and Edited from Ganot's Cours Elémentaire de Physique
   (with the Author's sanction) by E. ATKINsoN, Ph.D., F.C.S., Pro
  fessor of Experimental Science in the Staff College.      Fourth
     Edition.         London: Longman, Green, and Co.                                         1881.
     It   may be safely asserted that no book on Physics has had a more
deserved popularity during the past fifteen years among teachers
and pupils than Dr. Atkinson's larger work, now in the tenth
edition.    And the reason for this is very obvious: basing the work
on Ganot's well-known treatise, Dr. Atkinson, by well-chosen addi
tions and amplifications of his own, strove to produce a good book,
and abundantly succeeded.          Improvements on old methods, and
new discoveries, have in like manner found places from time to time
in Dr. Atkinson's excellent book.
   In the work now before us Dr. Atkinson is wisely pursuing the
same plan.       Thus, in art. 516 we find a lucid description of the
Telephone and                 its
                      applications     the transmission     insound.   Reis                   of

sound some distance         aid       by

what difficult   points  are illustrated by shaded drawings, which give
the student a very clear idea of what hemihedrism really means.
   The notations used are those of Miller and Naumann, side by
side throughout—the         figures bearing Miller's numbers on their
faces  (except  for the   hexagonal      system, in which Bravais's modifi
cation is    adopted),    while Naumann's symbols are used in the
descriptive text.      Explanations are also given of other systems,
such as those of Weiss and Schrauf.
   We notice as minor deficiencies in the geometrical portion of the
work, first, that it might have been mentioned a little more distinctly

ritic or spherulitic, which   appear to throw some light on the epoch
at which these structures have been set up. In a black porphyritic
obsidian is a crystal which the author believed to be olivine.     Zirkel
 has already noticed the occurrence of this mineral in a trachyte. The
 structure of some of the above indicates that it is extremely difficult
 to draw hard and fast lines between trachytic rhyolites and fel
 stones.   A tuff containing fragments of a rhyolite, some perlitic, was
 also described.   The spaces included within the boundary of some of
 these   perlitic cracks exhibit depolarization and sometimes inter
 ference-crosses.    The author considered these to be the result of
 strain in contraction, and connected with incipient crystallization.
    Andesites, from two localities in the northern part of the Yellow
stone district, were also described.
    In an appendix Mr. Eccles briefly described the geology of the region
 from which the above specimens were collected, referring for greater
 detail to the memoirs of Dr. Hayden and his fellow workers. In the
 Yellowstone-Park region trachyte and obsidian (the latter being the
 upper) form an irregular plateau, resting on rocks of Carboniferous
 age.    No vents were observed; but Mount Washburne, a few miles
distant, is a broken-down volcanic cone, from which both trachyte
 and basalt-flows (the latter the newer) have proceeded.
    2. “On the Microscopic Structure of Devitrified rocks from Bedd
 gelert, Snowdon, and Skomer Island.” By F. Rutley, Esq., F.G.S.
    The first specimen described was found about a quarter of a mile
from Beddgelert, on the Capel-Curig road.        Examined microscopi
 cally, it showed traces of perlitic structure, with small spherulites,
 both isolated and in bands, not exhibiting radial structure, but appa
 rently composed of very minute chlorite and a garnet, probably spes
 sartine. Hence the rock must be a devitrified obsidian or pitchstone.
 The second specimen is a banded greenish-grey “felstone,” at Clog
 wyn du'r Arddu, of Bala age, which also has probably been vitreous.
 The third specimen, from near Ponty Gromlech, is a schistose felsitic
 rock. This was compared microscopically with an obsidian from
Hungary and a rhyolite from Gardiner's River (N. America), and was
 shown to have been probably once a glassy rock. In conclusion
 the author discussed the limits of the terms felstone, rhyolite, tra
 chyte, and obsidian.
    An appendix was added upon the microscopic characters of some
 rocks from Skomer Island, off the coast of Pembrokeshire. These
 were shown to be devitrified obsidians, some of them exhibiting
 spherulitic and perlitic structures. A trachytic rock and a basalt
 from the same locality were also described.
    3. “The Date of the last Change of Level in Lancashire.”           By
T. Mellard     Reade, Esq., C.E., F.G.S.
    The author described some observations made by him at Blundell
sands, on the coast of Lancashire, near Liverpool, according to which,
judging from the position of high-water mark, the land      had gained
considerably upon the sea between 1866 and 1874. At one end of
 a length of 350 yards, spring-tide high-water mark had receded

              On  the  Moel-Tryfan Shelly Deposits, &c.                  71
15 yards, and at the other end 5 yards. The author estimated that
the deposit of sand that had accumulated in 8 years amounted to
an average of 10 yards width and 2 yards depth.         Allowing a further
depth of 1 yard for sand that may have been blown over the top, he
finds 10,500 cubic yards as the quantity of sand deposited in 8
years on a shore-frontage of 350 yards, or 375 cubic yards per yard
of frontage per annum. Applying this unit of measurement to the
16 miles of coast forming the western boundary of the deposit, he
gets 105,600 cubic yards as the quantity of sand annually moved;
22 square miles of sand, 12 feet thick, give 272,588,800 cubic yards
of sand accumulated, which, divided by the annual quantity, will
give 2580 years as the age of the whole deposit of blown sand. The
author adduced other evidence in support of his view, and concluded
that if the last change of level in South-west Lancashire was a
downward one, it could not have taken place within 2500 years.
         April 27.-Robert Etheridge, Esq., F.R.S., President,
                                in the Chair.
    The following communications were read :—
    1. “On the precise Mode of Accumulation and Derivation of the
Moel-Tryfan Shelly Deposits; on the Discovery of similar high-level
Deposits along the Eastern Slopes of the Welsh Mountains; and on
the Existence of Drift-zones showing probable Wariations in the Rate
 of Submergence.” By D. Mackintosh, Esq., F.G.S.
    The author commenced by giving a sketch of the progress of dis
 covery connected with the Moel-Tryfan deposits. He then described
certain phenomena connected with these deposits, to which little or
no attention has been devoted by other observers.         After identifying
the local stones and   indirectly  local erratics, he traced the derivation
of the far-travelled erratics which came from the N. and N.W.            He
drew   particular  attention to an extensive    exposure   of slaty laminae,
the edges of which have been bent by a force assailing the hill from
the N.W.; and as these edges have been shattered so as to form
parcels of slate-chips covered by or rolled up in laminated sand,
along with parcels of clay, he endeavoured to prove that a stranding
 of the floating ice which must have brought part of the erratics
 (including numerous chalk-flints) will alone account for the pheno
mena.     After describing patches of gravel and sand in other parts
of Caernarvonshire, referring to the Three-Rock Mountain deposits
in Ireland (which must have come from the N.W.), and briefly
noticing the drifts on Halkin Mountain, Flintshire, he entered upon
 the main subject of his paper, namely the discovery of an extensive
series of marine drifts, including (besides deposits on flat ground)
about twelve hillocks or knolls, consisting of rounded gravel and
sand, and, in at least two instances, containing gravel-pits with nu
merous shell-fragments.       They extend along the east side of the
northern   part of the   mountain-range     which runs between Minera
and Llangollen Wale, and are situated at levels between 1100 and
1300 feet above the sea. The gravel is largely made up of rounded

72     Geological    Society:—The     Rev.   J.   F. Blake   on the
Eskdale-granite pebbles; and during his last or fourth visit to the
district, he found a large granite boulder on the axial summit of the
ridge, about 1450 feet above the sea, showing a submergence of the
mountain to at least that extent. He went on to assign reasons for
believing that the sea lingered longer at the level of the sand and
gravel knolls than lower down and higher up, so as to allow time
for the extra rounding of the pebbles, accumulation of erratics,
and multiplication of Mollusca; for he could discover no reason
for supposing that the mollusks which left the shells did not live
on or near the spot in the littoral or sublittoral zone.      He then
described a small exposure of high-level rounded gravel and sand
near Llangollen, and dwelt on the remarkable fact that the marine
deposits on Moel Tryfan, Three-Rock Mountain (Ireland), Minera
Mountain, and in Macclesfield Forest occur at about the same alti
tude above the sea-level.      After proposing a provisional classifica
tion of the   drift–deposits of North Wales and the Penine Hills into
zones, showing probable variations in the rate of submergence, he
concluded by discussing the question whether the submergence was
caused by the subsidence of the land or the rising of the sea, without
venturing to express any decided opinion on the subject, but           in
clining to the former idea.
   2. “On the Correlation of the Upper Jurassic Rocks of England
with those of the Continent.”       By the Rev. J. F. Blake, M.A.,
F.G.S. Part I. The Paris Basin.
   This was an attempt to settle the many questions of correlation
arising out of the detailed descriptions given of the various localities
in the Paris basin where Upper Jurassic rocks are developed, by a
consecutive survey of them all, undertaken by the aid of a grant
from the “Government Fund for Scientific Research.” In previous
papers the names used for the great subdivisions and their boun
daries were adopted without material modification; in the present
such modifications were proposed as may bring the English and
continental arrangements into harmony.                    -
   Five distinct areas were considered in this   paper.     1. The southern
range; 2. The Charentes; 3. Normandy; 4. The Pays de Bray;
5. The Boulonnais.
   1. The Southern Range.—This is continuous from the Ardennes
through the Meuse, Yonne, &c., to the Cher. In the Ardennes the
“Ferruginous Oolite” corresponds to our Osmington Oolite, and to
the Lower Limestones and Passage-beds of Yorkshire, the under
lying “Middle Oxfordian * being equivalent to our Lower Cal
careous Grit.      Above comes immediately the Coral Rag with
Cidaris florigemma; and the stratigraphical and palaeontological
break is constantly between the Coral Rag and Ferruginous Oolite
when that occurs.       The Corallian is a well-marked formation,
though    its character  isvariability.   It   is divisible generally into
two groups—Coral Rag and Supracoralline beds, the latter usually
being the “Diceras-beds;” but       in the Yonne there    is   a  great de
velopment       of
                 Diceras-beds below,    associated with Cidaris flori

             Upper Jurassic Rocks of England and the Continent.                                            73
gemma    and massive corals, which is gradually introduced in going
west. This part of the series in the Haute Marne has been de
scribed as very different; but the author did not at          agree with               all
M.Tombeck's stratigraphical determination, and considers the “Oolite
de     Nothe"
        la                   no
                     more than the continuation        the Supracoralline    of
Diceras-beds, which         considers   he uniformly overlie and never
                                                               to
   underlie the Am. marantianus marls, which latter are Oxfordian.
In tofact nothing abnormal occurs         this Department. The whole
                                                            in
series has     tendency
                    a       degenerate into barren lithographic lime
                                         to
stones,     which distinctions are lost. The Astartian and Virgulian
               in
beds were traced through this range, the latter seldom showing any
well-marked Pterocerian division, and the former being most con
nected with the overlying series.          Above these are limestones
hitherto called “Portlandian,”          which two zones are constant;
                                                       in
but above all are vacuolar Oolites, which alone may             truly cor                   be
related with the Portland rocks        England.        of
                                                    The whole     the beds                    of
in  this  range  are  eminently  calcareous,     true clay being   scarcely

is very calcareous, and the distinction       one part from another very

slight; but the highest portion, both near Cognac and               the Ile                      on
d'Oleron, yields beds which may         paralleled with our true English

sented at Boulogne, which may be divided into Upper and Lower;
and that the true Portland limestone and the Purbeck be united
into one group, as Lower and Upper Portlandian, the fact of the
latter being freshwater being paralleled by parts of the true Portland
having that character.

           June 8.-Robert Etheridge, Esq., F.R.S., President,
                            in the Chair.
   The following communications were read:—
    1. “The Reptile-Fauna of the Gosau Formation, preserved in the
Geological Museum of the University of Vienna.”        By Prof. H. G.
Seeley, F.R.S., F.L.S., F.G.S.; with a Note on the Geological
Horizon of the Fossils, by Edward Suess, F.M.G.S.
   2. “On the Basement-beds of the Cambrian in Anglesey.”          By
Prof. T. McKenny Hughes, M.A., F.G.S.
    In this paper the author first pointed out that there was in
Anglesey (1) an upper slaty group, in which he had fixed two
life zones, which showed that the series belonged to the Silurian
(Sedgwick's classification), and (2) a lower group of slates and sand
stones in which Arenig fossils had been found in several localities,
and Tremadoc had been less clearly recognized, while by the cor
rection of the determination of a species of Orthis there was now a
suspicion of even Menevian forms. These all rested upon the base
ment-beds of the Cambrian, of which the paper chiefly treated.
They were made up of conglomerates,          grits, -and sandstones, with
Annelids and Fucoids.
    The Basement-beds varied in thickness and character according
to the drift of currents along the Pre-cambrian shore and the ma
terial of the underlying rocks.      Near Penlon, where they rested on
a  quartz-felspar  rock, they consisted chiefly of a quartz-grit and con
glomerate, almost exactly like that of Twt Hill. Near Llanerchy
medd, where there was a mass of greenish schistose rock succeeding
the Dimetian, the Cambrian basement-bed contained a large number
of fragments of that rock, certain bands being chiefly composed of
Near Bryngwallen, where the underlying Archaean consisted              of it.
gneissic rocks, the Cambrian basement-beds were made up         of  quartz
conglomerate. Tracing      it still further   tothe S.W. he found bosses
of   conglomerate among the sand dunes         of Cymmeran Bay, full
fragments      green schistose rock, like that
                of                                  Bangor, and telling

the further development     ofPebidian   at the S.W. end of  the Anglesey
axis.      In
           several localities these conglomerates were associated with
and passed into fossiliferous grits and sandstones.         He exhibited
slices    the more important rocks, which,

observations now made confirmed the views he had expressed on a
former occasion with regard to the basement-beds of the Cambrian
between Caernarvon and Bangor, where the deposits which rested
upon the granitoid rocks of Twt Hill were either a kind of arkose
or chiefly composed of quartz with a few pieces of mica-schist and
jasper; but as we followed them a few miles to the N.E. we found
that the quartz had got pounded into smaller grains, and the larger
pebbles were chiefly of felsite, which here formed the shore, while
further towards Bangor fragments of the still higher Bangor volcanic
series helped to make up the Cambrian shingle-beach.
    3. “Description and Correlation of the Bournemouth Beds.-
Part II. Lower or Freshwater Series.” By J. S. Gardner, Esq.,
F.G.S.
    This was in continuation of a former paper by the author (Q. J.
G. S. vol. xxxv. p. 209). The beds described are exposed east and
west of Bournemouth and near Poole harbour, over a distance of
about four miles. The author referred them to the Middle Bagshot,
and stated that they are distinguished from the Lower Bagshot by
the absence of the extensive pipe-clay deposits and the presence of
brick-earths, and from the overlying beds by the absence of flints.
They reach their extreme limit in the western area of the London
 basin, and are represented by the lignitic beds 19–24 of Prof. Prest
wich's section.      Lignites can be traced partly across the bay. The
 cliffs present  an  oblique section across a delta divisible roughly into
 four   masses,   one of  which,  from its confused bedding and want of
fossils, is supposed to have been formed by the silting-up of the main
 channel. The total thickness of the series was estimated at 600 to
 700 feet.     The inferences drawn by the author were as follows:—
 1. from the beds cut through showing a steep side to the west,
 that the river flowed from that direction; 2. from the absence of
 boulders or coarse sediment, that the area was flat; 3. from the
 absence of lignite, that there were catchment basins; 4. from the
 absence of flint and the quartzose nature of the beds, that no chalk
 escarpments were cut through, and that the deposits came from a
 granitic area; and 5. from the presence of wood bored by Teredo
 that the beds belong to the lower part of the river in proximity to
 tidal water.
     The flora was stated to be confined to local patches of clay. Those
 at the western end of the section are very rich, and distinguished
 from the rest by absence of palms and rarity of ferns. The beds
 near Bournemouth are still richer and very distinct; those east of
 Bournemouth are characterized by Eucalypti, Aroids, and Araucaria;
 and those at the western end of the section by abundant Polypo
 diaceae.    It is remarkable that nearly every patch contains a flora
 almost   peculiar  to it; but the flora as a whole seems to pass upward
 to the   Oligocene,  but not down to the Lower Bagshot.

 NOTE BY DR. C. R. ALDER WEIGHT ON MR. SHIDA’s PAPER “ON
     THE NUMBER OF ELECTROSTATIC UNITS IN THE ELECTROMAG
     NETIC UNIT,” AND ON HIS RECENT NOTE THEREON.
            note by Mr. R. Shida, in the June Number of the Philoso
 THE   phical Magazine (p. 473), calls for some remark, in view of the
 great interest and importance attaching to the exact valuation of
 the different electrical magnitudes and their correlations.             Mr.
 Shida stated, in his original paper*, that he measured the E.M.F.
 of a gravity Daniell cell electromagnetically by determining the
 current generated by it in a circuit the total resistance of which
 (inclusive of the internal resistance of the cell) was measured, the
   roduct of the current into the resistance being the required
    .M.F.; also that he compared, by means of a quadrant electro
meter, the E.M.F. of the gravity-cell with that of a 30-cell Daniell
battery, which had been just measured by means of an absolute
electrometer—this electrostatic valuation being made just before,
and also just after, the electromagnetic valuation. [It is noticeable,
in passing, that, through an obvious slip in copying his results, Mr.
 Shida gives in each of the papers the electrostatic E.M.F. of the
30-cell battery as 0.904187 C.G.S. units, and that of the gravity
 cell as
          "..."-ooººsl            C.G.S. units, instead of only   one tenth
of these quantities in       each case respectively; otherwise the final
value of v deduced would be only one tenth of the quantity found.]
In his recent note, Mr. Shida says that he omitted to state in the
original paper that the electrostatic valuation depended upon by
him was made “while the current was actually flowing through the
tangent-galvanometer,”      as it was during the electromagnetic valua
tion; and he consequently infers that he eliminated the possible
 source of error incidentally suggested by me (whilst discussing the
 subject of “polarization” of so-called constant batteries) as exist
ing in his experiments, due to the E.M.F. of the cell during the
electromagnetic valuation whilst a current was passing not being
identical with that subsisting during the electrostatic valuation
made (as would be naturally supposed on reading his paper) when
no current was passing.
     It is noteworthy, however, that in striving thus to avoid the
Scylla of possible error through battery-polarization, Mr. Shida has
fallen into the Charybdis of a yet more serious error, due to the
circumstance that the potential difference registered by a quadrant
electrometer to which a cell is applied is not the E.M.F. of that cell
if it generate   a current, but is something less. That this is so, is mani
fest from the following considerations.         Let the actual E.M.F. of
the cell be E, and the E.M.F. obtained by the quadrant-electro
                             lº
meter be E. Let C be the current generated, R, the internal
resistance of the cell, and R, the external resistance of the rest of
the circuit.     Then   C=              The total work which this current

82                             Lord Rayleigh on the
observation”, require us to suppose that in a doubly-refracting
crystal the rigidity of the medium varies with the direction of
the strain; while, in order to explain the facts relating to the
intensities of reflected light, we have to make the inconsistent
assumption that the rigidity does not vary in passing from
one medium to another. A further discussion of this subject
will be found in papers published in the Philosophical Maga
zine during the year 1871.
     If
      the dielectric medium be endowed with sensible conduc
tivity, the electric vibrations will be damped; that is to say,
the light will undergo absorption, with a rapidity which Max
well has calculated.     By supposing the conductivity to be so
great that practically complete absorption takes place within
a distance comparable with the wave-length, we may obtain a
theory of metallic reflection which is not without interest,
 although the phenomena of abnormal dispersion show that it
 cannot be regarded as complete.
    For an isotropic medium at rest we have the equations

   In order to obtain a theory of metallic reflection, C must be
considered to have a finite value in the second medium. The
symbolical solution is not thereby altered from that applicable
to transparent media, the effect of the finiteness of C being
completely represented in both cases by the substitution of
K(1—iárn CK-') for K. Thus, if u be constant, the formula
for the amplitude and phase of the reflected wave in case 1 is
to be found by transformation of (18), in which the imaginary

further proof that much remains to be done before the elec
trical theory of metallic reflection can be accepted as complete".
   The same fundamental equations (8) and (9) will now be
applied to the problem of determining the effect on a train of
plane waves of a small variation in the quantities K and A.
which define the medium. A similar method will be adopted
to that already used for light in a paper “On the Scattering
of Light by small Particles”f, and in my book “On the Theory
of Sound,’ $296, the principle of which consists in an ap
proximation depending upon the neglect of the higher powers
of the small variations AK and Apl.
   Let us suppose that a train of plane waves, in which the
electric displacement is parallel to 2, and magnetization parallel
to y, propagates itself parallel to a undisturbed until it falls
*
upon a region where the generally constant values of K and
p become K+ AK and u+ Au.                       If
                                         AK and Au were zero,
the wave would pass on as before ; but under the circum
stances secondary waves are generated, which diverge from
the region of disturbance, and are ultimately, when AK and
Ap, are small enough, proportional in magnitude to these

    The simplest example of this kind is that afforded by an

 impinges perpendicularly to the axis, so that every thing
 takes places in two dimensions.        This case is indeed not
 strictly covered by the preceding formulae, on account of the
 infinite extension of the region                  but a moment's
 consideration will make it clear that each elementary column
 here acts according to the laws already described—that is to
 say, gives rise to a component disturbance whose phase is de
  termined by the situation of the element along the primary
  and secondary rays.             If

an infinitely small sphere is obtained from (29), (30), (31) by
writing h for ho; where by h is denoted the actual displace
ment (parallel to z) within the particle, and by ho the displace
ment in the enveloping medium under the same electric force.
If K   be the specific inductive capacity for the particle, the
ratio of h : ho is 3K/: K' +2K ; and in this ratio the results
expressed in (41), (42), (43) are to be increased.            we                                      If

 The opposition of sign is apparent only, and relates to the dif
ferent methods of measurement adopted in the two cases. In
(65) the primary and secondary disturbances are represented
by h/K, but in (67) by the magnetic function c.        we express     If
the solution in the second case in terms of the electric func
tion g, we shall find (see 13) that the ratio of c to g changes
sign when we pass from the primary light propagated alon
—a to the secondary light propagated along + æ. The                               ...i
ratio of amplitudes in the two cases is thus (k” + k”)/2k”, or
(K’--K)/2K. Unless the difference between K' and K be
neglected, the two components of unpolarized light are scat
tered along this direction in different proportions, that compo
nent preponderating in which the electric displacement is
parallel to the axis of the cylinder.     The secondary light is
therefore partially polarized  in the plane perpendicular to the
axlS.

   Here the probable error is a function of the probable errors
of the experiments upon potassium-chlorate, and the probable
error of the atomic weight of oxygen. We may now use
this value KCl in connexion with the second of the ratios
above cited, and deduce for the atomic weight of silver, the
figure Ag=107.696; +:024.         In every proportion used there
are known   probable  errors for three terms, and they are                                in

twenty ratios above referred         eight entirely independent
values for the atomic   weight      silver can     found. Each       be             .

from Marchand and Scheerer's work     alone, and   Mg=23.959;

  Zinc.—Jacquelain, Favre, and Axel Erdmann.      General
mean, Zn=65:557; +011.      Erdmann's results alone, how
ever, give    a    more probable value (considered chemically)                                 of
Zn=64.9045; +-019.

   Chromium.—Peligot's     work was not available for discus
sion.   The data studied were                        by
                                     Berlin, Moberg, Lefort,

gives Cr-52°389; +.019. Siewert's results give Cr=52:009;

Marchand,      Maumené, Rivot,

 Commaille, and Hampe.          Cu = 63:173; +011.
    Molybdenum.—Debray, Dumas, Rammelsberg, and analyses
by Liechti and Kemp. Mo-95:527; +-051.
    Tungsten.—Berzelius,        Schneider, Marchand, v. Borch,
Dumas, Bernoulli, Persoz, Roscoe, Scheibler, and Zettnow.
General mean of all, W = 183-610; +032.

    Aluminum.—Berzelius, Tissier, Isnard, Dumas, Terreil,
and Mallet.       General mean, Al=27-0092;           + 0028.     All
the data except Mallet’s might be rejected without essentially
affecting this value.
    Gold.-Berzelius and Levol.            Au-196°155; +095. A
 thorough redetermination is much needed.
    Nickel.-Several early series of nickel and cobalt were re
jected. The data, taken were by Schneider, Dumas, Russell,
 Sommaruga, Winkler, and Lee. General mean, Ni–58:547;
  +:009.     I attach more importance to the concordant results
of Schneider, Sommaruga, and Lee, whose figures give a
 general mean of Ni–57-928; +:022.               Lee's investigation
 was of  all  the least  susceptible    constant errors.

                                                    so
 raised  by  Mendelejeff   as

                                    settled.
     Vanadium.—Roscoe's weighings, recalculated with the new
 values for    O, Ag, and Cl, give V=51.256; +:024.
    Arsenic.—Pelouze, Dumas, Wallace, and Kessler.            General
 mean, As=74:918; +016.               Wallace's analyses        Asbr,    of
 were made       to establish the atomic weight            of
                                                       bromine    but         ;
 they serve    a better purpose here.
    Antimony.—For this element there have been the two rival
 figures 120 and 122. The general mean from data by Kessler,
 Dumas, and Dexter         is   Sb
                                 =  122°092; +035.        The general
 mean from the experiments                of
                                        Schneider and        Cooke  of            is

            in a Recalculation of  the Atomic Weights.        107
Sb = 119-955; +036. In view of the recent discussions upon
the subject, we may regard the lower figure as established.
   Bismuth.-General mean from Schneider's experiments
Bi-207:523; +-082.          If O =16, this becomes 208:001.
All of Dumas's results on bismuth chloride give a mean of
Bi-210.464; the figures which he considers best give
Bi-209-78.       Schneider's work is probably nearest correct,
his method being less liable to constant errors than that of
Dumas.
    Tin-Berzelius, Mulder and Vlaanderen, Dumas, and
Vlaanderen.     General mean, Sn=117-698; +:040.
    Titanium.—Rose's    weighings give Ti = 48-710 + 105.
Mosander's figures give Ti-47-045.       Pierre's giveTi-49.889
  +096; and Demoly's, Ti =52-191+ 153. A general mean
of the results of Pierre, Rose, and Demoly is 49.846+064.
Mosander's work must be rejected for want of sufficient de
 tails. An experimental revision is wanted.
   Zirconium.—From Berzelius's figures, Zr = 89.255; +039.
 From Marignac's data Zr-90.328; +113. The general
mean of both sets is Zr =89:367 ; +037.           New determina
tions are  evidently needed.
    Thorium.—Berzelius,      Chydenius, Berlin, Delafontaine,
 Hermann, and Cleve. General mean, Th=233°414; +-073.
     Gallium.—From Boisbaudran's results, in mean,           Ga
 68'854.
    Indium.—Reich and Richter, Winkler, and Bunsen. Gene
 ral mean, In=113:398; +-047.
     Cerium.—Beringer,    Hermann, Marignac,         Bunsen and
 Jegel, Rammelsberg, Wolf, Wing, and Buehrig.              General
 mean of all, Ce=140'424; + 017.           Buehrig's analyses of
 the oxalate give Ce=141-198; +020.          The figures by Wolf
 and by    Wing   give Ce=137.724.       Wolf and Wing had a
 white ceroso-ceric oxide; and Wolf suspects the ordinary yel
 lowish compound to contain a fourth metal of the cerium group.
 Buehrig's work is the best ; but the possible presence of a
 fourth metal is not considered by this chemist.         Therefore
 new experiments are needed.
    Lanthanum.—Hermann,        Rammelsberg, Marignac, Czud
 nowicz, Holzmann, Zschiesche, Erk, and Cleve.             General
mean,    La-138-526; +030.
    Didymium.—Marignac, Hermann, Zschiesche, Erk, and
 Cleve. General mean, Di- 144'573; +031. Cleve's work
alone, which is doubtless the best, gives   Di-   146'804.
    Scandium.—Nilson’s      results,   recalculated, give    Sc =
43-980; +015.
     Yttrium.—Popp, Delafontaine, Bahr and Bunsen, and Cleve.

 108             Prof. F. W. Clarke on the Results obtained
  General mean, Yt=97.616.           Excluding Popp’s work as
 worthless, the general mean becomes Yt-89:816; +067.
     Ytterbium.—Nilson.                  Yb-
                                  172-761; +038.
     Erbium.—For this metal the most probable results are those
 of Cleve, which give, recalculated, Er-165'891. Previous
 workers undoubtedly studied material rich in ytterbium and
 other metals of the group.
     For terbium, samarium, phillipium, decipium, thulium, &c.
                                        º
 there are no satisfactory data. Cleve gives 1707 for thulium,
 while Delafontaine puts Ph-123 to 125, and Dp=171. These
 figures assume that              all
                         the earths     the group are sesquioxides.
                                                          of
     Columbium  *-Marignac's        results give approximately
 Cb=94; Blomstrand                                        95
                                           the most probable value.

New estimations are needed.
     Tantalum.—All       Marignac's figures give
                                 of                   general mean      a
of   Ta-182.144; +166. Probably 182 may                 safely used      be
as the true value.
    Platinum.—By        recalculation

     Osmium.—Berzelius's figures give me Os=198494.
    Iridium.—The general mean calculated from Seubert's
weighings      Ira 192-651; +033.
                  is
    Palladium.—Berzelius's last results are the only ones worth
considering. They give Pd=105.737.
    Rhodium.—Data                  by
                          Berzelius.    Rh=104-055.
    Ruthenium.—A single analysis                               of

Rh, Pd, and Os need scrupulous redetermination.
                                         Conclusions.
  A    careful scrutiny                  all
                                the data upon which the foregoing
                                    of
atomic-weight calculations depend will reveal various sources
byof
    error. Of course, each series       results must      of
                                                          considered         be

 errors are  important   enough      warrant mention here.

   First, every value after oxygen, with one,           two partial
exceptions, involves whatever error may attach           the atomic      to or

   Secondly, confusion arises from the fact that many of the
weighings under discussion were not reduced to the standard
of a vacuum; while others had been subjected to such a cor
rection. The errors thus introduced into the calculations are
small, but still they cannot be lost sight                                  of.
   Another           set
                     errorsof    unknown magnitude are produced
                                          of
    follows:—Many series          experiments, notably

     Stas, Marignac, and other eminent investigators, involve
the titration       chlorides, bromides,
                     of                                             or

                                       metallic silver.       But Dumas
has lately shown that              purified after the usual methods,
occludes weighable quantities          oxygen.       of other words, the         In
silver hitherto    employed       atomic-weight
                                              in     investigations      has
not been pure silver. One exception               found       Mallet's re

a result which amounted to the discovery of a new pheno
menon, “the Convection of Heat by Electricity”—namely, that
in a pyroelectric crystal whose temperature is rising, heat
flows more easily with the electricity than it does against the
electricity. We were later indebted to Mr. G. F. Fitzgerald,
of Trinity College, Dublin, for the suggestion that an analo
gous phenomenon might occur, namely that there might be a
unilateral electric convection whilst the electromotive force
producing the flow was rising or falling".

   7. Magnetic Properties.—Plücker examined the magnetic
deportment of tourmaline. The following account of what was
observed is given by Tyndallf:—“A plate of the crystal which
had been prepared for the purposes of polarization, 12 milli
metres long, 9 wide, and 3 thick, was suspended by a silk
fibre between the poles of an electromagnet. On sending a
current round the latter, the plate, which was magnetic, set
itself as an ordinary magnetic substance would do, with                                                             its

of the crystal with tinfoil through which                             a   truly circular hole
had been punched. The foil was fixed over the crystal with
gum or varnish, and was connected to earth. At the centre
of the exposed circle a metallic point was fixed in an insula
ting support; and by this means the electricity stored in a
Leyden jar could be made to flow across the circular space
from the centre to the circumference. With powerful dis
charges from a Leyden battery sparks leapt along the crystal
face, leaving a permanent trace along the path of least resist
ance.   Later experiments were conducted in a partial vacuum,
when the discharge took place quietly in luminous streaks of
a pale-violet colour along that diameter of the circle which
corresponded to best conductivity along the surface.
                                                                                      .
   The crystals operated upon by de Senarmont were three
black tourmalines from Greenland, in the collection of the
Ecole des Mines, having plane mirror-like faces tangential to
the lateral edges of the primitive rhombohedron        slightly
striated (“stries à peine sensibles”).  With circles of three
different sizes, de Senarmont found the maximum conduc
tivity to       liedirection parallel

 investigations of Cavendish, published some sixty years before.
 At the end of his communication Faraday gave a description
 of an apparatus, the “Differential Inductometer,” for the
 determination of such inductive capacity.
     This serves as the point of departure for the following                          in
                         I
 vestigation; but shall first, and chiefly, consider the electro
 static induction in a single medium, namely the atmospheric
 air; so that the question of “specific induction,” a question
 involving more than one medium, will be considered later.
    Faraday, in his ‘Experimental Researches' (§ 1307), de
 scribes the above-mentioned apparatus as follows:—“Three
 circular brass plates about five inches in diameter were
 mounted side by side upon insulating pillars. The middle
 one   ‘A’   was a fixture; but the outer plates                and ‘C’‘B’
 were moveable on        slides, so that             all
                                               three could       broughtbe
with their sides almost into contact                        or
                                                    separated     any re
 quired distance.      Two gold leaves were suspended               glassin to
                                                                             a
jar from insulated wires. One              the outer plates, “B,” was
                                                of
 connected with one           the gold leaves, and the other outer
                               of
plate with the other gold leaf. The outer plates                   and       B            C
 were adjusted      atthe distance             of    an
                                              inch and     quarter from
                                                                 a
the middle plate ‘A;’ and the gold leaves were fixed                  two        at
inches    apart.        ‘A’  was then    slightly   charged   with elec
tricity, and the plates         ‘B’and ‘C’ with their gold leaves
thrown out         of
                    insulation        the same time, and then left
                                         at                                           in

                                                   was charged positive
inductrically,     and        and

leaves hanging,         course, parallel

    Faraday affected the relation                  of
                                            the induction from                   A   to

between   B   and   C  from A.
    Faraday brought           plate

                          On the Differential Inductometer.                                         131
leaves approached one another.    The leaves again separated
when the shellac was taken away. According to Faraday,
the attraction is due to the increased induction where the
shellac    is,
             causing          induce more negative electricity
                               A    to                                                                  on
B.     The side therefore                (and of   B                 its
                                                    gold leaf) furthest
from  A   becomes positive.        On the other outer plate           there                    C
is less  negative  electricity   induced;    and the outer side         this                   of
plate, together with the gold leaf connected with                 becomes               it,
therefore negative.         Hence the gold leaves attract one
another.

 These formulae, which are the same as those for the divided
 current, are only absolutely true for plates of an infinite size.
 They signify that the inductive capacities of the two con
 densers which form the differential inductometer are                                                       in
 versely proportional to the distances of the plates.                If we
 use the term “inductive resistance" to denote the reciprocal
 of the inductive capacity in the same way as conductivity is
 the reciprocal of resistance, then, in the case of infinite plates,
 the inductive resistance is directly proportional to the dis
tance.     In such a case of infinite plates the equipotential
surfaces are planes parallel to the plates, and the tubes of
force are cylinders at right angles to them.
    This electrostatic condition is converted into the corre
sponding electrodynamic one if a conducting liquid is placed
between the plates.

134         Dr.   J.   Moser on the Division of Induction in the
have in the one case to be regarded as lines of force, and in
the other as lines of flow. The greater the plates are, the more
nearly flat are the surfaces of electric level, and the straighter
are the lines of force.
  Induction and conduction act, therefore, in the same lines.

non-conducting plate with two movable coverings, and can

136     Dr.   J.    Moser on the Division of Induction in the
thus be used as a Franklin's disk, a Leyden jar, or a condenser.
My electrophorus consisted of a circular ebonite plate 1:5
millim. thick and 30 centim. diameter.              The coverings were
of zinc and were of the same          diameter,  one of them being pro
vided with an ebonite handle.           For other purposes used three  I
plates of the same shape, of thinner ebonite, together with
other plates of zinc of similar dimensions.
     The simplest supposition is that the ebonite plate, lying
on the one uninsulated metal covering, being beaten by the
fox's tail becomes negatively electric. Then induction starts
from this negative layer of this ebonite plate as inductric
layer (inductor).        The inducteous layer (inducendus), where
the induction ends, is the underlying uninsulated metal plate.
After putting on and uninsulating the upper metal plate, how
 ever, the induction branches off again from the upper nega
tive layer of the ebonite plate as inductric body (inductor),
and extends to both the metal plates as inducteous bodies (in
 ducendus).        If there exists, as we have supposed, only one
 inductric layer in the electrophorus, namely the negative one
 on the upper surface of the ebonite plate, the differential               in
 ductometer could be viewed as a scheme of the electrophorus.
 The negative layer of the electrophorus would be represented
 by the negatively charged middle inductric plate of the dif
 ferential inductometer; and the two metal coverings of the one
 apparatus would correspond to the two of the other. Further,
 this similarity of the two apparatus appears still more com
 plete if we use the differential inductometer as electrophorus
 for producing electricity. We can uninsulate the one plate
  of the differential inductometer; and bringing the other near,
  we can draw out of it a negative spark; then withdrawing                 it,
  we can get positive spark. But one difference now presents
              a
  itself, and proves the insufficiency                  of
                                                our last scheme.     As    to
  the differential inductometer,            perfectly indifferent whether
                                              it   is
  we uninsulate the right outer plate and insulate and discharge
  the left one,    or    we uninsulate this and change the distance
                        if
 of   the  right   one. We always get positive discharge from that
  outer   plate   which we have removed from the negative middle
  plate. The same kind, namely positive discharge, after re
  moval, must take place
  layer. Then there
  out, no    difference
                              is,

    The differential inductometer, which gave positive in both
cases, is therefore not a sufficiently accurate          to explain
why we get,

having only one inductor plate, to make a scheme of the elec
trophorus, is effected by adding a second inductor plate (a posi
tively charged one), which corresponds with the                   of
the ebonite plate. In fact, after beating, the ebonite plate
attaches itself so closely to the metal sole, that I could hold the
sole vertical without the ebonite plate sliding down. At first
the negative layer of the rubbed surface induced positive elec
tricity in the metallic sole. The induction is followed by con
duction and discharge; a part of the positive electricity goes
over from the sole to the lower side of the ebonite plate. On
the other side the negative electricity penetrates deeper from
the upper surface into the ebonite; so that there are two layers
on the ebonite plate—a negative one on the upper side, a posi
tive one on the lower side.     For the understanding of the ques
 tion, it is here sufficient to regard these layers as
                                                                   º,
 without discussing the question of the thickness.
    With the help of these two layers we have to explain the two
 observations:—
    (1) The + spark when the metal plate is lifted from the
                 -
 rubbed surface;
    (2) The      spark when it is lifted from the unrubbed one."
    For the proof of this theory we shall deduce further conse
 quences from          it;
                    and we shall have    to
                                          confirm these       by

four plates:—

in both cases positive discharges.
    Thus we have the means of recognizing not only—
    (1) on which side an ebonite plate is            positively,
    (2) on which side it is charged negatively, but also
    (3) if it had been charged originally negatively on the one
side or
     4) positively on the other side.
      or this purpose we place the ebonite plate to be tested close
to an uninsulated metal plate.     Then we put a second metal
  late on the ebonite disk, uninsulate     and try the electricity     it,
induced      init; the opposite one exists      the upper surface            in

   Now the ebonite plate          tested     some height over the

       Differential Inductometer and in the Electrophorus.         141
maining part of the circuit) changes of induction take place.
In the ordinary experiments with the electrophorus this con
ducting wire is represented by the earth, the base being unin
sulated.     Here we can speak of a circuit only with the same
right as in the case of a telegraphic battery with earth-con
duction.     If the conduction is broken by insulating the sole
after   having  it uninsulated, the electrophorus is without effect.
                                      .."
As to the changes of induction in the interior of the electro
phorus (which we may imagine as a polarization of the dielec
        I
tric), will further adduce the following experiments:—
    If the ebonite plate, put on the                 base, is strongly
excited, it attaches itself to the base.     If now the cover is put
on and both metal      plates are uninsulated at the same time, it
attaches itself to the cover, so that we can lift the plate
by means of the cover. A current of positive electricity has
flowed at the moment of uninsulating from the sole through the
outer conducting wire to the cover.          Before the current has
flowed, the induction (polarization) went wholly through the
ebonite plate; after the current the inductive (polarizing)
effect of the excited layer extends, for the greater part, through
the thinner interval of air to the cover, and only for a smaller
part of it through the thicker ebonite plate to the sole.
              I
                                     i.
    Finally, may mention an experiment in which branching
of induction, as well as branching of conduction, may easily
be observed.      I beat the ebonite        lying on the uninsulated
base, and put on the excited surface of the first another equal,
but not excited, ebonite plate, and then on this the metal cover.
This cover, being uninsulated and lifted, gave positive sparks,
just as if there had been in place of the upper ebonite plate a
corresponding layer of air.         Immediately after this      I tried
 the  upper  ebonite  plate, endeavouring   to use it alone as the disk
of an electrophorus.       But this trial did not succeed; the plate
 was ineffective.
           I
    Now repeated the experiment, laid the same plate again on
 the rubbed surface of the first ebonite plate, put on it also again
the cover, but left the apparatus unaltered during twelve hours.
 In this case there is ebonite on the two sides of the inductric
    .
 layer of the ebonite plate; induction extends from this layer
 through ebonite to the sole and to the cover.            In the same
 manner the conduction—the penetration or absorption of elec
tricity—must take place to both sides; and I expected that the
 negative electricity would penetrate not only into the lower
 ebonite plate, but would go over to the upper plate also. This
 is          what took place.    After twelve hours the upper plate
 could be used as the disk of an electrophorus. Both plates
 gave now strong and, as it seemed, equal effects.             As was

to be supposed, the upper plate was negatively charged on                                                  its
lower surface, with which      lay     the inductric layer, and

                                          [Plate    II.]
IN    the ordinary apparatus for illustrating a plane wave, a
      series of cranks or eccentrics are attached to one axle,
the successive cranks or eccentrics being turned through small,
but equal angles.   Attached to the cranks or eccentrics are
rods, each of which is terminated by a ball, to represent one
of the particles of        the wave.    On turning the axle each ball
rises and falls in          succession, producing a plane wave. This
apparatus is known as that of Powell.
   The arrangement I am about to describe consists of two
such apparatus, with the rods connected together at right
angles to each other. The axles of the apparatus are linked
by a rod so that they turn together; and, finally, an adjustment
allows the cranks to be placed relatively to each other in any
desired position.
   The apparatus, divested of supports and accessories, is shown
in the figure, drawn in isometric perspective. The cranks
6, 5, 4, 3, &c. turn with the axle X.            The cranks are
placed successively at 30° angular distance, corresponding in
position to the figures on a clock-dial; and as there are twelve
cranks, one complete wave is represented by a single turn of
the axle.
   On the axle X" is arranged a precisely similar set of cranks.
Around each crank is put a metal strap connected with a light
wooden rod. These rods, a, b, c, &c.,                             a<U+017F>,

    To describe the action of the apparatus, it should be pre
mised that the starting-point of each crank is when the crank
and rod are in the same straight line. Thus, regarding for
 the moment the first left-hand crank only, it will be at the
 starting-point, or zero, when the crank 6 has moved on 45° to
 the left. Similarly with the first right-hand crank, it will be
 at zero if moved back through 45° to the right; so that, in the
 position shown in the figure, the left-hand crank has moved
 through seven eighths of a revolution, while the right-hand
 crank has moved through one eighth ; or the difference of
 their phases is six eighths, or three quarters; and on turning
 the cranks, a wave corresponding to circularly-polarized light
 is produced, each bead describing a circle in succession. Bring
 now the cranks into the position of the figure, unscrew the
 pin p', and, keeping the left-hand crank steady, move the
 right-hand crank to the vertical position upward. Now the
 left-hand crank, as before, has made seven eighths of a revo
 lution, but the right-hand crank five eighths, i. e. a difference
 of phase of one quarter. On inserting the pin p' and now
turning the cranks, the beads will describe the same wave as
before.     Now keep the left-hand crank in                           its
                                                        first position (the

IN mental
   the great majority, at least, of investigations (experi
          or mathematical)             with conduction of
                                           connected
heat, it has been assumed that the known changes of specific
heat of metals do not require to be taken into account. Thus
Ångström says, even in his paper on the Change of Conducti
vity with temperature (Pogg. Ann.cxviii. 1863):-‘‘Daindess
diese Veränderungen,      soweit man sie kennt, wenigstens                                  in
nerhalb der bei den Beobachtungen vorkommenden Tem
peraturgränzen, nicht bedeutend sind, . . . . . . so missen
dieselben den Werth des Wärmecoefficienten nur unbedeu
tend afficiren können.”       In my paper on “Thermal and
Electric   Conductivity”    (Trans. R. S. E., 1878),     said that              I
“the change of specific heat with temperature would increase
the values of k at higher temperatures, and thus reduce the
change in conductivity in iron, and increase the small changes
indicated for the other substances.” But          had not at hand    I
the means of applying these corrections.        Recent discussions
as to the comparative merits of different experimental methods
have led me to investigate the amount of this effect, by the
aid of the best data        I
                         could procure. A comparison of these
seems to leave no doubt that the specific heat of iron increases
by somewhere about 7 #0 of                its
                                     amount for each degree                                 of

  From the first two of these means we find that the specific
heat at 15° is 0.109 nearly, and that it increases by Tºo for
each degree.
   Now Forbes's experiments on iron                                   indicated that the
quantity
            :   the ratio     of the conductivity to the specific heat,
diminishes by about ºo part for each degree from 0°C. to
                          º
200° C. Hence it is clear that, in this case at least, the
alteration of specific heat cannot be neglected in estimating
that of conductivity.    For it follows from the numbers just
given, that the diminution per 1* in the conductivity of iron
is really only about gºod of the whole amount. My own
experiments with              bars gave an average change of
! less than     that due to the increase of c alone, thus indicating
an increase of conductivity with rise of temperature.     Ang
ström's result, on the other hand, is considerably greater than
that of Forbes; but the range of temperatures he employed
was not above forty degrees.    For reasons pointed out in my
paper above referred            to,
                            consider Forbes's estimate

truth.     In   other metals the change                        specific heat        is    usually
less than   in   iron.    But         so   is   also that       of     c.
                                                                             It    would thus
appear that we cannot yet state positively that there   any                               is
metal whose conductivity becomes less           temperature          as     its
rises; and thus the long-sought analogy between thermal and
electric conductivity   not likely

   In the method devised and carried out by Forbes, the
change of specific heat must be attended to during the calcu
lations. Thus we cannot, without going over again the whole
numerical work connected with what he called the Statical
Curve of Cooling, estimate accurately what will be the effect
of this element upon the values of the conductivity.

gas in the receiver is now increased, it can be demonstrated that the
quantity of free electricity on A is diminished.        The insulation
remains perfect, and the plate A has not moved; but the capacity
of the condenser has become greater by the introduction of the gas
into the previously exhausted receiver. The effect is virtually the
same as if the distance between the plates had become D times less.
The gas possesses, then, the property of making the capacity of
the receiver D times greater by       presence,    being what    its

   The phenomena thus foreseen are the inverse of the phenomena

remark that the sense of the inverse phenomenon may always be
defined by the following rule, which is an extension of that given by
Lenz for induction:—The inverse phenomenon is always of such a
sense that it tends to oppose the production of the primitive phenomenon.

and which consists in      translating  a  physical law by a condition of
integrability, was introduced into science by Sir W. Thomson and
by M. Kirchhoff. An examination of the work of those eminent
physicists will,  I  think, be convincing that the principle of the Con
servation of   Electricity  is for Electricity that which the principle of
Carnot is for Heat.

   NOTE ON THE PHOTOGRAPHIC SPECTRUM OF COMET b 1881.
              BY WILLIAM HUGGINs, D.C.L., LL.D., F.R.S.
   On the     evening                I
                        of June 24 directed the reflector furnished
with the spectroscopic and photographic arrangements described
in my paper “On the Photographic Spectra of Stars”* to the
head of the comet, so that the nucleus should be upon one half of
the slit. After one hour's exposure the open half of the slit was
closed, the shutter withdrawn from the other half, and the instru
ment then directed to Arcturus for fifteen minutes.
   After development the plate presented a very distinct spectrum
of the comet, together with the spectrum of the star, which    I have
already described in the paper referred to above.
    The spectrum of the comet consists of a pair of bright lines in
the ultra-violet region, and a continuous spectrum which can be
traced from about F to some distance beyond H.
    The bright lines, a little distance beyond H, with an approximate
wave-length from 3870 to 3890, appear to belong to the spectrum
of carbon (in some form, possibly in combination with hydrogen)
which   I observed in the spectra of the telescopic comets of 1866
and 1868.
    In the continuous spectrum shown in the photograph the dark
lines of Fraunhofer can be seen.
    This photographic evidence supports the results of my previous
observations in the visible spectra of some telescopic comets.    Part
of the light from comets is reflected solar light; and another part
is light of their own.         The spectrum of this light shows the
 presence in the comet of carbon, possibly in combination with
hydrogen.
    On the next night, June 25, a second photograph was obtained
 with an exposure of an hour and a half. This photograph, not
withstanding the longer exposure, is fainter, but shows distinctly
 the two bright lines and the continuous spectrum, which is too
faint to allow the Fraunhofer lines to be seen.
    Postscript, July 9, 1881–I have since measured the photographs
                                   I
of the comet's spectrum; and find for the two strong bright lines
the wave-lengths 3883 and 3870. The less-refrangible line is much
 stronger; and a faint luminosity can be traced from it to a little
beyond the second line, 3870. There can be no doubt, therefore,
that these lines represent the brightest end of the ultra-violet
group which appears under certain circumstances in the spectra of
the compounds of carbon.          Professors Liveing and Dewar have
found for the strong line at the beginning of this group the wave
length 3882-7, and for the second line 3870°5.
   I  am also able to see upon the continuous solar spectrum a
distinct impression of the group of lines between G and h, which
is usually associated with the group described above. My measures
for the less-refrangible end of this group give a wave-length of
4230, which agrees as well as can be expected with Professors
Liveing and Dewar's measure 4220.

   In their paper “On the Spectra of the Compounds of Carbon "
(Proc. Roy. Soc. vol. xxx. p. 494), Professors Liveing and Dewar
show that these two groups indicate the presence of cyanogen, and
are not to be seen in the absence of nitrogen.    If this be the case,
the photograph gives undoubted evidence of the presence of nitrogen
in the comet, in addition to the carbon and hydrogen shown to be
there by the bright groups in the visible part of the spectrum.    On
this hypothesis we must further suppose a high temperature in the
comet, unless the cyanogen is present ready formed.
    Ishould state that Mr. Lockyer regards the two groups in the
photograph, and the groups in the visible spectrum, as due to
the vapour of carbon at different heat-levels (Proc. Roy. Soc.
vol. xxx. p. 461).
   It is of importance to mention the strong intensity in the photo
graph of the lines 3883 and 3870, as compared with the continuous
spectrum and the faint bright group beginning at 4230. At this
part of the spectrum, therefore, the light emitted by the cometary
matter exceeded by many times the reflected solar light.           I

      To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
                                 I
   In the papers which have communicated to your Journal on
the above subject,          I
                        have endeavoured to show that the phenomena
of Optics can be explained without calling in the aid of any sub
stance of the nature of the aether, and also that what may be termed
ordinary matter possesses the requisite properties to enable it to
act as the medium which serves for the transmission of the undu
latory movement. Although            I
                                     have not anywhere in these papers
laid claim to   originality,  yet    I
                                    was quite unaware at the time of
writing that the same ideas had been previously propounded. Until
after the publication of the second of these papers,          I
                                                            regret to say

        had not read “The Correlation of       Physical  Forces.’      I

that so far back as 1842 the distinguished author of this work had
published his views on the subject, which in almost every particular
are the same as those held by myself.        All credit for originality is
therefore due to Sir W. R. Grove; and it is probable that, if had      I
known how completely he had anticipated the conclusions to which
I  have arrived, my papers would never have been written.

Thisone article           be considered as the continuation of
            published in the ‘Philosophical Magazine’ for No
vember 1880, under the title “On the new Action of Mag
netism on a Permanent Electric Current,” in which were given
                                              #.
the results of some quantitative investigations of a certain
phenomenon recently discovered in the
of the Johns Hopkins     University.

                                        It will perhaps be remem
bered that the essential feature of this phenomenon is the set
ting up, in a conductor bearing an electric current, of an
electromotive force at right angles to the primary electromo
tive force, when the said conductor is subjected to the action of
a magnetic force at right angles to the direction of the current.
    In the article alluded to, results were given as obtained with
gold, silver, tin, platinum, iron, and nickel. The magnitude
of the effect observed, relatively to the strength of the primary
current, the intensity of the magnetic field, and the dimen
sions of the conductor, had not been determined with any
accuracy in the case of nickel and tin, though it was known
to be comparatively large in nickel and small in tin. The
other metals ranged themselves, as regards the numerical
magnitude of the effect exhibited, in the following order, viz.
iron, silver, gold, platinum–the effect observed in iron being

158            Dr. E. H. Hall on the “Rotational Coefficient”
several times greater, and that in platinum several times less,
than the effect in gold or silver. The fact of greatest interest,
however, was that, if we called the direction of the transverse
effect in iron + , that in the diamagnetic metals, and in nickel
and platinum also, would be                         –”.
   In  view of this remarkable disagreement in behaviour be
tween the two strongly magnetic metals iron and nickel, it
seemed highly desirable to make a quantitative investigation
of the effect in nickel as soon as possible, and extend the ex
amination to the other strongly magnetic metal cobalt. Most
of the experiments to be described in this article relate, there
fore, to nickel and cobalt. The examination of the latter was
a hasty one, and may well be described first.
    Nothin strips of the metal being at hand, a slice was sawn
 from a small block of moderately pure cast cobalt and worked
 into the form of a cross.      To the extremity of each arm of this
 cross was soldered a thin strip of copper 2 or 3 centim. long,
 for the purpose of making the electrical connexions. The
 cross of cobalt with the copper strips attached was now fast
 ened with hard cement to a strip of glass and worked down
 with a file to sufficient thinness.       Before placing the cross
 upon the glass                its
                         thickness, and that      the glass also, was of
 measured   by   the  calipers.  After cementing    the two together,
 the total thickness was     found, and, again,  the thickness    the                           of
  whole after the cross had been filed down. The thickness of
  the cross    its final condition was thus estimated at 45 mil
                     in
 lim.,    to
          which value          uncertainty
                                       an      perhaps            perof              10   or    15
cent. attaches.
      With this apparatus                 it   was found that the direction                     of   the
 transverse effect             in    cobalt    is +,     the same
                                                           i.   e.    that      as         in       iron.
 As    to   the magnitude                 of   the effect,       Mºy        was found           to    be
 44   x   10", placing cobalt between silver and iron.                            The speci
         cobalt used, however, contained                                   some nickel (how
          in is of
 men
 much    not known accurately); and this doubtless counter
 acted     part the effect    the cobalt.      ofseems probable,           It
 however, that, allowing for     errors,            all
                                         the transverse effect                                         in
 cobalt   less than that
            is             iron, other things being equal. The
                                          in
 magnetic field used was about 9000 (cm.-gr.-sec.), stronger
 than has yet been used with iron.

   We now return to          the consideration of nickel.
    The   original  experiment      with this metal had been made with

 a specimen so irregular, that it had not been possible to deter
mine the magnitude of the transverse effect except in the most
general way. The direction had been determined beyond ques
tion. The specimen of nickel now employed, and with
the results to be given were obtained, was quite different in
ºf
appearance and physical condition from the first specimen—
though it was obtained in about the same manner, viz. by
             off a piece of nickel plating from the metal upon
which it had been electrolytically deposited.                 The first spe
cimen was      very   brittle,  the second     quite    tough.    The latter

the same strength, but varying within wide limits the inten
sity ofthe magnetic field.      We should       this way ascertain        in

Mr. Hopkinson has suggested “rotational coefficient of resist
ance;” and possibly some quantity might be found which
                                        /
would demand that title.                               At    first sight           *. which       is an elec
tromotive force divided by a quantity proportional to a cur
rent, would seem to be of the nature of a resistance; but it is
to be noticed that the electromotive force E' is not the cause,
but the effect, of the current implied in W.

                                    have described in previous
papers, no account was taken of the temperature of the con
ductor experimented upon. When these experiments upon
nickel, however, had been going on for a long time, it began
to be suspected that the temperature of the room, and so of
the nickel plate, did exercise a very considerable influence
upon      magnitude                                                                                         by

Moreover this difference must have varied somewhat with the
strength of the direct current; so that the temperature read
can be assumed to give only a very rough indication of the
changes in temperature of the nickel.
    None of the numerical results of measurements made with
nickel before the disturbing influence of temperature was dis
covered are here published.       In some of the results afterwards
obtained, however, the effects of variations of temperature can
apparently be detected, as will be pointed out hereafter.
       e general method of experiment has been already suffi
ciently described in previous papers.      There will now be given

 Was         one Bunsen cell would send through—say, six or
 eight ohms.     It will be seen that there are variations of about
 6 per cent. in tan a ; and the actual variations in the primary
 current may possibly have been considerably greater than
 this; for on March 11th, 12th, and 14th the galvanometer
 stood in a different room from that in which it was placed for
 the previous observations, and the horizontal intensity of the
 earth's magnetism was probably somewhat different in the two
 places.   I have, however, as stated above, assumed that within
 the limits of these variations the value of E' is a linear func
 tion of the direct current. It is evident that no large error
 can result from this assumption.
    It will be seen from the table that the experiments began
 with the smallest values of the magnetizing force and went on
 by stages to the highest. This is the proper course to follow
 in order to avoid at any stage of the magnetizing force the
 effects of a previous stronger magnetizing force.            It must,
 however, be stated that, before the series of experiments whose
 results are here published was begun, the nickel had already
 been several times subjected to a magnetizing force of about
 7500, i. e. four or five times as great as the forces with which

this series begins. The question, of course, arises whether
there may not have been induced by this means a permanent
magnetism sufficient to affect the results of subsequent expe
riments.     In order to settle this question as far as                {l
small  piece   of nickel  film,  of the same   quality as the   strip in
use, was first subjected to the action of a field of about 7000
or 8000.      It was then placed in a field of perhaps 1500 or
1600, whose direction was such as to tend to reverse any per
manent magnetization which might have been induced in the
film by the previous field. It was found that now in the
second field the nickel became magnetized, temporarily at
least, in the direction of that field. No attempt,              believe,                                           I

In order to  compare them with the observations above given,
we need to plot them in some manner that will lay off the
values of $8 (M in Prof. Rowland's first paper) on the base
line. We may then take as ordinates the values of the
magnetic permeability, as Rowland has done in his first paper
(plate iii.), or the values of k, Neumann's coefficient of
induced magnetization, or the values of 5, the “magnetic
force”" within the nickel, which would be a reversal of one
method used by Rowland in his first paper (plate ii.); or,
finally, we may use the values of 3, “the intensity of magne
tization according to the German theory,” as Rowland calls
it in his second article.
    Having plotted these various curves we may compare them
with
   f   (1) above, in order to determine whether our quantity
     corresponds                                         p, to k, to            $5,   or        3.

in iron and cobalt, make a prediction by analogy as/ to what
would prove to be the character of the curves for W. in these
metals.    We should say that they would be sensibly straight
for a much longer distance than the curve for                and that
in fact it might be difficult to carry the magnetization far
enough to detect any marked departure from a straight course.
So great a difference in behaviour as is indicated by a reversal
of the sense of the transverse effect, however, makes any such
predictions hazardous.
    This difference of sign in the rotational coefficients of the
magnetic metals is so anomalous and so important a fact, that
one returns again and again to                                  its

 170                   Dr. E. H. Hall on the “Rotational Coefficient”
should be undertaken as soon as practicable. It will require
very great intensities of the magnetic field and a very large
battery" to carry these metals through a range of magnetiza
tion corresponding to that through which nickel has been
examined. It seems doubtful whether the magneto-electric
machine can be here employed, as the current which it pro
duces may not be sufficiently uniform to be used with ad
vantage.
   The examination of the non-magnetic metals also should be
continued as fast as circumstances will permit, with the object
of determining the sign and, when practicable, approximately
the magnitude of the rotational coefficient in every case.

     In my article of last November                                       I stated          that, in accordance
    * In the experiments here detailed, the largest battery used has con
sisted of 48 large Bunsen cells arranged 8 in series. The resistance of
each cell was                  something more than an ohm; the resistance of
the electromagnet                      Iis,

                                      had tested the Kerr effect
with one specimen of nickel, and found it to be of the same
sign as the effect which Kerr had observed with iron.         In
order to prevent mistakes, the experiment was repeated with
iron, or rather,           I
                  suppose, with steel, the result being the same
which Kerr had obtained.     The surface of nickel first used in
this way was the coating upon one of the plates of Prof. Row
land's absolute electrometer, the metal beneath being brass.
Two other specimens of nickel have since been tried. One
was a coating deposited electrolytically directly upon the iron
pole of the electromagnet, the other was a nickel film fastened
with soft cement to a plate of glass.                     Probably none of
these specimens was pure; but (and this is a matter of more

netized".    For this purpose two strips         silver upon glassof
were used; and these strips were fastened one upon each pole
of  the magnet, the silvered surfaces being turned toward each
other and      nearly parallel
                   as               practicable. The poles being
                                                as

sitated the use of a large quantity of substance, the conse
quence being that the mercury in the bulb was so much heated

   At first we endeavoured      make allowance for the loss of

seen at once that there are some differences much larger than
the rest.  On close examination, it is seen that they belong
exclusively to the Vulgar Fractions whose denominators are
small—1, 2, 3, &c.                     I

180                    Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet on the
    A few words may be said about the improvements in the
arrangement of the bottle-notes" with which my investigations
on beats have been conducted.             It was found that the clips
used to hold the india-rubber        tubes,  through which water was
admitted to the       bottles, were not     sufficiently   tight, and the
arrangement of a small reservoir to each note was not conve
nient. The corks were also frequently defective ; and it was
found difficult to procure them sound when of the proper size.
A number of india-rubber corks were obtained, two inches
in diameter; and the bottles were fitted with these. A number
of glass stopcocks were also obtained, such as are used in ordi
nary chemical apparatus.          In this way the difficulty as to the
tightness of the water-tubes was completely overcome.
    An india-rubber tube was carried from the water-supply of
the laboratory, and slipped on to any of the glass-stopcock
 tubes into which water was to be introduced.                 An aspirator
 was similarly employed at first to remove water when required.
 But it was ultimately found more convenient simply to detach
 the end of the india-rubber tube from the water-supply, and                           let
 the end hang down over the waste. When the india-rubber tube
is  full    water, this constitutes simple and efficient aspirator.

     During the last severe winter the laboratory was almost
 uninhabitable, and little was done. An arrangement for
  heating         by
                gas with ventilation proved        failure; the moisture

condensed    in the ventilating-tubes, and injured the machinery.
The   arrangement    has been removed.
   The principal work done since that time has been the con
struction of two disk machines and the clock governor. One
rather elaborate disk machine with clock governor attached is
finished and ready for experiment. The disks are made of
brass, and have thirty radial slots.                 If
                                               the machine is suc
cessful, it will enable determinations of tuning-forks to be
made with great accuracy by merely striking them and looking
at them through the revolving disk.
    A good deal of incidental work has been done, on the prin
ciple that it is best to provide complete and efficient apparatus
for every point as it arises. In particular, considerable addi
tions have been made to the lathe, including an overhead
motion (the existing back-motion proving insufficient for
some purposes).
    In slotting the disks in the lathe, it was found that saws of
the ordinary form were unsuitable for the purpose, as they
soon choked when imbedded in the brass.               This difficulty
was overcome       according   to a principle  suggested    by Willis.
 Where    choking   takes place,  the number of    cutting-teeth is to
 be reduced.      A small steel circular saw was therefore con
 structed with four teeth only on the circumference; by means
 of this the disks were slotted on the lathe without difficulty.
 A new tool, however, has been recently invented in Oxford,
 which promises to overcome this difficulty by the application
 of more power to the ordinary saw. It will also extend greatly
 the applicability to         all
                           forms      circular cutter, whose use has
                                          of
 hitherto been limited      bythe same difficulty.
    The first disk machine constructed consisted simply                            of   a
 solid foundation carrying the spindle           which the disk re

   secured which is    independent     of the variations of the ultimate
  source of power. The arrangement by which the endless rope
  drives and is wound up are identical, and deserve a moment's
  attention.
      This arrangement is founded on a combination attributed to
  Sir C. Wren, described in Willis's ‘Principles of Mechanism.”
  The description, however, is either incomplete or inaccurate;
  and  I  had to try some models before                    I
                                                     arrived at the form                              I
  have   adopted.
      The arrangement of Wren is figured at p. 431 of Willis.
  It consists of two parallel cylinders, in each of which four
  circular grooves are cut. The rope is passed round the cylin
  ders as if it were wound on the two together from outside,
  being in contact with half a circumference at each point of
  contact, and thence passing to the other cylinder. "I have

boxes, whose fly-wheels are driven by an arrangement of this

roughly ; they are mere slits, and are cut straight, not to the
angle of the screw.             I
                           first cut the required teeth in the shape
of square  slots,  cut to the angle of the screw, but not rounded
or finished in     any  way. The wheel so cut drove the disk
beautifully.      I
                  then gave some further cuts to the sharp edges,
and rounded them off so as to fit the surface of the screw rather
neatly.       The wheel then refused to drive the disk at all.                                 It
appeared   as if the greater surface in contact increased the
friction so as to stop the action. Eventually      cut away the              I
greater part of the rounded edges of the teeth again, and the
wheel now drives the disk quite well.                          I
                                            believe that straight
square slots, in which the surface in contact would be reduced
to a minimum, would be the best form of tooth for this purpose.

        N  a criticism on Dr. Mills's Researches on Thermometry,
         published in the July number of the Philosophical Maga
    zine, we stated that we believed that he had committed an
    error which “upsets        the inferences drawn by him from his

    rection-factors, total remaining ascents), by which they are
    only indirectly measured.
        We stated that,       our opinion, Dr. Mills's experiments
                                     in
    prove that the “exposure corrections [expressed                y=                                 by

N and       T–t
              must be less than at 100°.     They, too, are factors
of the  correction; and if their variations are taken into account,
our statements that the example worked out by us was favour
able to Dr. Mills's views, and that the corrections for three of
the thermometers were practically identical below 100°, are
strictly correct.    Let us investigate this point a little more
  i.
fully.
if,   in
        corrections may be considered as practically identical
      the case     any thermometer, we may substitute for the

from all the thermometers.
  For the thermometers referred                                          by    us   (2,   3,   and        6)

expression for the mean correction
                 y=(.00013591+-000000051152N)N(T-t).
Subtracting this from the correction for thermometer                                                        2,   we

186                Messrs. Thorpe and Rücker's Remarks on
 thermometer 2, A=0-11 when N=273.                     In the case of ther
 mometer 3, A=0.01 when N=156; 8 vanishes when N=312,
 and is 0.01 when N = 400.              Finally, in the case of thermo
 meter   6,   the  largest   value of 8 is 0:13, which occurs when
 N = 400.
   Of these quantities, the value of A for thermometer 4 is
considerably in excess of the error of reading.                 It is not in
this case, however, a question of the error of reading only.
An experiment conducted with an exposed scale is in that
respect conducted under unfavourable circumstances; and the
other errors thus introduced are far more important. This
can readily be shown from Dr. Mills's own paper.
   He says (Trans. Roy. Soc. Edinb. 1880, p. 570) that there
appeared to be in the experiments some source of variation
which      Icould not detect.” Thus the value of the correction
factor varied between 0.000113 and 0.000164 in the first of
the three series of observations of which details are given,
between 0.000136 and 0.000165 in the second, and between
0.000140 and 0.000166 in the third.               On the other hand, the
mean correction-factor for                the       all
                                               thermometers,      and that

    zero is thus given by the formula as unchangeable in direction.
    It is not reversed when y=0; and the evidence, if of any value

    the theory of the three movements of the zero of a thermo

and suppose that we have given   us the equation in 2, and that
we are asked whether it can be made to take a binomial form.
The answer is this. When (1) and (2) are identically satisfied
it can be made to take such a form. And since (3) only de
termines a-e, we may give any value we please to one of the
quantities a, e, and we shall nevertheless have four disposable
quantities, f, g, h, and k, wherewith to satisfy the four out
standing equations which, apart from (1), (2), and (3), have
still to be satisfied.

                                W= o(a +3),
the above equivalent for (1), can be put under the form

while the last equation of art. 23 becomes

of which solutions the latter is irrelevant, because it does not
solve the equivalent of (2).   But the former satisfies both (1),

196                     Messrs. Ayrton and Perry on the
  33. It follows that the relation of art. 27 may be represented
by some case of
                        +3(I+J)+(U-2) +2=0;
and when this single condition is fulfilled, the biordinal can
be linked with a terordinal whereof the factors in both nume
rator and denominator are in arithmetical progression. The
values of the arbitrary or indeterminate quantities A and E
will, of course, have to be properly assigned.
   34. Returning to art. 21, we get a second and a third set
of relations, viz.
                             A=} + V4–L,              E=},
and
                             A=#,         E=} + V+–N;
and     in either case we have
                                        (Q–1)*= o”.
   35. Taking the second set (E=}), we see that Q-1=o,
and that  (5), leaves N free. But it would seem that the four
conditions cannot be fulfilled unless L, M, N be connected by
at least two relations. This last remark applies also to the
third set (A=}), wherein Q–1 = –0, and (4), leaves L free.
   36. In the fourth set (A, E=}) we have both L and N left
free and 0–1, w=0.       And if we take the radicals positively,
(1), and (2), are each satisfied by b-0 or by      –2. Thus,         U-
                                                                          ...i
bearing in mind Boole's transformations, we may say that
when U is an even integer, the biordinal can be          with a
terordinal of the form described in art. 33. This last result
is confirmed by, and confirms, another process by which I have

                  Index of Refraction of Ebonite.               197
pair of delicate Bell's telephones, we had succeeded in showing,
1st, that there was refraction when intermittent radiation from
the oxyhydrogen light passed through an ebonite prism; and,
2ndly, that the index of refraction of that ebonite was approxi
mately 17.
    Exceedingly great care had to be taken, in consequence of
the feebleness of the sounds given out by the telephones; and,
from the nature of the experiment, we obtained the index of
refraction for that narrow band of rays which experienced least
absorption.
    Shortly after these results were published, Prof. Fitzgerald,
of Dublin, suggested, in conversation, the possibility of check
ing them by measuring the polarizing angle of light reflected
from ebonite, on the assumption that the refracted ray is at
right angles to the reflected one when giving maximum pola
rization.    Subsequently Dr. Jellett was so kind as to make
these   experiments,  the results of which Prof. Fitzgerald per
 mits us to quote.     The mean index of refraction for ebonite
 thus obtained, on Fresnel's theory, was 1611.
    Later on we repeated our selenium experiments, replacing
 the intermittent oxyhydrogen light with an intermittent elec
 tric light, and increasing the electromotive force in the sele
 nium telephone-circuit to about 60 volts. A confirmation of
 our former result was obtained; but, although we were able to
 take greater precautions to ensure accuracy, we obtained no
 more than a confirmation; and from the difficulty of hearing
 the weak sounds in the telephones, we felt that the index of
 refraction thus measured might be as much as 1-8 or as small
 as 1-6.
    In  the course of these experiments, however, it was noticed
 that visible red rays were certainly refracted; and consequently
 we proceeded to make measurements according to ordinary
 optical methods, using the apparatus shown in the figure.
 L (fig. 1) is a fairly powerful electric light produced by a
 Gramme machine;       §  is a glass lens giving a parallel beam of
 light, part of which passes through the slit, S, ºn inch wide,
 and falls on the edge of the ebonite prism P.         F is a frame
 holding tissue-paper, which can be moved about P as centre,
 and which carries an index, I, pointing to the graduations on
 the circle, as seen in fig. 2. There was a fine vertical line in
 the middle of the tissue-paper; and HG, forming about one third
 of the paper, was well blackened.           First this screen was
 moved into such a position that the edge of the prism threw a
 black shadow which was bounded by the fine central line, and
 between that line and the blackened portion H G was a thin
 band of white light.     In fact a narrow beam from the slit fell

on the edge of the prism; and half was stopped by the prism,
the other half going on. The index-reading in this position was
taken; and now the screen was moved round until a red spec
trum was seen. At the least-refrangible end this spectrum termi
nated nearly abruptly, as the ordinary visible spectrum usually
does ; and this end was made to coincide with the central line
in the screen, and the index-reading taken when, after moving
the prism itself, it was supposed that we had minimum devia
tion. The index-reading was also taken in the same way for
the most-refrangible                  .#

      a paper by Captain Abney and Colonel Festing, recently
     In
read before the Physical Society and printed in the Philoso
phical Magazine for June, on the Transmission of Radiation
through Ebonite, reference is made to our original experi
ments; and the authors say that, judging, from the figure
accompanying our Note, they should think that the thickness
of the ebonite prism traversed by the intermittent beam must
have been about one fourth of an inch. We are afraid that that
figure is liable to give this misconception; in drawing it we
were merely paying attention to the directions of the incident
and refracted beam, and not to the actual thickness of the
ebonite, which was in fact very small indeed where the inter
mittent beam passed through                                 it.

                          and Recording Earthquake-Motions.                                              205
     been  for some time used by Prof. Chaplin at the Tokio Uni
     versity.        I
                  have since heard from Prof. Chaplin that he ob
     tained the idea from a Zöllner's pendulum.  Prof. Chaplin was
     no doubt the first in this country, perhaps the first anywhere,
     who applied this certainly valuable arrangement to the measure
     ment of earthquake-motion.         While talking over my experi
     ments, Mr. Milne expressed a strong desire to have a direct
     record of the earthquake from some such arrangement; but a
     suitable mode of obtaining it did not then suggest itself.
     Since that time, however, it has occurred to me that two
     levers hinged together will not only give this arrangement,
     but will avoid at the same time one very serious source of
                                                                                                   º:
     disturbance, namely the shock which the mass receives in con
     sequence of the direction of motion not being at right
     to the direction of the lever. Acting on this idea,             made a                   I
     sketch of the arrangement described in this paper, and showed
     it to Mr. Milne, who at once offered to give the instrument a
                 I
     trial if did not care to do so. In consequence of this, one of
     these instruments has been in course of construction for some
     time, but unfortunately has not yet (March 23) been finished
      sufficiently for exhibition to the Society.
         The principle and form of this machine will be readily un
      derstood by reference to fig. 3.      A post, P, resembling in all
     respects a light gate-post, is fixed firmly in the ground; and
      to it a species of gate, A, is hinged in a manner almost iden
      tical in form with that usually adopted.          The hinge, H, is
      capable of being moved backwards and forwards,                position                 its

 206         Mr. T. Gray       on 1nstruments     for Measuring
  of B is slightly different, a light bracket being introduced for
  the purpose of raising the ring R, and allowing room for the
  registering-lever.       The ring R is pivoted so that it can turn
  round a vertical axis, thus rendering more definite the point
  which remains steady.           A stiff bar, b, fixed to the post P at
  one end, carries the universal joint in which the writing-lever,
  l, turns. This universal joint consists of four very light bent
  springs, fixed at the lower end to a round ring, and at the
  upper end to a small disk through which the lever l passes,
  and to which it is soldered.        The four springs are arranged at
  right angles to each other, and offer a slight elastic resistance
  to the rotation of the lever l, and consequently of B and A.
  This resistance is made so small that the period of oscillation
  of B is very long. The reason for using this peculiar form of
 joint is to prevent a gradual displacement of R by the top of
  l when the plate on which l writes is kept moving by clock
  work. The static friction, even with the precaution taken in
 this machine, will probably be much greater than the pressure
 of l; but a slight motion might take place during the shaking.
 The ideas of calculating the positions of H and H' and of
 pivoting the ring R which are used in this paper, are taken
 from Prof. Ewing's paper “On an Astatic Horizontal-Lever
  Seismograph,” communicated at last meeting to this Society,
                                                 I
 or rather from a conversation which had with him previous
 to the reading of that paper.           I  have generally been in the
 habit of finding approximately the steady part by experiment;
 and in many cases this is almost the only satisfactory method".
     In using this instrument, the two gates A and B are ad
justed so that their planes are accurately at right angles to
 each other, each inclined at an angle of 45° to the front of the
 |.     P. The gates are so made that when in this position the
   ever l is vertical.      At the lower end of the lever l a thin
 sewing-needle, m, slides up and down through two small loops.
 Under this needle the plate p, smoked to receive the record,
 is placed.     If  it is desired to separate the different motions, p
 must be moved by clockwork.

    * In the small instrument which    I  described before the Seismological
Society, the levers were so light and small compared with the ring R that
no determination of the exact proper positions of the axes were made. That
instrument promises to act very fairly as a                     I
                                                             but expect the

        height, finer and more scientifically arranged hinges, and greater

                     and Recording Earthquake-Motions.                            207
  I suggested   that a conical pendulum would probably be found
 a good   arrangement for registering one component of the
 motion of the earth during an earthquake. Since that time
                                         º
an instrument on this principle has been made ; and as it has
been found to be very suitable for this purpose, a short de
scription of it may be interesting.
   The instrument is shown in plan and elevation in fig. 4. In
that drawing P is a post              is intended to be fixed firmly
in the ground, and may project above it from a foot to a foot
and a half. W, W are weights fixed to the ends of the cross
bars b, each pair forming the bob of a conical pendulum. The
suspending wires, t, t, of these pendulums are attached to cross
pieces, c,c, slotted and made to slide under clamping-screws, s,s,
By sliding the cross pieces c, c backwards and forwards and
turning them round to one side or other, the point of suspen
sion can be adjusted until it is vertically above the point p at
which the small cross arm a rests. This cross arm a serves
the double purpose of causing the bob of the pendulum to
move in a circle, if it moves at all, and of forming the short
arm of the lever l, which is used for writing a component of
the motion of the earth.        When the pendulum is adjusted in
the  way  just   described the bob is evidently in neutral equili
brium in any position; and hence any error due to oscillatory
motion is avoided.         Since, however, it is desirable that the
 º
instrument should have a small amount of stability, it may be
made to have a long period of oscillation round a definite
       by adjusting the point of suspension a little forward, or
  y fixing the top of the suspending wire and allowing              tor     its
sional rigidity
                                                    in of

                          to                   the bob.
   The only points where friction acts         this machine are      p';     p,
and since the    pressure       theseonpoints      small,   they

                                                      this respect the
conical-pendulum machine has           decided advantage over most

that the wire t           be lengthened. The question of mas

 late the position of the float. An instrument of this kind was
 made for water as the floating medium, and gave results which
justify the assumption that, by causing it to write on a moving
plate, it is capable of giving valuable information as to the
magnitude of the vertical movement.         This instrument has,
however, the disadvantage of being very large, and conse
 quently inconvenient; and I propose therefore to use mercury
instead of water. Fig. 5 indicates a form which may be
 adopted in such a case.
    Referring to the figure, F is a varnished, or otherwise pro
tected, lead floatplaced in a wood or iron vessel, V, filled with
 mercury.    A fine wire is fixed to the lower end of the float,
and, passing loosely through a hole in the plate p, serves to
prevent the float from turning round. A weight, W, sufficient
 to completely submerge the float is applied to the stem above
the surface of the mercury.      To the upper end of the stem a
a wire or   thread,  W,  is attached, which is passed through a
 small hole in the  top of the vessel V, and then over the pulley
 l, to which the index, i, is attached. With this arrangement
 the period of vertical oscillation can be made very long; and
 consequently each individual motion of the earth can be re
 corded on a moving surface, such as a drum D, relatively to an
 undulating line due to the slow up-and-down movement of the
 float.  By using the pulley l, the sensibility of the instru
 ment is made constant for any position within the range of the
motion.

 I have   contrived for registering vertical motions, and which

         In  February last, when           began these experiments,

            vibration.     Hence we are led         conjecture that there
                                                                    to

the selenium    always    split off from the copper plate.            order             In

   The preparation was,         in accordance with that          the photo   of

                                                a                     about             of
3  millim.    thickness;      this was covered                     by
                                                            thin sheet  a                         of
mica,   on  which the selenium which eventually flowed off was
collected.      The copper plate having reached the melting
point   of amorphous selenium, was covered with this substance
and thereupon removed from the brass plate. On being re
moved   it  cooled quickly; and            on nowit   black brilliant layer
                                                               a
of amorphous selenium remained. The larger brass plate having
also cooled, the copper plate covered with selenium was again
laid  on    and again slowly warmed,
           it                                    that the selenium crys
                                                        so
tallized. The     temperature      was still further raised, near        the                 to
point   at which the     crystalline   selenium begins         melt. The     to
selenium was then annealed.
   But, notwithstanding this caution,             was not possible        fix                to

        and      the lower side blue-black, not brilliant but dull.
     the same way the copper plate had now                     similar dull a
blue-black     covering.      This blue-black      body      cuprous    sele
                                                                        is
nide, Cu,Se.. There were thus three layers—copper, cuprous
selenide, and selenium; and              the copper-selenium-zinc cell
                                          in
two other   layers—selenide          of
                                     zinc and zinc.;      that     together
                                                                       so         all
there were five     layers.
I     took thinner copper plates; but the splitting-off still
occurred.

 216                             Dr.      J.   Moser on the Microphonic
    This eageriment shows that between the copper and the
 selenium, or rather the cuprous selenide, there is only a slight
 and imperfect contact.
         But the same is the case in the photophonic cell.                                                In
  this also the three layers—copper, cuprous selenide, sele
  mium—follow one after the other. The plates give only an
  enlarged view of what is to be observed in the photophonic
  cell on a smaller scale, and with more difficulty, by the eye.
  Thus we see that in the photophonic selenium cell also we
  have only a similar slight and imperfect contact, which is to
  be influenced by radiation. It was first by this experiment
  that it became obvious to me that a microphonic effect is the
  essential part of the action of the selenium cells.
         I
       was confirmed in this conclusion, that the selenium photo
                                                         I
   hone is a microphone, when learned that Mr. Sumner Tainter
{.    constructed a photophone in which selenium was replaced
 by carbon. Indeed his apparatus, the zigzag line filled with
 carbon on the silver-coated glass plate, is nothing else than a
 microphone.                     If
                    we remember the apparatus described by Mr.
 Hughes as a thermoscope, we understand that the selenium
 photophone of Messrs. Graham Bell and Sumner Tainter

                 principle with the carbon photophone
                                                                                                  as of
 agrees in                                                   the
 latter; and, again, this                       is   in

 thermoscope.
    Thus my attention became now more directed                those                          to

 the platinum wires form gratings or interlying spirals, is un
.
 questionably the best form to employ when the object in
 view is to obtain a high sensitiveness to light” ".
    Both authors assume the selenium to possess a special
 sensitiveness, and this quality to be damaged by the high
resistance of the junctions.          Therefore they aim at annihi
lating this resistance at the surfaces of contact.             Aiming
 at this annihilation, they enlarge the surfaces of contact and
 thus diminish the resistance.
    The surfaces of contact should indeed be enlarged. The
 reasons, however, for which this must be done are, in my
opinion, just the opposite to those influencing these two
                It is the high resistance at the junctions which
is the    variable,  and which is necessary for the microphonic
action. The case of this resistance alone being the variable
I   shall discuss immediately.           That the resistance at the
junctions is high is a necessary consequence of the imperfect
 and variable contact. To annihilate it is to render the photo
 phone insensitive.      And, vice versä, the more extensive the
 surfaces of contact    are, the more sensitive is the selenium cell.
    A further strong support, amongst others, is given to this
 theory by the observation of Mr. Bidwellf, who has made
 very numerous experiments with selenium cells. “He got the
 best speech from cells of high total resistance . . . The sele
 nium should, however, have a low specific resistance.”
    These observations are easily understood by the micro
 phonic action of the cells ; for, that the total resistance is
 to be great and yet the specific resistance of the selenium is to
 be small, has no other meaning than that there must be a bad
 contact between good conductors.
    The next question          is,this microphonic action
                                 if                           confined

also      the selenium itself.        But even     the selenium were per if
fectly homogeneous, and remained                  during the illumination,
                                                                        so

 be removed from           isolated position and coordinated with                                            all

the cells. That my present view                  the simple action      of  the                         of
selenium did not present itself              once    owing       attwo causes.is             to
     In the first place, there          the fact that the microphonic

             the so-called    heat-rays,    are produced         the selenium               in
 by  the illuminating rays.
     In the second place, complication             introduced by the fact is
 that selenium exists          four   allotropic
                                               in  modifications,     and that
 light      able
           is          exert  to     these divers influences. Though
                                                    on
 these are not essential          the action    to the photophone,       of has                         it

                                   Action of Selenium Cells.                                        219
  In   the beginning                  of April"
                                           the experiment ofI repeated
Mr. Graham Bell, and allowed light to pass through ebonite.
In order to be able to make a quantitative observation   con                                    I
nected the selenium cell, on which the light was to fall, not
only with the telephone, but also with a galvanometer.
While, however, it appeared that a photophonic effect took
place through the ebonite, it was shown that this effect was
only a small part of the direct effect when the ebonite dia
phragm was away.       Now, as ebonite allows passage only
to red and ultra-red rays, we learn from this experiment two
things:—
   (1) That the illuminating rays are those which are especi
ally absorbed by selenium, and that these produce the greater
part of the photophonic action.
   (2) That it is even possible to make a selenium photophone
without light—that                  is,
                           with exclusion          illuminating rays and
                                                                of

rays   in the selenium      photophone       has  perhaps      not yet been
sufficiently insisted on, because the most modern researches
on  light-rays are not yet assimilated                the general view                               of
physics. We find still the conception                               of to
                                                      three different kinds
of rays—heating, illuminating, and actinic; whilst                  has long               it
been demonstrated that there           only   one form is     rays, differing    of
from one another, however,                wave-length and intensity.

absorbs principally the illuminating rays. When, therefore,

the efficiency of the selenium cell, has been the second cause
which masked the microphonic action of the cell. These are
changes in the material; they concern rather the chemistry of
selenium. They are indeed purely chemical if we view the exist

quality. Into these chemical changes    shall enter here only so        I
far as it is necessary for the proof that they are not essential
to the microphonic action of the selenium cells, since my aim
now is the physical one of correlating two forces.

    That by radiation the allotropic modification of selenium
may be changed, but that such changes do not occur in the
selenium cells, was proved most conclusively by one piece of
selenium, which had the anomalous property of showing                                                                     in

222         On the Microphonic Action of Selenium Cells.
connected with the galvanometer by means           of a switch. And
      I
 now found a secondary current which went through the galva
 nometer always in the same direction, quite independent of the
 direction of the primary battery-current.       Even when the pri
 mary current was produced by a single Leclanché cell only,
 the deflection by the secondary current was 80 divisions, or
 about 5 centim. This secondary current is therefore no po
 larization-current; for in that case its direction would be
 always opposite to the primary.       But here a change of direc
 tion did not   occur,  the secondary current always flowing from
 the platinum electrode A to the platinum electrode B, and
 never in the opposite direction.
    The passage of a current also, like illumination or concus
 sion, occasioned a quicker increase of resistance.
    All these qualities, however, are very easily understood;
 and the very appearance of the piece suggests the explana
 tion. There are in it several modifications of the selenium
 side by side.    At the transformation of the one modification
 into another, as   I   have pointed out above, heat or electric
effect must take    place.    A state of equilibrium is not reached
before that modification has been formed the formation of
which is attended by the maximum development of energy—
thermal or electric. Such modification again, as also men
tioned above, has a different resistance from the one from
which it originated; and therefore the variation of resistance
is a necessary consequence of the change of modification.
While the transformation goes on, we observe the electric cur
rent; after the transformation is complete we observe the
change of resistance.
    Such changes in the modification can be also occasioned by
          i.
light: a pencil of amorphous selenium assumes, when exposed
to the daylight, a grey crystalline surface.
    Two conditions distinguish these changes from the photo
phonic ones, and prove that, as a rule, they do not occur in
the photophonic cells.
    On               the cell in which only a microphonic action
took place, the original state was reached again which it had
before being illuminated ; in the piece of selenium wherein
a change of modification occurred, this was not the case.         This
                                                        original posi
                                                     of its
is the reason why the light-spot returns to
tion  on   the galvanometer-scale       inthe case      the selenium
cell, but does not      in the case    of
                                        the selenium piece.      And,
secondly,    by  such changes     ofmodification a    phenomenon   is
produced which has been called “fatigue.”               Such fatigue
(that is,   aninsensitiveness) must take   placeas  soon      as
                                                             the store

tiveness of the last-described piece is now extremely lowered.
   And thus we see that there are two different effects which
light may have on selenium and on selenium cells. The one
is more of a chemical, the other more of a physical character.
The one is a changing of modification, and is not essential to
the efficiency of the selenium photophone.   In this latter we
have to deal essentially with a heating effect, changing volume
and contact—in brief, with a microphonic action.
   Therefore, as to the photophonic efficiency of selenium
I see no reason to separate it from       other bodies; and      all                              I
longer believe that there      any prospect    is  finding      un            of                  an

“the E.M.F. of Thomson's gravity Daniell was measured by
comparing it before and after the above experiment [the elec
tromagnetic valuation] directly with that of the above battery
by means of Sir William Thomson's quadrant-electrometer:”
the which wording conveyed to me the impression that both
cell and battery were compared under the same conditions,
viz. with insulated poles, no current flowing.          Incidentally
referring to Mr. Shida's paper (Phil. Mag. May 1880),                                                           I
                                                                  .
noticed that such a mode of working would introduce an error
due to polarization, the E.M.F. of the cell being less when                                                            \
generating a current than when                              its
                                          poles are insulated.
                                                                  Mr.                                                  ,
Shida rejoined (Phil. Mag. June 1881) that the quadrant
electrometer comparison was made whilst the cell was gene
rating    current,
           a            that the polarization-error was avoided.
                                 so
I then pointed out (Phil. Mag. July 1881) that,           Mr. Shida                     if
made the quadrant-electrometer comparison whilst the cell was
generatinga current, the electrometer-reading would         less than                       be
the true E.M.F.        the ratio of the
                             in                    resistance     the                                 to

                                  2    Mr. Shida now replies,                                                 in

 226            Dr. C. R. A. Wright on the Nnumber of
E.M.F. of      the cell,          Mr. Shida          used the following formula,
                                  E= R. H. tana. K,
where R=b+p, H is the horizontal component of terrestrial
magnetism, a is the angle of deflection of the tangent-galva
nometer, and K is a constant calculable from the dimensions
of the instrument &c. With the object of obtaining several
values of R. tan a and averaging them, Mr. Shida caused R
to vary within certain limits: unless considerably different
currents were made to flow, no sensible alteration in the
E.M.F. through polarization would occur; so that the product
R. tan a should be sensibly constant, barring unavoidable
                                                                                               of his
errors of observation. Mr. Shida states, in each of     original
papers, that R=g +b+r, where          the resistance    the gal

               to                                    each paper
the following table               of

                    &.                               r.                            R.

and thence concludes that the mean value of             tan                                 R            a    =

   Now the above numerical values are irreconcilable. Whether
Mr. Shida has copied down the wrong figures from his note
book,    or
          how     came  he print these numbers, cannot say;
                                       to                                          I

 ON THE DETERMINATION OF             THE ANGULAR DISTANCE OF THE
                 COLOURS.       BY M. A. ROSENSTIEHL.
Twº       series of experiments made upon a chromatic circle called my
      attention to three colours appearing to fulfil special functions”.
I  was thus led to discuss Young's theoryf on the three fundamental
sensations, and to establish two categories of non-complementary
colours:—1, those which by their mixture in threes at equal inten
sity produce the sensation of white; 2, those which produce that
sensation outside of those proportions.
  I   have designated the first category by the name “triad;” and                I
remarked that from their definition it follows that, representing
the table of colours by an equilateral triangle of which each vertex
is occupied by one of the colours of a triad, the complementaries
will be placed, in that construction, on the sides of the triangle and
at the extremities of a straight line passing through the point of
meeting of the median lines, while this regularity cannot exist for
the second category of combinations of three colours.
   The aim of the present note is to prove that the three colours
above referred to, viz. orange, the third yellow-green, and the third
blue, possess the characters of a triad.
                                          I
   By a first series of experiments determine the pairs of comple
mentary colours. By a second series I ascertain the proportions in
which the three colours chosen must be mixed in order to obtain
the sensation of white.         By a third series I seek to reproduce a
determined colour by the mixture of two or three colours:                        all
these experiments are made with rotating disks; the measurement
of  the angles  of  the sectors gives the position        of
                                                       this colour    the   on
sides of  the  triangle.   In  the calculationsI     not take into consi

 determined sensation of 'colour. The results of the three series of
 experiments are summed up in the following figure.
                                   3rd yellow-green.
                                   _º
         3rd blue                                                  Orange.
                      Violet-blue.          Violet.    Red.
    It is there seen that the straight lines which join the comple
 mentary colours intersect in a single point.                     Consequently the
three separate colours form part of a triad; here is their position
in the spectrum :—
               Orange at . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     from C to D.
               Green (3rd      yellow-green)        at # from D to E.
               Blue (3rd blue) at . . . . . . . . # from F to G.
 I repeated the last two series of experiments, methodically repla
cing one of the three colours by another.                   I did the same with the
three colours which Maxwell considers fundamental.                         None of
these systems give regular results.                 Some colours which to the eye
are very close are in them separated by large spaces, while some
distinct colours are there brought very near together and almost
blended, and the lines joining two complementary colours do not
intersect in only one point.
   The two propositions above formulated are therefore in accord
ance with experiment.
   To complete the demonstration of the existence of the triads, it
remains for me to prove that all the colours which occupy the vertices
of an inscribed equilateral triangle possess the same properties.
   I  ascertained that it really is so by recommencing the same series
of  experiments      with the triad formed by the first violet, the blue
green, and a yellow comprised between the first and second yellows
of my chromatic circle. These three colours are distant 120° in
the above figure.        The results of the experiment are there indi
cated.      It will be remarked, not only that the complementary.
colours are situated at the extremities of a straight line passing
through the point of intersection of the median lines, but also that
the new figure is exactly superposable to the first in what concerns
the position of the intervening colours.                    We may conclude from
this that the angular distance of the colours is the same, whichever may
be the triad employed as starting-point.

   This angular distance is therefore determined once for all; but

make use           the experimental arrangement

 and   it has given me the best results.
    An ordinary observation consists               two viewings, each suscep
                                                                    of
tible      of   an
                error. The method above explained admits                        four                              of
errors for the double deflection, and six for the triple deflection.
It    istherefore necessary                    to
                                      determine whether the measurements
 thus made possess greater precision than direct measurements.
     If the experimenter placed the axis             the half-wave plate every
                                                                         of

incident rays,          with the plane that bisects the system with pen
 umbrae,      it evident that the same precision
                   is                                       measurement applied    of

therefore          on

sitiveness of the observation is considerably augmented, and the
determination is made with much greater precision than the ordi
nary measurements.
   On discussing the perturbing influence of a small difference be
tween the real position of the plane of symmetry of the polarizer
and the initial position of the principal plane of the analyzer, one
perceives that the error committed in the orientation of the axis of
the crystal plate is about one half less, and that, if        the viewings                   of all
are made with the same       precision, the  employment      the foregoing
method reduces the errors of observation to about three fourths of
their value for the double, and          two thirds for the triple deflec

    Besides, the observer finds                         in

           THEnology       in science cannot be overestimated, since a
   want of      precision in language leads to vagueness in thought,
  and often to errors in philosophy.            There are few more stri
  king examples of indefiniteness in language than can be found
  in the use of the words physic, physiology, and their deriva
  tives. The material universe is designated with etymological
  correctness as physical (that is to say, natural)—a term which
  belongs alike to the organic and the mineral kingdoms; but
  in the use of this and of other words having a similar etymo
  logy (Gr. ºbtats, Lat. natura) we find in modern language
  many restrictions, limitations, and ambiguities.             It will aid
  us in our present inquiry if we bear in mind that both the
  Greek physis and the Latin natura involve the notion of a

century, employed the word (in French physique) with the
same signification; and it was subsequently used by Locke in
a still more comprehensive sense.         He writes of “The know
ledge of things as they are in their own proper beings, their
constitutions, properties, and operations; whereby           mean not                I
only matter and body, but spirits also, which have their proper
natures, constitutions, and operations, as well as bodies.       This,

natural philosophy”.
    § 5. We have seen that in Latin the words physic and phy
siology were used synonymously.          That they were thus under
stood   by    English  writers is  apparent    from the ‘Universal
English Dictionary’ of Edward Phillips (sixth edition, 1706),
where Physiology is defined as “a discourse on natural things;
physics or natural philosophy; being either general, that
relates to the affections or properties of matter, or else special
and particular, which considers matter as formed or distin
guished into such and such species.” Cotgrave, a lexicogra
}.     of the seventeenth century, in his ‘French and English
   ictionary, also defines Physiologie as “a reasoning, dispu
ting, or searching-out of the nature of things,” a definition
which is cited by Charles Richardson in his *English Dictio
nary,’ under Physiology.
    § 6. It was to those who occupied themselves with abstract
or general physiology (as defined by Phillips) that the Greeks
gave the name of physiologists, first applied to the philoso
phers of the Ionian school, who sought to derive                things                   all
from one       or
                more material elements, and thus had          physical               a

 Poetics, makes the criticism that           was more    he  physiolo         of a

     9. There is an example of a special application of the
words physiology and physic which requires further conside
ration. W. have already cited Cotgrave's first definition of
the word Physiologie, to which he adds, as a secondary mean
ing, “anatomizing physic, or that part of physic which treats
of the composition or structure of man's frame.” In more
recent times, however, the term has come to mean, not the
anatomy, composition, or structure of the human frame, but
  its
    functions,      which signification physiology

rently synonymous with naturiste, which, as stated by the
learned Littré in his Dictionnaire, meant “a mediciner who
practised expectant medicine—that is to say, who trusted to
the conservative influences of nature to heal his patient.”
    § 11. For the origin of the physician or naturian in medi
cine, we must go back more than twenty centuries, to the great
Hippocrates, justly styled the father of medicine.      It was a
maxim of his school that “nature is the healer of diseases”*;
and himself it was who wrote of medicine, that “the art con
 sists in three things—the malady, the patient, and the medi
 ciner. The mediciner is the servant of nature, and the patient
 must help the mediciner to combat the disease”f.
    Nature, in the language of the time, was spoken of as a                                                       vis
 medicatric,       healing power; but Virchow justly remarks
                      or
 that, from     careful perusal
                  a             the works left    of   the great                        us    by
master, we cannot doubt that       nature              by
                                              meant the whole                  he

agencies, but upon the belief that nature works according                                                         to

 distinguish between the physician and the professional healer
 of diseases. From medicare came the mediaeval Latin verb
 medicinare, whence the French verb médeciner and the sub
 stantive medecin, corresponding          which we find    to    German                 in

   § 18. Dynamics in the abstract regard matter in general,
without relation to species, the genesis of which is the office
of the chemical process or chemism.         This gives rise to mine
ralogical, or so-called chemical, species, which, theoretically,
may be supposed to be formed from a single element or
materia prima by the chemical process.
  “It    is necessary to distinguish between the production of
new species differing in physical characters f and that repro
duction which belongs to organic existences.        The distinction
arises from that individuation which marks the results of
organic life, and is eminently characteristic of               higher                               its

“I  think the facts leave no doubt that the very mightiest
among the chemical forces are of electrical origin; . . . but                       I
do not suppose that other molecular forces are excluded,
working directly from atom to atom”.
   The activities which appear in dynamic and in chemic
phenomena are one in essence; for force is one.      The same
                                          organic growth,
                                                                    š.
is true of the activities manifested in                    and
even in thought; but the unity and mutual convertibility
of different manifestations of force afford no ground for con
founding, as some would do, dynamics with                      or with
vital or mental processes.       All of these phenomena are but
the evidences of universal animation, or, in other words, of
an energy which is inherent in matter, the manifestations of
which, as matter rises to higher stages of development, become
more complex, as organic individuals are themselves more com
plex than mineral forms.
    § 21. From the process which generates chemical species
we pass to that which gives rise to organized individuals, in
which appear a new class of phenomena, distinguished alike
from those of dynamics and those of chemism.               These new
manifestations, which are called vital, involve dynamical and
 chemical activities, but display, in addition to these, still
higher ones. Matter on this more elevated plane not only
 becomes individualized, but adapts itself to external condi
 tions by organization, and exhibits in the resulting forms the
 power of growth by assimilation and of reproduction. The

of vitality. To the gradual manner in which the colloidal
changes take place (for they always require time as an ele
ment) may the characteristic protraction of chemico-organic
changes also be referred "*.
   Following Graham, Herbert Spencer has noted that plia
bility, elasticity, the power of absorbing water with change of
bulk, and the phenomenon of osmosis, the whole of which are
well designated by him as showing sensitiveness to external
agencies which are mechanical or quasi mechanical—are pos
sessed  in common by mineral colloids and by organized sub
stances.    These phenomena are examples of that “continuous
adjustment of internal relations to external relations” which
characterizes organic lifef. When the chemist shall have

    When the energy which is in matter is manifested without
reference to species, we call it simply dynamics; when it
results in the production of mineral species, we call it chemics,
or chemism; and when it gives rise to organisms, which may
be defined as kinetic individuals, we distinguish it as vital, or

name     of physiology was given; and the two terms are in fact
synonymous. The study of nature, as has been shown, divides
itself into physiography and physiology; and this division
applies equally to each one of the three great kingdoms of
nature. Thus, for example, Physiographical Botany studies
the relations of plants to each other as members of the vege
table kingdom, and investigates their external forms and
relationships, by which we arrive at Systematic and Descrip

        especially, those who are engaged in an attempt to
advance that science by experimental work, there must be
many who feel that, notwithstanding the immense number of
new facts brought forward during recent years, comparatively
little real progress has been made. Since 1857, when Kekulé
first            his views concerning the internal construction
of the molecules, chemists have been mainly occupied in ap
plying his ideas to a multitude of carbon compounds.         This
work, although of the greatest importance, has led us perhaps
too much into questions of detail, and has turned away our
attention from the other great problems which were of so
much interest to our predecessors.      The chemical literature
of the past decade is replete with information concerning
                                                                                                    ";

tion, there will be a low vapour-tension; and with little attrac
tion there will be a low boiling-point.     It follows from this
that the attraction between the molecules of hydrogen is rela
tively extremely small; that in the case of oxygen and nitrogen
it is also very small, though probably much larger than in the
former case; the attraction mutually exerted by molecules of
chlorine will be more considerable; while with bromine, iodine,
and other liquid and solid elements it will be greater still. We
must not, however, confound the attraction exerted between
atoms of a substance with that between the molecules ; for
each atom attracts separately those of the contiguous mole
cule, so that the attraction between two molecules of bromine,
for example, will be four times as great as between two atoms;
and generally when the molecule of a substance contains n
atoms, the attraction between two molecules will be approxi
mately nº times that between two atoms.          This is of course
even approximately true only when the distance between the
two molecules is great relatively to their size; when the two
molecules are close together, the several interatomic attractions
will be exercised over very different distances, and will there
fore be very unequal in amount.          Nevertheless the above
remark enables us to see that in some cases the apparent
attraction, as estimated by the boiling-point, may be very
misleading.      In sulphur, for example, of which the molecule
in the solid and liquid states is probably somewhat complex,
we have a substance of high boiling-point, though the mutual
attraction of the atoms may be comparatively small. The same
is the case with carbon and many other substances.
   Applying now the above considerations to a few actual cases,
we shall see that the relative volatility of different substances
is generally satisfactorily explained. Let us designate by
(h h) the attraction at unit—distance between two atoms of
hydrogen, by (oo) the attraction between two atoms of oxygen,
and generally by (rs) the attraction at unit-distance between
any two atoms R and S. Then, in the case of water, the mole
cular attraction will be represented by
                     4A(hh)+4B(ho)     + C(oo),
where    A, B,  and C are factors dependent on the distances
which    separate  the atoms.  Now we have seen that (hh) and
(oo) probably have small values; but (ho) is not small: hence
the attraction between molecules of water should be far greater
than that between molecules of oxygen, and the boiling-point
much higher, a result which is in accord with fact. The
boiling-point of water would probably be much higher than it
is were it not that the attractions between Hand O are exerted

                       carbon more distant than the atoms                                                 of

  In applying     these arguments we must remember that the
molecules are in constant motion about their centres of gra
vity. In the case of CO, for example, the direction of the
line joining the centres of the carbon atom and one of the
oxygen atoms varies continuously; hence the molecule of
CO, as regards the action on other molecules, may be regarded
as practically in the condition of a centre of carbon surrounded
by a shell of oxygen.
    Among inorganic substances there are but few which take
the form of volatile liquids, and these are mostly isolated           in
stances ill-suited for comparisons of this kind.   It is therefore
to the homologues and isomers of organic chemistry that we
must chiefly look for a confirmation of these views.        In the
alcohols of the ethyl series, for example, the larger the mole
cules the greater must be the attraction between them, and
 consequently the higher the boiling-point; this, as is well
 known, is in accordance with fact.       In the case of isomeric
 alcohols, the influence of the position of the atoms comes con
spicuously to the fore.     It is clear that if the atoms of carbon
of two different molecules cannot approach each other so nearly
in the case of one isomer as in another, the attraction between
the molecules will be less, and the boiling-point consequently
lower. Now in secondary and tertiary alcohols the carbon
atoms are more sheltered by each other, are, as it were, more
removed from the exterior of the molecule than in primary
alcohols; at the same time the boiling-points are lower, which
is in accordance with our hypothesis.
   If  we replace two atoms of hydrogen in an alcohol by
one of oxygen, we increase the attraction of the molecules, since
we substitute a certain number of attractions (ho) and (co)
 for the relatively small attractions (h h) and (ch): the increase
 of boiling-point which we should expect is confirmed by expe
riment.

 ethyl-methyl ether, CH,-0—C, H, boils at 11°; but ethyl
alcohol, H–0—C, H, boils at 78°; in this latter substance
the oxygen is partly exposed by the substitution of H for
 CHs. Again, in ethyl butyrate, C, Hº-O—CO—CH2—C, H5,
 and in propyl propionate, C, Hº-CH2—O—CO—C, H, it is
evident that the oxygen atoms occupy in each case an equally
 central position, while the total number of atoms is the same.
We might therefore expect that the boiling-points of the two
substances would not be far apart.          Experiment shows that
the  boiling-point    of the  butyrate  is 121°,  that of the propio
nate 122°.     In the isomeric substance    butyl  acetate the oxygen
atoms are no     longer  so  central, and the  boiling-point   rises to
 124°3; while in valeric acid, in which the oxygen atoms may
be viewed as occupying an outside place in the molecule, the
boiling-point rises above 180°. As another example of the
     **.
 reduction of the total molecular attraction when the oxygen
occupies a central and sheltered position, we may take ether,
C2                 Hs, boiling at 35°. If it be true that in this case
the attractions (ho) are greatly diminished by the distance over
which they are exerted, it is clear that for O we may, without
much general effect, substitute CH2 or some other group
of atoms of similar weight: this substitution produces pentane;
and we find that this is a body having a boiling-point differing
but little from that of ether.      Many other examples might be
brought forward, were it not that their discussion would tran
scend the limits of this paper.
   The use of the above hypothesis renders it difficult, at first
sight, to account for the formation of definite chemical com
pounds.     It seems that if any number of atoms of hydrogen
are  equally  attracted by one of chlorine, the combination of
one of them with that atom would not prevent the adherence of
a second and a third forming H, Cl, HgCl, &c. This difficulty
is avoided by supposing that the chlorine atom is of such a
form that only one atom of hydrogen can approach sufficiently
closely to adhere permanently; such forms are difficult to
imagine, though it may be remarked that an atom in the form
of a ring offers in a certain sense a unique position to another
which instals itself inside it. The existence of molecular com
pounds proves that the permanent adherence of other atoms is
sometimes possible, and thus affords material support to the
notion that the chemical affinity of an atom is not only exerted
upon those atoms with which it is combined, but upon         all others
in   its
       vicinity.

be hotter than others, conduction of heat takes place; and
although the thermometric temperature of the element we are
considering may be the same as before, yet the molecules will
move more quickly in one direction than in another, and the
temperature of the element, without regard to the temperature
of the surrounding elements, will not indicate the direction in
which the molecules move fastest. The temperature at a given
point is only an average indication, and only
defines the state of the gas if the temperature is uniform.         We
should be wrong to assume that, because a certain distribution
 of velocities holds when the temperature is uniform, it must
also hold when conduction of heat is allowed to take place.
What holds in the case of conduction of heat may also hold in
 the case of radiation; and we cannot assume, without further
 proof, that the radiation of a body is independent of the tem
 perature of the surrounding bodies.            It admits, on the con
 trary,    Ibelieve, of proof that the radiation of a body into a
 cooler medium, being a phenomenon of dissipation of energy,

264                Dr. A. Schuster           on the Dynamical
tion in the enclosure is very nearly the same as that of the
flame radiating into space; and consequently a removal of the
flame into the enclosure will not materially affect the average
energy of vibration for yellow light. But the internal radia
tion for the green light being much stronger in the enclosure
of uniform temperature, the energy of vibration of the medium
within the flame will be much increased by the removal of
the flame; and this cannot take place without a corresponding
increase in the energy of vibration of the molecules them
selves.    It follows from this that the difference-in the inten
sity of the yellow and green vibration of sodium must be
much smaller in the enclosure of uniform temperature than
when the sodium-flame is allowed to radiate into space, though
the temperature in both cases may be the same.
   The following suggestion as to the genesis of radiation is
founded on the ideas of the molecular theory of gases, and
may serve to make the difference between the molecular                                  vi
brations in the case of a radiation into a colder space as dis
tinct from a radiation into an enclosure of equal temperature
a little more clear.      In a gas which is neither gaining nor
losing heat we assume a constant interchange of motion
between different molecules.
   Let us assume that the molecules we are considering are
like the sodium molecules, capable of vibrating in two distinct
periods, one corresponding to the yellow and one to the green
rays. The energy of vibration for each molecule is constantly

changing ; the translatory energy of motion             means      the             of
encounters, transformed into vibratory energy corresponding
to  one or   to the other period; and          theif,   onthe average
energy remains constant,            because
                                   it   is   just     much vibratory

energy  is  transformed into     energy    translatory
                                                  of    motion. We
may imagine that this energy            translatory motion
                                             of                  more         is
easily transformed into yellow vibrations than into green vibra
tions; but    in that case the energy       yellow vibrations must
                                                   of
also more easily        transformed into translatory motion. The
                         be
mathematical calculations of Maxwell and Boltzmann have
shown that when the final equilibrium has been reached the final
energy   of   vibration for the two periods must            the same,    be
though each encounter may more easily produce vibrations
                                                                                        is of
one period than      of the other.   This theoretical conclusion
not   altogether   confirmed       by
                                   experience;   but we may, for the
sake  of   argument,     assume     it hold  to   the imaginary case
                                                         in
which we are         present considering.
                    at                          Imagine now the gas
to  be taken out of the enclosure and allowed            radiate into
                                                                    to
space.     During the first instant the yellow and the green
vibrations will      be     the same intensity; but very soon the

                                      Theory of Radiation.                                             265
 molecular encounters will show their influence. We have
assumed that yellow vibrations are more easily produced than
green vibrations. While, therefore, the green vibrations are
allowed to decrease in intensity, the intensity of the yellow
rays is constantly renewed by the encounters. The radiation
of a body is a phenomenon of dissipation of energy; and the
relative intensity of the different radiations merely show
through what channels the energy is more quickly dissipated:
The rate at which the energy of translation is transformed
into energy of periodic motion (which has, according to
Boltzmann, nothing to do with the establishment of final equi
librium in the enclosure of uniform temperature) is the most
important quantity in determining the intensity of vibration
when a body is losing heat. The mere fact, therefore, that
we observe lines of different intensities in the spectra of bodies
is not in itself sufficient to invalidate Boltzmann's theoretical
conclusion that in an enclosure of uniform temperature the
vibrations ought to be equally strong.
    It will be seen from what precedes that have adopted a                    I
view on the origin of the different intensities of spectral lines
which is different from that usually given; but it                        far               is,   as
as
 I     can see, the only one consistent with dynamical prin
ciples. The statement that the spectrum                        body      not  of   a             is
independent        of                           surrounding             may

concerned, have been overlooked. It is therefore perhaps not
astonishing that the result is not, on this very point, in ac
cordance with experimental fact.         While molecules are in
close proximity, forces must act which depend on their vibra
tions; and the relative phase of vibrations will be an important
factor in the determination of the strength and sign of these
forces.  As the molecules approach each other they try to
place themselves in unison; that is to say, the vibrations of
those already in unison will be strengthened, while the vibra
tions of those the phases of which are in disagreement will
be weakened.     At the moment of the shock a sudden altera
tion in phase may take place ; and observations on natural
light seem to show that it does take place.          this alteration        If
takes place according to fixed laws, the forces acting between
the molecules during the second part of the shock will be
altogether different from those acting while the molecules are

  The sixteen compartments here represent the formal division
of a universe into the classes A B C D, A B C d, Ab CD, &c.
   Thus by continued dichotomy we may reach a diagram for
any number of terms.      A diagram for n terms, if n be any
even     number greater than 2, requires 2+2°4-2°4-...+ 2*
dividing lines; diagrams forn-1 terms require 2+2°,+2°,+...
27—237' such lines.
   As the number of terms increases, the labour of writing out
a quantity of letters may be considerably lessened by the use
of brackets. This will appear in the solution of the following
problem.
    The are eight arguments, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, thus
related to each other:-When E is true, F is true; and when
F is true, either E is true or B and C are both false. When
either G is true or E and F are both false, D is true.         B is                   If
false when either For G (but not both) are true, then H is true
and either C is false or D true. It is true only when an even
number of the remaining arguments are true ; it is false only
when an odd number of the remaining arguments are false.
   Supposing any combination not inconsistent with the pre
mises to exist, (1) What follows from A being true either when
B is true and D false or C false and F true? and (2) From
what combination of arguments may we conclude that A and
H are both true when E and G are both false?
   Representing truth by a capital and falsity by a small letter,
all possible combinations      the truth     falsity

arguments are indicated       the small squares      the following          in

      he shaded squares indicate the   combinations which are  A
inconsistent with one       more     the premises; the non-A

XXXIV.     On the History of the Theory of the Beats of Mistuned
  Consonances. By R. H. M. BosANQUET, Fellow of St. John's
  College, Oxford.
 To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
IN     a paper recently published in the Philosophical Maga
               I
      zine, have given an account of my recent experiments           :
on an important branch of this subject.          I
                                               wish to contribute
further to the appreciation of the bearing of my results, by
means of a critical notice of a few of the most important
points connected with the history of the subject; to which       I
propose    to add some remarks on König's recent paper
(Annalen der Physik und Chemie, 1880, p. 857).
   Passing over the early history of the subject, we come to
Smith's ‘Harmonics’ (1759), a treatise always regarded as
important, but difficult.   Smith was mainly concerned with
the reduction of the phenomena to rule, for the purpose of his
studies of musical temperament.       His fundamental principles
do not   really reach  beyond  the numerical or geometrical ap
pearances or patterns which arise from the superposition of
certain sequences of forms at regular intervals. Causal expla
nation, reference to laws of sensation, analysis of the functions
of the ear, were not attempted by Smith. But his work is of
great importance. Is is still much appreciated as the first
and, in one sense, almost the most powerful exposition of prin
ciples still largely held, which are entirely incompatible with
the point of view originated by Helmholtz, or         its
                                                   developments.

           are enveloped, they are not difficult         in

            Theory       of the     Beats    of Mistuned Consonances.                    271
    Smith's ‘Harmonics,” prop. x. p. 81, 2nd edit.
   We will call a note having 100 vibrations in a certain time
a  “unison;”    and a note having 101 vibrations in the same
time will be said to make with the first an “imperfect unison.”
Then the time in question, in which the notes make respec
tively 100 and 101 vibrations, is what Smith calls a “simple
cycle,” or “the period of the imperfect unisons.”
   Consider notes making 2 and 3 vibrations respectively in
the time of 6 of the first note, or “unison.” Then the time
in which these notes make 2, 3, and 6 vibrations respectively
is what Smith calls the “short cycle” of the consonance.
   Suppose the consonance to be mistuned, so that 2 vibrations
of the one note = 6 of the unison (100), but three of the other
= 6 of the imperfect unison (101), then the 2 of the one note
still very nearly = 3 of the other, and each of these periods
or short cycles is still nearly 6 vibrations both of the unison
and the imperfect unison. Then Smith says:– , ,
   “Take away the greatest equal numbers of short cycles
(of 6) that can be taken from both ends of the simple cycle,
or period of the imperfect unisons.”
   (Take away two sets of 8 short cycles of 6 from 100 and
101 respectively.)
   “Then some part of another short cycle or two, as consist
ing of unequal numbers of the quicker and slower vibrations
of the imperfect unisons, will always remain in the middle of
the cycle or period.”
   (100–2 x 8 × 6=4. 101–2.8.6=5.                 So that 4 and 5
vibrations respectively are the parts of the short cycles that
remain over.)
   “And this part, by interrupting the succession of the short
cycles” (of 6) “wherein the harmony of the consonance con
sists, interrupts         its
                        harmony, and causes the noise which                               is
calleda   beat; especially        the interruption
                                       as                 made where      is

                                        to     the period.”

ance,  the modern student cannot afford to dispense with
Smith’s most powerful exposition. But it does not account
for our modern conception of beats, regarded as variations in
the intensity of certain notes.   We have still to find out in
what way such variations of intensity arise out of the system
of recurrences Smith describes.
   With respect to the supposed difficulty of Smith's proposi
tions,     I
         am confident that any one who has mastered the above
example will find the difficulties gone, in     that part  the               all                     of

 he  quotes, did not understand Smith.               The passage       Young                   of

     Young's theory will now bear strict criticism, there can

not   surpassed        at

                                          a                  now seen           is                   to   be
objectionable, when                     he
                                says that the beats become the Tartini

the notes arise out          the beats.      One might almost say that
it    is mere question
           a                     language; but

                                               of

    Of the other writers who occupy similar position we need  a
only mention De Morgan, from whose analysis many have

                 Theory of              the Beats      of Mistuned Consonances.                              273
formed their idea of Smith's work.     From our present point
of view we admire his painstaking appreciation of Smith,
while we think he overestimates the value of Smith's analysis
of beats. He does not seem to see that it amounted only to a
numerical or geometrical analysis, and left the reader a long
way off even the idea of the existence of a deeper-seated expla
nation. The obstaele opposed to Smith's explanation by the
resolution in the ear of the resultant or complex forms into
their elements according to Ohm's law, escaped De Morgan
entirely.
   De Morgan is behind Young in thinking that Tartini (com
bination) tones only exist in the case of consonances; this
vitiates fundamentally      his notions         all
                                           the phenomena, and              of

    The account of the unison-beat is in most respects that

on  Young's theory, Pole fails to notice the real nature of the
discovery of Helmholtz, which is that the two notes are sepa
rately received by the ear; so that the disappearance of the
beats is to be regarded as arising, in great measure at least,
from the removal of the two disturbances from each other's
influence, and not entirely or even principally from their
rapidity.              I
                have dealt with this point in my recent paper
(Phil.   Mag.  June 1881, p. 422).
    Pole's second kind of beat is Smith's beat (variation of
maximum displacement in resultant forms). It is assumed
that the theory of Smith constitutes a complete explanation of
the existence of certain beats in mistuned consonances, as to
the nature of which nothing further is said.            Smith's investi

The question which suggests itself continually          reading                                in
König's paper     “What did is,                     all
                                   these beats consist of?”—a
question which    have endeavoured
                            I            answer      my recent    to                      in
paper, and hope    answer more
                             to  fully    some future occasion.    on

 König only answers this           question, once, where he says that,
 in beats of     the mistuned     octave,   the octave and fundamental
 appear alternately.          I  regard this as a proof that König's
 notes were not free from octave. As to this see further Helm
 holtz, Tonempfindung,         4th ed. pp. 263,264; also Preyer, Akus
 tische Untersuchungen (Jena, 1879), p. 15.
    On account of the importance of König's paper,                      I   have
prepared the following list of the rather numerous errata in
the copy in the Philosophical Magazine, as also of those in the
copy in Poggendorff.             It is not possible to read the copy in
the Philosophical Magazine with entire comprehension unless
the errata have been first eliminated.

by difference- and summation-notes, since the frequencies do
not correspond".
  The audibility of beats is regarded as depending solely on
their number, and on the intensity of the primaries, and as
being independent of the magnitude of the interval.    (This is
certainly not true; Helmholtz, Tonemp. 4th ed. p. 286.)
   In several other respects beats are identified with primary
impulses of the same frequency.
  According to my results, we should correct these statements
by saying that beat-notes are developed from beats by the
transformation of a small definite portion of the energy of the
º:     into the beat-notes, in the transmitting mechanism of
the ear.
  We now         come to a paper                 interest, “On
                                                  of considerable
Beats of Imperfect Harmonies,” by Sir W. Thomson (Proc.
Roy. Soc. Edinb. 1877–78, p. 602.) The facts stated in this
paper are in accordance with the details of König's experi
ments.   The phase-differences corresponding with the different
portions of the beat are exhibited by figures of harmonic
curves. The correspondence of the number of beats with that
deducible from the forms of the curves is demonstrated expe
rimentally; and the existence of beats is demonstrated in the
case of the simpler binary harmonies, when mistuned.
   The following is an example of the nature of the description
of the sounds heard:—“a revolving charactert which          per                    I
ceive in the beat seems distinct enough to prove that the
ear does distinguish between these configurations.” . . . .   It
will be seen that the author has here to some extent proposed
to himself the question—What are the sounds of which the
beats consist?   But if my work is right, he has not attained
the complete answer to                  it.

 the matter on the footing developed in my recent paper.

not only possible, but certain that it must be so. When we
speak of pendulum-vibrations we are apt to forget our history,
and to think of the circular pendulum as if it really executed
perfect harmonic motions. But this is only true of the ideal
cycloidal pendulum, which never has been realized, and is
never likely to be. And the difference between the two is not
negligible: we need only think of the correction for arc
which the periodic time requires in pendulum-observations of
accuracy, to see that higher harmonic terms must enter into
the motion; and in all cases in which the fundamental vibra
tion is not very small indeed, these higher terms will certainly
not be negligible.
   With any other experimenter than König should be dis            I
posed to point to a number of influences which lead to trans
formation.     One may possibly have escaped him : it is neces
sary for his purposes to be sure that the bending of the spring
calls into action a force strictly proportional to the displace
ment.    For large displacements it is improbable that this con
dition is satisfied.  Further, any unsteadiness in the stand of
the instrument leads to transformations of very considerable
  *
extent; but this is not likely to have misled König.
      remaining investigations will now be more easily dealt
with.
º
   On pages 860 & 861 the argument rests on the idea that the
harmonic in the source of excitation must be developed to the
same actual magnitude as the excited harmonic vibration,
but this is not at            all
                          the case. According        both theory and

the case          on

I       do
         not say that this       the sole explanation

              is                      the question

    in 1876.           If
                  the threads are not so arranged that the pull on
    the excited vibrator is strictly proportional to the displacement
    of the exciter, it is quite certain, both from theory and expe
    riment, that transformation must take place.         My apparatus
    consisted of a number of    pendulums   arranged   as harmonics to
    a large and heavy metronome.         The connexions were made
    with elastic threads.    When the connexions were so made as
    to satisfy the above requirement as nearly as possible,                    could                              I
    reduce the excitation of the harmonic pendulums to a very
    small amount;            I
                             never succeeded in entirely stopping                But                          it.

No         experimental method is in more general use than is
          that of Wheatstone's bridge for the comparison of elec
trical resistances.       It appears, however, that erroneous ideas
are    prevalent    among     practical electricians, and have found
their   way   into works on electrical testing, as to the proper
resistances to be used in the different branches of the Bridge
in order that the most sensitive arrangement may be obtained
in any particular case. The following investigation, together
with some graphical illustrations of the effect of using different
resistances, was originally prepared for the use of my students;
but the fact just referred to has led me to believe that it may
be found generally useful by those engaged in electrical work.

of a particular resistance,                      all

and   then the subsequent adjustment of c is easy after a first
rough test for R.
   The effect of using the resistances given by this rule is very
striking, and is illustrated by means of the subjoined curves.
   The first, second, and third sets of curves (Plates IV. & W.)
show the effect of using a value of a differing more and more
from Vfy, the value of c being in each case determined so as to
give the best effect for that particular value of a. An examina
tion of the curves will show that, for any particular battery and
galvanometer, the resistance which is best measured is that
which is equal either to the resistance of the galvanometer or the
battery, the arrangement being equally sensitive for both. Care
must be taken, however, not to confound this with the best ar
rangement for measuring the resistance here referred to; for it
does not follow that no better arrangement can be made for the
measurement of a resistance because it is the one which gives
the best result in a particular arrangement.       For instance, if
we have a battery-resistance 100 and galvanometer 10, we find
the greatest sensibility will be obtained when R=10 or 100;
but, as we shall see below, if the battery be rearranged so that
f shall also be 10, a still greater degree of sensibility will be
obtained for the measurement of the resistance 10.
   The fourth set of curves (Pl.VI.) illustrates the effect of
ing the ratio of a to c from that which gives the best effect. In
these curves, then, a is supposed constant, while c varies—the
                                                                       *.

proportional to a and the ordinates to                 .     It   must be   ob
served,   however, that in the third set the ordinates are ten
times greater than they would be if plotted to the same scale
as the first and second sets.  Curves II. and              III.

  The second case investigated is that in which the galvano
meter-resistance is also supposed to vary, the battery-resistance
being supposed      onstant, in this case. This assumption is
made with    regard  to     the
                           battery, because           for

   In this case the number of turns of wire in the coil of the
galvanometer has a considerable influence on the result, and
hence comparison between the sensibility in one case and
that in another when the galvanometer has been changed is
difficult.        I

liquefaction with decrease of temperature, which in many in
stances is very marked; and sometimes there is also a decided
change in colour.
   A transparent homogeneous liquid is sometimes, though
rarely, obtained; but generally the liquid holds in suspension
an insoluble compound or an undissolved salt either in the
hydrous or anhydrous state; and sometimes the consistency is
that of a stiff paste.
   History.—It has long been known that freezing-mixtures
may be made by mixing some salt with ice or snow; and in
1875–6 Guthrief determined the lowest attainable temperature
of quite a large number of such mixtures. He found that
the lowest temperature obtained with any given salt was the
same whatever
      limits,
                   its
                     initial temperature; also

Subsequently" he mixed nitrate of iron with Glauber's salt,
and             a reduction of 32°F.
    Berthelot, in his recent work on Thermo-Chemistry, devotes
a brief space to the subject; and the Comptes Rendus, vol.xc.
pp. 1163, 1282, contains a communication from Ditte calling
attention to this wonderful phenomenon.             He considers the
use of concentrated acids with      hydrated    salts, also mixtures
composed solely of salts.     An example is given of ammonium
nitrate and hydrated sodium sulphate mixed together in a
mortar, the loss of heat being about 20° C.
    Liquefaction of Salts.-As far as we know, when any salt
soluble in water is mixed with ice, liquefaction is sure to fol
 low, and the minimum temperature is below 0°C.             But when
 salts only are taken, the case is different.
    In some instances liquefaction is very evident, in others
there is none at all, and in still others it is doubtful; while the
 loss of heat is sometimes great, sometimes very slight, accord
 ing to the amount of liquefaction. Whether moistening will
 take place or not must be decided in nearly every case by
 actual trial; and in the preliminary experiments made wit
 reference to this point,           I
                            have mixed the substances in a wedg
 wood mortar.
     From a large number of trials, the following conclusions
have been      drawn:—
   1. As a rule, it is necessary to liquefaction that one of the
solid substances used should be hydrated.
   2. It is not necessary that each solid should be a salt.
Moistening sometimes follows the mixing of a salt with an
acid, a salt with a base, or a base with an acid.
   Ec.—Calcium chloride (CaCl2.6 H2O) with tartaric acid
          (C, H, O,).

              Potassium hydrate (KOH)                      with tartaricacid   (C.H.O.).
  3. As, in the case of liquids, metathesis will take place if a
compound insoluble in the menstruum can be formed, so with
solids, if such a compound can result, metathesis is probable
with liquefaction.

 292         Miss E. M. Walton on Liquefaction and Cold
 for it is sometimes observed that liquefaction seems equally
 marked, whether the two original salts are mixed or the two
 bodies formed by their interchange.
     6. The rule among liquids in regard to weak and strong
 acids and bases seems to prevail with solids also, their action
 tending to promote or impede liquefaction.
    7. When, by the admixture of two salts, oxidation or reduc
 tion can take place, there is again probability of liquefaction.

    In   the last no change by reduction is possible.
    A    new  Substance.—A notable exception to the rule men
tioned above (that one salt at least should be hydrated), is that
 of AgNO, mixed with HgCl2. When these are rubbed together
 there is decided moistening, which would seem to prove that
there is such a body as anhydrous nitrate of mercury liquid at
ordinary temperatures.         On adding water a large residue of
 silver chloride is observed.
    Evidences of Chemical Change.—When salts capable of meta
thesis are mixed, in addition to liquefaction, change of colour,
formation of an insoluble compound, and escape of a gas are
proofs of chemical reaction.
    An important difference sometimes noticed between mix
tures of salts in the solid and the liquid form is the escape, in
the former case, of some gas, as C, H, O, CO, HCl, or §H.
The gas is dissolved by a liquid solution and eludes observation.
    Classification.—Cases of liquefaction may be divided into
two classes—the first including those in which there is mutual
exchange of base or acid, the second those in which there is
no interchange.
    The mixture of lead nitrate with sodium carbonate is an
example of the first class.       There is metathesis, and we obtain
lead    carbonate,    sodium   nitrate,  and ten equivalents of free
water.

    At the more or less low temperature due to liquefaction,
there is naturally a tendency for salts to crystallize out from
the saturated solution.
    The crystalline character is sometimes perceptible to the
senses; for the product often contains grains much coarser
than did the finely-powdered salts first taken.
                                                                                    º
    Effect of Temperature.—Experiments show that sometimes
 liquefaction takes place readily at a temperature somewhat
                               all
 elevated, but not at          at  low temperature.

 used, care being taken that the heat should not             great      be
to   cause either    of the  original  salts      melt  to  their waterin                     of
crystallization.
     When two salts capable           metathesis are mixed, chemical
                                        of
 action apparently begins immediately                every point

    That the cold produced when ice and a salt are mixed is due
to rapid liquefaction of the ice is plain enough; but              I  have
seen no attempt made to explain the cause of the liquefaction,
until Ordway last year announced his theory of the “diffusion
                                               º,
of solids' in an address * before the American Association
                          j
for the Advancement of Science.
    We know that the molecules of a body are in a state of
constant oscillation, and that if a salt                  be placed in
contact with pure water, diffusion takes place until the mole
cules of salt are equally distributed throughout the mass.
     So, too, when the solid is placed in water, solution follows,
or, in other words, diffusion. Now, when a salt and water,
both in the solid form, are in contact, there is probably the
same tendency to interpenetration.           But a mixture of water
and salt molecules cannot remain in the solid form except at
a low temperature, and the rigidity of the solid state is over
come, because oscillations of the water and the salt molecules
cooperate to produce a greater motion.
        raham found that although sodium chloride is not at all
deliquescent, yet the                 solution has a great affinity for
 water. Therefore when the smallest quantity of the salt is
 once in solution the first step is taken, and the melting of the
 ice continues rapidly.       If this is the true explanation of the
 action of sodium chloride on ice, the problem is solved.
     When salts capable of metathesis are used, this physical
 phenomenon is complicated by chemical reaction.                Liquefac
 tion probably results when CaCl, .6 H2O and Ca(NO3), .4H2O
 are mixed, and in similar cases, because the crystallizing-point
 of these two bodies together is lower than for each alone—just
 as the freezing-point of salt water is lower than that of fresh
 water, and as the fusing-point of an alloy is sometimes below
 that of either of its constituents.
      Calorimeter.—For further experiments in which the reduc
  tion of temperature might be measured with some degree of
 accuracy, it was desirable to secure a closed space in which
 radiation and convection should be reduced to a minimum,
 and the heat of the surroundings should be constant.              A calo
 rimeter was therefore constructed somewhat like that used by
  Berthelot in some of his investigations.
      It consists of a covered circular tank of fourteen-ounce
  tinned copper, of about twelve gallons capacity, placed in a
  much larger wooden case, the space between the walls of the
  tank and case being filled with loose cotton.
      The upper surface of the tank has four wells, each to re
  ceive a cylindrical vessel of polished german silver resting on

    Lowest attainable Temperature.—In addition to Guthrie's
discoveries already mentioned, he found that when two salts
were used with ice the minimum temperature was unlike that
of either alone, each exercising an influence over the other.
    Most of my experiments with the calorimeter were made
for the purpose of discovering whether or not the lowest at
tainable temperature of a given salt when mixed with ice is
the same if that salt is produced in a freezing-mixture of two
salts, also if it is independent of the initial temperature and

the results were not so free from modifying influences as             I
had anticipated, basic carbonates being formed not wholly

    The interesting fact was thus revealed that ferric carbonate
or basic carbonate exists in the liquid form at a low tempera
ture, say -20°C. The colour is a deep red ; and, as the mix
ture gradually warms, CO, is rapidly given off, causing the

    With    the nitrates of magnesium and calcium the tendency
 to metathesis is so slight that the liquefaction is not rapid
 enough to produce any great degree of cold; and with an             ini
 tial temperature of -2° there is no liquefaction whatever.
    The time allotted for the completion of my graduation
 thesis, of which this paper gives the substance, rendered it
 necessary to suspend for the present the continuation of these
 experiments.            is work was undertaken at the suggestion
 of Professor Ordway, to whom the subject has been one of
 interest for some years, but whom the pressure of other duties
 has prevented       from pursuing an investigation.           He has,
                                         ..
 however, given considerable thought to the matter, one of
 the results of which is his theory of the “diffusion of solids.”
 His predictions that, there may be liquefaction without
 chemical reaction, and that the product obtained from the
 mixture of salts is sometimes                 were both confirmed
 by the results of my work. . He devised the calorimeter
                               I
 which was used; and am indebted to him also for valuable
 suggestions and advice.

analyzers, but with molecular solutions of the sulphates of

silver most of all.
   This method affords a simple means of demonstrating differ
ences of chemical affinity; but whether it is capable of giving
more than approximative measurements will require further
investigation to determine. In some cases secondary actions
are, of course, set up, so that the intermedial space would repro
sent the initial electromotive force + or — any interfering
electromotive forces.

 rately than if the cell had been applied directly to the absolute
 electrometer, in absolute electrostatic units a difference of
 potential equal, or nearly equal, to the E.M.F. of a Daniell’s cell,
 by a quadrant-electrometer. Thus the quadrant-electrometer,
 a much more convenient instrument than the absolute electro
 meter for rapid experimenting, and for the purpose to which it
 was to be applied, could be used in the remainder of the inves
 tigation, which, as appears clearly from Mr. Shida’s paper,
 supplemented by his note in the June number, consisted in
 the measurement, both electrostatically and electromagneti
 cally, of one and the same electromotive force.
    For the electromagnetic measurement, the cell was placed
 in circuit with a resistance-coil and a tangent-galvanometer,
 and the current measured as described by Mr. Shida.           But Mr.
 Shida has since stated that, while the current was thus flowing
 through the gavanometer, he measured the difference of poten
 tials at the two ends of the external resistance by the quad
 rant-electrometer, and calculated from this, by a simple appli
 cation of Ohm's law, the E.M.F. of the cell while generating
 a current. There could therefore be no question here of pola
 rization-error; for the method is plainly equivalent to deter
mining simultaneously, in both kinds of units, the difference
of potentials between the two ends of the external resistance.
These measurements, Mr. Shida has told me, he has since care
fully repeated with different resistances in circuit, obtainin
results which one and                 all
                                differed only very slightly from the
E.M.F.         of
               the cell with                its
                                   poles insulated.    Hence, even

the assumption deprecated by Dr. Wright had been made,

  “and the mean value of
                                 “R tan a = 104.73.”
  It  is plain therefore that Mr. Shida, in copying down from
 his notebook specimens of his numbers, inadvertently wrote
 45° 15' in the first column of the table for the calculation of
 It tan a, and in the second column gave 80 and 100 instead
 of 75 and 80 respectively.             The table ought accordingly to
 stand:—

 which gives Mr. Shida's average value of R tana, viz. 104.73.
     I  do not think that Dr. Wright's letter calls for further
 remark from me, except that, whatever may be the influence
of these “peculiar numerical aberrations" on the minds of
readers of Mr. Shida’s paper, we may take it for granted that
they had had no effect in leading Dr. Wright to believe that
“oversights had been made in other portions of the research,”
or that precautions not mentioned “were probably omitted;”
for if these aberrations had been observed by Dr. Wright
before he wrote his note in the July number of the Philoso
phical Magazine, he would probably not have forgotten them
when pointing out the trifling slip in misplacing the decimal
point in the statement of the electrostatic values of the cell
and battery.

       EXPLANATION OF AN ANOMALY IN DOUBLE CIRCULAR
                REFRACTION.       B.Y. M. CROU'LLEBOIS.
THE      two inverse circular rays have a separate existence outside
      the quartz; to be convinced of this it is sufficent to repeat
the following experiment:-Taking a biquartz of 60 millim. thick
ness, we pass interfering pencils, polarized or natural, through
each half; we then receive these pencils, superposed, upon the
horizontal slit of a direct-vision spectroscope.    Under these con
ditions we observe two distinct systems of curved longitudinal
fringes presenting the characters of inverse circular polarization.
If we explore the common field directly with the lens, we get two
lateral groups of vertical fringes, resulting from the interference
of rays of the same gyration unequally retarded in the biquartz.
   For a long time it was possible to believe that the distance,
estimated in fringes, of the two central bands gave the measure of
the circular birefringence for the middle rays of the spectrum.      It
is far from being so; the observed is always greater than the theoretic
displacement.    For example, with a quartz of 42 millim. M. Billet”
ascertained that this distance amounts to 24 fringes and is more
than double the theoretic value, which would be 10-5. . My pre
sent purpose is to explain this disagreement between theory and
observation.    Even in white light, with the lens only, the position
of the central fringe is often doubtful; with the spectroscope,
employed as stated above, there is no longer any uncertainty. The
central fringe is always delimited by the two black lines equally
inclined in both directions from the vertical. Having made this
remark, let us return to the experiment, and suppose that the
observer has the group of circular fringes to the left; the central
band answering to the different colours will be thrown back un
equally.   The displacement will be given by the formula
                              f=K.e(n"—n'),
and will be proportional to the numbers 58,62, 70, 80, 87, and
100 respectively for the lines B, C, D, E, F, G. Thus the central
fringe of the violet is much more displaced than that of the red,
and the black line (place of those central fringes) is strongly                  in
clined upon the vertical. To the right of this singular line BG the
attendant bands become more and more oblique; to the left, on
the contrary, they reerect themselves; and as the distance between
two successive bands is greater in the red than in the violet, on
advancing towards the left we shall find two black lines inclined
symmetrically: it is there that the central fringe        of the disIK
placed system must be formed. But how many fringes must we
go forward to meet with that central fringe? Let us observe, 1st,

that we must have IB=KB, B, being the projection of the point
B upon the horizontal KG ; 2ndly, that there are as many fringes
of the rays G as of the rays B, from the curve BG to the vertical
IK. Consequently we have the evident relation
                         42(fo-fa)+m}\g-mAh,
whence
                                m=6-81.
    Accordingly, besides the theoretic displacement, we must advance
 6'81, which gives 12:06 fringes, and consequently, in conformity
 with the experiment, 24 fringes for the displacement of the two
 groups.
    With my biquartz of 60 millim.        I
                                          have met with the same ex
 aggeration.   The thickness capable of producing the retardation of
 one wave-length upon the middle ray of the spectrum is usually
 estimated at 8 millim.; the distance of the centres of the two
lateral systems ought therefore to be 15 fringes.    Now it is found
that this distance reaches the figure 34; and this exaggeration of
the displacement is explained as above.
    According to the formula we have
                                m=9:7,
which number added to 7.5 gives 17.2, and consequently (very
approximately) 34 fringes for the total displacement.
   It results from the above that the abnormal displacement of the
two lateral groups receives a natural explanation, and that it cannot
be taken advantage of as an argument against Arago's hypothesis.

           ON   THE LIGHT OF COMETS.            BY M. RESPIGHI.
   The appearance of the fine comets b and c 1881 has presented
to astronomers the opportunity of making new researches upon
the light of those stars; and the results obtained by spectroscopy
and photography have appeared to confirm the idea that their light
is due in part to reflection of that of the sun, and in part to a
light which is the cometary matter's own.
   There is no doubt as to the first part of this conclusion, since to
the proofs already acquired Mr. Huggins has succeeded in adding
the photograph of Fraunhofer's lines in the spectrum of comet b
1881; but on the second point—that is to say, on the question of
knowing whether the comet emits a light of           its
                                                    own, due       to
                                                                  real a
incandescence,   I think there       is   no
                                          ground   yet for giving          an
affirmative decision. Indeed     seems
                                it           me that the discontinuity
                                               to
of   its
      spectrum,     as

                           the   bright  lines      bands, may proceed
                                                    or
from the same   cause, namely  reflected   light,    regard
                                                    if            be

the modifications which that light  must have     undergone    passing
                                                                  in

 through the gases and vapours which constitute the entire mass of
a comet.
    It is certain that the greater portion of the light transmitted by
comets comes from the interior of their mass, and that it has
traversed deep strata of gas or vapours; it must have undergone
 there the elective absorption proper to those vapours and to the
 compounds which result from them. It is therefore natural that
dark lines or bands should be produced, different from Fraunhofer's
 lines, which are peculiar to the light of the sun. Thus, besides
the faint but complete spectrum of that light, produced by re
 flection from the external parts where the absorption is insensible,
another spectrum must be produced, coming from the deeper parts
and greatly modified by more powerful absorption.
    The limits of a mere Note do not permit me to enter into the
details of my numerous spectroscopic observations of the comet
b 1881; but     I can affirm that they appear to confirm this view;
that is to say, the phenomena do not seem to require the inter
vention of a light due to the incandescence of the cometary matter.
Hence it would follow that the discontinuity of this spectrum
comes from the same cause which gives rise to wide dark bands in
the spectrum of the sun when he is near the horizon, or in the
spectra of the atmospheres of the planets, with the sole difference
that in the comets the phenomenon is exaggerated in consequence
of the enormous thickness of the absorbing strata, their richness
in chemical compounds, and the faintness of the light which they
reflect toward us. It would therefore be necessary, for the spectral
analysis of the comets, to proceed as we do for that of those atmo
spheres—that is to say, to fix our attention not so much upon
the bright bands as upon those which owe their darkness to
absorption.—Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences, 5th Sep

             ON  THE MAGNETIC METALS.        BY M. GAIFFE.
    With the view of seeking out the best conditions for the pre
paration of magnets of cobalt and nickel, of which          I  have the
honour to submit some specimens to the Academy,           I tried those
metals in different states.
    The samples which were used for the trials were obtained by
means of the electrochemical processes communicated to the
Academy by Mr. Adams and me on January 7, 1870, and July 15,
1878, by employing currents of suitable intensity for rendering
the metals very hard.
    After dividing the samples into bars of nearly equal dimensions,
I   left some bars of each metal in the hard state; others were
 annealed; and others were annealed and forged. All were after
wards magnetized in the same manner, and the magnetism
 measured directly with the magnetometer. After thirty-six and
                                                                   -
seventy-two hours of rest, it was measured again.

   Although only taken very approximately, these measurements
(recorded in the annexed Table) will nevertheless, I hope, suffice
to show what relatively great coercive force these metals, especially
cobalt, can acquire in a state of purity, when it is known that pure
iron, obtained by the same means, gave under the same circum
stances only inappreciable deflections.
   For completeness       I add that some examples of cobalt which took
only a weak magnetization two years since, when I made these
experiments, became strongly magnetized now, without having
been annealed, and having lost nothing of their original hardness.
   It would a priori seem that the feeble coercive force of these
metals when they issue from the galvanoplastic baths is due to
the presence of hydrogen in combination with them, and that as
soon as it has disappeared, either by the action of heat or by
spontaneous liberation, nickel and cobalt resume their real coercive
force. In that case the action of hydrogen would be analogous to
that of the metals which are combined with nickel to constitute
argentan : it would paralyze their magnetic power.

310       M. H. Becquerel's Experimental Inrestigations
ratus was constructed sufficiently powerful to demonstrate the
feeble rotations which the hypothetical calculations had led
me to expect.
   The results of the preliminary observations were published
at the end of March 1879. The numbers obtained at that
time were the first that had been given on the measurement
 of these phenomena, or which had established the relative
magnitude of the magnetic rotatory powers in liquid and solid
bodies and those in a gaseous condition.
    Since that time, Bichat and Kundt and Röntgen have pub
lished various communications relative to the magnetic rota
tory power of certain bodies in a gaseous state.
   About the same time Lippich obtained a magnetic rotation
of several seconds of arc with a column of 0:50 metre of air
subjected to a strong magnetic action.      Bichat more particu
larly confined himself to the determination of the relation
between the magnetic rotatory power of carbon disulphide at
various temperatures in the liquid and gaseous condition.
His results agree with my own.
   Kundt    ...i Röntgen have studied the magnetic rotatory
power of certain gases from a point of view quite different
from mine. They compressed the gases to 250 atmospheres,
while   I more particularly studied them under the ordinary
temperature and pressure.    The German authors have obtained
under considerable pressure magnetic rotations of several
degrees; but the imperfection of their apparatus did not allow
them to take advantage of the extent of the rotations in order
to obtain very accurate measurements.        They limited them
selves to  publishing numbers relative to five gases—hydrogen,
oxygen, air, oxide of carbon, and marsh-gas; and they were
unable to discover any relation between the index of refraction
of the gases and the observed rotations.
   In the present memoir I attempt to show that the existence
of a relation between the index of refraction of bodies and
their magnetic rotatory power in a solid, liquid, and gaseous
state cannot be called in question.     I would further record
the fact that I have demonstrated the existence of a perturba
tion in the phenomena of atmospheric polarization, due, appa
rently, to a slight rotation of the plane of polarization of the
luminous rays passing through the atmosphere, under the      in
fluence of terrestrial magnetism.

ferent gases has been invariably taken. My wish to operate
at the ordinary temperature and pressure very greatly com
plicated the apparatus, which would have been extremely
simple if the               had been made only under very strong
pressure; and    I  have been obliged to have recourse, therefore,
to means of amplification which         I  shall describe more closely
hereafter.    The    apparatus     employed      is composed of two
distinct  parts:—first,    the  electromagnetic       apparatus; and,
secondly, the optical system, the arrangement of which is of
the most delicate character.
                   1. Electromagnetic     Apparatus.
    The apparatus is composed of a copper tube, 0.122 metre in
external diameter and 3.27 metres long, closed by parallel mir
rors, and around which are six large electromagnetic bobbins.
The whole of this arrangement is mounted horizontally on a
wooden bench formed of a large beam 3.82 metres long. This
serves also to sustain the optical system (see Plate VIII. fig. 1).
The tube is held by special supports in the middle of the bob
bins so as not to touch them.             Each of these is 0.48 metre
long, 0.13 metre internal diameter, and contains 15 kilogr.
of copper wire 0.03 millim. in diameter, thoroughly insulated
and rolled upon a copper tube which forms the body of the
bobbin. The total weight of the copper wire employed was
about 90 kilogr., which corresponds to 1380 metres in length
for the six bobbins.
    They are associated in series, so as to form a single solenoid
round the tube which contains the gas.
    Into these bobbins was passed the electric current produced
by 80 elements (nitric acid) of large size. The battery was
 formed of two groups of 40 elements arranged in series, which
were united together in multiple arc.
    Under the influence of an electric current so intense, the
 conductors and the tube itself soon become considerably
 heated, and the temperature rises to 30° or 40°C.             It is ne
 cessary, on the one hand, to allow for this elevated tempera
 ture, and, on the other, to guard against the variations in
intensity of the electric current. These variations are slow
and regular, and are due to the progressive weakening of the
acids of the couples, and to the heating of the conductors by
the passage of the electric current.            In order to allow for
them, it is sufficient to measure at convenient intervals of
 time the intensity of the electric current and to trace the
 curve of the intensities.     For this purpose there was arranged,
 in connexion wth the     circuit,  a sine-compass, which measured
 at every moment the                    the current in the apparatus,
                         intºof  2B 2

312     M. H. Becquerel's Experimental Investigations
and which thus allowed the observed      results to be reduced to
what they would have been if the electromagnetic intensity
had been perfectly constant.    A mercurial commutator con
veniently placed within reach of the observer, allowed the
direction of the electric current in the bobbins to be reversed
 at pleasure, and the bodies studied to be subjected to inverse
 electromagnetic action.
    The tube which contains the gases was originally 3 metres
 long.    It was constructed to maintain a vacuum and to sup
 port the pressure of several atmospheres; for this purpose it
 was terminated by very thick pieces of copper, which were
 screened and soldered, and in which was drilled a rectangular
 opening of 0.10 metre by 0.04 metre.
    These pieces presented a plane surface perpendicular to the
 axis of the tube, and on which were fixed by means of screws
 flat glasses enclosed in a frame of copper.     The tube was pro
 vided with taps and a manometer; and the whole was so
 arranged as to slip inside the bobbins.
    Various inconveniences, and amongst others a slight acci
 dent, which caused the simultaneous rupture of the two glasses,
 led to the following modification of the apparatus.
    On the two plane surfaces which form the end of the 3-metre
 tube (Pl. VII. fig. 1) are screwed and cemented cylindrical cop
 per tips 0-135 metre long, furnished at their ends internally with
 a thread for a screw. The tube can be closed by two large copper
 stoppers, which are screwed into the pieces just described, and
 in which are cemented two flat glasses of about 0.005 metre
                         wi.
 thickness, leaving for the light a rectangular opening of 0-09
 metre by 0.06 metre.
             hermetically
                                    of greased leather enable the
 tube to be                 closed.  On each side of these pieces
are arranged taps, which answer the purpose of either intro
ducing the gas or putting the tube into communication with
a manometer.       Before entering the apparatus, the gases are
passed through tubes containing substances necessary to
purify and dry them.
    The tube extends beyond the bobbins by about 0.135 metre
on each side, so that the glasses are subjected to only a very
feeble magnetic influence : we shall see afterwards how this
influence must be taken into account.
   The distance between the internal surfaces of the glasses is
3.27 metres; the volume occupied by the gas submitted to the
experiment is about 37 litres. When the tube was hermeti
cally closed it acted as a gas-thermometer, and the indication
of the internal pressure allowed the average temperature of
the gaseous mass to be deduced from     it.The axis    of
                                                       the tube
made  an  angle of  about 52° with the magnetic meridian. The

   Under the conditions of magnetic intensity just described,
the rotation of the plane of polarization of a luminous ray
passing through the tube filled with gas is very feeble. With
the various gases studied, the double rotation obtained by
reversing the direction of the electric current in the bobbins
did not exceed an angle of                      5'.
                                      On this account         became                    it

width.     e prism was cut in half lengthwise, and the two
halves brought together so that their principal planes made an
angle of about 5°. The field of this prism was a circle of
about 0.022 metre in diameter.     Such a large opening was
considered to be  necessary—first   of        allow    sufficient       all   to             a

316       M. H. Becquerel's Experimental Investigations
great nicety; and we thus see that the two mirrors present a
series of images which are reflected without any deformation.
Including the direct image from the polariscope, they corre
spond to columns of air represented by one, three, five, seven,
nine times the distance of the mirrors.         A tolerably large
number of reflected images can be obtained ; but, in order to
preserve a sufficient luminous intensity, distinctness, and an
apparent diameter of the image suitable for the polariscope,
I  have been obliged to stop at the fourth reflected image,
which corresponds to nine passages of the luminous ray
through the bobbins.        With the magnifying-power just
indicated, this fourth image is as clear as the direct image of
ordinary polarimeters or saccharimeters.
    Suppose, now, that the electric current is caused to pass in
one direction : one of the images, the fourth for instance,
must be reduced to uniformity of tint, as in ordinary polari
meters; then, if the electric current is reversed, one half of this
image will be seen darker than the other.       If the analyzer is
then turned so as    again  to obtain   uniformity   of tint in the
two halves of the image, the angle by which it has been
turned will measure twice the magnetic rotation sought.
    The method supposes, in theory, that the light studied is
monochromatic ; but in the experiment itself, as the rotations
are very small, it is not necessary that the incident rays should
have the same wave-length.       However, we shall return later
to this important question.
    Under the most favourable conditions the rotations could
be measured to nearly 30".
    Glasses which close the Tube.—In the experiments that we
have just described the luminous rays only pass through air,
and the rotation obtained represents, with the exception of a
slight correction, the magnetic rotation of that gas. When
the experiment is tried with other gases, it becomes necessary
to close the tube by glasses, as we have above indicated.
    The luminous rays pass through the glasses G, G, as many
times as through the tube itself; and as at each passage the
latter presents four surfaces, it is clear that the luminous rays
corresponding to the fourth reflected image will have traversed
thirty-six surfaces of glass.     If to them are added the four
surfaces of the mirrors, it will make forty surfaces of glass
 .#      the passage of the light.     From this it is seen what
must be the perfection of the workmanship of these surfaces
 in order that the images should not experience any appreciable
distortion.   In addition to this, if it happened that the glasses
were even   very slightly unannealed, the depolarization of the
light, which would have been almost imperceptible during a
 single passage, would become considerable.

                                     I
pairs before obtaining those that have employed throughout
the work, and which are at least as good as the first ones.
These glasses are of St.-Gobain glass, about 0.005 metre in
thickness, and are finished with the greatest care, so that they
do not distort the images in the least degree, at any rate up to
the fifth passage.       Even after nine passages they do not
depolarize the light to an                 extent, and the images
 can still be reduced to equality of tint with remarkable pre
 .
 ClS10n.
    When the apparatus is not perfectly regulated, it is found
 that the positions of the equality of tint of the various images
are no longer exactly the same as they ought to be.          This
 arises from the fact that the rays which reach the eye for each
 image pass through the polariscope and the analyzer more or
 less obliquely.   This inconvenience would be obviated by ad
justment; but as the angle of the two deviations obtained by
             the direction of the electric current is always
measured, the absolute direction of the plane of polarization
 of the incident ray does not enter into the determinations. It
is equally easy to prove that the luminous rays which pass
 through the glasses almost normally cannot undergo any ap
 preciable amplification or diminution in their magnetic ro
 tation in consequence of the phenomena of refraction of the
 polarized light.
                  |.
    However, it was proved by a special experiment that a slight
 rotation of the plane of polarization of the luminous rays
 experienced by          on issuing from the polariscope was still
 the same at the fourth image reflected ; so that the passage
 through the glasses and the successive reflections did not,
 with the exception of the magnetic effect, introduce any appre
 ciable correction into the measurements.     The only important
 correction occasioned by the glasses has relation to the mag
 netic rotation which they cause the plane of polarization of
 the light to undergo.     This correction was studied with the
 greatest care, and it will be treated of hereafter.
    It would have been preferable to avoid this difficulty by
 placing the glasses further away from the bobbins; but this
 arrangement would have tended to make the size of the ap
 paratus too large. It would also have been possible to use
 only the four centre bobbins; but the diminution of the
 distance traversed by the light under magnetic influence was
 not compensated for by the increased intensity of the current
 of the pile circulating in a solenoid of less resistance.

in the third decimal place; beyond that the difference is
marked.       I have assumed that the first formula expresses
tolerably approximately the progress of the phenomenon; and
I  have reduced the rotations observed to what they would be
at a temperature of 0°.          The numbers obtained differ by only a
few minutes of arc from those which would result from the ap
plication of the formula of dilatation of the carbon bisulphide.
   The following table contains the numbers obtained for the
rotation of carbon bisulphide in the interior of the different
bobbins. The multiplicity of the measurements in each case
enables us, as an average, to count upon an accuracy of some
tenths of a minute; the hundredths of a minute, resulting from
the calculation of the averages, have been recorded.

   The glasses which close the tube of 0:50 metre are of crown
glass, and are about 1.5 millim. thick. The magnetic rotation
which they cause the plane of polarization of the light to
undergo is very feeble. It was ascertained directly, the tube
being empty of liquid; and the rotations are recorded in the
last column of the preceding table. The sum of these correc
tions is 13-98, and it must be subtracted from the total-
amount of the rotations observed.
   It is equally important to subtract from each measurement
the rotation due to magnetic influence on the column of air
traversed by the luminous rays.               In accordance with what
will hereafter be    shown,      this rotation at 20° and at a pressure
of 760 millim. amounts to about 0:58, say 3.48 to be sub
tracted from the sum of the rotations.

by an iron wire, or if this was dipped in the mercury collected
in the cup E.
    In this latter case there were attached to both electrodes
iron wires dipping in mercury, exposed to the air, and in
almost identical conditions—the only difference being in the
capillary relations of the mercury contained in the cup and
of that in the funnel and neck.
    The question arose, Is the formation of drops at the end of a
very fine tube accompanied by electrical phenomena such as to
cause a positive charge to be gradually accumulated in the mer
cury-reservoir 2
    The effect observed was not due to the electrification pro
duced by friction against the glass; for this effect is of much
smaller dimensions, and the mercury would be negatively
charged.
    The case of these falling drops is in many respects analo
gous to that of mercury advancing in a capillary tube.            I
tested therefore the behaviour, in such a tube, of a column of
mercury broken by an air-bubble, by connecting the cups in
which dipped the ends of the tube to the two electrodes of an
electrometer, then suddenly raising one cup.
    I found that the advancing column was always positive to
the retreating mercury; and by multiplying the effect by        in
serting many air-bubbles a deflection was obtained, when the
rate of flow was sufficient, corresponding to 7 D. (The fric
tional charge, as shown by a low-resistance galvanometer and
an undivided column of mercury, was extremely slight.)           In
such an apparatus the retreating end is oxidized, the coating
of oxide appearing after prolonged action, while the advancing
end is reduced and acquires a positive charge.
    Similarly, the advancing drop in the apparatus first described
beomes positively charged, so long as any reduction takes place.
This depends on.previous exposure to the air and other cir
cumstances which favour oxidation, but also on an action
                                              i.

slight oxidation of   i.             and this therefore causes a
                          surface, which, however, is not of suffi
 cient duration to lower the potential of the mass of mercury
in the column to any extent; for, the forward motion at once
setting in, the oxide locally deposited is reduced, this reduc
 tion being equivalent to a positive charging ; and, since the
drop takes time to form, the positive charge is communicated
 to the column, which thus becomes more and more charged
 by each forward motion of the column, so long as oxidation
can occur immediately after each drop has fallen.

    Thus, when iron and copper are each of them placed alone
 in water, both metals are oxidized, though differently: both
 therefore are negative, though by different amounts, to the
 water; but if these metals are placed in the same water, the
 iron alone is oxidized, the copper has hydrogen deposited on
it and becomes therefore positive to the iron, as before, but in
addition is positive to the acid.
    We have as yet no means of estimating the actual difference
of potential between an electrolyte and any metal; for the
measurement of the Peltier effect on the passage of a current
is the only way of determining this difference, and such a
method is impracticable.      Since there exists no proof of the
contrary,  I  have assumed that when two metals are introduced
into an electrolyte, the potential of the latter is intermediate
between those of the two metals.       Now, if the production of
potential depends on the charges brought by the dissociating
ions, this assumption must necessarily represent the actual
case ; and it is moreover borne out in the experiments that
follow.
    We have therefore two cases to consider, whether in liquids
or in gases:—The metals (say iron and copper) are in the same

  This difference of potential, in air, has usually been regarded
as that existing between the two metals; but in experiments
similar in principle to Sir William Thomson's half-disk appa
ratus, it is the potential of the air or gas that has been deter
mined, and not that of the metal.
   In water, this difference of potential has been shown by
Brown (Phil. Mag. Feb. 1879).
  A third, intermediate state of affairs exists, namely that in
which the metals are connected through a considerable external
                              Fig.   4.
                       & or
resistance.  Then the fall of potential is distributed according
to the external and internal resistances.
   Two suppositions have been made; and these require to be
confirmed by experiment:—
º
   (1) Metals in contact are at the same potential, though dif
ferences of potential exist in the medium (electrolytic) around
them.
   (2) Metals in the same electrolyte and in sufficient proxi
mity, when insulated, are at different potentials, though the
           may be at one intermediate potential between them.
   We have thus to prove :—
   I. The equality of potential of metals touching (say in air).
  I  used the apparatus described in the first part of the paper,
and, as mentioned, obtained a deflection depending on the rate
of fall, the amount of oxidation, and consequently the medium
around the drops.     The cause of this has been explained; but
by substituting coal-gas for the air about the drops (and also
the exposed surfaces, as that of the mercury in the funnel) the
oxidation is more and more reduced, till the positive charge
passes into a negative one.     (It is necessary, to obtain this
effect, that the drops run slowly.)      That is to say, when
the medium is neutral and no chemical action is set up, no
deflection at all is observed.   What is the condition of affairs
at this point?
   The electrode B (fig. 1) is in connexion with an iron cylin
der, which, not being oxidized in this medium,       is,
                                                      according

oxidation or reduction takes place; the mercury therefore
(according to the theory) receives neither positive nor negative
charge, and is therefore likewise at the potential of the air.
The only remaining possible cause of deflection being the con
tact of iron and mercury (to both electrodes are attached iron
wires)—since there is no deflection observed, there is no dif
ference of potential between the iron and the mercury (except
perhaps that answering to the slight Peltier effect).
    II. The influence of the presence of one metal on the poten
tial of the other, and the difference of potential thereby set up.
    In the case of the liquid cell, this influence has accidentally
been proved by experiments previously performed.                      Thus,
 Perry and Ayrton find that the air near copper touching
water in which is also dipped an iron bar, is at a higher
potential than the air about the iron; for the air oxidizes both
metals, though unequally (for the copper is out of the reach
of the influence of the iron through air); whereas the water
 oxidizes the iron, rendering it negative to itself, and therefore
 renders the copper positive by the deposit of hydrogen which
 clings to    it.  The air being positive          both metals, to     thus                    is
 necessarily       at higher potential about the copper than about

   Hence, in gaseous as well as in liquid electrolytes, metals,
unless touching, are at different potentials, dependent on this
mutual influence as well as on the amount of chemical action
set up by the one, more electro-negative, which becomes
negative to the electrolyte, and still more so to the electro
positive metal.

   As a conclusion, these two points, fancy, hold generally
for gases and liquids:—
  (i) The         metal    to which goes the                          positiye      ion
                                                         electro- negative
becomes, by the charges' brought      by the dissociated atoms,
          positive       -

electro-            relatively to the electrolyte; and
          negative
   (ii) Metallic contact entails equality of potential.
   The simplicity of these laws is evident, as also the advan
tage of bringing back to generally received laws of action the
phenomena of potential due to contact of metals and electro
lytes.
  I wished to have added  one or two experiments to the above,
which I wanted also to  repeat to get surer quantitative deter
minations, and to render the conditions more conducive to
accuracy; but the time at my disposal was limited, as well as
the opportunities for performing the experiments. .

tions of two equal circular coils f of wire whose axes were
parallel to each other—that is to say, measurements of the rela

coefficient of mutual induction became nothing. I also showed
how, by the aid of these measurements, a curve could be
drawn such that when one coil remained fixed, and the other
was moved with            its

outer circumferences are 28.2 centim. The depth of the sec
tion of the coils perpendicular to the axis is 0-9947 centim.;
the width of the groove parallel to the axis is 1-0 centim. :
the section of the coils is therefore approximately one square
centimetre. The mean radius is 3.99, or approximately 40 cen
tim. The resistances do not agree quite so closely; but their
mean gives R=2.4 ohms at 11°5 C.
   The coils are mounted on straight guides which have
grooves in their upper surfaces, along which the coils can be
made to slide ; and their positions are indicated by scales at
tached to the guides. The readings are obtained to centi
metres and millimetres direct, and tenths of a millimetre by
estimation.     The coils A and B are mounted with their axes
coincident on a straight guide EF, of sufficient length to allow
their centres to be separated to a distance of 70 centimetres.
The coils C and D are mounted on a pair of guides OP and
MN, O P being about half the length of MN, and attached
to it at right angles midway between                 ends. The axes         its                                   of

 The measurements for the second set of curves were made ex
  perimentally in the same way as for the first set ; but as the
 axes of the coils C and D were at right angles, there was a con
 siderable part of the field near the origin in which no measure
  ments could be obtained, on account of the coils coming into
  contact with each other.
    The positive or negative induction corresponding to any one
 of the plotted curves being equal to that between A and B
 when placed at some definite distance from each other, it
 became necessary, in order to place the curves so that the
 numerical value of the induction-coefficient might have a
 known relative for each, to determine the law according to
 which the induction between the two coaxal coils A and B
 varied with the distance between them.         For this purpose the
 coil A was connected with a      contact-key    and with a battery
 of 20 Grove’s cells to form the primary      circuit;  the secondary
 circuit was formed by connecting the coil B with a contact
 key and with the coils C and D, which were placed close
 together and used as a galvanometer.        The needle and mirror
 employed were rather heavy: this had the advantage of allow
 ing the induced currents to exert their full effect on the needle
 before it had moved perceptibly from                    its
                                                  position     equili     of
 brium. The key was         adouble-contact key,       arranged that
                                                                so
 on  depressing the key the primary circuit was completed; and
 immediately afterwards, when the current was established, the
 secondary circuit, which was already complete, was opened,
 and was kept open       by spring acting       the lower key, while
                                                     on

 depressing and releasing the key was             general about one

 current circulated   every  time that contact was made was ap
                         º
 proximately that period. With this arrangement only the
 induced current    on  making was allowed         act     the galva

     Asthe state of the battery was liable to change and the
strength of the current to vary, it was important that
errors arising from these causes should as far as                   be
eliminated.     In order to effect this, a double set of observations
was  taken,  first with increasing distances between the coils,
and next with decreasing distances.          In every position de
flections were taken towards both ends of the scale; so that the
recorded results represent the means of never less than four
readings; and in most cases they are the means of twelve or
sixteen.    The observations were begun with the coils A and
B as close together as possible without touching, and were
continued till the distance between them was 70 centim.; but
beyond about 50 centim. the galvanometer above mentioned,
formed by the juxtaposition of the coils C and D, was not
sufficiently sensitive.       It was therefore replaced for these
distances    by   a delicate reflecting galvanometer; and the
necessary reduction was made after the ratio of the indications
                                                           º
of the two instruments had been found. The deflections of
the needle were indicated by the movements of a spot of light
on a circular scale of one metre radius. The readings were
obtained in centimetres and millimetres, and, after having been
corrected for the effect of damping, were reduced to degrees.
The value of the induced electromotive force, or, in other
 words, the strength of the induced current, was in each case
taken as being proportional to the sine of half the angle
through which the needle was deflected—that                      is,

and
      D,   sothat the same mountings served for both, and the
readings were obtained from the same scales. That which was
fitted    the former we shall call Co, that which was fitted
          to                                                                                    to

                                                                                AE

               which the mutual induction between               and                        Ba
  alanced that between             Co
                               and Do; this gave the desired value
to  the induction-coefficient         the curve; and the remaining
                                         of

                        Electromagnetic Induction.                                       339
points were found as in previous cases. Without again shifting
the coil B, a negative curve, the induction-coefficient of which
had the same relative value as that of the positive curve,
could either be continued or completely traced out by inter
changing the leading wires of the coil                     i.
                                                and passing it to the
negative region. Thus the curves, whether positive or negative,
could either be continued or completely traced out with the
thin coils just as with the thick ones; and a constant value
could be given to the mutual induction between the coils Co
and Do in each pair of balancing positions, proportional to,
although not the same as the value assigned to M for a given
curve. Hence the path traced out by the centre of the coil
Do was practically the same as that which would have been
followed by the centre of the coil D, had it been possible to
use it in tracing the same curve in that part of the field.      The
value of the induction-coefficient of each of the two curves
nearest to the origin is uncertain, as the value of 2 which
corresponds to that of a for either of these curves is beyond
the range of the curve, fig. 1.       A convenient, although un
certain value was    given   to the induction-coefficient of either
of these curves by placing Do at the point P and moving Co
towards O until the distance between the centres of Co and Do
was equal to that between the origin and the point where the
curve was required to cross the axis of          then balancing by

   The first set of curves of constant induction are given in
fig. 2, Plate X. Curve 20 and the point of maximum nega
tive induction could not be found experimentally; they are
therefore only given as near approximations.         The rectangular
space near the origin shows the region within which the auxi
liary coils C, and Do (see p. 338) had to be employed. These
curves represent the contour-lines of one quadrant of the sur
face above described, and show at what distance from the
origin any curve cuts the axis of y. Knowing this, and know
ing also the relative value of M or of 2 for each curve,
we obtain a set of values for the coordinates of a curve which
may be viewed as a section of the surface in question in a
plane containing the axes of y and 2. These coordinates are
given in Table IV.; the curve plotted by means of them is
given in fig. 3, Pl. XI.; but the dotted part of it is only ap
proximate.

    In order   to give a better idea of the symmetry of the curves
 of constant induction than can be got from fig. 2, the curves
 in that figure have been repeated in the other quadrants, and
 are given in fig. 4, Pl. XI., for the whole of the magnetic field
 of the primary coil. Now every thing is symmetrical rela
 tively to the axis of c, and each curve represents a section of
 a surface of revolution about that axis.       Hence, if the curves
 are supposed to revolve round the axis of a, a number of sur
 faces of revolution will be generated, each of which will be a
 surface of constant induction, the surfaces of positive induction
 being separated from those of negative induction by the sur
 face of no induction.      The positive surfaces may be described
 as shells which enclose one another, and each of which turns
 inwards, closing up round the axis of a on each side of the
 origin.     The zero-surface, which divides the positive from the
 negative surfaces, instead of

extend in space to an infinite distance.          The negative surfaces
turn outwards and close        up  in a    plane containing the axes of
a and z ; they are hollow circular rings which enclose one
another, and which have their common centre at the origin of
coordinates.
   In  the series  of measurements for the determination of the
second set of   curves,     the axis of the coil D was perpendicular
to that of  C,  but otherwise every thing was arranged as in the
diagram. The same values were given to M for these curves
as for the others, by setting the coil B in the same positions
on the scale E F which it had occupied during the previous
experiments. These curves are numbered in accordance with
Table W.

   The zero-curve of this set coincides with the axes of coor
dinates; and, in general, when two similar coils with their axes
perpendicular are employed, one as primary and the other as
secondary, their mutual induction is zero when the axis of the
 one lies in the mean plane of the other.          This shows that any
 curve of the second set for which the value of M is small must
 make a near approach to the axes of coordinates in the neigh
 bourhood of the origin, and that a part of each curve in that
 region cannot be traced experimentally with the coils em
 ployed. The coordinates of these curves, as far as it was
 found possible to determine them experimentally, are given in
 Table VI. ; but there is with this set a larger space near the
 origin within which the dimensions of the coils made it im
 possible to get measurements than was the case with the first
 set of curves.    In the figures, the curves are continued con
jecturally within this space by dotted lines. The second set
 of curves are given in #. 5, Pl. X.

    The positive and negative curves of the second set have the
same form, and are positive in one quadrant and negative in
another alternately. They have been treated as an indepen
dent set of curves; but, as will afterwards appear, they are
not so, but are merely a special case in which the positive
curves of the first set have become separated by the interve
ning zero-curve which coincides with the axes of a and y. In
this case any corresponding pair of positive and negative
curves, besides having the same form, have also the same
linear dimensions.       In every other case the form and linear
 dimensions of any corresponding pair of positive and negative
curves are different, the linear dimension of the negative
 curve being always less than that of the positive.
 this is the case in which the linear dimension of any negative

 curve is greatest, and in which that of the corresponding posi
tive curve is least. The second set of curves, for the whole of
 the magnetic field, are given in fig. 6, Pl. IX., which shows the
 relative positions occupied by them in the various quadrants.
    When a system of curves of constant induction have been
 obtained   for a given pair of coils, they may be used to give
 the total inductive effect produced on one of the coils by a
 given change of relative position while the other coil is
 traversed by a current of known strength. To simplify the
 statement, suppose the primary coil in which there is a current
 of uniform strength C to remain at rest while the secondary
 coil is moved from a position such that the coefficient of mutual
 induction is M1, to a position in which this coefficient becomes
M. Then, if t is the time occupied by the movement, the

The total quantity, q, of electricity conveyed by the secondary
current is consequently
and is therefore independent of the time occupied in the
displacement of the secondary coil.
   The values of M1 and M2, the coefficients of induction
corresponding to the initial and final positions of the secondary
coil, can be obtained by inspection of diagrams of curves of
constant induction such as those which accompany this paper.
It is evident that the total secondary current is nothing in
every case in which the secondary coil is moved so as to

originally were each bisected by the axis of y, have then come
to occupy the two remaining opposite quadrants. Thus the
one set of curves of constant induction merges into the other,
and the forms of both sets, which may be described as ovals,
depend upon the angle between the axes of the primary and
secondary coils.
    We see, then, that the second set of curves, although found
experimentally, are not entirely independent of the first set,
and that being positive and negative in alternate quadrants,
they have no corresponding surfaces of revolution, that the
only curves of constant induction which have corresponding
surfaces of revolution are those which are obtained when the
axes of the primary and secondary coils are parallel, and that
 all curves of constant induction which are due to the coils
when their axes make any other angle with each other are
merely modified forms of them.
    The arrangement of apparatus employed in this investigation,
 namely two similar coils in the primary and two other similar
 coils in the secondary circuit, was employed by Dove in his
 researches, and was called by him the “Differential Inductor”
(Annales de Chimie et de Physique, tome iv. 1842).
    The same arrangement was employed by Felici, a short
account of whose researches is given in Maxwell's ‘Electricity
and Magnetism,’ vol.        pp. 169–172.

352           Prof. S. P. Thompson on                      the Phenomena
    2. The beats of mistuned consonances of the form n : 1,
which were not explicitly mentioned in the author's papers,
nor at that time subjected by him to detailed examination,
have lately claimed attention on account of the revival of the
dispute between acousticians-ef-two schools concerning the
origin of difference-tones,    or grave harmonics. Dr.
of Paris still consistently advocates the theory of Smith and of
                                                                           %.
Young—that the beats (which represent in frequency the dif
ference between the vibration-frequencies of the two interfering
tones) pass, when occurring sufficiently rapidly, into beat
tones (as he calls the differential tones). All mathematical
               ".
acousticians agree, on the other hand, that this is physically
impossible
that the   squares
                     tones are pure and of so small an amplitude
                    and higher powers of the displacements may
be   neglected.   A very important paper on this matter by Mr.
Bosanquet has lately appeared", in which the following state
ments are made:–(1) That the beats and difference-tones of im
perfect consonances other than unisons are subjectivef; (2) that
the beats consist, as König discovered in 1875, of variations
in the intensity of the lower of the two interfering tones;
(3) that if the squares and higher powers of the displacements
be not neglected in the equations, a term appears having a
period whose frequency is the difference of the frequencies of
                    º
the generating tones, as required by Helmholtz's theory of the
difference-tones,   and corresponding to König's lower beat
notes.    In this last we have the apparent reconciliation of the
experiments of            with the theory of Helmholtz.    To his
former experiments König has now added a fresh series with

  t   I am   not quite sure whether     I
                                        entirely understand the sense in which
 Mr. Bosanquet uses the word subjective.              If
                                                   he means by this term that
 the phenomena of beats and difference-tones exist only in the mind, brain,
 or nerve-structures of the ear, being generated in the sensory apparatus
 by something which physically has no existence, being in fact only phan
 toms of the imagination, then      Ientirely differ from him.   But if by sub
jective Mr. Bosanquet means that the existence of these phenomena,
 though physically and mechanically true, is limited to the receptive me
 chanism of the ear, then I beg in the first place to disagree with such a
   erversion of the adjective, and in the second place to deny that any such
  imitation exists. The beats are objective: they can be seen in a mano
 metric flame if the primary tones are sufficiently loud.       The difference
 tones of the mistuned consonances in question are also objective, inasmuch
 as a suitable asymmetrical resonator will reinforce them.         What is the
 ear but a complex resonator upon whose parts vibrations from without

 the same reason,  be  taken  up   by

binaural hearing the case of mistuned consonances of the form

    (a) Mistuned Unison.—Two stopped organ-pipes (C" of 4-foot
octave), sometimes blown from one source, sometimes from
two, were used, one being kept to exact tuning, the other
raised and lowered in pitch by altering position of stopper or
by holding an obstacle to the                       lip

which ceased         either

the mistuned octave entirely confirmed the second point                                       of to
 Mr. Bosanquet's research. Whether the upper                              or

or of
     the octave interval was tampered with, and whether raised
     lowered, beats were heard, and those beats consisted exclu
 sively  of variations          in

                                              the lower note.      That ear
 which received the        higher     note heard    merely    variations                      in
pitch when that note was tampered with, heard                     variations    no
either  of  pitch      or  intensity when the lower note was tam

 merely variations           intensity (beats) when the upper note

354          Prof. S. P. Thompson on the Phenomena
except through the tubes.      Under these circumstances very
distinct beats were  heard; and they were beats exclusively of
the lower note.     Here, however, a very curious subjective
phenomenon presented itself, similar to that noted in the
author's earlier researches in the case of unisons in different
phase:  the beats of the lower notes did not seem to be mere
maxima and minima of loudness; they were heard as a moving
of the lower tone backward and forward from the ear to the
back of the head.
   (c) Mistuned Twelfth-For this interval the arrangement
with stopped organ-pipes was reverted to, the higher note
being raised and lowered in pitch. To one ear the higher
note simply rose and fell in pitch without the least throb. To
the other ear the lower note merely throbbed. Extreme mis
tuning, so that the beats became too rapid for distinction (at
60 or 70 per second), yielded no differential tone, though such
was heard strongly when the two sounds were mingled together
before reaching the ears.
   An experiment with tuning-forks gave a similar result.
   At this stage resonators, consisting of rectangular boxes
closed at one end, were tried, with the result of bringing out
the phenomenon much more loudly.        The beats of the lower
note are not subjective.
   (d) Mistumed Double-octave.—The mistuned double-octave
gave equally marked results.       When the upper note was
altered the effects in the ears were as follows: the lower note
throbbed; the upper note merely rose and fell in pitch. When
the lower note was altered the upper remained unchanged, but
the lower rose and fell and throbbed.

   4. The author has tried to produce interference between an
objective and a subjective tone in the following manner:-
In the spring of the present year, after a violent catarrh he
was troubled at intervals        for
                               several days with    “singing”    a                in
the left ear  of   shrill note somewhere near d". He tried
                   a
several times  to produce note within beating-distance
                             a                               this;           of
but not    having  forks for this  octave, nor                  of
                                                     lower octavea
sufficiently near,     he
                       did not succeed     the attempt before the
                                                  in
ailment vanished.
   He has, however, succeeded        another case. After listen

      º
and a real objective note tuned to beat with       the author has                        it,
produced beats. He brought the tones          the ears with tubes,                to
One         intolerably loud, the other faint; and arrangements
were made        which   by
                          single movement opened one pipe and
                                          a

   XLVI.    Earthquake Observations and Experiments in Japan.
 By JoHN MILNE, F.G.S., and THOMAs GRAY, B.Sc., F.R.S.E.”
 WB experiments
           propose to give in this
                         on
                                     paper a  brief
                            earthquakes performed by
                                                    résumé of some
                                                         us during
  our residence in Japan. Some parts of Japan, and notably
 the Yedo plane, where these experiments were made, are sub
ject to very frequent seismic disturbances. It must be borne
 in mind, however, when considering the experiments and
 results here described, that the earthquakes which occur in
 this region are seldom of a destructive character.
    We have found it convenient to divide this paper into two
 parts. In the first part a very brief discussion of the more
 important instruments used by us is given; while in the second
 part some of the most interesting points brought out by the
 use of these instruments are referred to.
                                PART  I.
    The instruments may be classified, according to the pur
 pose for which they were intended, into the following groups:–
                          1. Seismoscopes.
    These are instruments which merely show that an earth
 quake has taken place.       A great number of instruments of
 this class have been used ; and descriptions of most of them
are to be found in the Transactions of the Seismological
 Society of Japan. The following are some of the more im
portant:—
    (a) Vessels containing Liquid.—Wessels of liquid have often
been referred to in descriptions of earthquakes as giving indi
cations, by the motion of the liquid up the side of the vessel,
of the direction and intensity of a shock. In large shocks,
provided they can be made to record their motions by some
such method as colouring the liquid, or coating the side of the
vessel with some substance which can be easily washed off,
these may sometimes be of value.           For shocks of ordinary
intensity we have found them quite useless.         Many methods,
both mechanical and chemical, were tried; but as yet no prac
ticable method of recording by means of a liquid has been
found.
   The chief difficulties are to obtain a liquid which will neither
evaporate nor freeze, and at the same time will not creep up
the sides  of the vessel. Then, again, it is difficult to get a
                  * Communicated   by the Authors.

vessel of the size or shape which will ensure a washing-up at all.
A vessel, the fundamental period of oscillation of          liquid in
which nearly coincides with the period of the earthquake,
would possibly show a considerable motion. A difficulty here
arises however.      Our observations show that few earthquakes
have   any   definite period ; and different earthquakes have
generally different, sometimes very different, periods.
   (b) Columns.—These generally consisted of round cylinders,
with their ends cut very accurately at right angles to the axis
of the cylinder. Specimens of such cylinders, of various dia
meters and the same height, were set on end on a level plane
with the view of finding, from the direction in which they fell,
the direction of motion during the earthquake-shock.              We
were somewhat surprised to find that even the smallest cylin
der that can be set on end but seldom falls in ordinary non
destructive shocks.      When the shock is tolerably severe, they
fall in various     directions,   even when placed on the same
slab.   The reason of this appears to be that most earthquakes
commence gently,–the columns rock, and, whilst rocking,
gradually change their plane of motion before being over
turned. Occasionally it may be due to the presence of two
sets of vibrations in different directions, some columns being
overturned by one set, whilst others are overturned by the
other set.    Because of this indefiniteness in the indications of
columns, we have called them Seismoscopes.            In addition to
round cylinders, columns of various shapes (as, for instance,
inverted cones) have been employed.             Columns have also
been caused to stand on segments of small spheres.             These
variations have not as yet shown any advantage over the ordi
nary column.             -
   Besides the   ordinary   columns which are used as earthquake
indicators, we may mention bodies like strips of glass, pins,
i. !".
&c., which will not stand unless supported on one side. When
                       ..i.
such bodies are thus supported, they are overturned more
readily by motions               to the plane of support than the
finest columns we are able to set on end.         In employing this
           of              up, it is necessary to use a number of
  odies placed against planes in different azimuths.
    (c) Microphones, or circuit-breakers in conjunction with a
galvanometer so arranged that if the needle swings it comes
into contact with a piece of iron and is held, and many other
similar contrivances have been employed to indicate small
motions.
    (d) Tremor-Indicator.—This is a modification of a pendu
lum seismometer, in which the bob of the pendulum is at the
time of an earthquake approximately steady.             Against this
bob are placed the ends of two small       strips of wood resting in

each other. The outside end of each of these strips carries one
thread of the bifilar suspension of a mirror, the other thread of
the bifilar being attached to a point fixed to the earth. When
the strips are pushed inwards against the bob, by the earth
moving them, the mirrors turn, and a beam of light coming

the weight causes the bracket to turn, while it itself remains
nearly steady.   This frame is firmly attached to the head of a
stake driven into the ground.       A light prolongation of the
bracket forms an  index, which writes on the surface of a smoked
glass plate a magnified representation of the motion given to
the frame by the ground.      Two of these instruments, placed
at right angles  to each other, are used in conjunction for the
purpose of writing two rectangular components of the motion.

a mass supported in neutral equilibrium at the end of a
bracket) was, we believe, first used by Prof. W. S. Chaplin,
of the Tokio University—and subsequently in the instrument
described above, which was invented by one of the authors of
this paper, who was not then aware that the principle had been
previously applied to this purpose. An instrument involving
the same principle has also been invented by Prof. J. A. Ewing,
and is described in the   Proceedings  of the Royal  Society  for
February 1881.

moved, the balls roll and the upper plate is left behind. Pivoted
 on the upper plate is the end of a long light index. A short
distance below this pivot the index passes through a universal
joint fixed to the lower plate. The lower end of this index
carries a sliding needle, the point of which rests on a smoked
glass plate, and there writes a magnified representation of the
earth's motion.
         3. Instruments for recording Vertical Motion.
   (a) Ordinary Spiral Spring.—The earliest form of instru
ment used to record vertical motion was a spiral spring with
a weight at the lower end, the weight being supposed, on
account of    its
              inertia,   remain steady
                          to                  at

a long period of vibration.
   (b) Flerible-bottomed-Cylinder Seismograph.--This consists
of a tin can with an indiarubber bottom, which rests on a thin
flat spring.   Against the lower side of this spring, opposite
the centre of the rubber bottom, the end of the short arm of
a lever presses.    The can is partly filled with water, which
by       its
        inertia causes the bottom            deflected   to    be

clocks, arranged for the purpose of driving a drum about

of about one revolution in two minutes. So long as no earth
quake occurs, the pointers of the seismograph continue to move
along the same line. When an earthquake occurs, the
is in motion and ready to receive the whole record.       It is yet
a question whether this is necessary, as it is quite             to
start an apparatus before an ordinary seismograph (giving,
say, a multiplication of 10) is able to show any movement on
the somewhat broad line which has been previously formed.
Certainly in earthquakes, when the motion is considerable,
there is no use for such an apparatus.
   With apparatus for this purpose it is difficult to produce
uniform motion, as it is evident that an escapement-method of
governing is not suitable.        Conical pendulums, troughs of
liquid with dipping vanes, after the pattern of Airy's governor,
have been tried, but, though acting well when there is no dis
turbance, are likely to be affected by the shock, and hence may
not act well when they are wanted.        It appeared that a better
arrangement would be, to reverse the action of the Airy
governor and cause the trough of liquid to rotate, the vane
remaining stationary. The liquid, from the mere fact of its
rotation, would not be so likely to be affected by the shaking ;
and, besides, the trough, in consequence of           comparatively     its
great mass, would have        fly-wheel governing-action.

   The measurements on the rate of dying out were mostly
made by means of rolling-sphere seismographs.
   The velocities obtained for direct and transverse vibrations
were 438 feet and 357 feet per second.        This gives 1:23 as
the ratio of the propagation of these two sets of vibrations.
   The very low rate of propagation is due to the soft medium
through which the vibrations were propagated.          The actual
results are probably very nearly correct, from the manner in
which they were performed, there being no personal equation
to take account           of.

   It  is to be observed that, as the record was written on a
                                                      ''.
strip of smoked paper wound round a drum which was started
automatically by the earthquake, the very beginning of the
earthquake is not shown. The waving line                    shows
the successive motions of the earth in a direction N. 15° E.
magnified about ten times; while the line a b c shows the
motions at right angles to that direction magnified to the
same extent.      The spaces inclosed between the cross lines
were moved over in five seconds.          The extremely gradual
manner in which the motion dies out is well illustrated in this
record.
   In Yedo, earthquakes showing east-and-west directions
of vibration have been proved by accurate time-observations
to have originated in the south.      This would seem to indicate
that the normal vibration did not appear prominently in the
record. It is possible that in some cases the normal vibra
tions are never very prominent, the original strain on the
material being more of a shear than a compression or extension.
If  this supposition holds, it follows that we cannot with any
certainty make a deduction with regard to the direction of
propagation from the direction of motion. The direction of
original shear might be inclined at any angle to the direction
of propagation.
      vidence that the motion is in some cases of a nature
similar to that here suggested has been obtained in the follow
ing manner. Instruments were set up at several stations,
about 20 miles apart, round Yedo Bay; and in conjunction
with the observations of these instruments the time of arrival
of the shock was observed at Yedo and Yokohama.              From
the latter    observations,  it was found that the     hyperboloid
which forms the locus of possible positions of the origin lies
between Yokohama and Yedo, and also that it is concave
towards Yokohama.         These observations are corroborated by
the much      greater  intensity, greater verticality, and greater
number of the shocks as felt at Yokohama than at Yedo.          In
some cases, however, the directions of motion at Yedo and at
stations situated at points in lines at right angles to the line
between Yedo and the probable origin, are found to be nearly
the same—thus indicating a disturbance which is propagated
in one direction as a normal vibration, while at right angles
to that it is almost a pure transverse or distortional vibration.
   The existence of such an irregular kind of disturbance is
rendered still more probable when we take into consideration
the highly irregular nature of the vibrations which are felt
both by our senses and by our instruments, and combine these
with the observation that the rocky masses in the vicinity of

                                                                                         -

our probable origin are highly faulted, and bear strong evi
dence of recent elevation.      e jolting movements felt in an
earthquake resemble very much what one would expect to be
produced by the tearing open of a fracture or the sliding of
two irregular surfaces over each other.
   It has been usual to deduce the angle of emergence from
observations of the horizontal and vertical components of the
earth’s motion.

 370           Messrs. Milne and Gray's Experiments
 necessary.     The following are one or two other methods
 which might be adopted for this purpose:–
     If the time of arrival of a shock at three stations a long
 distance apart be taken, and an average velocity of propagation
 assumed, it is possible to construct for each pair of these
 stations a surface (which will be approximately an hyperboloid)
 on which the origin will be situated. The mutual intersection
 of these three surfaces will be approximately the origin re
 quired. A correction on this may be obtained from succeeding
 shocks by instituting a fourth station on a line through the
 approximate origin and one of the previous stations, and by
    is means approximating more closely to the velocity of
 propagation.
     As another method, if we have the times of arrival at three
 stations close together accurately measured (these give us the
 direction of propagation and the horizontal velocity), a fourth
 station at some distance, say one or two miles, but placed ob
 liquely to the determined direction, and worked in conjunction
 with the first three, will give us an hyperbola; and the point on
which the direction obtained from the three stations inter
sects this gives us the epicentrum, or point vertically above
 the origin of the disturbance or centrum.       It is possible that in
 some cases two   points of intersection may  exist;   but the relative
intensity of the shock at the two points will be sufficient to allow
the proper one to be chosen.       A fifth station would render the
determination of the epicentrum perfectly definite.
    The most general case for the determination of the centrum
from time-observations requires six stations; and these six
stations must not be in the same line through the origin: and
even here it is assumed that the velocity of propagation has
been the same in all directions.
    By varying the elements which are known—as, for instance,
the number of stations at which time was observed, the
relative positions of these stations, the directions of vibration
observed at various points, the angle of emergence (if for small
shocks such an angle is determinable), &c.—we see that a large
number of problems may be presented the solution of which
will give to us more or less correctly the centrum or epicentrum
of the shock.
    The duration of an earthquake-shock is seldom less than
one minute, in Yedo, and is often two or three minutes.              It
must be remarked, however, that, judging from our senses,
                                         *:
many of the shocks seem to last only a few seconds.
    The intensity of a shock is evidently best estimated from
the maximum velocity of translation                  in a body during
an earthquake.      This is evidently the element according to

                   on Earthquakes in      Japan.                      371
which the destructive power is to be measured, it being pro
portional to the maximum kinetic energy of the bodies on
the earth's surface relative to that surface during the shock.
According to this, then, a shock, the vibrations in which are
of one-second period, will have only one fourth of the intensity
of a shock with vibrations of half a second period, if the
amplitudes be the same. We may write intensity proportional
to amplitude divided by the square of the period, or
                                 A
                             I & T.
   Marked instances of the effect of period are often to be ob
served by simply referring to our senses for the intensity, and
then to our records for the amplitude and period. W. find
sometimes that what we considered a severe shock has had a
very           amplitude of movement, but that it has had a short
p er    ºnal
     1001.
    Another interesting point to be observed, is the variation of
the affected area with intensity, amplitude, and duration.        Of
these elements it would appear from our observations that dura
tion is the most important. A comparatively small earthquake,
 if it last for several minutes, will be felt over a large area;
whereas a severe earthquake which consists of only a few bumps
will only be felt for a few miles. A very good illustration of
this was obtained on December 23, 1880, when an earthquake
which was felt at Yedo as a somewhat severe shock, and which
lasted between three and four minutes, was felt in several
places in Yezo ; whereas a previous earthquake, which was
much more destructive, but which lasted less than half the
time, was not felt through half the distance.           Both these
shocks seemed to originate near the same place.
    The geological nature of the rocks near the origin from
which some of the earthquakes we have felt in Yedo appeared
 to emanate, is as follows:—
                                                             on all
    Round the northern end of Yedo Bay we meet on              sides
with greyish-coloured partially clay-like rock, which          close
examination appears     to  consist  of
                                      a  decomposed volcanic ash.
These tuffs are horizontally stratified, and very little faulted       or
altered. As we     go   southwards   onboth sides  ofthe bay, these
same rocks gradually become coarser         intexture, until finally
they are little more than agglomerates consisting       ofundecom
posed volcanic ashes.   .  Along with this lithological change we
observe  a     physical change  to   be taking place.    The rocks
become      gradually  bent into  gentle  anticlinal and synclinal
 folds
     ;     and faults become more numerous.           Near     tothe

372            Messrs. Milne and Gray's Experiments
entrance of the bay, in the extreme south, the foldings are
more steep, and the faults exceedingly common.            At many
points in the faulted districts distinct evidence of a very
recent elevation are to be seen in the form of borings of
Lithodomi 6 to 10 feet above high-water mark. In some of
these holes the shells still exist. As the rock is exceedingly
soft, and at the same time exposed to the weather, it is reason
able to suppose that the elevation must be of a very recent
date.
   It  is in this district of faults and marks of recent elevation
that we have determined an origin for several of the more
recent earthquakes.
                    Classification of Earthquakes.
   Instead of classifying earthquakes according to the         im
pression they have on our senses, we would suggest that they
might be better classified by the records we obtain from our
seismographs.      So far as records have gone, it would appear
that we    might  classify  shocks into (1) Direct, (2) Transverse,
(3) Compound shocks.
   By a direct shock we mean a shock consisting of vibrations
in the direction of propagation, the degree of horizontality
being expressed by the ratio of the horizontal to the vertical
motion.
   By a transverse shock we mean a shock which is for the most
part due to vibrations at right angles to the direction of pro
pagation. The character of this might be expressed in the
same manner as the character of the direct shock.
   By a compound shock we mean a shock showing combina
tions of the direct and transverse vibrations. The horizontality
might be expressed as before.
    n defining an earthquake we should consider it as the
result of an irregular disturbance in the earth's crust, generally
producing both waves of compression and distortion.              In
certain cases the former of these may be prominent, whilst in
other cases the latter.

    From this table we       seethat during the six winter months
(beginning with October) there has been a total of 182 shocks,
while during the remaining six months only 123 shocks have
been recorded.      This result, it will be observed, accords with
the     general  result obtained by Mallet from an examina
tion of the     earthquake    records of many countries. These
shocks, however, were destructive; whilst those we speak of,
with the exception perhaps of one or two, were so small that
they would not have found a place in the records examined by
Mallet.
    Not only do we experience a greater number of shakings in
the cold months, but they are of greater intensities as compared
with those of the warm months.          The intensities of the former
period may be denoted by 20, and those of the latter by 11.

 these earthquakes with regard to the connexion between the
time of their occurrence and the position of the moon. The
 results obtained did not show any of the connexion observed
 by M. Perrey.
    If   we turn to the destructive earthquakes of Japan, we see
 from the following Table (which is drawn up in the same
 manner as those compiled by Mallet) that there have been
 more shocks during the summer than during the winter. This
 result, it will be observed, is not in accordance with the results
 obtained by an examination of the recent earthquakes, nor with
 the general result deduced by Mallet for the earthquakes of
 the world.
     The table has been compiled from Japanese earthquake
 literature.    Of this literature we are acquainted with 65 books
  treating on earthquakes, 7 of which are earthquake calendars
  and 23 are earthquake monographs. No doubt there are many
  other books besides those we here refer to.
     These earthquakes, examined as a whole, do not show any
  decided decrease in seismic activity.

                                                  however, we select
a    particular seismic district—as, for instance, that         Kioto,           of
  for which we have      a series       of
                                      records  extending   over about
  1200 years—a decrease           the activity

  servable.   Ifa   similar examination could         made for specialbe
  seismic areas    in  Europe, instead                of
                                                 examinationan      the               of

     The fact that there      not general decrease
                             is         a                     observed     to   be

                     Effect     of Earthquakes     on Buildings.
    So far as we have been                    able to observe, the effect of
cumstances       :-
an earthquake on a                 building   depends on the following cir
    Whether the different parts of the building are so propor
tioned that they are able to vibrate in unison without producing
º
excessive stresses at any part. We have observed, for instance,
that brick chimneys passing through the roofs of wooden
houses, and chimney-stacks built outside a house and sup
        by tie-rods from the house, are very subject to damage
  y earthquakes.    We have observed, also, that cracks pro
duced by an earthquake generally open and close during the
vibrations of succeeding earthquakes, thus giving evidence of
a want of agreement in the vibrational period of the portions
of the building on opposite sides of the crack.
    The absence of arches having sharp angles at the crown
or at the buttresses is also of considerable importance. An
examination of a great number of brick arches in similar
buildings, some of which had sharp angles, as here described,
while others were curved at these points, showed a very
marked difference in the effects which had been produced in
the two cases.      The rounded arches were seldom at all
 damaged, while the others were nearly              more      less     all              or
cracked.

Evidence that the rocks near to the edge of one of the bluffs
above Yokohama were subject to great stress during a recent
earthquake is obtained in the form of long cracks parallel
to the edge of the bluff. It is more difficult to account for
the damage done to buildings close to the foot of steep cliffs;
but possibly an explanation may be afforded by reflexion of
vibrations causing increased activity in that region.
                           Rotation of Bodies.
   After a severe     earthquake      it has often been observed that
many heavy bodies (like obelisks, gravestones, chimneys, &c.)
have more or less rotated. This phenomenon has been explained
in many ways. Some have supposed that they indicate a
vorticose motion in the ground; others that the phenomena are
due to reflected and direct shocks acting simultaneously on the
body which has been rotated.               Mallet offers the explanation
that the rotation is due to the centre of friction of the base of
the body not coinciding with                              its
                                           geometrical centre.
     Incertain cases              no
                            doubt these explanations, especially the
latter, may        be
                   correct.
  If  vorticose motion          the cause  is   the rotation, we ought
                                                                 of                                           to
find that    all
               twisted bodies near the same place have been turned
in  the same direction; and                 we take Mallet’s view, the
                                                          if
rotation   ought      follow

THE SPONTANEOUS THINNING OF LIQUID FILMS. BY J. PLATEAU.
    my memoirs “On the Figures of Equilibrium of a Liquid Mass
IN   without Weight,’ and in my “Statics of Liquids submitted to
Molecular Forces only,' I have from time to time insisted that the
gradual thinning of liquid films is due, entirely in certain cases, and
in great part in the rest, to the suction exerted by the small sur
faces with strongly concave transverse curvatures which line the
margins of those films. Now, on considering the capillary pressures
in  themselves, and starting from the principle that the pressure of
a  plane  or relatively but little curved excels that of a strongly con
cave surface, one may ask if the gradual thinning does not consist
in this—that the two superficial layers of the film, by their excess
of pressure, press out from between them the interposed layer,
driving it towards the very concave portions,—or if the superficial
layers participate in this motion.         To solve this question   I  have
had recourse to the following experiment.           A plane film of gly
cerine liquid was formed in a ring of iron wire of 7 centim. dia
meter, supported by three feet, and quite horizontal.          While it was
still colourless it was sprinkled with a light coat of lycopodium
powder; it was then covered over with a glass bell, and was observed
while it was gradually being attenuated, which was ascertained by
the appearance and succession of the colours. Now, the lycopodium
was seen little by little to gain the margin; about half an hour after,
it had accumulated along the ring, and the film was clear of           it.
   Thus,   in  the act      thinning, the superficial layers travel towards
                           of
the  margins    of  the  films;   but    these necessarily adhere
                                        as                             to
                                                                        the
interposed layer, they could not move without dragging the latter.
It  must, then,      beadmitted that the whole        the film partakes
                                                      of                     of
this motion, whether the action           exerted directly upon the super
                                         be
ficial layers only,           exerted directly upon the interposed layer
                          or
                          is
also, or, lastly, only upon the latter.

 § 1.
       WHEN           a       is more
                 stant temperature,     at a certain pressure, as is
known, condensation        commences, and is completed without
any increase of the pressure; and only when it is finished is
an augmentation of the pressure required for a still further
diminution of the volume, which pressure must then be                 in
creased in proportion very greatly.          Besides this actual course
of the thing,    J. Thomson, as is well known, has imagined an
other process, which, it is true, cannot in reality take place,
because the states of equilibrium occurring in it are in part
unstable, but is yet theoretically conceivable—namely, an alte
ration of volume in which the entire mass is supposed to be
constantly homogeneous, and the pressure accordingly to
change continuously.         The curve which represents the change
of pressure    corresponding     to the change of volume for this
last process    may   be named briefly the theoretic isothermal.
The real isothermal differs from it by this—that for a certain
length, which in the case of compression corresponds to the
process of condensation, and, conversely, in that of expansion
corresponds to the process of vaporization, the curved line is
replaced by a straight line parallel to the axis of abscissae.
This straight line must, as can be demonstrated from the
second proposition of the mechanical theory of heat, be situated

leave to communicate first, in this paper, the general formulae,
independent of the nature of the particular substances, and a
series of numbers relating to them, reserving for another paper
the applications to definite substances.
     § 2. The formula which, in my treatise on the behaviour of
                  I
carbonic acid, constructed for the representation of pressure
as a function of volume, and temperature, to be annexed to
previous formulae set up by other authors, is
                            T          C
                    p=R                                            (1)
                          w—a     T(v4-8)* '      ' ' ' ' '
in which p, v, and T denote pressure, volume, and absolute
temperature, and R, c, 2, and 8 are constants.         This formula
 I   first formed for carbonic acid, by a comparison with the
 results of Andrews's observations; and        I added, as a conjec
ture only, that with a different determination of the constants,
 without any other alteration, it could be applied also to the
                                    I
 other gases. . When, however, made the experiment of ap
 plying it to those substances for which extended and reliable
 series of data of observation exist, especially to steam,   I found
           .
 that to bring about a satisfactory accordance a still further
 alteration of the formula must be undertaken—which             I had
 previously contemplated when occupied with carbonic acid
                                  I
 only, but which at that time abandoned on account of the
 uncertainty of the data upon which      I had been obliged to base
 the formula. Namely, in the place of the fraction cyT, occur
 ring in the last term, a more general temperature-function,
 with more indefinite constants, must be put.
      Since the more exact knowledge of the temperature-function
 is not             for the general developments here in the first
 place contemplated, we will, for the present, content ourselves
 with indicating it by introducing a new symbol. For the con
  venience of the calculations, however, it is advisable not to
  choose the new symbol simply to put it in the place of the
  fraction c/T, but to make it represent another quantity con
  taining that fraction.    For this purpose we will give to equa
                         ––––––.

  and herein the fraction        may be replaced by     *gº, in
  which 0 shall denote the temperature-function left undeter
  mined, of which we may provisionally say only that for T–0
   it likewise has the value 0, and for the critical temperature it

   These three equations are to be employed for the calculation,
because from them the values of II, w, and W for every value
of 6 can be determined, which determination further leads to
the determination of II, w, and W for every value of T also,
if 6 is known as a function of T.
   § 3. If we wished to carry out the calculation with the aim
of expressing II, w, and        directly as functions of 6, we
should have to treat a transcendental equation which cannot
be solved in a closed form. Hence, as Planck rightly says, it
is better first to determine all four quantities II, w, W. and 6
as functions of a suitably chosen new variable.       Planck has
selected as such new variable an angular magnitude b, which
he provisionally unites with another quantity r, and, together
will this, defines by the following equations:—
                    W = r cos”                    = 7"

sponding values of 6 can be calculated, and which, conversely,
by employing an approximation method, can also be used to
determine, for given values of 6, the corresponding values
of X.
   The table thus calculated, in which, in order to facilitate
interpolation, the difference between each two succeeding
numbers is added, follows at the end of the paper.         If from
this table the value of X belonging to a given value of 6 be
taken, then, as already said, with the aid of this the correspond
ing values of w, W, and II can be directly calculated from the
above equations.     Nor, after the table for A is once calculated,
is there any  further difficulty in calculating tables of the same
sort for w, W,  and II, giving for the same series of values of
6 the corresponding values of those quantities.

                        by Cayley, that any determinant of

I propose  now to show that it may be done away with.

If  w = 0, then A = 0; so that, corresponding to Cayley's
theorem, “An odd-ordered determinant which is skew with
respect to a zero diagonal vanishes,” we have an exact coun
terpart, viz. “An odd-ordered determinant which is skew with
respect to a zero, centre vanishes.”            The latter, too, may be
proved exactly like the former, viz. by multiplying the ele
ments of every row by -1, and thus showing that A = —A.

LI.   Experimental Investigations on Magnetic Rotatory                Polari
          zation in Gases.       By M. HENRI BECQUEREL.
                         [Concluded from p. 324.]
         Discussion of the Sources of       Error:   Corrections.
   N   measurements so delicate as these about to be recorded, it
     was of the highest importance that the effect of the various
disturbing causes proceeding from the apparatus itself should
be most carefully studied and measured.                     Although the
corrections which it was necessary to make in the results
observed were very small, yet, as they were of the same order

          on Magnetic Rotatory Polarization in Gases.           395
of magnitude as the latter, it was essential to determine them
with the greatest accuracy.
     They may be grouped in the following manner —
      I. Variations in electromagnetic intensity.
     II. Want of homogeneity in the luminous source.
   III.  Magnetic rotations caused by the glasses and the
           glass of the mirrors interposed in the course of the
           luminous rays.
    IV. Corrections due to variations of temperature in the
             aSeS.
      W. Diºment of the         luminous point.
      I. Variations in Electromagnetic Intensity.—We have
already stated that the heating of the conductors during the
passage of the electric current and the operation of the pile
gave rise to a regular variation in the electromagnetic inten
sity, and that the intensity of the induced current, which is
in proportion to that of the principal electric current, was
measured repeatedly.         The numbers obtained enabled the
observed results to be reduced by a simple proportion to what
they would be if the intensity remained constant.          The accu
racy of these numbers will therefore depend on the precision
with which the intensities are measured. We made use of a
sine-compass placed at 10:50 metres from the middle of the
large solenoid in the apparatus.         At this distance the mag
netic influence on the compass was still sensible, and deflected
 the needle about 10, either to the right or left, according to
 the direction of the current in the bobbins.            In order to
 eliminate this    disturbing  element,  each determination of the
 intensity consisted of two successive measurements, made b
 reversing the direction of the electric current in the bobbins;
 and the average of the two deviations obtained was taken as
 the definitive measurement.
      During the course of a series of observations      these deter
 minations were repeated very frequently, every ten or fifteen
 minutes; and it is certain that, for the measurements included
 in these intervals of time, the numbers obtained by interpola
  tion gave the intensity of the current with a precision equal
  to that of direct determinations.
      The deviations of the compass varied between 25° and 22°;
  the total variation from morning to evening for the same
 series scarcely amounted to 2°.        All the results were reduced
 to what they would have been if the deviation had been con
 stantly 24°. The error in the measurements of the angles
 did not exceed 1'; so that, with respect to the intensities, the
 error could not amount to 0-001 of their value. This accuracy

 396            M. H. Becquerel's Experimental Investigations
is greater than that of the numbers obtained for the magnetic
rotations of the gases.
    II. Want of Homogeneity in the Luminous Source.—A
shaded polariscope, formed of a divided nicol, such as the one
employed by us, might be used for studying light of any
colour whatever, provided that the luminous rays of different
wave-lengths experienced the same action.                              the                tº.               in
fluence of      magnetism,      on the    contrary,    the  planes   of polari
zation of the different       rays   are   unequally    deflected,   the image
from the      polariscope   is  tinged    with various   colours,   and before
any measurements are possible it is necessary to make use of
a monochromatic source of light.                   On the other hand, our
apparatus needed an extremely brilliant source of light, on
account of the very long distance generally traversed by the
luminous rays before reaching the eye : the passage through
the glasses and the successive reflections are                                         byall
                                                                causes      loss                       of
 of  light; and equality              tint     of
                                                obtained  is    almost extin

only a narrow portion of the spectrum to pass, is placed be
tween the source of light and the polariscope.
   In this point of view, the want of homogeneity in the
source of light causes only a slight perturbation in the appre
ciation of the equality of tint of the two halves of the image;
nevertheless an imperfect knowledge of the wave-length of
the luminous rays which reach the eye causes a serious un
certainty, which it is most desirable to obviate.
   In fact, it usually happens, as will be shown later, that the
magnetic rotations of the planes of polarization of luminous
rays of different wave-lengths traversing a gaseous column,
are very nearly in the inverse ratio of the squares of their
wave-lengths. The slightest variation, then, in the nature of
the rays, of which the equality of tint is being estimated,
modifies the size of the corresponding magnetic rotation very
considerably ; and our apparatus was sufficiently sensitive to
demonstrate these variations.
   A little difference in the pressure of the oxygen in the
blowpipe causes a variation in the temperature of the incan
descent lime, and consequently in the quality of the light
emitted; for the higher the temperature the richer the light
becomes in refrangible rays. At each passage through the
glasses, and at each reflection on the mirrors, a small quantity
of light is lost; so that the colour of                   all

  In order to measure the rotation of the plane of polarization
of light, other methods might be employed, by which the
wave-length of the light under measurement would be very
accurately ascertained; but, as                          I
                                            have already remarked in
the memoir above        quoted,   these methods do not admit of the
same sensibility as the shaded polariscope when the rotations
to be measured are very small. In the present researches                                             I
propose to determine, at the same time, the magnetic rotations
of various gases with luminous rays having the same wave
length, and to compare amongst themselves the magnetic
rotatory powers of the same body with luminous rays having
different wave-lengths. It has just been shown that the two
studies should be pursued side by side.
    I made use of the light of incandescent lime seen either
directly or through coloured screens, which were                                    :-

 between the lines        and   E      the solar spectrum.

 0.50 metre          of

    These results correspond           the light received after

     The following Table contains the results obtained.                           In order
 to facilitate the comparisons, the numbers observed were re
 duced to what they would be with the intensity of the electric
 current which           I  employed as unity throughout the work; but
 as   they    arise from more considerable rotations, their precision
 is    greater.      The results are given to the hundredths of a
 minute; at best the tenths of a minute can be relied on. In
 this Table       I    have been obliged to make some corrections,
 which will be justified later—in particular the action of mag
 netism on the column of air subjected to the action of the
 electromagnetic coil, and the influence -exerted by the latter
     #.
 on the glass of the nearest mirror.
                  as the law of dispersion of the planes of polari
  zation of the various coloured rays is ascertained for the

these observations   are obviously the same as those with the
carbon  bisulphide.    The composition of the light from the
different images  reflected varies little when coloured screens
are used; but with the light seen directly without screens the

     III. Magnetic Rotations caused by the Glasses interposed in
 the Path of the Luminous Rays.-I have already mentioned
 that, in consequence of the exigencies of construction, the
 luminous rays had to pass through rather considerable masses
 of glass, subjected to an extremely weak electro-magnetic
 action. Nevertheless the rotatory power of solids is so great,
 compared with that of gases, that the rotations produced by
 these masses of glass are of the same order of magnitude as
 the phenomena to be measured.
    A very simple means of determining
                                                                          in all                         to at

 air, the glasses support pressure  a        about       kilog. now

the   rotatory  power          of

 support, the glasses present phenomena             elliptical polariza

402         M. H. Becquerel's Experimental Investigations
tain in the tube gases containing only a few hundredths of
impurities, of which, however, an account is kept. Under
these conditions it is certain that the glasses do not occasion
any sensible phenomena of elliptical polarization which can
confuse the measurements.             For instance,            I
                                                          placed in the
immediate vicinity of the polariscope a small tube of sugar
and water, giving a rotation of 55' for yellow light; and
on measuring this rotation by means of the fourth reflected
image, it was found to have exactly the same rotation, 55.
The rays had then traversed forty surfaces of glass.
    It must, however, be remarked that when the tube is very
hot the circumference of the glasses becomes unequally heated,
and they present slight and momentary indications of strain.
The glasses can be set so as to counteract the effects pro
duced ; but it is better to conduct the experiments in such a
way as to avoid these perturbations, and to reject the obser
vations which there is reason to believe are affected by this
cause of error.       In order to ascertain the influence of the
glasses, the magnetic rotation through the tube full of air
was measured ; then the glasses were unscrewed, and the new
rotations obtained measured ; the difference between the two
gives the action of the glasses.        But this difference itself de
pends upon very small numbers; and it becomes of conse
quence to try, by special measurements,              the value of this
                                or at all
correction, since it affects

netic intensities inside the first           and      at atdistance from
it.    For the glasses whose centre              is   about 0.14 metre
from the exterior surface        of  the coils, the ratio        the magof
netic intensity experienced has been found                equal 0:067

that inside the coil.
  A    heavy piece   of   glass placed inside the first coil gave for
the   yellow   lighta   rotation     106.10; and
                                    of                   the place

 glasses    inthe tube  it  gave  7-1. The ratio           the two rota

tions  is  also 0-067.  I   adopted this number, and thus, knowing
the magnetic rotations         of  the glasses inside the first coil
 (p. 399), was able       to   deduce from them the corrections
 sought for with the different colours and different images.
      o this correction   a  second but less important one must                   be
added.       It  has been seen that both before and after the
successive reflections, the luminous rays pass through the
mirrors themselves.         These are made        St.-Gobain glass, and
                                                 of

are   subjected    has been found        equal
                                            to   0:026      that existing
                                                                   of

thickness of the glasses and mirrors, it is clear that, in order
to ascertain the magnetic rotation to which they give rise,
the number obtained for the glasses inside the tube must be
multiplied by 0.040.

     These numbers are obtained from a large number of obser
 vations; although the tenths of a minute may be relied on,
 the hundredths are given as they resulted from the calcu
 lations. In concluding the examination of this question,                           I
 may remark that, the rotations to be measured in the gases
 being very small, all secondary considerations had to be
 sacrificed to perfection in the arrangement of the optical
 system, without which perfection the measurements would
  have been impossible.
     IV. Correction for the Temperature.—I stated above that, in

  404       M. H. Becquerel's Experimental Investigations
  consequence of the passage of the electric current through
  the coils, the temperature of the tube rose rapidly to 30° or
  40°C.      It was therefore very important to ascertain the
  average temperature of the gases in each series of experi
  ments.
     To do this    I  measured  the temperature   of the copper by
  means     of contact—thermometers.      Moreover the tube itself
  acted as a gas-thermometer; it was in constant connexion
  with a mercurial manometer which, when the atmospheric
 pressure was ascertained, gave at every moment the pres
  sure of the gas inside the tube.        The temperature deduced
  from observations of the      pressure   was always the same as
 that    given  by  the thermometers.     The comparison of these
 temperatures enabled us to discover when there were leakages
 of gas in the tube.                    -
       n order to admit of comparison, the results observed had
 to be reduced to the same pressure of 760 millim. of mercury
 and to the same density.      The correction relative to the pres
 sure and to the     density might amount to 0-10 of the value of
 the numbers found experimentally.
     I  have assumed that the magnetic rotatory power of the
 gases studied between 0° and 40° varied proportionately to the
 density, or in the inverse ratio of the modulus of dilatation
 (1+ at). The probable existence of a slight variation with
 the temperature in the molecular rotatory power of the gas
 has been thus neglected ; but it may be remarked that if this
 variation is of the same order of dimension for gases as for
 other substances it must escape our measurements; for it is of
 the order of the errors of observation.      The agreement of the
 results obtained at different temperatures seems to justify this
 hypothesis. Concerning the numbers given below, it may be
 stated that they were obtained at a temperature of between
 10° and 40°, and that the different gases were reduced to a
 uniform pressure and volume by multiplying the numbers
 obtained    by the factor
                             <U+017F>º (1+ at), H being    the pressure  of
 the gases, t their temperature,    and a their coefficient of dila
 tation.                                       -
     W. Displacement of the Luminous Point.—The luminous
point does not invariably occupy a fixed position. Although
the blowpipe is fixed to the polariscope, it happens that the
luminous point rises or falls on the piece of lime according
to the greater or less pressure of the oxygen which feeds the
combustion. The lime itself becomes slightly hollow; and on
this account the incandescent region is displaced.
    These slight displacements of the luminous point cause

                                                                  º

      corresponding variations in the                 of polarization of the
      different images; and if a sudden displacement occurred
      during the progress of a measurement, the latter would be
      erroneous.       In order to guard against these variations, a
      large number of consecutive measurements were made by
...   alternating the direction                of
                                         the electric current       the coils.                  in

be the magnetic rotation for a given gas, submitted to the

wave-length of the luminous rays to which the observations
are being directed, let p be the rotation which is to be mea

     Strictly speaking, then, in a single determination it would
 be possible to commit an error which would vary between
 the third and the tenth of the rotation, according to magnitude
 of the rotation.
    These numbers are far from giving the precision which
  may be attained by increasing                     É.
                                               observations.    For ex
 ample, we made on the two gases that we have just cited about
 a hundred and fifty measurements, which mutually tested each
  other, and enabled us to see which observations were too                                 in
 exact and ought to be rejected.
     Not being able to determine separately the value of the
  most important causes of error, we attempted to make the
|. recision of each series evident by means of the greater or
       agreement in the measurements.                Suppose that the
 average of the numbers for a series of observations is the true
 value of the rotation sought; the individual measurements
 can then be compared with this average, and the positive or
 negative deviations calculated in each case. Giving the same
 sign to   all   of them, and taking the average,           number will

      Oxygen.—The oxygen was prepared by mixing chlorate of
  potash with a little binoxide of manganese.                  The greatest care
  was taken to purify the gas from the chlorine always contained
  in it: this was done by passing it several times very slowly
  through a solution of potash, and then over pumice moistened
  with a concentrated solution of potash.                The gas was dried by
  passing over fragments of pumice moistened with sulphuric
  acid and then over calcium chloride.
      In this way several hundreds of litres of gas were prepared
         ...
  in bags which had been used for some time; and the oxygen
  Was
  more      through
                   introduced into the tube by causing it to pass once
                        the series of purifying and drying tubes.               The
  oxygen displaced the air, so that eventually the tube was filled
  with a mixture containing only a few hundredths of impuri
  ties. Several methods were employed for analyzing the oxygen,
  hydrochloric acid and copper being principally used. In this
  way we obtained for the mixture studied as below:—
         n the 27th of February, 1880, out of 134 vol. of gas, 3.5
  vol. of residuum, which we may admit to be nitrogen (say
  0.9739 of oxygen and 0.0261 of nitrogen). After having made
  the determinations with this gas, a fresh analysis, made on the
  3rd of March, yielded out of 121 vol., a residue of 34 vol.
  .
  (say 0-972 of oxygen and 0.028 of nitrogen).
      }. is to be noted that, between the two series of experi
  ments, a fresh quantity of gas was passed into the tube.                         It
  may be admitted that we had an average of 0.973 of oxygen
          0.027 of nitrogen.           The following numbers were ob

sented anomalies upon which     shall dwell presently.   I

made a further series of observations with this   gas, some at
the beginning of the experiments in 1879, others at the end
of January 1880, and, finally, the determinations which                                                      I
have    just recorded.
   The latter correspond to a purer gaseous mixture than the
previous series.   I judged it useless to reproduce the numbers
relative to the former series; they, however, completely con
firmed those just given.
   Nitrogen.—The nitrogen was prepared by passing air very
slowly through two tubes, 0:50 metre long, filled with copper
turnings, heated to a red heat in porcelain tubes. The gas was
received in a large gasometer, and afterwards made to pass,
after drying, into the tube previously full of air.
   The gaseous mixture was analyzed by means of cold phos
phorus; and out of 150 vol. of gas a residuum of 136-5 was
produced. The following are the results obtained:—
                            Nitrogen, 0.91 +0.090 Oxygen.

This number agrees sufficiently well with the direct determi
nations; for we cannot count on a greater precision.
    Nitrogen Monocide.—Nitrogen monoxide was prepared by
the decomposition of ammonium nitrate, and collected over
water saturated with this gas.          It was subsequently passed into
the tube, which was then full of a mixture of 0.70 of oxygen
and 0.30 of nitrogen.
   The gas was analyzed by absorbing it by water; in this ana
lysis account must be taken of the air dissolved in the water,
and which is evolved on the solution of the gas which is more
soluble.      In this way we obtained for the mixture:–
                Nitrogen monoxide............              0-691

Cold phosphorus was employed for the analysis of the mix
ture not absorbed by the water.
    The gas, as we see, was very impure; and this disadvantage
must be attributed to the air dissolved in the water of the
gasometer, and which was evolved, either by a partial vacuum
being produced in the upper part of the gasometer, or by the
solution of nitrogen monoxide in the water.
    The following numbers were obtained for the preceding
mixture:–

    Carbonic Acid.--The carbon dioxide was prepared by the
action of hydrochloric acid on white marble. A current of
this gas, previously dried, was passed for a very long time into
the tube, which contained at the time the mixture of nitrogen
monoxide, oxygen, and nitrogen above mentioned.
   This gas was analyzed by absorbing it by water; and out of
154 vol. of gas         I found a residuum of 3 vol. (say 0.0195 of
impurities and 0.9805 of carbonic acid). This gas may be
considered pure; and the numbers obtained can only admit
an inappreciable correction; for it happens that the carbonic
acid has very nearly the same magnetic rotatory power as the
mixture which constitutes the 0-019 of impurities.                       The results
obtained are given in the following table:—

    Sulphurous Acid.—This gas was prepared by the volatiliza
tion of liquefied anhydrous sulphurous acid, for which                        I  am
indebted to the kindness of M. Raoul Pictet.                     The     gas   thus
obtained was perfectly dry.              It was introduced into the tube
which contained dry air.
    In order to analyze this gas, it was, on issuing from the
tube, received in small glass tubes which were hermetically
closed; subsequently one of the ends of these tubes was broken
over boiled water containing potash, and the gas was analyzed
by absorption. By exactly gauging the volume of the small
tube as well as the volume of the gaseous residuum not ab
 sorbed by the potash, it was ascertained that the mixture
 enclosed in the tube contained 0.984 of sulphurous acid and
                                                   .º *

   By taking into account the 0-016 of air in the gaseous mix
ture, we may calculate by means of the preceding numbers
the rotations that we should have with the gas absolutely pure.
We should find thus:—

   Olefiant Gas.-A preliminary series of experiments per
formed upon a mixture of 0.72 of olefiant gas and 0:27 of
carbonic acid, proved that this body was endowed with a rela
tively great magnetic rotatory power; and we took extreme
precautions to obtain in the tube gas in              purest possible         its
condition.    More than 300 litres       olefiant   gas      of

    In   this analysis account must be taken of a small quantity
of air that may        be introduced by the chlorine, as well as of the
air which is evolved from the liquid by absorbing the chlorine
through the potash.
    From careful experiments              I   found, before commencing
the first series recorded         below,   that the gas contained 0-044
of air. In the interval between the first and second series,
the tube being very hot, a little gas was lost by the closing of
the glasses.         At the end of the second series two closely
agreeing analyses gave 0.061 of impurities. It may be assumed
that we had on an average a mixture containing 0.95 of olefiant
gas and 0.05 of air.
     A great number of measurements for the different images
and colours were made with this body, because the rotations,
 relatively great, were to serve as verification of our experi
mental method.
    A direct determination made with the yellow light of soda
 gave, for the first image, a number very close to those which
would be deduced from the rotation obtained with the fourth
white image. There is no use in giving this number, because,
on account of the feeble intensity of the light, it was not pos
sible to ensure the same precision as in the case of the other
measurements.
    We subjoin the results of our measurements with olefiant gas.

                 Discussion of THE RESULTs obTAINED.
           I.     Verifications          of   the Method        of Observation.
   The principle of the method employed by me in this work
consisted,  as we have seen above, in amplifying the pheno
menon   by   causing the luminous rays to pass several times
through the tube full of gas.   It is evident that the numbers
obtained for each reflected image must be proportionate to the
number of passages made by the luminous rays through the
apparatus.    These numbers should therefore mutually test
each  other;  and by dividing them by 3, 5, 7, and 9 we ought
to obtain numbers which would represent the magnetic rota
tion corresponding to a single passage through the tube.
With the same luminous source and the same coloured screen
these numbers should be constant; but we have seen above
that the composition of the light which reaches the eye in
order to form the different images varies with them; we
ought, then, to find numbers regularly varying with the order
of the images.
   Strictly speaking,           all
                             the measurements ought             effected    to    be
at the distance which       separates  the   mirrors;  and when any
other  gas   than air        question,

         inside the first coil, especially with the white light.
  or example, if the rotations are compared with that which is
deduced from the fourth image, we shall find that the rota

    It  has been shown that the luminous rays studied had not
in each case the same wave-length, but that their average
wave-length could be deduced from the magnetic rotation of
the carbon bisulphide.
    As the phenomenon has been exhaustively studied with
regard to liquid bodies, such as carbon bisulphide, we can
limit ourselves to comparing the relations of the magnetic
rotations for the same colours with this body and with the
different gases studied.                  The St.-Gobain glass, which has
been made the object of special determinations in this memoir,
can also serve for comparison.
    By taking the average of the results obtained with each of
the coloured screens employed, the results indicated in the
 following table were obtained; the unit to which the rotations
 for each substance were referred was the rotation obtained
 with the yellow light D, or the rotation deduced from the
fourth white image.

     We   see, first of all, that the statements of the rotations for two
  self-colours are nearly the same for liquids, gases, and solids.
  Oxygen, to which we shall return later, must be excepted.
  If  the numbers contained in the summary (pp. 422,423) be
  compared with those which were obtained by the glasses of
  the tube, it will be found that the numbers relative to the
   lasses of the tube are very nearly ten times those obtained
  #. the air, and that in the two tables the same figures are
  sometimes reproduced for the same colours.                           I  would again
  refer to the comparison made between the numbers obtained
  with the different white images.
     These considerations enable us to see that the precision of

426         M. H. Becquerel's Experimental Investigations
the measurements can be carried very far, since it enables
the variations in coloration of the successive images to be
 followed with gases as well as with a mass of glass.            The
average wave-length of the luminous pencil can then be ap
proximately determined in each case and compared with the
rotations obtained.      The most simple means consists in making
a graphical representation.
      f the numbers inversely proportional to the squares of the
wave-lengths distinguishing each image be taken as the
abscissae, and the magnetic rotations observed for the ordi
nates, we see that the typical points of the determinations
relative to the same substance approach very closely to a right
angle passing by the origin of the coordinates, which proves
that the rotations are very nearly in the inverse ratio of the
square of the wave-lengths, as may be verified by reference
to the preceding table.
    The numbers produced by the different images with different
colours may each serve for the determination of an average
right angle which, within the limits of the observations, repre
sents the phenomenon with sufficient precision.
    Briefly summarizing, we see that, for five of the gases
studied, the magnetic rotation of the planes of polarization of
luminous rays having different wave-lengths is very nearly in
the inverse ratio of the squares of the wave-lengths of these
rays.      The slight value of the rotations observed did not
allow me to ascertain whether these gases, like solids and
liquids, diverge a little from this simple law in proportion as
the rays become more refrangible.
    The nitrous oxide gives a rather less deviation than the
other gases. We may remark that, in order to make the
numbers agree with those given by the other bodies, it would
suffice to multiply the results by 1:05; and as this ratio 1.05
is exactly the ratio of the rays of white light to the rays of
yellow light, we may conclude that the inequality is due to
an increase of brilliancy in the luminous source at the moment
of the experiment with the white light. This explanation
appeared to me to be admissible; but if such were not the
cause of the divergence observed, we may associate this fact
                                                I
with that presented by oxygen, and which will now discuss.
    Oxygen showed a remarkable anomaly. Previously, while
studying the magnetic rotatory powers of various bodies with
                     I
the yellow light, had discovered that the presence of oxygen
in a combination tended to diminish the rotatory power of the
compound.       I  now find that gaseous oxygen has a feeble posi
tive   magnetic   rotatory power, and that, in addition, it does not
disperse the planes of polarization of rays of different colours
as the other gases do.     The numbers which relate to this body

              on Magnetic Rotatory Polarization in Gases.                                          427
are very small, and the precision of the observations is much
less than for the other gases.   It is noticeable that this want
of precision was characteristic of the experiments made with
oxygen—although                 I
                      always took the measurements with the
same care, and although                       I
                            studied this gas several times at
different periods during  our series of experiments.         the                              If
numbers found directly for the various colours be not cor
rected by the rotation of the glasses, it will be seen that they
are very nearly equal to each other. In order to prove this
       I
fact, took the precaution of making a large number of series,
operating alternately with red and green rays; and                 always                 I
found that the rotations were        essentially  the same.
    Now, as the magnetic rotation due to the glasses is greater
for the green rays than for the red rays, we should conclude
from this that the oxygen would deflect the plane of polariza
tion of the green rays less than that of the red rays, in oppo
sition to the other gases studied up to this time. This body
presents, then, a most curious exception; and it would be very
important to establish this fact irrefragably.             The numbers
       I
that obtained       do  not  as yet  allow  of     but             it;

               phide for the Yellow Rays of Soda.
   The relation above established between the magnetic rota
tions of the planes of polarization of rays of different colours
and the wave-length of the corresponding light, enables us to
determine the magnetic rotation relative to the yellow light of
soda which corresponds to the rays D in the solar spectrum.
In order to effect this determination, use may be made of                             all
the numbers obtained for the different colours, either     means            by

   These numbers correspond to a single passage of the lumi
nous rays through the tube; we see with what precision they
mutually test each other. By dividing these numbers by the
rotation obtained for carbon bisulphide under the same condi
tions, and which was found to be equal to 4520', the following

   In the course of the experiments an occasion offered of veri
fying the preceding numbers.
   We have seen how the determination of the magnetic rota
tion of the glasses in the tube inside the first coil was effected.
This rotation may be compared with that of the gases. Now
it happens that for air the comparison is immediate ; the rota
tion of the glasses (say 1 centim. of crown glass) is equal
to ten times the rotation of 3 metres of air (say to 3000 cen
tim. of air submitted to the same magnetic influence). The
relation of the rotations is then
                                       1     –a.
                                             =0.00033.
                                    3000
Now in my former researches I found that the magnetic rota
tory power of crown glass for the yellow light was 0.48 of
that of carbon bisulphide.     By adopting this number, which
is independent    of our present experiments, we should find for
the  rotatory  power  of air 0.000158".
   * Since the time when I began these researches, MM. Kundt and
Röntgen have published        numbers relative to several gases.    The only
ones common to our researches are oxygen and air.              The numbers
given by these authors in their first memoir (Wiedemann's Annalen,
t. viii. p. 278) are too large, because they have compared the rotations
obtained directly with white light for gases, and with yellow light D for
carbon bisulphide.                                                    I
                       For oxygen the number that find is identical with
that which they have given for high pressures. The agreement                                 is,   no
doubt, owing       the fact that oxygen has
                   to                                        no

was of the greatest importance to prove whether such a relation
still existed in the gaseous state; and                         I
                                            took the opportunity of

for the yellow light of soda, it is seen that the rotations increase
 regularly with the indices of refraction.      In the table which

   In   order to make a comparison between the numbers in the
 given smaller numbers than those previously published; and the results at
 which they arrived do not agree any better with mine. The number that
 they            to air (0.000127) is identical with that which I had pre
viously published in a work on atmospheric polarization (Annales de
 Chimie et de Physique, t. xix.).                I
                                     observed at the time that this num

 first column and those in the third, we may construct a curve
by taking the indices as the abscissae and the rotations as the
ordinates: in this way a curve of great regularity is obtained,
whose form recalls that which we obtained under analogous
conditions with liquid and solid bodies (fig. 5).
    By seeking a simple function of the index, which varies
proportionately to the rotations observed, we easily see that
the ratios of the function (n-1)*, n being the index of re
fraction, follow very nearly those of the magnetic rotations.
These appear in columns 2 and 4 of the preceding table.
However, it does not seem that this formula is the complete
expression of the relation between the magnetic rotatory
powers of bodies and their indices of refraction. We had
already observed that it did not suffice for the various peculia
rities of the phenomenon in solids and liquids; and it is easy
to see that it does not account for the relation of the magnetic
rotatory powers of bodies in the liquid and gaseous conditions.
                                    I
    In my previous researches, had been led to adopt the ex
pression n°(n°–1) as approximately representing the state
ments of the magnetic rotatory powers of the various solid and
liquid bodies that had been studied.          I had discovered that
the relation of the magnetic rotation R to the function
n°(n°–1) varied very little when compared with the great
variations of the magnetic rotations of one body and another.
    The unit adopted was the magnetic rotation of liquid carbon
bisulphide;   and the values    of the expression    wº-1     (gene
rally about 0.25) varied between 0.10 and 0'50".               These
values are indicated in column 5 of the preceding table. The
numbers obtained are the same as for various solid and liquid
bodies.    Thus, although the magnetic rotations are 10,000
times smaller than in liquid bodies, the variations in the func
tion n°(n°–1) are always of the same relative order of size
as those of the magnetic rotations.
    It ought, however, to be observed that the numbers in the
fifth column of the preceding table increase regularly with the
indices of refraction, which tends to prove that the formula
n°(n°–1) is only an approximate expression of the pheno
menon, which answers sufficiently well for the properties of
non-magnetic solid and liquid bodies, but which might diverge
from experiment when the values of the index of refraction
became very small, as in the case of gases.
    The variations of the expression                  with gases do

not, however, exceed the limits of those which are presented by
solid and liquid bodies; and this study must be extended to a
                                     *
much greater number of gases before we are able to decide
whether these variations are not simply characteristics of the
physical and chemical constitution of gases, as we have dis
covered in regard to other substances.
   Some interesting remarks may be made on this subject.
The numbers given above enable us to compare the magnetic
rotatory powers of gaseous                acid with that which
it possesses in a liquid state. M. de la Rive found for liquid
sulphurous acid a magnetic rotatory power variable with the
temperature, and which at about 12° is nearly 0.382.        But
the index of refraction of this body has not been accurately
measured.
                                    ñº.
              Faraday merely says that the index is the same
as that of water ; on this             we should find that the
ratio
           wº-        is 0.277—that is to say, exactly the half                     of
the number found with the gaseous body.                 Is this statement
a mere conjecture, or is it the expression              of a more general
fact? K
     An analogous result is observed on comparing with the
number obtained for  oxygen   the numbers given by certain
highly oxygenated liquids, such as nitric and sulphuric acids,
&c.                  is about 0:11 for these bodies, while it is 0.27
        nº(nº-1)
with gaseous oxygen.      Finally, we may connect with these
facts an observation relative to various salts (chloride of so
dium and chloride of potassium) endowed with a positive
rotatory power. Their magnetic rotatory power is less in a
crystalline condition than in solution.
   These various remarks would then tend to show that the
positive rotatory power of a body is so much the greater in
relation to    its
               index       of
                         refraction      the particles

      GENTLEMEN,
IN      your November number, in a paper by Professor S. P.
       Thompson on Binaural Audition, there occur some refer
ences to my recent work.            While it is gratifying that the
work should have attracted Prof. Thompson's attention, it is
rather disheartening to find that he has failed for the most
part to grasp            its
                    purport.      am obliged  I     him for his remarks,to

beats are objective; they can be seen in a manometric flame

my exposition of the existence in air of the Smith's beats, or
variations of resultant displacements, and demonstration by
difference of properties that they are not the same as the beats
we hear, is               all

see             the manometric flame, are given                                by

         the reflecting stereoscope     means of which slightly
dissimilar pictures of the same         could be
viewed in such a manner as to produce the illusion of bin
ocular relief. The essential object attained by using this
instrument he expresses by sayingf, “the two pictures (or
rather their reflected images) are placed in it at            i.
                                                       true con
course of the optic axes.” The apparent distance of the com
bined image is thus determined by the intersection of these
axes.   In a subsequent papers, published in 1852, Wheatstone
described a number of experiments with his stereoscope, by
which he had investigated the effect of varying the conver
gence of visual lines. The result he expressed by saying|,
“The perceived magnitude of an object diminishes as the incli
nation of the axes becomes greater while the distance remains
the same; and it increases, when the inclination of the axes
remains the same while the distance diminishes.”       In a sub
sequent paragraph, however, speaking of the change in appa
rent magnitude of the image produced by varying the optic
angle, he says", “and yet, if we attentively             ºf
                                                      it in an
fixed position, it is perceived to be at a different distance.”
That Wheatstone had not given up the idea of apparent dis
tance expressed in his first paper, however, is shown by his
subjoining” a table of inclinations of the optic axes which cor
respond to different distances; it also shows the angular posi
tions of the camera required to obtain binocular pictures

which shall appear at a given distance in the stereoscope in
their true relief.” This table is constructed from the following
formula” (“a denoting the distance between the two eyes,
and 6 the inclination of the optic axes”):—
                                        D=}       a cot $6.
   From this formula it is obvious that if the axes become
W.       D becomes infinite; if divergent, D becomes negative.
 Wheatstone makes no reference to the attainment of optic
divergence; but his stereoscope was constructed in such man
ner that the visual lines might be made parallel. Of the
images thus produced he notes as a peculiarityf, “although
the optic axes are parallel, or nearly so, the image does not
appear to be referred to the distance we should, from this cir
cumstance, suppose it to be, but it is perceived to be much
nearer.”
    These apparently contradictory statements of Wheatstone
show how difficult it is to interpret our sensations when the
conditions attendant upon normal vision are disturbed. Wheat
stone notices the distortion of perspective produced by making
the angle between the camera axes different from that between

connexion he does not mention any apparent change in dis
tance of the picture as a whole.
    In 1844, Sir David Brewster published a paper: “On the
Knowledge of Distance given by Binocular Vision,” in which
he elaborated the idea that apparent distance is determined by
intersection of visual lines,                              geometric
discussion of the     subject, and  describing   many   experiments

    I have had access, where a diagram is employed in tracing the
    course of rays entering the eyes.   That it is misleading and
    should be abandoned, is shown by the fact that the perception:
    of binocular relief and the judgment of apparent                  in
    the  stereoscope  are easy  when conditions are such as to make
    the visual lines slightly divergent.                    If
                                              their intersection deter
    mines the point of sight, this would then be behind the ob
\   server's head.    In taking the pictures composing the stereo
    graph, each point in the field of view is at the intersection of
    a pair of secondary camera axes; and thus far, but no further,
       heatstone's formula is strictly applicable.     No diagram can
    give more than an approximation to the truth when the pic
    tures are viewed in the stereoscope; and not one hitherto pub
    lished has exhibited any provision for the possibility of optic
    divergence.          I
                      have elsewhere” shown how such a diagram
    may be constructed by application of Hering's theory of a
    binocular eye (ail de cyclope imaginaire)f, assuming that we
    know the angle of convergence between the camera axes for
    a given point in the field of view.
        The fact that optic divergence is possible with distinct bin
    ocular fusion of retinal images is not new.      The use of prisms
    for  testing  the rectus muscles of the   eyeballs  has long been
    known; and Helmholtz not only mentions the use of stereo
    graphs for the same purpose, but observes the increase in ap
    parent distance of the point of sight when divergence of
    visual lines is inducedf.      No analysis of the visual pheno
    mena seems to have been      made,  however; and their important
    bearing upon the theory of stereoscopic perspective seems to
     have escaped notice.     Helmholtz says $ in regard to such illu
    sions of sight,          “If
                          these images are such as could not be pro
    duced by any normal kind of observation, we judge them
    according to their nearest resemblance;” but comparison is
     scarcely satisfactory if direct analysis is possible.
         Ihave examined many stereoscopes and stereographs in
    testing Brewster's theory        and have found that optic diver

              Brewster's Theory of Binocular Perspective.                                      439
corresponding points on the stereograph. The relative posi
tions of the different parts of the externally projected binocular
image is determined mainly by the stereoscopic displacement
in the pair of pictures viewed. This in turn is determined
by the degree of convergence of the camera axes; while the
relation between the visual lines of the observer in the stereo
scope may be either convergence, parallelism, or divergence.
 It is not, however, a matter of indifference which of these
     j
relations is assumed.      Theoretically the visual lines should
meet at an   angle  the same as that between the camera axes,
 when a given point is examined; practically this is rarely ever
 the case. The distance between corresponding stereograph
points is adjusted to secure, if possible, comfort to an average
pair of eyes in viewing the picture; and the same stereograph
may necessitate convergence of visual lines for one observer,
 divergence for another, in order that binocular fusion be
                                                                                   jiàº.

    In studying the effect of varying the optic angle while a
given stereograph is examined, have found a              I      of
 Wheatstone's   reflecting  stereoscope to be valuable.  The arms
 were made to glide under a divided circle in such manner that,
 from a given point on either of the conjugate pictures, the angle
 of           at the surface of each mirror could be varied from
                                   is its
0° to 60°. When             value      45° the visual lines must

    The optic vertex is simply Brewster's “binocular centre.”
 In normal binocular vision of near objects, the distance of the
 point of sight is sufficiently nearly given by this formula,
 while the subjective effect is that of the superposition of the
                               º
 two retinal images in a central binocular (cyclopean) eye",
 the two visual axes being combined into a single median line,
 along which distance is estimated.     These lines in turn have
 no objective existence; and their intersection really cannot
determine any external point. Any effect due to axial con
vergence is merely the interpretation which experience has
taught the observer to put upon the sensation of muscular
tension, as the internal rectus muscles contract. This inter
pretation may be                   or antagonized by what other
conditions suggest; and the estimate of distance on the com
bined median line is modified accordingly. The direction of
the combined image is along this median, whether the visual
axes be convergent, parallel, or divergent.

of sight than is suggested by the tension of the rectus muscles;
and there   is partial dissociation between actions generally
associated.   Finally, the visual angle has remained constant;
and this tends to produce the idea of constancy in distance.
Of the three elements, however, the first is found most impor
tant; and the combined effect is that the image appears 18 or
20 centim. distant, the judgment being quite uncertain. The
apparent area and depth of the external image are diminished
approximately in the ratio of the diminished distance.
    et the arms of the stereoscope be now pushed back till
a=–5°. Relaxation of the internal rectus and contraction
of the external rectus muscles is habitually associated with
recession of the point of sight; and in this case it is carried
beyond the limit of axial parallelism.     But, again, the focal
adjustment is for a point only 50 centim. in front; and the
visual angle is constant. Of the three elements the last is
now most important; and the combined effect is that the image
appears about 60 or 70 centim. distant, with corresponding
increase in apparent area and depth.

centim.   is  then impossible.       For negative values focalization
is   comparatively easy; but beyond —6° the unaccustomed
strain upon the external rectus muscles produces unsteadiness
of  vision. As limits, therefore, —5° and +45° were selected.

the lower pair are seen, by axial convergence, as a truncated

    In the course of these experiments, extending over many
months, it has been found that, although the coordination of
muscular actions in the eyes is commonly directed only to the
attainment of perfect vision, their dissociation is largely under
the control of the will. Not only is it possible               to
diverge the visual lines without employing any external
points of fixation, but              I
                            find it not difficult to contract the
ciliary muscle strongly, thereby destroying the distinctness of
distant vision, while the relation between the visual lines un
dergoes scarcely any noticeable variation.       Certain peculiar
visual effects result from this; but the discussion of them must
be reserved at present.

   The bare title of this book   by  no means does it justice.    It is
certainly not a heterogeneous collection of examples, were it nothing
more; but besides an excellent progressive arrangement and group
ing of exercises under the different sections of Analytical Geometry,
there are some most valuable hints for solving the difficult problems
interspersed among the answers, together with a number of figures.
As a supplement to the best and well-known modern treatises on
Coordinate Geometry, it will be useful to both beginners and more
advanced students.

            AN AMUSING EXPERIMENT WITH LIQUID FILMS.
                                 BY    J.   PLATEAU.
I    HAVE sought to derive a little amusement from thin liquid
     films.     I
                have had constructed of iron wire of about 0.5 millim.
thickness the outline of a flower with six petals of oval form; these
are each 24 millim. in length, and 19 millim. in their greatest
width.      The central ring, made of the same iron wire, to which
they are attached, has a diameter of 14 millim.; it is supported
beneath by a little fork, which is fastened to a thicker iron wire,
forming the stalk of the flower; this last is implanted in a small
board which serves as a support.          All the petals are in the same
plane; and when the board rests on the table the flower is hori
zontal.
    The whole contour of the flower was first slightly oxidized by
keeping it for a few moments in dilute nitric acid; then, after
             to it,
washing             was immersed horizontally
                      it                                the glycerine liquid,
                                                           in
but    only       very
                  a     little depth,       in
                                         order        to
                                                   avoid the formation     of
a  filmin    the fork;      was drawn out again, also horizontally, and
                            it
was then turned up and the board placed upon the table.                Finally
the whole was covered over with            glass bell,
                                                 a              to
                                                            shelter the films
from the slight agitations          the air. The apparatus was placed
                                   of
before a    window        that the sky was seen
                           so                              by
                                                         reflection from the
films.
I       thought that the petals would soon present uniform tints,
which would gradually change,               in
                                         accordance with the attenuation
of   the films; but         was not so.
                           it              During the first moments the
flower  of   course appeared colourless; then, upon each petal and
the central circle, shades        rose and green
                                  of                       of
                                                       the last orders were
seen  to   appear, which gave place         irregularly distributed bands
                                                 to
and spots presenting tints           higher orders. The appearance was
                                    of
then that     of   flower streaked with the most lively colours. These

were afterwards slowly modified; and ten hours after the forma
tion of the flower some small black spots were distinguished upon
the hetals. The observation had to be discontinued on account of
the lateness of the hour; and the next morning several of the
petals had burst.
   I   ought to mention that the glycerine liquid which was used for
this experiment was of very indifferent quality, perhaps because
the oleate employed was not prepared with the requisite care, or
because Price's glycerine is nowadays not so pure as it was for
merly.      But this may have been an advantage; for with an excel
lent liquid the modifications of the flower would have been too slow.
   If   after withdrawing the flower from the liquid, and while               the                              all

of their tints. The employment of a spectrophotometer permits
this difficulty to be surmounted.
   Let us suppose the simple radiations which constitute the light
 emanating from an electric regulator and that from a standard
 Carcel lamp spread out in two contiguous spectra. If the distances
 of the two sources from the photometer be such that their mean
 illumination is the same, the two spectra will be far from present
 ing the same aspect: that of the carbon points is more intense
 towards the violet extremity, and less luminous towards the red,
 than that of the lamp. The temperature of emission of the electric
 light being much higher than that of the lamp, the ratio of the
 intensities of the simple radiations of the electric light to the                                                   in
 tensities of the corresponding lights of the spectrum of the flame
 of the lamp, will with equality of mean illumination, be represented
 by a fraction greater than unity towards the violet; but if the red
 be approached, the ratio will gradually diminish, following the law
of continuity, and will be less than unity at the red end.
     There exists, then, a determinate simple radiation (whose wave
 length depends on the nature of the lights compared) for which that
ratio is exactly equal to unity. If this radiation be precisely known,

sible empirically to displace the second nicol (and thereby the two
bands) so as to preserve the maximum of intensity to the simple
radiation the comparison of which would give the same result as
that of the total intensity.      The neighbouring radiations are more
and more     rapidly weakened in proportion as their distance from this
maximum increases; and this circumstance diminishes the influence
of their differences of intensity (which increase with their distance
from the maximum) to such a degree as to render then negligible.
