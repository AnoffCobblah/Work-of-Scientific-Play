OU' knowledge upon this subject is chiefly derived from
       Graham’s classical researches. His first paper was
communicated to the Royal Society in 1849, and further
papers in 1850 and 1851.
   About the year 1855, Fickf, commenting upon these in
vestigations, remarked that it was a matter of regret that in
such an exceedingly valuable and extensive investigation the
development of a fundamental law for diffusion in a single
element of space was    £            which (he added) it was quite
natural to suppose would be identical with the law according
to which diffusion of heat takes place in a conducting body,
and upon which Fourier £ theory of heat, and Ohm
his theory of diffusion of electricity in conductors. Fick
endeavoured to supply this omission so far as common salt is
concerned, and Woit calculated the coefficient of diffusion of
sugar. Professor Mach, of Prague, has also worked with
these substances. Other experimenters have calculated the
coefficients of diffusion of salts, or, rather, of a limited number
of them, with not very concordant results, as may be seen b
consulting the tables of Schumeister attached to the article
“Heat,” by Sir W. Thomson, in the ninth edition of the
Encyclopædia Britannica, and comparing them with the results
of Beilstein, who employed Jolly's method, described in

 Watts's “Dictionary of Chemistry, vol. iii. p. 710. Graham,
 however, in his latest paper upon the subject, communicated
 to the Royal Society in 1861, described a method of experi
 ment which, to use his own words, affords a means of obtaining
 the absolute rate or velocity of diffusion. This he called “Jar
 diffusion,” the saline solution being delivered by a pipette to
 the bottom of a column of pure water 127 millim. high, stand
 ing in a cylindrical jar 87 millim. diameter, and the amount
 £        being ascertained by drawing off the liquid from the
 top in equal £ by a very fine syphon, the orifice of the
 short leg of which was kept close under the surface of the
 liquid being drawn off.
    Graham applied this method to a variety of organic com
 pounds, but only to hydrochloric acid, sulphate of magnesia,
and sulphates and chlorides of potassium and sodium amongst
 inorganic substances. He did not attempt the calculation of
 the coefficients of diffusibility in absolute measurements, but
remarked that the method is extremely simple, and gives results
of more precision than could have been possibly anticipated.
   I have recently made a considerable number of experiments
with this method; but in place of using jars of 87 millim. in
diameter I have employed glass cylinders of 36 millim. dia
meter, such as are used for “Nesslerizing,” and which are
very uniform in bore. The annexed Table shows the actual
amount of salt found in each section of the liquid after dif
fusion, expressed in millimetres; the quantity of salt in the
upper section being also calculated in percentages of that
particular section which at the commencement of the dif
fusion was the point of junction of the saline solution and the
pure water.
   The concentrated saline solution was introduced below the
pure water by a method slightly different to that of Graham ;
namely, a fine-bore syphon with contracted orifices was first
filled with water, the finger being placed so as to cover the
short end; the long end was thrust to the bottom of the water
in the diffusion-jar, and the short end was uncovered in a
vessel containing the saline solution at a higher level, and the
syphoning continued until the height of the liquid admitted
under the water in the diffusion-jar amounted to 50 millim.
   Many of the results agree with those of Graham, whilst
others are additions thereto, such as the diffusions of mercurous
nitrate, mercuric chloride, lithium sulphate, cadmium sul
phate, silver sulphate, manganese sulphate, nickel sulphate,
and lead nitrate.
   Moreover they are twenty-five diffusions conducted for
equal lengths of time, and under similar circumstances as to
temperature and methods of experimenting.

             Mr. J. J. Coleman on Liquid Diffusion.                      3
   Although from many points of view, and especially that of
the chemist, most valuable and important deductions can be
made from this class of experiments, some of which will be
referred to in a later part of this paper, it must be admitted
that, from the physicist’s point of view, all these experiments
are vitiated from the fact that the diffusions should commence
with the solid salt or the anhydrous acid or alkali, and end in
an atmosphere of pure water. With Graham’s earlier expe
riments a saline or acid solution, the strength of which was
gradually diminishing, was diffused into a weaker saline or
acid solution which was constantly increasing; and even with
his latest method of “Jar diffusion” it is practically impossible
to work with syphons in long columns of water such as are
necessary to get a pure water atmosphere above, the salt bein #
diffused. I have therefore turned my attention to improve
methods of working, and have devised apparatus, illustrated by
 Plate I. fig. 1". This apparatus allows of a very concentrated
solution of the substance under examination being admitted
at any desired rate of speed underneath a column of pure
water of any desired length, and, further, of the liquids being
drawn off in regulated quantities at the end of the time of
diffusion. No doubt, with solid crystalline salts, theory in
dicates that diffusion should commence from the salt; but
practice determines the fact that, with solid salts, air-bubbles
are a difficulty; and, moreover, there are a very large number
of salts that are not crystalline at all, and some that do not
exist in the solid state, such as MgCl2:
    Returning to the description of fig. 1, BB represents a
Mohr’s burette 500 millim. long and 15 millim. diameter
provided with a glass stopcock.
    The stopcock being closed, this burette is nearly filled with
 pure water, and is then connected by india-rubber tubing
 with an apparatus by means of which #. air above the water
 can be slightly rarefied, such as an air-pump or an aspirator,
 or, by what I find most convenient, an open glass tube CC
 standing in a jar of water. On opening the stopcock of the
 burette, about half its water escapes, say, to the level (a)
 (rarefying the air above), upon which a column of water
 rushes up the tube C C, say to w. The stopcock being now
 closed, the tube C C is raised and clipped in such a position
 that the column of water in the tube C C is much longer than
 the water-column in the burette, by which means the air above
 the water in the burette is sufficiently rarefied to admit of
 the concentrated saline or other solution being sucked up
    * A description of this apparatus and the principal results detailed in

underneath the water by cautiously opening the stopcock. A
column, say, 100 millim. deep can be drawn into the burette
under a depth of water of 200 millim., which latter can be
further added to by filling up the burette cautiously by a long
legged pipette discharged on a cork float. This, however, is
seldom necessary except with very diffusive substances, such
as hydrochloric acid, which barely reach a height of 200
millim. in 21 days. To prevent leakages, an indiarubber
cap is slipped over the point p of the burette. At the end of
the diffusion-time the   #       is very slowly run off until the
level where the water originally joined the saline solution is
reached, after which equally-measured sections are carefully
 removed and reserved for further examination, each section
 being, say, 25 millim. deep. The results are conveniently
 calculated in percentages upon the salt or other substance
 contained in the bottommost layer, where diffusion commenced.
 It was thought at first that some errors might arise from
 adherence # the saline solutions to the inside of the burette,
 down which the upper layers had to pass before estimation.
 This proved, however, not to be the case to any serious or
 appreciable extent. Most diffusions are carried on until at
 any rate 1 per cent. of the salt rises 50 millim.; and it was
 found that sulphuric acid of 1:2 specific gravity, admitted in
 the burette under water coloured blue with litmus and then
 withdrawn carefully, had so little effect on the water 25 mil
 lim, above that it came out of the stopcock barely reddened,
 and the water lying 50 millim. above the acid came out quite
 blue. Corroborative experiments were made with saturated
 cupric sulphate and ammonia as an indicator.
    £              acid being the most diffusive substance ex
 amined by Graham, comparative experiments were made with
 this compound at temperatures of 12°5 Centigrade, the
 results of which are shown in the curves, fig. 2.
    Fig. 3 shows in the form of curves the results of some
 comparative experiments made for a period of twenty days at
 a temperature of 12°5 C., with the following substances —
           Sulphuric acid containing 20 per cent. anhydride.

    These results are put forward merely as preliminary expe
 riments with a method which is rapid in execution and sus
 ceptible of great accuracy, and which it is hoped will afford
 or lead to the means of calculating the correct coefficient of
 diffusion of a large number of substances, Sir W. Thomson
 having kindly promised his assistance in any mathematical
 calculations necessary.
     From the chemist's point of view, several interesting con
 siderations arise from a review of experiments already made,
   articularly when taken in connection with Newland’s and
 '',              periodic law, which was not put forward until
 some time after the date of Graham's last paper.
     The periodic law classifies the elements into vertical groups
 of the type R2O, RO, &c., and into series usually known as
 horizontal series. Most of our recent textbooks quote the
  3rd series as typical; thus:—
                        Na.     Mg,      Al.    Si.       P.      S.         Cl.
    Atomic weight . 23           24     27.3    28        31     32         35.5
    Atomic volume . 24           14     10      11        14-5   16         27
     It will be observed here that whilst there is a comparatively
  small difference between the atomic weights commencing and
  ending the horizontal series, the atomic volume commences
  very high at the extreme left, gradually diminishes to less
  than one half in the middle, and ends very high again at the
  extreme right of the series. Diffusibility of the compounds
  of these elements varies in the same way; thus:—
                   Na.      Mg.       Al.     Si.      P.       S.        Cl.

The diffusion of chloric acid against sulphuric acid I had to
make specially"; the other figures are from the tables and
data before given, and the atomic volumes are quoted from
Ira Remsen's recent book, the ‘Principles of Theoretical
Chemistry.”
    Here then is evidence that, given a number of elements the
atomic weights of which do not differ widely, the diffusibility
will vary in some sort of proportion to the atomic or mole
cular volume, which latter, indeed, may be to some extent
regulated by the energy of the molecules.
    Mendelejeff's fourth horizontal series commences with K
and Ca, the molecular volumes and diffusibilities of the chlo
rides being thus:—
                                           K2Cl2.            CaCl2.

         Diffusibility .      . .      . . 41                  27
Here again diffusibility corresponds with the larger molecular
volume.
    The fifth series commences with copper and zinc, the mole
cular volume of the sulphates being exactly equal and the
diffusibility nearly equal.
    The sixth series commences with rubidium and strontium,
the metal rubidium possessing, with the exception of caesium,
the largest atomic volume of any metal yet discovered.
    Graham has already shown that chloride of strontium is
 much less diffusible than chloride of potassium. If, there
 fore, chloride of rubidium be as diffusible as chloride of potas
 sium, then the diffusibility of chloride of rubidium will be
 greater than that of chloride of strontium. This has been
 proved to be the case by the following diffusions I have
 recently made. Chloride of rubidium, chloride of potassium,
 and chloride of sodium were diffused for 10 days at 12°C. in
the apparatus figured on Plate I.

    It will be seen that rubidium chloride is quite as diffusive
as potassic chloride, a salt which has hitherto been the most
£ salt examined.                 This I anticipated from the large
atomic volume of the metal, which is very much greater than
even that of potassium ; but, on the other hand, its atomic
weight is greater.
    if a large molecular volume indicates a tendency to rapidity
of diffusion, it may be suspected that a large atomic or mole
cular weight has a tendency to retard it; this, however, is
not so easy to prove, from the extreme difficulty of gettin
groups of soluble compounds, the molecular volumes of £
are identical, but the molecular weights of which differ.
Moreover, it appears necessary to look for such groups in the
family groups of Mendelejeff's vertical series, or the isomor
phous groups of the older chemists. The sulphates of zinc
and magnesia are strictly isomorphous, and possess an identical
' volume, viz. 44 when anhydrous, their molecular
 weights being as 120 to 161.
    (£ not only in this case, but in several other cases of
isomorphous bodies, strove hard to prove that the rate of dif
fusion was identical, returning again and again to the subject,
on the last occasion making seventy-two experiments with
magnesic and zincic sulphates; which he sums up by stating
that the approach to equality becomes close in the 4-per-cent.
and larger portions of salt, but differed as much as 8.75 per
 cent. in favour of the sulphate of magnesia in the 1-per-cent.
solutions.
    I have recently diffused these substances for the long period
 of 50 days, and at a temperature of 15° C., in the apparatus
 described in an earlier part of this paper as an improvement
 upon Graham’s. The results are that—

 diffusive, and that the one possessing the least molecular

decisive also on the matter of solubility not influencing dif
fusibility, since the sulphate of zinc is well known to be much
more soluble in water than the sulphate of magnesia.
   Two substances from Mendelejeff’s 6th group, viz. chromic
acid and tungstic acid, were selected for diffusion; the
molecular volumes of which are identical, and the molecular
weights of which are as 100.5 to 232. They were diffused as
normal salts of soda for thirty days, at a temperature of
12°5 C., with this result (in which it will be again observed
the one possessing the least atomic weight is most diffusive):—
       25 per cent. of chromate of soda rose 75 millim.
       17       25       tungstate              35      75 ,
   Molybdate of soda was diffused also at the same time, but
as the atomic volume of molybdic acid is not identical but
larger than that of either of the other two, there was a ,
greater diffusibility, viz.:
         28 per cent. molybdate of soda rose 75 millim.
   In the case of Mendelejeff's 7th group we have chlorides,
bromides, and iodides of the following molecular weights and
volumes :

of molecular volume simultaneous with an increase of
molecular weight, so that it is possible retardation of diffusi
bility, owing to an £ molecular weight, may be
counterbalanced by an increased energy, indicated by the
larger molecular volume; and may account for the singular
fact discovered by Graham that these substances are practi
 cally equally diffusive, though further experiment may show
 some little variations.        Similar remarks may be made in
 regard to the chlorides and nitrates of calcium, strontium, and
barium, which Graham also showed to be practically equally

out that cuprous chloride has only half the diffusibility of

   I am still prosecuting the investigation, and other interesting

          II. On the Self-induction of Wires.—Part W.
                     By OLIVER HEAVISIDE".
Th:       mathematical difficulties in the way of the discovery
       of exact solutions of problems concerning the propaga
tion of electromagnetic disturbances into wires of other than
circular section—or, even if of circular section, when the
return current is not equidistantly distributed as regards the
wire, or is not so distant that its influence on the distribution
of the wire current throughout its section may be disregarded
—are very considerable. As soon as we             £      from the
simple type of magnetic field which occurs in the case of a
straight wire of circular section, we require at least two geo
metrical variables in place of the one, distance from the axis
of the wire, which served before; and we may have to supple
 ment the magnetic force “of the current,” as usually under
stood, by a polar force, or a force which is the space-variation
 of a single-valued scalar, the magnetic potential, in order to
 make up the real magnetic force.
    There are, however, some simplified cases which can be
 fully solved, viz. when the external magnetic field, that in the
 dielectric, is abolished, by enclosing the wire in a sheath of
 infinite conductivity. It is true that we must practically
 separate the wire from the sheath by some thickness of
 dielectric, in order to be able to set up current in the circuit
 by means of impressed force, so that we cannot entirely abolish
 the external magnetic field; but we may approximate in
 a great measure to the state of things we want for pur
 poses of investigation. The wire, of course, need not be a
 wire in the ordinary sense, but a large bar or prism. The
 electrostatic induction will be ignored, requiring the wire
 to be not of great length; thus making the problem an electro
 "'         One.
     }onsider, then, a straight wire or rod or prism of any sym
 metrical form of section, so that when a uniformly distributed
 current passes through it its axis is the axis of the magnetic

field, where the intensity of force is zero. Let a steady cur
rent exist in the wire, longitudinal of course, and let the
return conductor be a close-fitting infinitely conducting sheath.
This stops the magnetic field at the boundary of the wire.
The sudden discontinuity of the boundary magnetic force is
then the measure and representative of the return current.
    The magnetic energy per unit length is #LC", where C is
the current in the wire and L the inductance per unit length.
As regards the diminution of the L of a circuit in general,
by spreading out the current, as in a strip, instead of concen
trating it in a wire, that is a matter of elementary reasoning
founded on the general structure of L. If we draw apart
currents, keeping the currents constant, thus doing work
against their mutual attraction, we diminish their energy at
the same time by the amount of work done against the
attraction. Thus the quantity #LC” of a circuit is the amount
of work that must be done to take a current to pieces, so to
speak; that is, supposing it divided into infinitely fine fila
mentary closed currents, to separate them against their attrac
tions to an infinite distance from one another.       We do not
need, therefore, any examination of special formulae to see
that the inductance of a flat strip is far less than that of a
round wire of the same sectional area; their difference being
proportional to the difference of the amounts of the magnetic
energy per unit current in the two cases. The inductance of a
circuit can, similarly, be indefinitely increased by fining the
wire; that of a mere line being infinitely great. But we can
no more have a finite current in an      £ thin wire than
we can have a finite charge of electricity at a point, in which
case the electrostatic energy would be : infinitely great, for
a similar reason; although by a useful and almost necessary
convention we may regard fine-wire circuits as linear, whilst
 their inductances are finite.
    Now, as regards our enclosed rod with no external magnetic
 field, we can in several cases estimate L exactly, as the work
 is already done, in a different field of Physics. The nature of
 the problem is most simply stated in terms of vectors. Thus,
 let h be the vector magnetic force when the boundary of the
 section perpendicular to the length is circular, and H what it
 becomes with another form of boundary; then
                   H=h-i-F, and F=-VQ. . . . (1a)
 That is, the field of magnetic force differs from the simple
 circular type by a polar force F whose potential is Q. This
 must be so because the curl of H and of h are identical, re
 quiring the curl of F to be zero. To find F we have the datum

12                  Mr. O. Heaviside on the
that the magnetic force must be tangential to the boundary,
and therefore have no normal component; or, if N be the unit
vector normal drawn outward,
                          —FN=hN . . . . . . (2a)
is the boundary condition. This gives F, when it is remem
bered that F must have no convergence within the wire.
    In another form, since we have h circular about the axis,
and of intensity 27trT, at distance r from it, the current
density being To; or
                         h=2TI'Wkr, . . . . . . (3a)

  £ We may therefore make use of all St. Venant's
  results.
      It will be sufficient here to point out that the ratio of the
  inductance of wires of different sections is the same as the
  ratio of their torsional rigidities. Thus, as L= }u in the case
  of a round wire, that of a wire of elliptical section, semiaxes
  a and b, is L=uab/(a”+b"); when the section is a square, it
   is 4417 u; when it is an equilateral triangle, 3627.u., &c.

 changed multiplier. [I also observe that the -t in their
 equation (44) should be + T, and the + T in (45), (the
 second t) should be – T.] Such little errors will find their
 way into mathematical treatises; there is nothing astonishing
 in that ; but a certain collateral circumstance renders the
 errors in their equation (46) worthy of being long remem
 bered. For the distinguished authors pointedly called atten
 tion to the astonishing theorems in pure mathematics to be
 got by the exchange of a and b, such as rarely fall to the lot
 of pure mathematicians. They were miraculous.
    I now pass to a different problem, viz. the solution in the
case of a periodic impressed force situated at one end of a
homogeneous line, when subjected to any terminal conditions
of the kind arising from the attachment of apparatus. The
conditions that obtain in practice are very various, but
valuable information may be arrived at from the study of the
comparatively simple problem of a periodic impressed force,
of which the full solution may always be found. In Part II.
I gave the fully developed solution when the line has the three
electrical constants R, L, and S (resistance, inductance, and
electrostatic capacity), of which the first two may be functions
of the frequency, but without any allowance for the effect of
terminal apparatus. If we take L=0 we get the submarine
cable formula of Sir W. Thomson’s theory; but although the
effect of L on the amplitude of the current at the distant
end becomes insignificant when the line is an Atlantic cable,
its omission would in general give quite misleading results.
   There are some a priori reasons against formulating the
effect of the terminal apparatus. They complicate the for
mulae considerably in the first place; next, they are various
in arrangement, so that it might seem impracticable to for
mulate generally; and, again, in the case of a very long sub
marine cable, we may divide the expression of the current
amplitude into factors, one for the line and two more for the
terminal apparatus, of which the first, for the line, is always
the same, whilst the apparatus-factors vary, and are less im
portant than the line-factor. But in other cases the terminal
apparatus may be of far greater importance than the line, in
   Phil. Mag. S. 5. Wol. 23. No. 140. Jan. 1887.         C

18                  Mr. O. Heaviside on the
their influence on the current-amplitude, whilst the resolution
 into independent factors is no longer possible.
    The only serious attempt to formulate the effect of the
 terminal appar tus with which I am acquainted is that of the
 late Mr. C. Hockin (Journal S. T. E. and E., vol. v. p. 432).
 His apparatus arrangement resembled that usually occurring
 then in connection with    '    submarine cables, including, of
 course, many derived simpler arrangements; and from his
 results much interesting information is obtainable.    But the
results are only applicable to long submarine cables, on ac
count of the omission of the influence of the self-induction of
 the line. The work must, therefore, be done again in a more
 general manner.     It is, besides, independently of this, not
easy to adapt his formulae, in so far as they show the in
fluence of terminal apparatus, to cases that cannot be derived
from his. For instance, the effect of electromagnetic in
duction in the terminal arrangements was omitted. I have
therefore thought it worth while to take a far more general
case as regards the line, and at the same time have endeavoured
to put it in such a form that it can be readily reduced to
simpler cases, whilst at the same time the results apply to any
terminal arrangements we choose to use.
   The general statement of the problem is this. A homo
geneous line, of length l, whose steady-flow resistance is R,
inductance L, electrostatic capacity S, and conductance of
insulator K, all per unit length of line, is acted upon by an
impressed force  W.  sin nt at one end, or in the wire attached
to it; whilst any terminal arrangements exist. Find the
effect produced; in particular, the amplitude of the current
at the end remote from the impressed force. If the line con
sist of two parallel wires, R must be the sum of their resist
ances per unit length.
   Let C be the current in the line and V the potential dif
ference at distance 2 from the end where the impressed force
is situated.  Then
               dC            d           dV-1,

are our fundamental line equations. Here R'= R+L (d/dt)
to a first approximation, and = R + L(d/dt) in the periodic
case, where R and L are what R and L become at the given
frequency. Let the terminal conditions be
                     W =ZIC at z=l end,                     2b
        —W, sin nt-HW =Z,C at z=0 end,            .   . .  (2b)
so that V =ZoC would be the z=0 terminal condition if there
were no impressed force.

      z=l end, change R, to R,' and L, to Li'. These functions
      have the value unity when the line is short-circuited at the
     ends, (Zo–0, Z1=0). They may therefore be referred to as
     the terminal functions. Their form is invariable. We only
     require to find the R' and L', or the effective resistance and
     inductance of the terminal arrangements, and insert in (200)
     and its companions.
        Thus, let the two conductors at the z=l end be joined
     through a coil. Then Ri' is its resistance, Li' its inductance,
     the steady-flow values, and the accents may be dropped, ex
     cept under very unusual circumstances, and II is its impe
     dance at the given frequency, when on short circuit. But if
     the coil contain a core, especially if it be of iron, neither R1
     nor L1 can have the steady-flow values, on account of the
     induction of currents in the core. Their approximate values
     at a given frequency may be experimentally determined by
     means of the Wheatstone bridge. Of course R1 and L1 are
     really somewhat changed in a similar manner by allowing any
     induction between the coil and external conductors, the brass
     parts of a galvanometer, for instance; L going down and R
     going up, though this does not materially affect I.
        If, instead of a coil, it be a condenser of capacity S, that
     is inserted at z=l; then, since
                          C = SV = SpV,
     we have
                       Z1 = (Sip)" = —p/(Sin”).
     Therefore take
                    R1 =0, and Li = -(Sin”)-1.
     The condenser behaves, so far as the current is concerned, as
     a coil of no resistance and negative inductance, the latter
     decreasing as the frequency is raised, and as the capacity is
     increased; tending to become equivalent to a short circuit,
     though this would require a great speed in general, as the
     quasi-negative inductance is large... [Thus n=100, S=10-15
     (one microfarad), makes Li'=-10". To get the inductance
     of a coil to be 10" it must contain a very large number
     of turns of fine wire.] Thus, whilst the condenser stops

                      Self-induction of Wires.                  23
slowly periodic or steady currents, it tends to readily pass
rapidly periodic currents, a property which is very useful in
telephony, as in Van Rysselberghe's system.
    On the other hand, the coil passes the slowly periodic, and
tends to stop the rapidly periodic, a property which is also
very useful in telephony. A very extensive application of
this principle occurs in the system of telephonic intercommu
nication invented and carried out by Mr. A. W. Heaviside,
known as the Bridge System, from the telephones at the vari
ous offices being connected up as bridges across from one to
the other of the two conductors which form the line.        Whilst
all stations are in direct communication with one another,
one important desideratum, there is no overhearing, which is
another.     For all stations except the two which are in corre
 spondence at a certain time ' electromagnets of high
 inductance inserted in their bridges, which electromagnets will
 not pass the rapid telephonic currents in appreciable strength,
 so that it is nearly as if the non-working bridges were non
 existent, and, in consequence, a far greater length of bured
 wire can be worked through than on the Sequence system,
 wherein the various stations have their apparatus in sequence
 with the line, whilst at the same time a balance is preserved
 against inductive interferences. When the two stations have
 finished correspondence, they insert their own electromagnets
 in their bridges. As these electromagnets are used as call
 instruments, responding to slowly periodic currents, we have
 the direct intercommunication.      Of course there are various
 other details, but the above sufficiently describes the principle.
     As regards the property of the self-induction of a coil in
 stopping or greatly decreasing the amplitude of rapidly
 periodic currents, or acting as an insulation at the first
 moment of starting a current, its influence was entirely over
 looked by most writers on telegraphic technics before 1878,
  when I wrote on the subject (Journ. S. T. E. & E. vol. vii.).
  A knowledge of the important quantity (R*-i-L” n”), which
  is now the common property of all electrical schoolboys
  (especially by reason of the great impetus given to the spread
  of a scientific knowledge of electromagnetism by the com
  mercial importance of the dynamo), was, before then, confined
  to a few theorists.

 which show the expressions of R1 and Li', the second being
 the coefficient of p, the first the rest.
     Similarly in # simple cases. And, in general, from the
 detailed nature of the combination inserted at the end of the
 line, write out the connections between the current and poten
 tial difference in each branch, and eliminate the intermediates
 so as to arrive at V =ZIC, the differential equation of the
 combination, wherein Z is a function of p or d/dt. Put
p’=-n”, and it takes the form Z = R + Li'p, wherein Ri'
 and Li' are functions of the electrical constants and of n”, and
 are the required effective R1 and Li' of the combination, to
 be used in (20b), or rather in its z=l equivalent G1.
     As regards the z=0 end, it is to be remarked that, owing
 to the current being reckoned positive the same way at both
 ends, when we write W = ZoC as the terminal equation, it is
 –Zo that corresponds to Z1. Thus –Zo= Ro'+Lop, where,
 in the simplest case, Ro and Lo are the resistance and induct
 ance of a coil.
     So far sufficiently describing how to develope the effective
 resistance and inductance expressions to be used in the ter
 minal functions G and H, we may now notice some other
 peculiarities in connection with the solution (19b). First
 short-circuit the line at both ends, making the terminal func
 tions unity and 6=0. The solution then differs from that
 given in Part II., equation (82), in the presence of the quan
 tity K, the former Sn now becoming (K*+S'n')', whilst Pand
 Q differ from the former P and Q of (78), Part II., by reason
 of K, which, when it is made zero, makes them identical. If
 we compare the old with the new P and Q, we find that

      If we should regard the leakage as merely affecting the
   amplitude of the current at the distant end of a line, we should
   be overlooking an important thing, viz. its remarkable effect
   in accelerating changes in the current, and thereby lessening
   the distortion that a group of signals suffers in its transmission
   along the line. If there is only a sufficient strength of
   current received for signalling purposes, the signals can be far
   more distinct and rapid than with perfect insulation, as I have
   pointed out and illustrated in previous papers. Thus the
   theoretical desideratum for an Atlantic cable is not high, but
   low insulation, the lowest possible consistent with having
   enough current to work with. Any practical difficulties in
   the way form a separate question.
      Regarding this quickening effect, or partial abolition of elec
   trostatic retardation, I have (‘Electrician, Dec. 18, 1885, and
   Jan. 1, 1886) pushed it to its extreme in the electromagnetic
   scheme of Maxwell. In a medium whose conductivity varies
   in any manner from point to point, possessed of dielectric
   capacity which varies in the same manner, so that their ratio,
   or the electrostatic time-constant, is everywhere the same, but
    destitute of magnetic inertia (u = 0, no magnetic energy), I
   have shown that electrostatic retardation is entirely done away
   with, except as regards imaginable preexisting electrification,
    which subsides everywhere according to the common time
    constant, without true electric current, by the discharge of
    every elementary condenser through its own resistance. This
    being over, if any impressed force act, varying in any manner
   in distribution and with the time, the corresponding current
    will everywhere be the steady-flow distribution appropriate to
    the impressed force at any moment, in spite of the electric
    displacement and energy; and, on removal of the impressed
    force, there will be instantaneous disappearance of the current
    and the displacement. This seems impossible, but the same
    theory applies to combinations of shunted condensers, arranged
    in a suitable manner, as described in the paper referred to.
       Of course this extreme state of things is quite imaginary,
    as we cannot really overlook the electromagnetic induction in
    such a case. If we regard it as the limiting form of a real
    problem, in which inertia occurs, to be afterwards made zero,
    we find that the instantaneous subsidence of the electrostatic
    '' becomes an oscillatory subsidence of infinite frequency
     ut finite time-constant, about the mean value zero; which

     26                  Mr. O. Heaviside on the
     is mathematically equivalent to instantaneous non-oscillatory
     subsidence.
        The following will serve to show the relative importance of
     R, S, K, and L in determining the amplitude of periodic
     currents at the distant end of a long submarine cable, of fairly
     high insulation : resistance —
                     4 ohms per kilom. makes R=40",

        Here, it should be remembered, K is the conductance of
     the insulator per centim. The least possible value of L would
     be such that LS=v-”, where v=30"; this would make
     L=4/9 only. But it is really much greater, requiring to be
     multiplied by the dielectric constant of the insulator in the
     first place, making L=2 say. It is still further increased by
     the wire, and considerably by the sheath and by the extension
     of the magnetic field beyond the sheath, to an extent which
     is very difficult to estimate, especially as it is a variable quan
     tity; but it would seem never to become a very large number,
     as of course an iron wire for the conductor is out of the
     question.     But leaving it unstated, we have, by (9b), taking
     R = R, L'=L,

     Now n/27 is the frequency, necessarily very low on an
     Atlantic cable. We see then that the first L*n” is quite
     negligible in its effect upon P, even when we allow L to
     increase greatly from the above L=2. The high insulation
     also makes the (RK-LSn”) part negligible, making approxi

 quite an old formula. It is what we get by regarding the
 line as having only resistance and electrostatic capacity. But,
 still regarding the line as an Atlantic or similar cable, worked
 nearly up to its limit of speed, Pl is large, say 10 at most, so
 that we may take this approximation to (26b),

 where the first of the three factors is the line-factor, the
second that due to the     '           at the c=0 end, and the
 third to that at the z=l end of the line; thus, by (20 b) and
 (25b), with L'=0 and R = R in the former,
 G-1+...(2PR(R-L")+2P(R, +L")),
        -                                                    (28b)
 G|=1+#2PRR'—L')+2P(R, +L")}.
    This reduction to (27 b) is of course not possible when the
 line is very far from being worked up to its possible limit; in
fact, all three terms in the {} of (26 b), or, more generally, of
 (19b), require to be used in general. For this reason a full
examination of the effect of terminal apparatus is very labo
 rious. Most interesting results may be got out of (19b),
 especially as regards the relative importance of the line and
 terminal apparatus at different speeds, complete reversals
 taking place as the speed is varied whilst the line and appa
ratus are kept the same. The general effect is that, as the
speed is raised, the influence of the apparatus increases much
 faster than that of the line. For instance, to work a land
line of, say, 400 miles up to its limit, we must reduce the
inertia of the instruments greatly to make it even possible.
In fact electromagnets seem unsuitable for the purpose, unless
quite small, and chemical recording has probably a great
future before it. But it would be too lengthy a digression to
go into the necessarily troublesome details.
    The following relates to some properties of the terminal
function G, which have application when (27 b) is valid. Con
sider the G1 of (28b). Let it be simply a coil that is in ques
tion. Then R1 is its resistance and L1 its inductance, dropping
the accent. Keep the resistance constant, whilst varying the
inductance so as to make G1 a minimum, and therefore the
current amplitude a maximum. The required value of L1 is
                     Li=R/2Pn, . . . . . . . . (29b)

 pendently of the resistance of the coil. Taking Pl=10, this
 makes L1= Rl/20m, where Rl is the resistance of the line.
 The relation (29 b) makes
                      G1 = # + 2PR,

 If the coil had no inductance, but the same resistance, G1 would
have the same expression, but with 1 instead of $ in (30 b).
 The effect of the inductance has therefore increased the ampli
tude of the current, and it is conceivable that G1 could be
 made less than unity, though not practicable.
    Now the G1/R of (30 b) is a minimum, with R1 variable,
 when R=2PR1, and this will make G1=2, or the terminal
 factor to be G1-#= 7. Now if we vary the number of turns
 of wire in the coil, keeping it of the same size and shape, the
 magnetic force will vary as (RI/G), so it at first sight appears
that R1 = R/2P and L = R/2Pn make the magnetic force a
maximum for a fixed size and shape of coil. £ is, how
ever, a fallacy here, because varying the size of the wire as
stated varies L1 nearly in the same ratio as R1, whilst (30 b)
assumes L1 to be a constant, given by (29 b). It is perhaps
conceivable to keep Ll constant during the variation of R,
by means of iron, and so get (RI/G) to be a maximum; but
then, on account of the iron, this quantity will not represent
the magnetic force.
   If, on the other hand, we vary R1 in the original G1 of
 (28 b), keeping LAR1 constant (size and shape of coil fixed,
size of wire variable), G1/R1 is made a minimum by

where Li/R1 has been constant.        If this constant have the

 III. The peculiar Sunrise-Shadows of Adam’s Peak in Ceylon.
       By the Hon. RALPH ABERCROMBY, F.R. Met. Soc."
      HERE are certain peculiarities about the shadows of
        Adam's Peak which have long attracted the attention of
 travellers: a good deal has been written about them, and several
 theories have been proposed to explain the observed pheno
 mena. In the course of a meteorological tour round the
 world, the author stopped in Ceylon for the express purpose
 of visiting the Peak, and was fortunate enough to see the
 shadow under circumstances which could leave no doubt as to
 the true explanation, and which also entirely disproved certain
 theories which have been propounded on the subject.
    The following account is taken from a paper by the Rev.
 R. Abbay, many years resident in the island, entitled “Re
 markable Atmospheric Phenomena in Ceylon,” which was
    * Communicated by the Physical Society: read November 18, 1886.

   30          Hon. Ralph Abercromby on the peculiar
  read before the Physical Society of London, May 27, 1876,
  and published in £ Philosophical Magazine for July 1876.
  Writing from descriptions, for he himself had never witnessed
  the appearance, Mr. Abbay says:-At sunrise apparently an
  enormous elongated shadow of the mountain is projected to the
  westward, not only over the land but over the sea, to a dis
  tance of 70 or 80 miles. As the sun rises higher, the shadow
  rapidly approaches the mountain, and appears at the same
  time to rise before the spectator in the form of a gigantic
  pyramid. Distant objects—a hill or a river (or even £
  itself, at a distance of 45 miles)—may be distinctly seen
  through it; so that the shadow is not really a shadow on the
  land, £ a veil of darkness suspended between the observer
  and the low country. All this time it is rapidly rising and
 approaching, and each instant becoming more        £        until
 suddenly it seems to fall back on the spectator, like a ladder
 that has been reared beyond the vertical; and the next instant
 the appearance is gone. For this the following explanation
 is proposed —The average       £            at night in the low
 country during the dry season is between 70° and 80°F., whilst
 that on the summit of the Peak is from 30° to 40°.        Conse
 quently the lower strata of air are much less dense than the
 upper; and an almost horizontal ray of light passing over
 the summit must of necessity be refracted upwards and suffer
 total internal reflection as in the case of an ordinary mirage.
     It will be remarked that Mr. Abbay does not allow for the
 difference of elevation, and the sequel will show that this
 theory cannot be maintained.
    Adam’s Peak is a mountain that rises in an abrupt cone,
 more than 1000 feet above the irregular chain to which it
 belongs; the summit reaches to 7352 feet above the sea.
 On the south side the mountain falls suddenly down to
 Ratnapura, very little above the sea-level; while on the
north it slopes irregularly to the high valley of the Maskeliya
 district. The peak also lies near an elbow in the main chain
of mountains, as shown in the diagram of the topography of
the Peak (fig. 1), while a gorge runs up from the north-east
just to the west of the mountain. When, then, the north
east monsoon blows morning mist up the valley, light wreaths
of condensed vapour will pass to the west of the Peak and
catch the shadow at sunrise only, if other things are suitable.
The importance of this will appear later on.
    The only difficulty in getting to Adam's Peak is the want

comfort and with a few necessary instruments. Our party
reached the summit on the night of the 21st February, 1886,
amid rain, mist, and wind. Towards morning the latter
subsided, but at 5.30 A.M. the sky was covered with a con
fused mass of nearly every variety of cloud. Below and
around us cumulus and mist; at a higher level, pure stratus;
above that, wild cirro-stratus and fleecy cirro-cumulus.
   Soon the foreglow began to brighten the under surface of
the stratus-cloud with orange; lightning flickered to the right
of the rising sun over a dense mass of cloud; opposite, a
light pink-purple illumined an irregular layer of condensed
vapour; while above a pale moon with a large ill-defined corona
round her, struggled to break    £        a softish mass of fleecy
cloud. Below lay the island of Ceylon, the hills and valleys
presenting the appearance of a raised relief-map ; patches of
white mist filled the hollows; true cloud drove at intervals
across the country, and sometimes masses of mist coming up
from the valley enveloped us with condensed vapour.
   At 6 A.M. the thermometer marked 52°F. ; we had been
told that the phenomenon of the shadow depended on the
temperature at the summit falling to 30 or 40°. F.; and
when, shortly after, the sun rose behind a cloud we had
almost lost all hope of seeing anything; but suddenly at
6.30 A.M. the sun peeped through a chink in the clouds, and

 32         Hon. Ralph Abercromby on the peculiar
 we saw the pointed shadow of the Peak lying on the misty
 land. Driving condensed vapour was floating about, and a
 fragment of rainbow-tinted mist appeared near the top of the
 shadow. Soon this fragment grew into a complete prismatic
 circle of about 8° diameter by estimation, with the red
 outside, formed round the summit of the Peak as a centre.
 The author instantly saw that with this bow there ought to
 be spectral figures, so he waved his arms about and immedi
 ately found shadowy arms moving in the centre of the rain
 bow. Two dark rays shot upwards and outwards on either side

of the centre, as shown in the diagram fig. 2, and appeared
to be nearly in a prolongation of the lines of the slope of the
Peak below. The centre of the bow appeared to be just
below the point of the shadow, not on it; because we were
standing on a platform below a pointed shrine, and the sub
jective bow centred from our own eyes. If we did not stand
fairly out in the sun, only a portion of the bow could be
seen. Three times, within a quarter of an hour, this appearance
was repeated as mist drove up in proper quantities, and fitful
glimpses of the sun gave sufficient light to throw a shadow

           Sunrise-Shadows of Adam's Peak in Ceylon.         33
 and form a bow. In every case the shadow and bow were
 seen in front of land and never against the sky. The last
 time, when the sun was pretty high, we saw the characteristic
 peculiarity of the shadow. As a thin wreath of condensed
 vapour came up from the valley at a proper height, a bow
 formed round the shadow, while both seemed to stand up in
 front of us, and then the shadow fell down on to the land,
 and the bow vanished as the mist passed on.
. . Here, then, was an unequivocal explanation of the whole
 phenomenon. The apparent upstanding of the shadow was
 simply the effect of passing mist which caught the darkness
 of the Peak at a    £ level       than the earth, for when the
 condensed vapour moved on, the characteristic bow disappeared
 and the shadow fell to its natural plane on the ground.
 When the mist was low, as on the two first occasions, the
 shadow fell on the top as it were, and there was no appearance
 of lifting, only the formation of a bow.
    The well-known theory of the bow is that light diffracted
 in its passage between small water-globules forms a series of
 bows  £          to the size of the globules, their closeness,
 and the intensity of the illumination. Had the mist been so
 fine and thin as merely to catch and raise the shadow, but
 not to form a bow, there might have been some doubt as to
 the origin of the appearance. Our fortune was in the un
 settled weather, which made the mist so coarse and close that
 the unequivocal bow left no doubt as the true nature of the
 CauSe.
    About an hour later the sun again shone out, but much
 higher and stronger than before, and then we saw a brighter
 and sharper shadow of the Peak, this time encircled by a
 double bow. Our own spectral arms were again visible, but
 the shadow was now so much nearer the base of the Peak,
 and we had to look so much down on it, that there was no
 illusion of standing up, and there were no dark diverging
 rays. The inner bow was the one we had seen before; the
 outer and fainter one was due to stronger light.
    The bows were all so feeble and the time so short, that the
 author did not succeed in obtaining any sextant measure
 ments of the diameters of the bows; but his thermometric
 observations conclusively disprove any idea of mirage. At
 6 A.M. the thermometer on the Peak marked 52°F., while at
 Colombo the temperature stood at 74°85. The difference of
 22°.85 is just about the normal difference in temperature due
 to a height of 7352 feet.
    The Colombo figures were procured through the       £
 of the Surveyor-General for Ceylon. They are got as fol

lows:—Colombo observations only give the minimum that
morning as 73°6 F., and the 7AM. reading as 75°5. The
mean curve of diurnal temperature for the month of February,
as determined by the Office, gives a difference of 0°.65
between the 6 A.M. and 7 A.M. observations; and by subtract
ing that correction from 75°.5 we get 74°85 as the 6 A.M.
reading.
   The questions have been frequently asked—Why this lifted
shadow should be peculiar to Adam's Peak?; why a similar
appearance is not observed from any other mountain-top?; and
why the shadow is rarely seen at sunset? There are not many
mountains which are habitually visited that are either over
7000 feet, or that rise in an isolated, well-defined pyramid.
Still fewer can there be where a steady wind, for months
together, blows up a valley so as to project the rising morning
mist at a suitable height and distance on the western side to
catch the shadow of the peak at sunrise. The shadow is not
seen during the south-west monsoon, for then the mountain is
covered with cloud and deserted.     Nowhere either do we find
at sunset those light mists lying near the ground which are so
characteristic of sunrise, and whose presence is necessary to
lift the shadow.
   The combination of a high isolated pyramid, a prevailing
wind, and a valley to direct suitable mist at a proper height
on the western side of the mountain, is probably only rarely
met with ; and at present nothing yet has been described that
exactly resembles this sunrise shadow of Adam's Peak in the
green island of Ceylon.
   But there is another totally different shadow which is some
times seen from Adam's Peak, just before and at the moment
of sunrise, that has been mixed up in some accounts with the
shadow we have just described. The shadow of the base of
the Peak stretches along the land to the horizon, and then the
shadow of the summit appears to rise up and stand against
the distant sky. The first part seems to be the natural
shadow lying on the ground; and the sky part to be simply
the ordinary earth shadow of twilight projected so clearly
against the sky as to show mountainous irregularities of the
earth's surface.  As the sun rises, the shadow of the summit
against the sky gradually sinks to the horizon, and then the
ordinary shadow grows steadily shorter as the sun gets higher
in the usual manner. This can only be seen at sunrise from
Adam’s Peak, because the ground to the east is too high and
mountainous to allow the shadow of the summit to fall on the
sky before the sun is too far down.
   The author found a similar effect, only at sunset, on Pike's

 Critical Mean Curvature of Liquid Surfaces of Revolution. 35
Peak, Colorado, 14,147 feet above the sea, and nearly double
the height of Adam’s Peak. There, towards sunset, the
shadow of the mountain creeps along the level prairie to
the horizon, and there begins to rise up in the sky till the sun
has just gone down, and the anticrepuscular shadow rises too
high to catch the outline of the Peak. The author only
witnessed a portion of this sequence, for just about the time
that the shadow stretched to the horizon, clouds obscured the
sun, and the rise of the shadow could not be observed ; but
from all the descriptions he heard, there can be no doubt
that the character of the shadow is identical with that of
Adam's Peak, only that, as the order of sequence is reversed,
it is more easy to follow the origin of the shadows.
    Since the above was written, the author's attention has
been called to the sketch of the shadow exhibited by the well
known traveller Miss C. F. Gordon Cumming, in the Colonial
Exhibition. This picture represents the shadow lying down,
but not raised, on an irregular surface of white mist and
mountain tops. The most interesting thing is a prismatic
fringe of colour along the straight outside edges of the shadow;
but there is no trace of a bow round its point.
    When we consider how much the appearance of the shadow
depends on the height, size, and aggregation of the mist, we
need not be surprised at the numerous phases of reflection and
refraction that have been described by travellers; but the
general principles which have been laid down in this paper
appear to govern all.
  IV. On the Critical Mean Curvature of Liquid Surfaces of
       Revolution. By A. W. RöCKER, M.A., F.R.S."
     ET a weightless mass of liquid, or a liquid film, be attached
       to two equal circular rings, the planes of which are per
pendicular to the line joining their centres. It will form a
surface of revolution; and if it is in stable equilibrium, the
longest or the shortest diameter will be half way between the
rings. It is convenient to call this the principal diameter.
At all points on the surface the sum of the reciprocals of the
two principal radii of curvature is constant. Half this quan
tity may be called the mean curvature. Maxwell has, in his
article on Capillary Action (Enc. Brit., 9th edition), given a
simple proof of the fact that if the film is a cylinder, a slight
bulge will cause an increase or decrease in the mean curvature
according as the distance between the rings is less or greater

 36     Mr. A. W. Rücker on the Critical Mean Curvature
 than half the circumference of either.   If the distance between
 the rings is exactly half the circumference, an infinitely small
 change in the volume will modify the form of the surface, but
 will not alter the mean curvature.     Thus the mean curvature
 of a cylinder, the length of which has this particular ratio
  (T/2) to its diameter, is evidently a maximum or minimum
 with respect to that of other surfaces of constant mean curva
 ture, which pass through the same rings at the same distance
 apart, and which differ but little from the cylindrical form.
 Hence the cylinder may be said to have a critical mean cur
 vature when the distance between the rings is half their
 circumference. If the distance between the rings is altered, a
 similar property will be possessed by some other surface. It
 is proposed in the present paper to determine the general
 relation between the magnitude and distance of the rings and
 the form of the surfaces of critical curvature.
    The expression for the change in the mean curvature of a
 film or liquid mass, under the conditions above laid down, has
 been investigated in a paper “On the Relation between the
 Thickness and the Surface-tension of Liquid Films,” lately
 communicated by Prof. Reinold and myself to the Royal
 Society. It was, however, applied only to the cases which
 were practically realized in the experiments therein described.
 It will be convenient, before discussing it more fully, to
 indicate the manner in which the equation is obtained.
    Beer has shown that if the axis of a be the axis of revolu
 tion, the equation to a liquid surface of revolution is given by
 the expressions
            w=2E+8F, y' = a cos” (p +8° sin” b; . . (1)
 where F and E are elliptic integrals of the first and second
kinds respectively, of which the amplitude is b, and the
modulus k=va”-g/a.
    As usual,
                        A=V1-x sin” b, . . . . . (2)
whence y=a^; and if &= sin 6, 8=a cos 6.
    Since a > 8, a and 8 are the maximum and minimum values
of y respectively ; and the above equations implicitly assume
that the origin lies on a maximum ordinate; for when p=0,
&=0 and y=a. If we wish to transform to a minimum
ordinate, p is > T/2, and
                    r= a(E-El) +/8(F–FI), . . . . (1a)
where E1 and F are the complete integrals.
   It may be well, for the sake of clearness, to state that the

                 of Liquid Surfaces of Revolution.             37
surface is an unduloid or nodoid according as 8 is positive or
"#. i.e. according as T/2> 0--T/2 or 37/2> 0-7/2.
     f6 be supposed to vary continuously, and if one at least
of the quantities a and 8 is finite, the form of the surface may
be made to pass through a continuous cycle of changes.
   Thus, between 6=0 and 6=t/2 the surface is an unduloid,
the limits being the cylinder when 6=0, and the sphere when
6=T/2. As 6 passes through the next quadrant the surface
is a nodoid, the limits being the sphere, and a circle the plane
of which is perpendicular to the axis of revolution, which
is, as Plateau points out, a purely mathematical limit. In the
third quadrant the surface is again a nodoid, the limits of
which are the circle and catenoid. Finally, when 6 lies be
tween 37/2 and 27 the surface is an unduloid, the limits of
which are the catenoid and the cylinder.
    If now 2X and 2Y are the distance between and diameter
of the rings respectively, and if b is the value of p when y=Y,
we have
            X=a E+8F, Y*=a” cos’ bi +8° sin” pi.
Hence if a., 8, and b vary, but so that X and Y are unaltered,
we have, by differentiation,

   Now the mean curvature of a surface of revolution of mini
mum area has been proved by Lindelöf to be the same as

38     Mr. A. W. Rücker on the Critical Mean Curvature
that of a circle of radius (a + 8). Hence

Hence the mean curvature has in general a critical value
when A-B = 0.
   First confining ourselves to the case in which the prin
cipal ordinate is a maximum, and b1 and 6 are less than
T/2, it is evident that, since F is always > E, B is always
  ositive

 whence, since dF/dk is positive and sin bicos p1 is positive,
a"E-8°F is positive, and therefore A is positive also.    £
 B can only vanish if bi=0; and none of the terms in A or B
become infinite unless bi=0 or T/2, cases which it will be
seen hereafter it is unnecessary to consider.
   Thus,
      (A–B)/a”=2E-F(1+ cos’6)+2A1 cot 24:1–0 . (7)
is a relation which must be satisfied by p, and 6 when the
mean curvature has a critical value for changes in the form
of the surface which take place, subject to the conditions that
the radii of the rings and the distance between them are
constant.
   Corresponding values of bi and 6 must be found by trial;
 but it will now  #. shown that if such a pair of values is known,
 when T/2> 6-0, the values of bi, which are proper to T-6,
 T+6, and 27–6 can be readily deduced without further trials.
    In the first place it is evident that, since the squares of the
 sine and cosine of 6 alone enter into (7), the curve obtained
 by plotting the values of 6 as abscissae and those of pi as
 ordinates is symmetrical with respect to the ordinate 6=t/2,
 and that the same value of bi corresponds both to 6 and T-6.
    If, then, we conceive a film attached to two rings, the
 volume and length of which vary continuously in such a way
 that (7) is always satisfied, as the cylinder changes to the
 sphere and thus to a nodoid forms which correspond to the
 same value of sin” 6 will have the same value of p1 also, and
 the lengths will be given by the expression

where 6 is < 7/2 for the unduloid and > T/2, but < r for
the nodoid.
   All these forms will have a maximum diameter half way
between the     rings. If we now proceed to discuss cases
where the principal ordinate is a minimum, we must all
through the previous investigation consider the lower limit of
the integrals to be "r/2 instead of 0, and p1 to be >T/2. With
this convention no change is produced in any of the equations;
as in equations (5) the quantities which are brought outside
the sign of integration vanish, both when p1=0 and when
  1=T/2.
   Thus, writing as usual E, and F, for the complete integrals,
and taking $ instead of b, as the upper limit of E and F,
where p' is >T/2, we have
    2(E-El)–(F-Fi) (1 + cos”6)+2A(b) cot 245 =0. (9)

    We thus conclude that, for every angle Y or pi which
 satisfies (7), there is a corresponding angle b' which satisfies
 (9) for the same value of k", and that these angles are con
 nected by the relation

 If, then, we determine from (7) the values of $1 which cor
 respond to certain values of 6 between 0 and Th2, we can by

 40      Mr. A. W. Rücker on the Critical Mean Curvature
  (11) find the values of p' corresponding to values between
 37/2 and 27t; whence, since (7) and (9) depend on the
 squares of the sine and cosine of 6, the values of p and p’
 between T/2 and 37/2 are also known.
    Before making any numerical calculations it is convenient
 to discuss (7) more fully.

 the case in which

 we notice that, if we subtract (13) from (7), we get
                      E-F--A1 cot p1=0; . . . . . (14)
 and these equations are satisfied if 6=T/2 and b =56°28'.
    For, if 6=t/2, (13) is true identically, and (14) reduces to

   The question as to whether the critical value is a maximum
or minimum has not yet been discussed. Since A-B=0,

Now as we pass from one surface which satisfies the condition
A-B=0 to another, the value of X changes; and it can easily
be shown that if dx/d6 be calculated subject to this condition,
it is of the same sign as dy/dx. Hence if X increases with 6,
dx/da is positive and the critical value is a minimum; if X
diminishes as 6 increases, it is a maximum.              If X is a maxi
 mum or minimum the curvature has a stationary value, but
it is not itself a maximum or minimum.

the relation between b1 or b, and 6, is given in fig. I.
   Rectangular coordinates are perhaps the most convenient;
but if 6 and b be regarded as angle and radius vector, the
curve assumes the symmetrical form shown in fig. II.
   This result completes the solution of the problem; but the
nature of the conclusions at which we have arrived is more
evident if we proceed to deduce the ratios of the lengths and
principal diameters of the films to the radii of the rings.
  This is done by means of the following relations, where
symbols with unity subscript refer to bulging films, and those
with 2 subscript to films the principal ordinate of which is a
minimum.

 44     Mr. A. W. Rücker on the Critical Mean Curvature
 and this gives
          a/Y=1:545, X/a=1,2044, X/Y=1:860.
 If, then, we suppose the rings to approach to or recede from
 each other, and the volume and diameter of the film to be at
 the same time altered so that it always satisfies the conditions
 of critical mean curvature, it will undergo the following
 changes of form.
    Starting with the rings in contact, and supposing that as
 they separate the film has a slight bulge, it will first be a
 £,       and the length and principal diameter will increase
 together. When the length is a little more than one and a
# (1:509) diameters of the rings the film is spherical, and
the principal diameter is then a maximum (a/Y=1:810). As
the diameter begins to decrease the film becomes an unduloid,
but the length increases until it is 1:860 x diameter of rings.
 Thereafter length and diameter decrease together until, when
the latter is a third proportional to the diameters of the sphere
and of the rings, it reaches its minimum value (8/Y=0:552).
The film is then a catenoid. As the length diminishes it
becomes a nodoid, exerting a negative or outward pressure,
and this continues until the cycle is completed by the rings
meeting again.
   The whole of the above investigation has taken place subject
to the condition that bi <7/2, and without reference to the
stability of the films, which is, however, secured by the
condition as to bi except in the neighbourhood of 6=180°.
    The curves, when drawn on a larger scale, lend themselves
to the solution of a number of problems with an accuracy
quite sufficient for practical purposes.
   Thus, if we wish to determine the conditions of the film
which has a critical curvature when the principal diameter or
the length is a given multiple of the diameter of the rings, we
have only to draw a circle with the origin in figs. III. or W. as
the centre, and with the radius equal to the given ratio. The
  oints of intersection give the value of 6; b1 is found from
fig. II.; and thus the other quantities can be determined either
by calculation or by means of the other figures.
   It is evident, since the maximum radius of the curve in
fig. V. is such that X/Y=1:860, that the curvature cannot
have a critical value for films such that the ratio of the length
to the diameter of the rings exceeds this number, while for all
less ratios there must be two critical points, a maximum and
a minimum respectively.
   If, then, we suppose a film attached to two rings to be
initially a nodoid with a diameter exceeding that of the sphere,

               of Liquid Surfaces of Revolution.            45
and to contract gradually, its behaviour, as regards change of
curvature, within the limits of the problem, would be as
follows.
   If the length were > 1:860 x diameter of rings, the film,
after becoming a sphere, would always be an unduloid until it
reached the limit at which the conditions no longer apply.
The mean curvature would increase as the principal diameter
diminished.                         -
    If 1.860> X/Y > 0.663, the film remains an unduloid
throughout all stages after it has become a sphere; but the
mean curvature first increases, then diminishes, and finally
increases again. The cylinder is the form of minimum mean
curvature if X/Y=1:571. The sphere is the form of maxi
mum curvature if X/Y=1:509.
   If X/Y=0.663 the last series of statements holds good,
with the addition that the minimum mean curvature is zero.
Hence the surface passes through the form of the limiting
catenoid, which is such that no catenoid can be formed be
tween the rings if the distance between them is increased. If
the distance between the rings is diminished, two catenoids
pass through them.
   If X/Y ~ 0.663, the maximum mean curvature which is
attained while the film is still a nodoid diminishes as the
figure passes through the forms of the sphere, cylinder, and
£ and then becomes negative, i.e. the pressure exerted
by the film is directed outwards. The minimum is reached
when the form of the film lies between the two catenoids
which can be drawn through the rings.
   The calculations enable us also to solve another problem.
If the interiors of two similar films be connected which are
formed between equal and equidistant rings, and which are
stable when separated from each other, the system will only
be in stable equilibrium if a contraction in the principal
ordinate, producing a decrease in volume, is attended by a
decrease in the curvature.
   Hence no pair of similar films so arranged can be in stable
equilibrium if the length is > 1:860 x diameter of rings.
   Two cylinders cannot be in stable equilibrium if the length
is >  #x   diameter, nor two spheres if the length is > 1:509x
 diameter of rings, i.e. > 0.834 x diameter of sphere.

V. On Silk v. Wire Suspensions in Galvanometers, and on the
    Rigidity of Silk Fibre. By THOMAS GRAY, B.Sc., F.R.S.E."
    N the last Number of the Philosophical Magazine there is
      a short article by R. H. M. Bosanquet drawing attention
to some eccentricities of a galvanometer used by him. A
determination of the rigidity of the suspending “fibre” of the
  alvanometer-needle would have been interesting, as it would
£ thrown considerable light on the probability or improba
bility of the explanation offered. It must have caused no little
 surprise to many of the readers of the Philosophical Magazine
 to find that Mr. Bosanquet based his condemnation of silk
 fibre suspensions on the trouble he experienced with an instru
 ment the suspending fibre in which was “left just stout
 enough to carry the weight,” and which was of such a nature
 that it could possibly twist or untwist with stretching or
 with hygrometric changes in the atmosphere. Surely Mr.
 Bosanquet is scarcely in earnest when he writes about sus
  ending the needles of a sensitive galvanometer with a twisted
 silk thread, or when he proposes to go back something like
half a century in the history of this subjectf, and adopt galva
 nometers with needles seven inches long made of stout knit
 ting needles and suspended by a wire five feet long.
    A galvanometer-needle should never be so heavy that it
cannot be suspended by a single fibre of silk (that is, half an
ordinary cocoon fibre), because such a fibre will bear easily,
leaving a good margin of safety, two grammes; and it is an
easy matter to so arrange such a mass that the period of vibra
tion will be not only so much as thirty seconds but even several
minutes. With an astatic arrangement, especially if it be
only “ nearly astatic,” there will be changes of zero cer
tainly, but I can hardly see any thing comparable to a
 “ghost” in what could occur.
    About a year ago I made, in the Physical Laboratory of
Glasgow University, a number of experiments on silk fibres,
which included among other things some determinations of
their rigidity. Mr. Bosanquet's paper has suggested to me
that possibly a few of the results may be worth publication.
Some of the results of these experiments are in type in
vol. iii. of the Reprint of Sir W. Thomson's Mathematical
and Physical Papers now in the press.
    Two methods were used for the determination of the rigidity.
   * Communicated by the Author.
   + Some interesting experiments “On the  £ of the Magnetic
Needle by Spiders' Fibre” are described by the Rev. A. Bennet, F.R.S.,
in the R. S. Trans, vol. lxxxii. 1792.

        On Silk v. Wire Suspensions in Galvanometers.               47
The first method was almost identical with that introduced in
this laboratory thirty-five years ago by Sir W. Thomson, and
now commonly adopted for the determination of the rigidity
of metallic wires. It consisted in suspending from a fixed
support, by means of a measured length of the fibre, a thin
circular rim of non-magnetic material and of easily calculated
moment of inertia, and observing the period of the torsional
vibrations. From this the torsional rigidity of the fibre can
be readily calculated by a well-known formula. The second
method consisted in suspending a small mirror, to which was
rigidly fixed a small magnetic needle of known magnetic
moment by means of a measured length of the fibre, and
observing the deflection of the mirror produced by twisting
the top of the fibre through a measured angle. This gives a
ready means of calculating the rigidity of the fibre in terms
of the magnetic moment of the suspended needle, and the
strength of the magnetic field in which it is suspended.
   The fibres were of Japanese floss-silk, which had been
thoroughly washed in hot water to remove the gum which is
always found in considerable quantity on cocoon fibres. The
fibres were in all cases single fibres; and it will be seen, both
from the direct measurements by the microscope and from the
rigidity, that they vary considerably in thickness. Even a
rough estimate of the rigidity per square centimetre section
of the substance is impossible, as the fibre is not even approxi
mately circular in section, and its diameter not nearly regular
along its length. The results of the experiments are given in
the following Table, the headings of the different columns
being sufficiently explanatory of the numbers.

   The following curve illustrates an experiment, and shows
how nearly proportional the first deflection is to the torsion even
after the elastic limit of the fibre has been far exceeded.                 In
the first part of the curve the ordinates are the scale-readings,
the abscissae the angle turned through by the torsion-head,
  * This is the ratio of the product of the pull applied to the fibre, and the
length of the fibre, to the elongation produced by the pull, or, if E be the
modulus, E _ weight applied x length of fibre

which we may, without appreciable error, assume to be
the torsion of the fibre, as the angle turned through by the
mirror is so small as to be negligible; in the last part the
ordinates have the same meaning, but the abscissae indicate
time. This second part of the curve shows the rate at which
the fibre takes a set under the torsional stress; the part of this
curve below the zero-line shows the working out of the set
after the fibre was untwisted. The length of the fibre in this
experiment was 8.5 centim. and the average thickness about
0.0015 centim.
   When a galvanometer is made sufficiently sensitive for the
fibre to play an important part in directing the needle, the set
of the fibre due to continued deflection always produces an
apparent change of zero which, in exact measurements, it is
somewhat difficult to properly allow for. Except, however,
in very special cases, as, for instance, in taking deflections
with a Thomson’s “dead-beat” galvanometer in a weak
magnetic field, the error is small, and it is not in any way
capricious. It is important to bear in mind, however, that
for very sensitive galvanometers to be used as deflectional
instruments the suspension should be of considerable length,
such, for example, as is provided in the Thomson's astatic
galvanometer.
   From the data given above we may very easily form an
estimate as to when the rigidity of a silk fibre comes to be an
important factor, affecting the sensibility of a galvanometer.
If C be the current flowing through the galvanometer, K a
constant depending on the coils, I and I the field at the upper
and lower needles respectively, m and m the magnetic mo
ments of these needles, T the torsional rigidity of the fibre,
and 6 the deflection, we have
          C=K{    Im-I'm'
                   m+m' tan 6+       (m+m')T6

When the needle system is perfectly astatic, m=m', and this
reduces to     C-K (# tan 6+

 when # is not small compared with I-I’. Now in a very

 to about 001, and m in such an instrument as we are consi
 dering will not differ much from unity. Hence t must be
 much less than 001; and we find, from the tables given above,
 that, for a fibre of about the usual length, say 5 centim, t will
 be about .0003; or about one fourth of the total force is, in this
 case, due to the fibre. This, then, may be taken as about the
 limit of sensibility beyond which we cannot easily pass with an
 ordinary Thomson’s astatic galvanometer with small needles;
 to get beyond it, attention must be directed to an increase of
 m". The limit here indicated is, however, far beyond anything
 that can be reached with wire suspension, the smallest current
 which can be measured being about 10" ampere for a galva
 nometer of 1 ohm resistance, and about 0.2 x 10" ampere for
 one of 10,000 ohms resistance. When I-I" is as much as
 0.01, or between a tenth and a twentieth of the earth’s hori
 zontal force in this country, the effect of the set of the sus
 pending fibre is extremely small. With such a value of I-I",
 however, a properly constructed galvanometer, the resistance
 of which is as low as 1 ohm, will measure a current of 10-8
 ampere. When very high sensibility is absolutely necessary,
 it may be to some extent obtained by increasing the length of
the fibre; but if this prove insufficient, some alteration or
other arrangement of the parts becomes necessary. Such an
arrangement is described in the paper referred to in the foot
note; but it may be remarked that, in so far as this arrange
ment is intended to increase m, it is only important when
I–I' is made practically zero. So long as I-1' is consider
ably greater than T, a high value of m is of no importance;
and the Thomson form is, because of the small inertia of its
needle system, decidedly the best.
    NoTE.—Since the above was written Mr. J. T. Bottomley
has suggested to me that some interesting results might be
£ if the vibrational method, above referred to, were
carried out with the fibre and vibrator in a good Sprengel
vacuum ; and in conjunction with him I have made some
preliminary experiments, the results of which seem worth
quoting.
    The vibrator used was the lighter of the two referred to in
connection with the former experiments, and consisted of a
small ring of brass 0.295 centimetre radius and 0.012 gramme
in weight. It was suspended, as shown in the diagram, in
side a small spherical bottle provided with a long neck and a
ground stopper, to the lower end of which the fibre was
attached. A tube passed from the side of the bottle to one

  lass, the other end of which was sealed to a tube leading to
the Sprengel pump. The vibrator was attached to the fibre
by means of three short single fibres, in the manner shown in
                                               to pumps

               vibrator
the sketch. The results are given in the following table, the
meaning of the numbers in the different columns of which
will be readily understood from the headings. In the column
headed “numbers of vibrations observed” the figures repre
sent roughly the number of periods which could be observed
at the different degrees of exhaustion, shown in the preceding
column, beginning in each case from an amplitude of about
60°, and observing directly the transits of a black spot on the
ring over a fixed mark until the amplitude fell to about 10°.
     he results are sufficient to show that the effect of the
viscosity of the fibre in damping the vibrations is very small
in comparison with the effect of the air friction; and it seems
probable that a moderately heavy vibrator(say about 2 grammes
in weight) with a small magnetic needle attached, and sus
pended by a single silk fibre, may prove a   £       £
for experiments such as have been carried out by Maxwell,
Kundt and Warburg, Crookes and others on the friction and
viscosity of gases. It certainly would have the advantage
that the period would depend mainly on the strength of the
magnetic field, and could be varied at pleasure. Should
 opportunity offer, Mr. Bottomley and the writer hope to con
 tinue these experiments.      E.

  WI. On Stationary Waves in Flowing Water.—Part IV.
   Stationary Waves on the Surface produced by Equidistant
   Ridges on the Bottom.              By Sir WILLIAM THOMson, F.R.S."
TH:usemost           obvious way of solving this problem is by the
            of periodic functions,              which we have been so well
taught by Fourier in his ‘Mathematical Theory of Heat;’ and
in this way it was solved in Part III. (formulas 1 to 15); the
solution being (15) Part III. with
                               k=1, m=2t/a . . . . . . (1);
 where a denotes the distance from ridge to ridge. Thus,
reproducing (15) Part III. with the notation modified to shorten
it in form and to suit it for numerical computation, we have

            at distance a from the point over one of the

            ridges;
        * denotes #                                                     (3)

and D denotes the depth.
   Thus, in (2) we have an expression for the surface-effect of
an endless succession of equidistant ridges on the bottom.
We shall see presently that if the succession of ridges is finite,
the result expressed by (2) will not be approximated to by
increasing the number of ridges. The difference in the effect
of a million equidistant ridges from that of a million and one
equidistant ridges, in respect to the corrugations on the surface
of the fluid over any part of the series, may be as great as the
difference between the effects of a thousand and of a thousand
and one, or between the effects of ten and of eleven : and the
absolute effect of four, or six, or eight, may be sensibly the
same as, or may be greater than, or may be less than, the
effect of a million, in respect to the condition of the surface
over the space between the two middle ridges. The awkward
ness of the consideration of infinity for our present case is
beautifully done away with, after the manner of Fourier, by
substituting for an “infinite canal” an “endless" canal,” or
a canal forming a complete circuitf: a circular canal as we
may imagine it to be, although it might be curved, of any
form, provided only that, whether it be circular or not circular,
the radius of curvature at any point is very great compared
with the breadth of the canal.            This condition is all that is
  * It is curious that the word “endless” should in common usage, and
especially in technology, have so different a meaning from “infinite.”
Thus every one understands what is meant by an “endless cord.” An
“infinite cord” means, in common language, an infinitely long cord—a
cord which has no limit to the greatness of its length.
  t A curious piece of illogical usage in mathematical language, according
to which an enclosing curve is called a “closed curve,” must henceforth
be absolutely avoided. It has already led to endless trouble in electrical
nomenclature, according to which, in common language, an electric cir
cuit is said to be closed when a current can pass through it, and to be open
when a current cannot pass through it. I believe all, or almost all, £
writers on electrical subjects have been guilty of this absurdity. I doubt
whether any one of them would say a road round a park is open when a
gate on it is closed, and is closed when every gate on it is open.

 necessary to allow the motion of the water in every part of
 the canal to be so nearly two-dimensional, that our formulas
 for two-dimensional motion in a straight canal shall be prac
 tically applicable to the water in the curved canal.
    Now let there be any integral number n of equidistant
 ridges in the circuit, and let a be the distance from ridge to
 ridge. Superposition by simple addition of solutions of the
 formula (2) gives, for the surface effect,

The consideration of cases of different values of n, even or
 odd, leads to interesting illustrations both of mathematical
principles and of practical results in dynamics; but for the
£         I confine myself to the case of n=1, for which (4)
  ecomes identical with (2).
   Remark, now, that if M(e'-e-")/(e' +e") is an integer,
the denominator of (2) vanishes for the case of i. equal to
this integer. This is the case in which the length of the
circuit # the canal is an integral number of times the wave
length of free waves in water of depth D. The interpre
tation is obvious, and is interesting both in itself and in
its relation to corresponding problems in many branches of
physical science.
     Meantime remark only that, when the value of
M(e'-e-")/(e'+e") approaches very nearly to any integer j,
the chief term of (2) is that for which i=j, and all the other
terms are relatively very small. Thus the chief effect is
forced stationary waves of wave-length a j. Thus, if we con
sider different velocities of flow approaching more and more
nearly to the velocity which makes M(e'-e-")/(e'+e") an
integer, the magnitude of the forced stationary waves is
greater and greater for the same magnitude of ridge, but the
motion is still perfectly determinate.        Suppose, now, we
make the ridge smaller and smaller, so that the wave-height
of the stationary wave may have any moderate value; as the
velocity approaches more and more nearly to that which makes
M(e'-e-')/(e' +e") an integer, the magnitude of the ridge
must be smaller and smaller, and in the limit must be zero.
Thus, with no ridge at all, we may have stationary waves
of any given moderate value, in the limiting case,—that in
which the velocity of the flow equals the velocity of a wave of .
wave-length a/j.                            -

lute values up to i=j; and for all values of i greater than j it
is positive, with decreasing values from i=j+1 to i=co.
Thus the absolute magnitudes of the coefficients of cosis) in
the successive terms of the series from the beginnin arenega
tive, with increasing absolute values up to i=j; and after that
positive,withdecreasing values converging ultimately according
to the ratio e-".   Remembering that e=e”, we see that the
convergence is sluggish when a, the distance from ridge to
 ridge (or the length of the circuit in the case of an endless
 canal with one ridge only) is very large in comparison with
 the depth; but that when a is less than the depth, or not
 more than five or ten times the depth (an exceedingly inte
 resting class of cases), the convergence is very rapid.
    We shall find presently, however, another solution still
 more convergent, much more convergent indeed for the
 greater part of the configuration, whatever be the ratio of D
 to a ; a solution which is highly convergent, in every case
 except for values of a considerably smaller than the depth.
 The calculation for these small values of w is necessary to
 give the shape of the water-surface at distances on each side
 of the vertical through the      #   small in comparison with
 the depth : for this purpose, and for this purpose only, is the
 solution (2) indispensable. For investigating all other parts
 of the configuration the new solution is much more convenient,
 and involves, on the whole, very much less of arithmetical
 labour. It is found by summation from the solution of the
 single-ridge problem given in Part III. (40), (41), as follows.
    Let the whole number of ridges be j+j'+1, and let it be
 required to find the shape of the surface between the verticals
 through ridges numbers j and j+1. Take the origin of the
 coordinate a in the vertical through number j ridge, and let
 number j+1 be on the positive side of it. The solution will
 be found by adding to the solution (40) Part III., j solutions
 differing from (40) only in having respectively w = a, a +2a,
 ..., x +ja substituted for v ; and j' solutions each the same
 as (40) Part III., but having -w- a, -w- 2a, ..., -w-Hj'a,
 substituted for v. Thus, denoting by S the sum of the effects
 of the j+j' + 1 single ridges, we find

already remarked in Part III, ai, a2,..., xi are all real; and
therefore fi, f, ..., f are each real and less than unity.

      VII. To what Order of Lever does the Oar belong?
  By Rev. T. K. ABBOTT, Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin".
     O the above question every one who has learned even the
      elements of Mechanics will reply without hesitation “To
the second, the fulcrum being in the water and the resistance
acting at the rowlock.” I propose to show that the answer is
erroneous, and that the vulgar conception of the oar as a lever
of the first order is correct.
   In fact, if the supposed answer were correct, it would fol
low—first, that the power would have the advantage over the
resistance in the proportion of about 4 to 3 (this being usually
about the proportion of the whole length of the oar to the part
outside the rowlock); secondly, that if we moved the hands
nearer to the rowlock we should gradually but slightly dimi

                  of Lever does the Oar belong?                  59
nish the advantage and increase the effort, until, when the
hands were applied at the rowlock, power and resistance
would be exactly equal, and the boat would still be moved,
only with one third more effort. If we continued to move the
hands till they were applied to the oar at one fourth of its
length outside the rowlock, we should still propel the boat
forwards, though with twice the original effort. Finally, if
we contrived by a rope to pull at the blade of the oar (that is,
at the fulcrum) we should produce no motion whatever. It
is needless to point out how unlike these the actual facts are.
If the power is applied to the oar at the rowlock no effect is
produced; if it is applied outside, the motion of the boat is
reversed; and the maximum effect in this direction is pro
duced if the power is applied to the blade. This is proof that
the true fulcrum (relative to the rower) is at the rowlock,
On one hypothesis only is the oar a lever of the second order;
viz. if the rower stands on terra firma.     In that case all the
consequences above mentioned as resulting from a change in
the point of application of the power will really result.
   Let us put another hypothetical case. Suppose the rower
to be in the boat as usual, but the boat to be fixed, while the
oar presses against another boat which is free to move. In
this case the oar is manifestly a lever of the first order; but
the relative position and action of the oar, the power, and the
resistance are in every respect precisely the same as in ordinary
rowing.
   The fact is that writers on Mechanics have strangely enough
neglected to consider that the rower is in the boat, and that
therefore the reaction of his effort is against the boat itself. To
him the boat is terra firma. It will perhaps be said that we
have only to take this reaction into account, and that then the
account given of the oar as a lever of the second order will
appear to be correct. True; and we might similarly treat
almost any lever of the first order as belonging to the second ;
but when writers tell us that the oar is a lever of such and
such a kind, they are supposed to mean that it is so relatively
to the rower, not relatively to the universe.
   I find it stated in some books on Mechanics that the amount
of work done in rowing has not been estimated; and this is
no wonder, if the nature of the effort has been so misconceived.
It cannot be said that the difference is unimportant practically,
if this means that it does not matter which theory we act on.
If we suppose, as above, that the distance from the rowlock to
the handle is successively one eighth, one fourth, one third,
and one half the length of the oar, then the proportion of
power to resistance would be successively:—

  60      To what Order of Lever does the Oar belong?
           On the common theory ......        ####
           On the true theory      ......... 7, 3, 2, 1.
 Thus the effect of outrigging, so as to place the rowlock at
 one fourth the length of the oar instead of one eighth, would,
 on the common view, only be to increase the power by one
 sixth ; on the other view, it more than doubles it.
    Again, if we suppose the oar to remain with the rowlock at
 one fourth of its length, while the hands are successively at
 the handle, one eighth from the handle, at the rowlock, and
 one eighth and one fourth outside, the successive proportions
 of power to resistance are:—

 (the minus sign representing the reversal of the effect). It
 cannot be said that this difference is practically unimportant,
 except in the sense that practical men will be led by expe
 rience, and not by a theory so manifestly erroneous as the
 former. It would be enough for such men to be told that,
according to this theory, it is easier to move a boat by rowing
than by dragging.
   Now let us look at the case of a canoe. Here we may sup
pose that the middle of the paddle remains at the same distance
 from the canoer's body. Practically it is as if the paddle were
attached at its middle point to a rigid rod resting against his
body. If we are to apply to this case the same sort of reason
ing which writers on Mechanics use in the former case, we
must treat this middle point as the point of application of the
resistance. Then we have the result that, as one hand moves
forward and the other backward, they counteract one another.
This is, I think, a reductio ad absurdum. There is no alter
native but to treat the middle point as the virtual fulcrum.
The actual fulcrum is of course in the body of the canoer, but
this does not affect the question.
   There are two analogous cases which seem worth consider
ing. First, that of a paddle-steamer. Here there is an
instantaneous lever of which the point that is actually at rest
is the lowest float in the water; and following the received
theory of the oar, or rather on the same principle, we should
regard this as the fulcrum, the resistance acting at the shaft
or axis of the wheel.        It would follow that when the

            Influence of Condition on Vapour-pressure.           61
crank is in the lower part of its course, the power would be
acting against the motion of the ship. It is perfectly obvious
that the true fulcrum (from a practical point of view) is at
the shaft, and the resistance in the water. If we choose to
treat the point of instantaneous rest as the fulcrum, we must
introduce complications which will only result in bringing us
back to the simple practical view.
   Another analogous case is that of a bicycle rider. I need
not dwell on this, as, mutatis mutandis, the same considera
tions apply as in the case of the steamer.
   The true theory of the oar has been discussed recently in
an appendix to a pamphlet entitled Ausa Dynamica, published
under the pseudonym of “John O'Toole” ". . The author
 remarks that “In certain emergencies it might be highly
 desirable for the captain of a vessel to know that the ‘power.”
 of an ordinary oar-lever is at a mechanical disadvantage. If
 he is unaware of this, or, still more, if he believes the opposite,
 he may send out an insufficient boat-crew to tow his vessel
 out of danger. It is highly probable,” he adds, “that vessels
 have been actually lost in this way.”
VIII. Influence of Change of Condition from the Liquid to the
    Solid State on Vapour-pressure. By W. RAMSAY, Ph.D.,
    and SYDNEY YoUNG, D.Sc.f
 IN     Wiedemann's Annalen, vol. xxviii. p. 400, W. Fischer
     has published a paper on the above subject. After stating,
 in the course of a historical sketch, that no experimental
 work with a view to decide whether the vapour-pressure of a
 solid is identical with that of its liquid at the same tempera
 ture below the melting-point of the solid has been carried out
 since Regnault's time, he corrects himself in a footnote in
 which he refers to a paper published by us on this subject in
 the Philosophical Transactions in 1884. He there states,
 however, that he gained a prize through some work on the
vapour-pressures of water and of benzene in 1883.         Now it is
 £ understood             that priority is determined, not by the
  ate at which work is done, but by the date of publication;
 and as Fischer's work was not made public until July 1886,
 there can be no question of priority between us.        But in the
 short sentence on our work he commits a grave error in stating
   * Dublin: Hodges and Figgis.

 62           Drs. Ramsay and Young on the Influence
that our work was merely qualitative; on the contrary, it was
 rigorously quantitative; and we then showed that the num
 bers calculated for the vapour-pressure of ice, using as data
an extension of the vapour-pressures of water below 0°, ex
 trapolated from Regnault's measurements above 0°, his deter
 minations of the heat of vaporization of water and fusion
 of ice, and of the specific heat of ice, agreed closely with
 those found by us. As regards benzene,        £         our work
had no pretence to be quantitative.
    Fischer's experiments were made by a process identical in
 principle with that employed by Regnault. The water, or
benzene, on which he experimented, was introduced, by a pro
 cess well devised for excluding air, into a vacuum connected
 with a gauge, and on alterating the temperature of the liquid,
 alteration of pressure was noted and registered. His experi
 mental results are very regular, and, so far as water and ice
are concerned, confirm ours, and agree well with theory.
    But although Fischer's experimental results with benzene
 are equally regular, yet they present certain anomalies which
 are difficult to explain. From his results he calculated con
stants—one series to    £         the relations of the pressure of
vapour in contact with liquid, and the other to represent
similar relations for vapour in contact with solid, employing
formulae of the general form p=a+bt+ct”. From the num
bers calculated by means of these constants, he concluded that
the vapour-pressure of liquid benzene is not identical with that
of solid benzene at the melting-point of the solid. This conclu
sion is evidently opposed to the second law of thermodynamics;
and, if it had not been apparently supported by Fischer's really
excellent experimental measurements, might have been dis
missed at once as absurd. But on revising Fischer’s results,
we find that the constants employed by him, if used to calcu
late the vapour-pressures of the £ at low temperatures,
give results which are by no means in accordance with his
measurements. Indeed at -8° the calculated pressure is
13:51 millim., whereas Fischer found 14.2 millim.; and it is
evident, from a graphic representation of his results, that the
divergence would increase at lower temperatures. Now it is
known that the relations of pressure to temperature are better
expressed by means of a formula of the type suggested by
Biot, p=a+ba' +c/3”; or, for a small range of pressure, by
the simpler form p=a+ba'. On calculating constants from
Fischer's results by means of this formula, we found that while
a curve was obtained agreeing better with his experimental
results, the anomaly which he supposed (viz. want of coinci

         of Change of Condition on Vapour-pressure.           63
dence at the melting-point) no longer existed. As in the case
of water and ice, solid and liquid acetic acid, solid and liquid
bromine, and solid and liquid iodine, which have formed the
subject of our experiments (Phil. Trans. 1884, p. 461, and
Trans. Chem. Soc. 1886, p. 453), solid and liquid benzene
exert the same vapour-pressure at the melting-point.
   For recalculating Fischer's results, his pressures at -7°,
–2°, and +3° were taken. At -7°, the vapour-pressure of
the solid determined by him was 15:273 millim.; at -2°,
21.679 millim.; and at +3°, 30.324 millim. The constants
are a=4:81664; log b=0.5602315; log a=199628446; b is
negative; and t = temperature centigrade +7. For the
vapour-pressures of liquid benzene, Fischer’s results agree well
with his formula. As data are in existence whereby the
vapour-pressures of solid benzene can be calculated for a short
interval of temperature below the melting-point, provided
those of the liquid are accurately known, it was deemed ad
visable to check Fischer's results with liquid benzene by the
dynamical method already described by us (Trans. Chem. Soc.
1885, p. 42).
   This was accordingly done. A large quantity of commer
cial benzene was distilled, and the first half, boiling within
five degrees, was frozen twice, the liquid portion being poured
off each time. The solid portion was then shaken repeatedl
with sulphuric acid until the acid was no longer       £
thiophene being thus removed. The remainder was shaken
with water and dried, and then fractionated until a product of
constant boiling-point was obtained. The actual boiling-point,
at a pressure of 753.4 millim., was 79°9.
   The following determinations with the liquid were made.
At the lower temperature, thermometers graduated in To divi
sions were employed. The zero-points of these thermometers,
and the apparent lowering of temperature consequent on
reduction of pressure, were determined, and corresponding
corrections introduced. For higher temperatures (above 50°),
a thermometer previously used for determination of vapour
pressures, and of which the corrections had been thoroughl
investigated, was used. The three T', thermometers we shall
name A, B, and C.; the one used at higher temperatures, D.

   These numbers agree fairly well with Regnault's results at
and above 10°,       £ that temperature his constants are
calculated from the vapour-pressures of the solid as well as of
the liquid, and of course are therefore incorrect.

        3       31-10       31-26
   It will be seen that the agreement is a very close one; and
as our determinations were made by the dynamical method,
while Fischer's were obtained statically, there is a strong pre
sumption that the substance in both cases was pure.
   In order to calculate the vapour-pressures of solid from
those of liquid benzene, the following formula was employed:—
Vapour-pressure of solid at (t–1)=P,-(P'-P              -0(*#):    t-3
                 P = vapour-pressure of solid;
                 P = vapour-pressure of liquid;
                 W =heat of vaporization of liquid;
                 F =heat of fusion of solid;
                 t = temperature of solid and liquid.
    It is therefore necessary to know the heat of vaporization
of liquid benzene at different temperatures, and the heat of
 fusion of solid benzene; and in order to calculate these, the
 specific heats of liquid and of solid benzene. The following
 determinations are available :
     1. Heat of Vaporization of Liquid Benzene-Regnault
 (Mémoires de l'Institut, xxvi. p. 881) has determined the total
heats of vaporization of benzene at different temperatures,
 while Schiff (Annalen, ccxxxiv. p. 344) has made a single
 determination at the boiling-point. Regnault's formula is
                             H=a+bt+ct”,
 where a=109, b=0.24429, and c= -0.0001315.                  Schiff's
    Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 23. No. 140, Jan. 1887.             F

 66             Drs. Ramsay and Young on the Influence
 single determination at the boiling-point, 80°35, at a pressure
 of 765.1 millim., is 93.4 to 93.5 calories.
     2. Heats of Fusion of Solid Benzene.—Peterson and Wid
 mann (J. prakt. Chem. xxiv. p. 129) give the number 29'09
 calories; and Fischer (loc. cit.) found 30.085 calories.
     3. Specific Heat of Liquid Benzene.—This has been often
 observed. But isolated observations are for our purpose
 comparatively valueless, for the specific heat varies with the
 temperature. Formulae are given only by Schüller (Pogg.
 Ann., Ergänzungs-Band, p. 5), and by Schiff (loc. cit.). We
have used Schiff’s formula. It is, specific heat=a+bt; where
 a=0.3834 and b = 0-001043.             Between narrow limits of tem
perature this may be accepted as sufficiently correct.
     4. Specific Heat of Solid Benzene.—Fischer (loc. cit.) gives
0.319.
    Calculating the heat of vaporization at the boiling-point
under     '' pressure from Regnault’s total heats of volatili
zation and Schiff’s specific heat of liquid benzene, the number
 93.67 is obtained; while Schiff found by direct measurement
93.4 to 93.5. This is a strong presumption in favour of the
correctness of the data.
    The mean of the two determinations of the heats of fusion
of benzene was taken.
    The following Table summarizes the data for calculating
the vapour-pressures of the solid. But this calculation in
volves the assumption that the heat evolved on solidification
at any low temperature is equal to that evolved at the ordinary
melting-point, minus the product of the specific heat of the
solid into the difference of temperature; and that the specific
volume of the vapour in contact with solid is equal to ' of
vapour in contact with liquid. It is certain that neither of
these assumptions is true; hence it is not legitimate to calcu
late the vapour-pressures of the solid from those of the liquid.
Still, for some degrees below the melting-point, the error
involved in these assumptions is probably not very great.

    For the first two series thermometers A and B were used;
 for Series III. another thermometer, D; and it will be seen
 that its readings confirm those of the other two. The indi
 vidual results are not so concordant as Fischer's.                    The
 reason is that the volatilization of solid benzene is so quick
 as to make it difficult to obtain an accurate reading before
 the solid has volatilized and partially exposed the thermo
 meter-bulb. These numbers, near the melting-point, show
 close concordance with those of Fischer, but at lower tem
 peratures they show       '        of divergence. For example at
  –8:42, if Biot's formula be applied, the difference between
 Fischer's results and ours amounts to 1:39 millim. ; and it is
 evident, from the graphical representation, that the difference
 would be an increasing one. It is to be noted that Biot's
 formula agrees with Fischer’s own results much better than
 the formula employed by him.

    “On the Drifts of the Vale of Clwyd, and their relation to the
Caves and Cave-deposits.” By Prof. T. M“Kenny Hughes, M.A.,
F.G.S.
    The Author divided his subject as follows:–I. Introductory Re
 marks; II. The Drifts, viz. (i.) The Arenig Drift, (ii.) The St.-Asaph
 Drift, (iii.) The Surface-Drifts; III. The Caves, viz. (i.) The Caves
 themselves, (ii.) The Cave-Deposits; IW. Conclusion.
     He exhibited a table showing the tentative classification he pro
 posed. II. (i.) The Arenig Drift, he said, might be called the
  Western Drift, as all the material of which it was composed came
 from the mountains of Wales; or the Great Ice-Drift, as it was the
 only drift in the Vale which contained evidence of direct ice-action.
 He traced its course from the Arenig and Snowdon ranges by striae
 on the solid rock and by the included fragments, a large proportion
 of which were glaciated. There are no shells in this drift.
     II. (ii.) The St.-Asaph Drift might, he said, be called the Northern
  Drift, as it was the deposit in which fragments of north-country
  rocks first appeared; or the Marine Drift, as it was, excepting the
  recent deposits at the mouth of the estuary, the only drift in the
  Vale which showed by its character and contents that it was a sea
  deposit. It contained north-country granites, flints, and sea-shells,
  of which he gave lists. Most of them are common on the adjoin
  ing coast at the present day, a few are more northern forms.
  None of the rocks are striated, except those derived from the
  Arenig Drift (i.).
     II. (iii.) The Surface-Drifts included the older and newer alluvia
  of the rivers, the Morfa Rhuddlau Beds or estuarine silt, the recent
  shore-deposits or Rhyl Beds, and all the various kinds of deposits
  known as talus, trail, rain-wash, head, run-of-the-hill, &c., of which,
  in so long a time, very thick masses have accumulated in many
  places. He explained some methods of distinguishing gravels accord
  ing to their origin.
      Turning to the subject of Caves, he thought they should be careful

 70                       Geological Society:—
 not to confound (III. i.) the question of the age and origin of the
 caves themselves with (III. ii.) that of the deposits in the caves.
He then described some of the more important caves of the district,
 explaining the evidence upon which he founded the opinion that
the deposits in Pontnewydd Cave were Postglacial Palaeolithic. He
 arrived at the same conclusion with regard to the deposits in the
 Ffynnon Beuno Caves. Combating the objections to this view which
 had recently been urged, he pointed out that the drifts associated
 with the deposits in those caves cannot have been formed before the
 submergence described under II. (ii.), because they contained north
 country fragments and flints, and that, even if they were of the age
 of the submergence, they would not be preglacial; that they cannot
 have been formed during the submergence, as the sea would have
 washed away the bones &c. from the mouth of the cave, and its
 contents must have shown some evidence of having been sorted by
 the sea. He considered that the greater part of the material that
 blocked the upper entrance of the upper cave belonged to the
 surface-drifts described under II. (iii.), and were, as they stood,
 almost all subaerial.
    He further pointed out that, so far as palaeontologists had been
 able to lay before them any chronological divisions founded on the
 Mammalia, the fauna of the Ffynnon Beuno Caves agreed with the
 later rather than with the earlier Pleistocene groups.
  December 1.—Prof. J. W. Judd, F.R.S., President, in the Chair.
    The President announced that he had received from Prof. Ulrich,
 of Dunedin, N.Z., the announcement of a very interesting discove
 which he had recently made. In the interior of the South Island
 of New Zealand there exists a range of mountains, composed of
 olivine-enstatite rocks, in places converted into serpentine. The
 sand of the rivers flowing from these rocks contains metallic particles
 which, on analysis, prove to be an alloy of nickel and iron in the
 proportion of two atoms of the former metal to one of the latter.
 Similar particles have also been detected in the serpentines. This
alloy, though new as a native terrestrial product, is identical with
the substance of the Octibeha meteorite, which has been called
octibehite.    Prof. Ulrich has announced his intention of communi
cating to the Society a paper dealing with the details of this inter
esting discovery—which is certainly one of the most interesting
that has been made since the recognition of the terrestrial origin
of the Ovifak irons.

will be devoted to a microscopic description of the rocks.

             Metamorphic Rocks of the Malvern Hills.                  71
   The author referred especially to the paper by the late Dr. Holl,
whose work he, in the main, confirmed. Dr. Holl's object was to
demonstrate that the rocks which had hitherto been treated as
syenite, and supposed to form the axis of the hills, were in reality
of metamorphic origin, and belonged to the Pre-Cambrian. Mr.
Rutley restricted his observations to the old ridge of gneissic syenite,
granite, &c., which constitutes the main portion of the range, and,
reversing the order of his predecessor, commenced at the north end
of the chain.
   He considers that the beds of crystalline rock, mostly of a gneissic
character, in the old ridge have been disposed in a synclinal flexure,
which stretched from the north end of the chain to the middle of
Swinyard's Hill, where they receive an anticlinal flexure, and are
faulted out of sight. The length of this synclinal fold would be
over 53 miles. The lithological evidence is in favour of the rocks
forming the north part of Swinyard's Hill being a repetition of
those on the Worcestershire Beacon. We might expect to find the
older beds having the coarsest granulation, and being even devoid
of foliation, and this is what occurs on the Malverns, where the
northern hills are made up of the coarsest rocks, with finer schistose
beds towards the south; the exception is at Swinyard's Hill; hence
there are two groups of coarsely crystalline rocks at either ex
tremity of the presumed synclinal. The contrast between these and
the fine-grained rocks of the other portions of the range has already
attracted attention.     The most northern of the coarse-grained
masses is cut off towards the south by a fault near the Wych, while
the other lies between a fault on the north side of the Herefordshire
Beacon and the before-mentioned fault on Swinyard's Hill.
   The metamorphic rocks of the Malverns seem, therefore, to be
divisible into three series extending from the North Hill to Key's
End. A Lower, of coarsely crystalline gneissic rocks, granite,
syenite, &c., a Middle, of gneissic, granitic and syenitic rocks of
medium and fine texture, and an Upper, of mica-schist, finely crys
talline gneiss, &c. A diagrammatic section shows the distribution
of these; the northern block, extending as far as the Wych, consists
of the Lower and the lower part of the Middle; the central block,
from the Wych to the fault in Swinyard's Hill, consists chiefly of
the Lower and upper Middle, but with a portion of the Lower at
the south end. The southern block, south of the fault on Swinyard's
Hill, consists wholly of the Upper series.
    How far the foliation of these rocks and their main divisional
planes represent original stratification must, the author thought,
remain an open question. It has been held that the strike of foliation
lies parallel to the axis of elevation; but this is far from being the
case in the Malverns. Still a once uniform strike may have been
dislocated by repeated faulting.
    The author further discussed the general question of how far
foliation may or may not coincide with planes of sedimentation.
 He admitted that the absolute conversion of one rock into another
 by a process of shearing has been shown to occur, but doubted
 its application in this case. Although he is inclined to believe

   72            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
   that the divisional planes, with which the foliation appears to be
   parallel, may be planes of original stratification, yet, as a matter of
  fact, they are nothing more than structural planes of some sort,
  between which the rocks exhibit divers lithological characters.

              ON A NEARLY PERFECT SIMPLE PENDULUM.
        To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
        GENTLEMEN,
  IN an article by Mr. Thomas Gray, communicated a few days ago
       to the Philosophical Magazine *, he has described experiments,
 carried out in conjunction with myself, on the oscillations, in a
 Sprengel vacuum, of a torsion vibrator hung by a single silk fibre.
 The performance of the tiny vibrator were so remarkable, that we
 are proposing to carry the experiments farther; but in the mean
 time they have led me in a somewhat different direction. With
 the assistance of Mr. Gray, I have suspended a small shot a little
 more than I's inch in diameter by a single silk fibre (half a cocoon
 fibre) two feet long. This I have placed in a glass tube about three
 quarters of an inch in internal diameter, and have exhausted with
 the Sprengel pump to about 0.1 M (one tenth of a millionth of an
 atmosphere). A most perfect “simple pendulum ” is thus obtained;
 and I find that starting it with a vibrational range of inch on
each side of the middle position, the vibrations are very easily
countable at the end of 14 hours.
    The weight of the lead shot used is only $gramme; and a single
silk fibre will bear nearly three grammes. I am proceeding to make
a “seconds” pendulum, 39.1, inches long, with a heavier weight
than that used at present, and it will be enclosed in a much better
vacuum than 0.1 M. With such a pendulum, I hope that I may
obtain a still slower subsidence; and I propose to find, if possible,
whether the subsidence observed is due to residual air, or to
viscosity of the fibre.                     Your obedient servant,

XI. The Determination of the Constitution of Carbon Com
   pounds from Thermochemical Data.               y HENRY E.
   ARMSTRONG, F.R.S., Professor of Chemistry, City and
   Guilds of London Institute Central Institution *.
TH:      -past year has witnessed the publication of the
       fourth and concluding volume of Julius Thomsen's
Thermochemische Untersuchungen, an event of high import
ance on account of the magnitude of the work and of the
reputation for accuracy which its author enjoys. Indeed the
unwearying perseverance and great manipulative skill which
have enabled him to accumulate the mass of data now pub
lished in a collected form must excite the admiration and
wonder of all who are able to judge of the difficulties to
be overcome in the execution of thermochemical determi
nations.
   In the present article I desire to direct attention to the
fourth volume, which is wholly devoted to the description of
determinations of the heat generated on combustion of no less
than one hundred and twenty distinct carbon compounds—
members of about twenty different groups, and also to a
theoretical discussion of the results and their bearing on
received views of the constitution of carbon compounds. As
many of the conclusions are directly opposed to, and irrecon
cilable with, popular views, it is desirable that they should be
 brought more directly under the notice of British chemists,
 and that the interpretations which Thomsen puts upon his
results should be carefully considered and criticised. I may
                  * Communicated by the Author.

74      Prof. H. E. Armstrong on the Determination of
also add that I have been led to take a special interest in the
work, as many of the results appear to me to lend considerable
support to my own views of the nature of chemical affinity,
serving to confirm the hypothesis that the affinity relations
of the negative elements are altogether peculiar, emphasized
by me in my Address to the Chemical Section of the British
Association at Aberdeen in 1885, and more fully developed
 in a recent paper on “Electrolytic Conduction in relation to
Molecular Composition, Valency and the nature of Chemical
 Change: being an attempt to apply a theory of “Residual
Affinity’” (Proc. Roy. Soc. 1886, vol. xl. pp. 268–291).
    (1) Manner in which Results are stated.—All the heats of
combustion of the carbon compounds that will be referred to
are calculated on the assumption that the substance burnt is
in the state of gas at 18°C., and that the products are gaseous
carbon dioxide and liquid water at this temperature; they are
stated in gram-”C. units. The symbol f stands for “heat of
combustion,” and when prefixed to a symbol or formula it
denotes the heat of combustion of the weight in grams corre
 sponding to the symbol or formula used.
   The heat of formation of a compound is the difference
between its heat of combustion and the heat of formation of
the products of combustion; the heat of formation of carbon
dioxide being taken as 96960 units and that of liquid water
at 18° as 38360 units.    The value thus calculated is the heat
of formation at constant pressure; that at constant volume is
deduced by subtracting from it (n–2) x 290, n being the
number of atoms of gaseous constituents which go to form
the molecule of the compound. For example, f.    &#.    211930
 units. The heat developed in the combustion of the same
quantity of the contained elements would be 96960+2.68360
 =233680 units, the difference between which and f. CH, is
 233680–211930=21750 units, being the heat of formation
of methane at constant pressure; as four atoms of its gaseous
constituent go to form a molecule of methane, 21750–580=
21170 units is the heat of formation of methane at constant
volume.
   In previous publications Thomsen has disregarded the
molecular composition of the elements, and has used equa
tions such as
          C,03–96960 units, H2,0=38360 units;
meaning thereby that in the formation of the compound CO:
from the elements carbon and oxygen, or of the compound
H2O from the elements hydrogen and oxygen, the specified
amounts of heat are developed, the comma being used by him

              the Constitution of Carbon Compounds.                       75
always to denote combination of the elements between which
it is placed in the proportions indicated by the symbols. This
disregard of molecular composition has undoubtedly served to
mislead. But the discussion of the amounts of energy to be
expended in the separation of atoms is an important part of
the present work; and for this purpose Thomsen introduces
the practice of representing atomic proportions of elements by
means of small letters. Thus C is used by him as representing
carbon as we know it, and c to indicate a carbon atom; so that
 if f. C denote the heat of combustion of ordinary (amorphous)
carbon, f. c is to be taken as denoting the heat of combustion
 of carbon in the atomic condition. This appears to me to be
 a most undesirable and unnecessary practice, and of set pur
 pose I have not adopted it, but have preferred instead to write
 the equations so as to indicate the molecular composition of
 the gases dealt with. It is far better to use C, as the symbol
 of carbon of unknown molecular composition and thus remind
 the reader of our ignorance; and Ci is the proper symbol of a
  monatomic carbon molecule".
     (2) Difference in the Heats of Combustion of Homologues.—
 The first noteworthy conclusion arrived at by Thomsen is that
 the heat of combustion increases from term to term in a series
  of homologous compounds by an almost constant amount: on
  an average by 157897 units. Of the forty-four differences
  cited (Table    £), the minimum        is 155120 and the maximum
  159563, only five departing by more than one per cent. from
 the mean f.
    * The failure to realize the importance of molecular composition in
  relation to chemical change, which unfortunately is so clearly traceable
  in our chemical literature, probably is in a great measure due to our want
  of system in writing the formulae of elements. I have more than once
  urged that an index should be used after the symbol of an element only
  to denote the number of its atoms in the molecule. If this practice be
  consistently followed and the index be used also in the case of monatomic
  elements, the absence of an index after the symbol of an element would
  at once serve to indicate that the molecular composition of the particular
  element (as gas) is unknown.
     + It $'. noted that all the compounds included in the Table are
  members of the paraffinoid class; also that the comparison is made be
  tween closely related bodies, a large majority being true homologues, i.e.
  bodies of the same type formed from one another by the mere introduc
  tion of CH, in place of H. If the heats of combustion of the benzenes
  examined by Thomsen be compared, it will be observed that whereas the
  difference between benzene and toluene
                   C.H.—C.H. =955680–799350=156330,
  is very near the average value (157897), the difference between toluene
   and pseudocumene or mesitylene,

   Important confirmation of the value found by Thomsen for
w in the equation

combustion of propyl, isobutyl, amyl and capryl alcohols in

is considerably above the highest of the forty-four differences in Table I.
Thomsen himself, however, calls attention to the probable inaccuracy of
the number for pseudocumene and mesitylene, the determination being
very difficult in the case of bodies so rich in carbon and of such high
boiling-point.
   It should here be mentioned that Stohmann, Rodatz and Herzberg
 (Journ, für praktische Chemie, 1886, xxxiii. p. 241) have called in ques
tion the number 799.350 given by Thomsen. These chemists find 787488
 units as the heat of combustion of benzene-vapour at 17°, that of liquid
benzene at 17° being 779262 units—a value which differs from that given
by Berthelot (776000 units), only in the ratio of 100.4 to 100, and is
almost identical with the value found—but rejected—by Thomsen in the
second of his four sets of determinations of the heat of combustion of
benzene.       It is perhaps noteworthy that the difference between Stoh
mann's value for      £ and Thomsen's value for toluene, viz. 168192=
955680–787488, is very nearly the same as half the difference found by
Thomsen to obtain between the heats of combustion of toluene and
trimethylbenzene.

the difference between the heat of combustion of phenol and
that of the homologue when both are in the same state of
aggregation.
   (3) Equality of the Four Affinities of Carbon.—On reference
to Table I., it will be noticed that on passing from methane
to ethane or methylmethane, from ethane to propane or
dimethylmethane, and thence to tri- and tetramethylmethane,
the heat of combustion increases at each step to the same
extent: the displacement of hydrogen by methyl, in fact,
appears always to involve the same development of heat; and
hence it may be inferred that the four affinities of the carbon
atom are of equal value. Thomsen also finds that ethylene
and ethylidene chlorides have identical heats of combustion
(272000 units); and that there is practically no difference
between those of allyl chloride, CH2. CH. CH2Cl (442500
units), and the isomeric monochloropropylene, CH2. CCl. CH3
(441190 units). These facts, and also the practical identity
of the heats of combustion of isomeric phenols established
by Stohmann’s determinations (Table II.), may be adduced
as confirmatory of the above deduction.
   (4) Heat of Combustion of Gaseous “Atomic” Carbon and
the Amount of Heat required to separate “Doubly-linked” Car
bon Atoms.—On comparing the heats of combustion of bodies
differing in composition    #   one or more atoms of carbon
(Table  £,    it is seen that the heat of combustion of carbon
in its compounds must be greater than that of the ordinary
amorphous variety of carbon (96960 units). The average
value deduced from fourteen comparisons is 121085 (in round
numbers 121090) units, the extremes being 115610 units (the
difference between ethyl- and allylamine), and 125750 units
(the difference between diethyl £ diallyl ether),—a somewhat
wide range be it remarked.
   In the instances given in the Table the comparison is in
stituted between a saturated and an unsaturated compound,
the latter being formed from the former by the addition of a
carbon atom which, according to the popular view, becomes
doubly linked with another carbon atom; the amount of heat
developed by this “double-linking” of two carbon atoms (v2)
is the difference between the heat of combustion of gaseous
“atomic ’’ carbon (f. C1) and the factor 121090, i.e.
                   f. C1=121090 units+ v2.
   Now if carbon dioxide were capable of combining with an
atom of carbon, it is to be supposed that it would form an
unsaturated compound, CO: CO, bearing the same relation
to it that ethylene bears to methane, and that the heat of

combustion of this compound would exceed that of carbon
dioxide by 121090 units; whence it follows, the heat of com
bustion of carbon dioxide being nil, that the heat of com
bustion of the product in question should be 121090 units.
In point of fact, however, two molecules of carbon monoxide
are produced by assimilating an atom of carbon with a mole
cule of carbon dioxide, the double linkage becoming annulled,
while at the same time the volume is doubled.    In the act of
expansion 580 units are absorbed (§ 1): hence the heat of
combustion of the product of the union of an atom of carbon
with a molecule of carbon dioxide exceeds 121090 units by
the amount absorbed in the separation of “doubly-linked”
carbon atoms plus 580 units. The heat of combustion of
2. CO is 135920 units; therefore
      f. C1 =121090+ v =135920-580=135340 units.
   It being thus determined that
                     f. C1–135340 units,
it follows that
                        v2=14250 units.

solid amorphous state to the gaseous atomic state will be
38380 units for each gram-atomic-proportion (12 grams).
The heat developed in the formation of a compound at con
stant pressure from gaseous atomic carbon may hence be cal
culated by adding for each atom of carbon in the molecule
38380 units to the uncorrected heat of formation (§ 1) cal
culated for carbon in the amorphous state. All the heats
of formation subsequently to be given are deduced in this
Inflnner.
   (6) Heat developed in the Combination of Hydrogen with
Carbon.—The heat of formation of methane, CH4, at constant
volume, calculated on the assumption that it results from the
combination of ordinary hydrogen with gaseous “atomic ’’
carbon—of two hydrogen molecules with one carbon atom—is
59550 units; that of ethylene, C2H4, is 73470 units. Both
contain the same number of hydrogen atoms, but in the latter
there are two “doubly-linked ” carbon atoms—assuming
ethylene to have the constitution popularly assigned to it:
the heat of formation of the two hydrocarbons should, there

 82       Prof. H. E. Armstrong on the Determination of
 fore, differ by v, i.e. 14250 units (§ 4). The difference
  73470–14250=59220 units is the heat developed in the
 combination of two atoms of carbon with two molecules of
 hydrogen; while the heat of formation of methane—59550
 units—is that developed in the union of the same quantity of
 hydrogen with a single atom of carbon. The two values may
 be regarded as identical; and hence, argues Thomsen, it may
 be concluded that the four atoms of hydrogen are equally
 firmly held, whether they are associated with a single or with
 two carbon atoms *.
     Halving the numbers 59220 and 59.550, we have 29610
 and 29775 units as the heat developed in the combination
  of a gram-molecular proportion of hydrogen with gaseous
  atomic carbon. The value 29775 is denoted by Thomsen by
 the symbol 2r.
     (7) Heat developed in the Combination of Carbon Atoms by
  single, double and treble Affinities.—The amounts of heat
  developed in the combination of (gram-atomic proportions of)
  carbon atoms by one, two, and three “affinities” of each, i. e.
  in the manner in which they are assumed to be associated in
  the paraffins, in ethylene, and in acetylene respectively, may
  be designated by the symbols vi, v.2, vs.
     It has been previously shown that v2=14250 units.
     As regards the value of v1, the heat developed in the
  formation of ethane, C2H6, results from the combination
  of three hydrogen molecules with two carbon atoms, and
  of these carbon atoms with each other by single affinities;
hence:
                (2C, 3H2)=3.2r + v = 104160 units.
              ‘. v1=104160-89325 = 14835 units.
 Or, comparing ethane with benzene, and assuming that there
 is one single linkage between carbon atoms in the former and
 nine such in the latter ($8),
                   (6C,3H)=216740=3.2.49,
                   (2C, 3H2) = 104160=3.2r + vi,
            ... 8v1=216740–104160=112580 units.
                    ... v1 = 14073 and 2r=30029.
   * It should be noted, however, that the difference between the heats
of formation of methane and ethylene is the value v.; and that the
heat of formation being dependent on f. C., as f.C. and v, are both given
by the same equation, the calculated and found differences must be
identical; Thomsen's conclusion as regards the relation of the hydrogen
atoms in ethylene to the two carbon atoms must, therefore, be held to be
“not proven.”

              the Constitution of Carbon Compounds.                   83
   Discussing a series of cases in this way, Thomsen arrives
at the mean values 2r=30130 units; v1=14056 units.
   It will, however, be observed that the value of v1 is prac
tically identical with that previously found for v, ; whence it
follows that the same amount of heat is developed in the
combination of carbon atoms, whether they become singly or
doubly linked ; or, in other words, that there is no difference
between the two modes of union.
   The heat developed when carbon atoms become trebly
linked may be deduced from the heats of formation of ace
tylene, CH : CH, allylene, CHs. C : CH, and dipropargyl,
CH: C. CH2. CH, C : CH, viz. 28990, 74610, and 133080
units. Heat may be assumed to be developed in their for
mation in the manner indicated in the following equations:
                     (2C, H,) = 28990= 2r + vs,
                    (3C, 2H2) = 74610=2.2r + va,
                    (6C, 5H2)=133080=3.2r +2v3+3v1.
   Substituting for 2r and v1 the mean values above given, three
values of v3 are found, viz. –1140, 294, and 261 units. The
mean of these is -81 units, a value so small that it may be
neglected; and it would therefore appear that the so-called
treble linking of carbon atoms is unattended with the deve
lopment of heat.
   The data recorded by Thomsen afford, in his opinion,
abundant proof that a single carbon atom may retain two,
three, or four others with the same degree of firmness as one.
The following Table contains several examples, the values of
v (=v, or v2) being deduced by subtracting the heat due to
the combination of the hydrogen from the total heat of for
mation, 30000 units being taken as the mean value of 2r:—
                                    TABLE IV.

   But the one hundred and twenty compounds burnt do not
afford a single instance from which it can be inferred that
two carbon atoms are ever held together by a force exceeding
that equivalent to about 14200 heat-units.
   Hence Thomsen concludes that one carbon atom cannot be
united to another by several affinities; and that compounds in
which the carbon atoms are popularly supposed to be doubly

84      Prof. H. E. Armstrong on the Determination of
linked, must, in fact, be regarded as unsaturated; and that this
is more especially the case with compounds with so-called triple
bonds. #or the present it must be left undecided how the
carbon atoms are held together in compounds of this last
mentioned class; their union is certainly unattended with
development of heat. This conclusion, Thomsen considers, is
in agreement with experience : bodies with “trebly-linked ”
carbon atoms are in a condition of unstable equilibrium, which
is easily disturbed by external influences, and such compounds
are easily decomposable; this could not be the case if the
carbon atoms were firmly held together (comp. § 24).
   As the force with which carbon atoms are held together in
gaseous compounds—expressed in heat-units—never exceeds
about 14200 units, the separation of gaseous diatomic carbon
molecules into atoms would involve the absorption of only
this amount of heat per gram-atomic proportion. The much
greater absorption of heat in converting amorphous into
gaseous “atomic ’’ carbon may be explained by assuming that
each atom of carbon is combined with several others, that is
to say, that the molecule of carbon is complex; if the mole
cule contain five or more atoms, each atom may be in direct
connection with four other atoms: in such a case the number
of linkages will be twice the number of atoms, and the heat
developed on combination will be 2. 14200 units per gram
atomic proportion. The difference between this number and
38380 units—the amount of heat absorbed in converting
ordinary amorphous into gaseous “atomic” carbon—viz.
 9980 units, will be the amount required to gasify the carbon
as distinct from that absorbed in producing molecular dis
ruption.
    (8) Heat of Combustion of Isomeric Hydrocarbons. Con
stitution of Benzene.–From the foregoing explanations it
will be evident that the heat developed in the formation of a
gaseous hydrocarbon, C.H.2, from gaseous atomic carbon and
ordinary hydrogen at constant volume, may be expressed by
the formula
                  (Ca, H2) = 2b.  r + Xv
                           =b. 30000 + n . 14200.
If ordinary amorphous carbon be taken, the formula becomes
           (C, H2)=b. 30000+n. 14200-a .38380;
while the heat of formation under constant pressure may be
calculated from the equation
   (C, H2)=b. 30000+n. 14200-a .38380+(b–1)580.

              the Constitution of Carbon Compounds.                      85
The heat of combustion of a hydrocarbon C.H.2, is expressed
by the equation
         J. C.H.-a, '+'. *–C.H.
   Inverting the values for Co.               and    #0.       Viz. 96960
and 68360 units, and simplifying as far as possible, we obtain
the equation
       f.C.H2 =a. 135340+b. 37780—n. 14200+580,
from which the heats of combustion of hydrocarbons generally,
in the gaseous state, may be calculated.
   By comparing experimental values with those calculated
from the above equations, it is possible to distinguish between
alternative formulae in the case of hydrocarbons in which there
may be a difference in the number of “single (or double)
bonds.” For example, Thomsen argues that, if benzene has
the constitution represented by Kekulé's formula, its heat
 of formation would be 3.30000+ 6. 14200 = 175200 units;
 whereas, if each carbon atom be regarded as associated with
three others (as in the prism formula), its heat of formation
 should be 3. 30000+9. 14200 = 217800 units.                      There is
 thus a difference of 42600 between the two values. Actually
 Thomsen finds 216610", which agrees well with the higher
 value; and he therefore concludes that the six atoms of
 carbon in benzene are linked together by nine bonds. A
 comparison of the observed and calculated heats of forma
 tion of chlorobenzene, aniline and methylphenyl ether serves
 entirely to confirm this conclusion. In the case of dipro
 pargyl, the observed value, 133080 units, agrees well with
 that calculated on the assumption that it has the formula
                       CH: C. CH2. CH, C: CH,
 viz.
                132600 =3.30000+ 3. 14200 units.
    Thomsen cites 18 cases of hydrocarbons, in 15 of which the
 heat of formation thus reckoned is within 3 per mille of the
 observed heat of combustion, a degree of accuracy which
 closely approaches that obtainable experimentallyf.

    (9) Heat of Combustion of Haloid Compounds.—The heat
produced by the combination of the halogens may be deduced
by subtracting from the observed heat of formation of the
haloid compound from gaseous atomic carbon at constant
volume (P) that due to the combination of the carbon atoms
and of the hydrogen with the carbon atoms; the values
to be assigned to v and          #   in the case of the haloid com
pounds are, however, slightly different from those assigned in
the case of the hydrocarbons, viz.         #=    15720, v=13960.
    As regards the values for chlorine thus arrived at, it will
be seen, on reference to the last column of Table W., that six
 of the eight compounds containing a single atom of chlorine
 give values of 13180 to 13750 units; in the case of allyl
chloride and the isomeric monochloropropylene the numbers
 are somewhat higher, viz. 14560 and 15870 units: hence the
 mean value is 13827 units". The mean values for compounds
 containing 2, 3, and 4 atoms of chlorine are 33090, 47320,
 and 59050 units respectively. It would appear, therefore,
 that the fixation of the four atoms of chlorine with which a
 carbon atom may combine, involves the development of unequal
 amounts of heat. Thomsen supposes that in the case of two
 of the atoms the heat developed amounts to about 16500 units,
 but to only about 13500 units in the case of the other two.
 Thus:
          #= 13500                        = 13500.     Found 13830.
          '-                    2.16500=33000,                  33390.
        3'- 18500+2.16500=46300.                                47.420.
        4'=2.18500+2.16500–60000.                               59.950.
     As regards the bromine compounds, it is only necessary to
 point out that of the heat developed in the formation of
 methyl, ethyl, and propyl bromide, the portion attributable to
 at disposal; and it is probable that the numbers for the two benzenes are
 inaccurate (compare footnote, § 2); therefore no great weight can be
 attached to these exceptions.
    * This, of course, is not the amount of heat developed in the combina
 tion of chlorine atoms with the hydrocarbon radicals, as heat is absorbed
 to an unknown extent in separating the atoms composing the diatomic
  chlorine (or bromine or iodine) molecules.

 88      Prof. H. E. Armstrong on the Determination of
 the combination of the bromine is 5430, 6040, and 6290 units;
 whereas in the case of allyl bromide, as in that of allyl chloride,
 there is a somewhat larger amount of heat developed, viz.
 7120 units.
    A comparison of the heats of combustion would appear to
 show that isomerism such as obtains between allyl chloride and
chloropropylene and between ethylene and ethylidene chlorides
 has no influence:

    (10) Heat of Combustion of Alcohols.—The thermal be
haviour of isomeric alcohols of the C, H2n+1. OH series is
very different from that of isomeric paraffins and their haloid
derivatives, as their heats of combustion are by no means the
same—the primary having higher heats of combustion than
the secondary, and the secondary higher than the tertiary.
The heat developed in the formation of the group C. OH may
be calculated by deducting from the observed heat of formation
at constant volume of the   •)
                               alcohol that of the hydrocarbon
 radical, assigning to r= #, as before, the value 15000 units,
and to v, (=v,) the value 14200 units. The numbers thus
 calculated are given in the last column of Table VI. It will
 be noticed that nearly the same values are found for the six
primary alcohols and (which is remarkable) phenol, and that
considerably higher values result in the remaining cases,
 especially in that of trimethylcarbinol.
    (11) Heat of Combustion of Ethers.—An ether being re
presented by the formula C. H. O. C. He, its heat of formation
may be expressed by the equation
                      P=(b-H 8)r + nv + m,
where n represents the number of single and double bonds,
and n the heat developed in the fixation of an atom of oxygen
by two carbon atoms.

that of methylallyl ether, the difference will be the value

    It therefore appears that v, and v2 have practically the
 same values in ethers as in hydrocarbons and alcohols. If,
 now, from the heat of formation, P, of an ether, the value nv
 be deducted, the difference will be the heat developed in the
 combination of b + 8 hydrogen atoms and of the two oxygen
 atoms to the carbon atom.                  On reference to Table    '# it
 will be seen that the quotient of P-nv by b + 8 +2 is prac
 tically a constant, the mean value being 15757 units, which is
 very nearly the value of             #=":      hence Thomsen concludes
  that the amount of heat developed in combination of an atom
  of oxygen with two carbon atoms is about the same as is
  developed by combination of a hydrogen molecule with a
  carbon atom.

     In this section occurs one of the most noteworthy of
 Thomsen's conclusions, viz. that ethylene oxide is in reality a
 dimethylene oxide of the formula CH2. O. CH2. The heat of
  formation of a compound of this formula is
                          (4+2) 15757=94540 units,
 which agrees well with the observed value 93980 units;
 whereas, assuming the formula to be that ordinarily accepted,
 the heat of formation should be greater by v, or about
  14,000 units.
    * It is not quite evident why the value of n is calculated in this
 manner; if deduced from the equation
                                m=(qb-nv)–(a+8)r,
 giving 2r the usual value (30000 units), its value is considerably higher,
 viz. 2. 17475 units in the case of dimethyl ether, for example, which is
  much above the value of 2r found in previous cases.

              the Constitution of Carbon Compounds.          91
     Thomsen also points out that, whereas the difference
  between the heats of formation of methane and methoxy
 methane or dimethyl ether is 65400 units, that between
 methoxymethane £ methylal—which is usually regarded as
 dimethoxymethane—is 76110 units, and that between methy
 lal and methylic orthoformate—which is commonly represented
 as trimethoxymethane CH(OMe)4—is 79730 units. Compar
 ing the heat of formation of methylal, C3H8O2, with that of
 methylethyl ether, C.H.0, there is a difference of 29500
 units; between methylic orthoformate, C.H10O3, and diethyl
 ether, C, HioO, there is a difference of 2.29920 units; so
 that the heat of formation is increased by the addition of an
 atom of oxygen by 29500 to 29920 units. This value very
 nearly corresponds to the difference between an alcohol and
the hydrocarbon from which it is formed, thus
           Methvl alcohol-methane=294.10 units.
           #          , -ethane =29620 ,
           Propyl , -propane =30290 ,
Thomsen therefore suggests that possibly the function of the
oxygen in bodies such as methylal and methylic orthoformate
is the same as that of the oxygen in alcohols.
    (12) Heat of Combustion of Aldehydes, Ketones, Acids,
Anhydrides and Ethereal Salts.—The observed heats of for
mation of a number of these compounds are given in Table
VIII., and also the values deduced by subtracting the amounts
of heat which it may be assumed are developed in the formation
of the hydrocarbon radicals.                 -
   The mean values which thus result, representing the heats
of formation of the characteristic groups in the aldehydes,
ketones and acids, are as follows:—
           Aldehydes . COH . . 65400 units
           Ketones . . CO           . . 54250 ,
           Acids . . . COOH. . 119960 ,
   It will be observed that 65400+54250=119650: in other
words, the amount of heat developed in the formation of the
carboxyl group of acids is the sum of that developed in the
formation of the group COH and CO. Hence Thomsen con
cludes that the aldehydes are unsaturated compounds of the
formula R. C(OH), inasmuch as it is to be supposed that the
ketones and acids are respectively constituted as represented
by the formulae
                  R.C: 0 and R. C.: O(OH).
   Deducting from the heat of formation of acetic anhydride,
284340 units, the value 6r--2v, the difference (165940 units)
will represent the heat developed in the formation of the
                               H2

   thrice (165940–3. 55310) that found for the group CO in
    ketones and acids, viz. 54250 units; so that it may be assumed
    that equal amounts of heat are developed in the formation of
    the groups C: O and C.O.C., both of which contain an
    oxygen atom united by two bonds to carbon. The values
    found for methylic and ethylic carbonate afford confirmation
    of this conclusion, inasmuch as 162155 units—the mean of
    the two values 161500 and 162810 units—which is the amount
    of heat developed in the fixation of the three oxygen atoms
    in the group C. O. CO. O. C., is thrice 54052.
       It will be observed on reference to the table that the heats
    of combustion of ethylic acetate and of methylic, isobutylic,
    and allylic formates give values for P-(mr + n) very different
    from those found for the five preceding ethereal salts in the
    list. Thomsen states that in the first instance the specimens
    of ethylic acetate examined gave very variable results, and
    that he had great difficulty in obtaining a pure substance by
    fractional distillation*. Ultimately two samples were prepared
       * R. Schiff has also recently called attention (Liebig's Annalen, 1886,
    vol. 234, p. 308) to the great difficulty of obtaining pure ethereal salts.

—one from absolute alcohol and crystallized acetic acid, the
other from ethyl iodide and argentic acetate—boiling at
 77°4–77°5, the heats of combustion of which were 548080
 and 549250 units, respectively. The value thus arrived at,
 however, is about 12000 units lower than that found for the
 allied ethereal salts, such as the metameric propylic formate,
 for example:     Thomsen is therefore inclined to think that the
 formula CH3. COOC, H, does not correctly represent the con
 stitution of ethylic acetate, as the heat of formation of such
a compound would be 253880 units, or 12030 units less than
the value found experimentally—a difference of over two per
cent. of the heat of combustion. Assuming the formula to be
CH3. CH(OH). CO. CH3, and calculating the heat of forma
tion with the aid of the constants previously deduced for acids,
aldehydes and ketones, the value found, viz.,
                7r-i-3vi +54250+65400 = 267250,
differs by only 1340 units, or a quarter per cent. of the heat
of combustion, from the theoretical number.
    Thomsen leaves unexplained for the present the cause of
the discrepancy in the case of methylic and isobutylic
formates; he does not regard it as remarkable that the value
for the allylic salt should be somewhat abnormal, as in other
cases values are found for allyl compounds which differ
somewhat from those for           £               compounds of
C.H2n+1    radicals.                           -
    (13) Heat of Formation of Nitrogen Molecules.—Thomsen
bases his determination of the heat developed in the formation
of nitrogen molecules from nitrogen atoms on the argument
that   £          as in the case of carbon, the two atoms are
held together by single affinities. Assuming that in nitrogen
peroxide, N2O4, the nitrogen atoms are directly associated as
represented by the formula
or by the formula
                                s—s.
                             O—N-O

                             O—N—()
the amount of heat absorbed in converting the peroxide into
nitrogen dioxide (NO) molecules is the quantity sought to be
determined. Now, according to Berthelot and Ogier, the heat
of dissociation of nitrogen peroxide between 27° and 198° is
10608 units; as about 20 per cent. is already decomposed at

94       Prof. H. E. Armstrong on the Determination of
the former temperature, the entire amount may be set down
as 13250 units. Boltzmann in a recent paper (Wiedemann’s
Annalen, vol. xxii. p. 71) gives the value 13920 units: the
mean value, in round numbers 13600 units, may be regarded
as not far from the truth.        But in the conversion of N2O,
into 2NO2, the volume becomes doubled, so that the heat of
combination of nitrogen atoms at constant volume is
               N. N* = 13600-580 = 13020 units.
   (14) Heat of Formation of the Ovides of Nitrogen.—From
his previous determinations, and taking into account the heat
of dissociation of nitrogen peroxide, Thomsen calculates that
the heat of formation of pure nitrogen peroxide gas at 18° is
       N2, 202=N2O =-3810 units at constant volume,
while that of nitrogen dioxide is
     N, 2O2=2NO2=2(–8415) units at constant volume.
   On the assumption that nitrogen dioxide has the constitution
                               s.
and that the amount of heat developed by the combination of
two similar atoms does not exceed that developed by their
union by single affinities, it is possible to determine the
heat of formation of oxygen molecules by comparison of the
heats of formation of nitrogen monoxide and dioxide at con
stant volume.       The manner in which the heat-disturbance
which attends the formation of these two oxides is effected
may be expressed by the following equations:
      N2, 02=2NO =2(-21575)=2N: 0–N. N–0. O,
    N2, 2O2=2|NO2=2(–8415) =4N. O—N N.           •
 Or, in words—the heat-disturbance of 2(-21575) units, which
 attends the formation of 2 gram-mol. props. of nitric oxide
 from 1 gram-mol. prop. of nitrogen and 1 gram-mol. prop. of
 oxygen, is the difference between the heat absorbed in the
 separation of the nitrogen atoms of the nitrogen molecules,
 and of the oxygen atoms of the oxygen molecules—the
atoms in both cases being united by single affinities—and that
 given out in the combination of the nitrogen and oxygen
 atoms by two affinities of each. In the case of the dioxide,
 as the oxygen atoms remain united by single affinities as they

 atom engaged in holding the atoms together.

             the Constitution of Carbon Compounds.          95
were in the original oxygen molecules, heat is absorbed onl
in the separation of the nitrogen atoms. On the other hand,
the heat developed arises from the association of the nitrogen
atoms each with two oxygen atoms, as exhibited in the
formula above, the expression 4N. O signifying merely four
single nitrogen-oxygen affinities. On the assumption that
N: O=2N.O., i.e. that the amount of heat developed when a
single atom of nitrogen combines by two of its affinities with
a single atom of oxygen is double that to which the associa
tion of an atom of nitrogen by but one of its affinities to an
atom of oxygen gives rise, the difference between the heats
of formation of nitrogen monoxide and dioxide will be the
amount of heat developed in the formation of the oxygen
molecule:
        (N2, 202–2NO-)- (N2, 02–2NO) = 2. 13160.
                     ... O. O=26320 units.
Provided that the heats of formation of nitrogen and oxygen
molecules thus deduced be accepted, the heat developed in the
formation of nitric oxide from nitrogen and oxygen atoms
may also be ascertained, thus:
         N2, 20,–2NO2=2(–8415)=4N.O-N. N.
              – 16830–13020 = -3810=4N. O.
                     ..". N. O= -952 units.
The value thus deduced is very small, and probably may be
regarded as zero, it being unlikely—remarks Thomsen—that
there are atoms which exercise a negative affinity.
   (15) Heat of Formation of Cyanides.—Comparing homo
logous cyanides, the difference between the heats of formation
of acetonitrile (60500) and propionitrile (104310) is 43810
units, or very nearly the value which in other cases corre
sponds to a difference of CH2; but the difference between
hydrogen cyanide (10900) and acetonitrile is considerably
greater, viz. 49600 units, pointing to a difference in consti
tution between the nitriles and hydrogen cyanide.
   Assuming the formula of acetonitrile to be CH3. C : N,
the heat of formation of the radical C# N from atomic carbon
and ordinary nitrogen will be the difference between the heat
of formation of acetonitrile, 60500 units, and 3r-Hvi =59200
units, i.e. 1300 units. Adding to this half the value N. N.
              C: N = 1300+ 6510=7810 units.
A similar calculation for propionitrile gives 910+6510=
7420 units.
   In like manner, adding 6510 to the heat of formation of

 96      Prof. H. E. Armstrong on the Determination of
 hydrogen cyanide (10900 units), the heat developed in its
 formation from ordinary hydrogen, gaseous “atomic” carbon
 and atomic nitrogen will result; deducting from this 15000
 units on account of the hydrogen, the remainder (17410–
 18000–2410) will be the amount of heat developed in the
 formation of the radical CN. It is much lower than that found
 for either of the nitriles.
    The heat of formation of cyanogen from gaseous atomic
 carbon and atomic nitrogen is 24080 units. Assuming that
 it has the constitution N: C. C : N,
               24080=2N : C+C. C=2N : C+vi,
                ... 2N : C = 24080–14200 = 9880.
 The value for N: C (4940 units) thus deduced is much lower
 than was calculated from the heat of formation of the nitriles.
 If it be assumed that cyanogen has the formula N : C : C : N
 the value 4940 would be the heat developed in the combina
 tion of carbon and nitrogen atoms by double affinities. But
 more probably, says Thomsen, its constitution is to be repre
 sented by the formula C. N. N.: C, in which case
                     24080 = 2 N: C+N. N.;
whence
                           N. : C = 5.530.
   It would appear, therefore, that the affinity of carbon for
nitrogen varies according to the mode of combination, the
values obtained being
         From acetonitrile    }.      .   N. : C  7810

           ,,  hydrogen cyanide       (?) N. C    2410
Very probably the three values are related as 3:2:1, and
the heat developed on combination of carbon and nitrogen
atoms is proportional to the number of affinities satisfied,
being on an average 2600 units per affinity.
   (16) Heat of Formation of the Amines.—The difference be
tween the heats of formation of homologous amines is some
what greater than is usually found between homologues,
especially in the case of secondary and tertiary amines, but
some uncertainty attaches to the values for these latter on
account of their high heats of combustion. The heats of
formation of primary amines are greater than those of the
isomeric secondary and tertiary amines. Thus

     Primary amines may be regarded as formed by the with
 drawal of a molecule of hydrogen from a molecule of ammonia
 plus a molecule of the corresponding hydrocarbon, and
 secondary as formed in like manner from primary, and ter
tiary from secondary amines:--

    The heat-disturbance in such reactions may be deduced from
 the heats of formation of the three compounds, that of am
monia at constant volume being 11310 units (Table IX.).

    On inspection of the last column of the table, it will be
seen that the primary amines form two groups; the difference
is too great and too constant within each group to be the
result of accident. Hence Thomsen is of opinion that the
amines of the two groups differ materially in constitution.
The numbers for secondary and tertiary amines (Table X.)
closely resemble those afforded by the members of the second
group of primary amines, which may be regarded as indicative
of similarity in constitution.
    It is commonly held that the amines are formed by the
displacement of the three hydrogen atoms in ammonia one by
              * Thomsen regards piperidine as a primary amine.

 one by hydrocarbon radicals, on which view it is to be ex
 pected that equal amounts of heat would be developed
 at each stage. This, however, is not the case (Table X.):
 the displacement of the first hydrogen atom by methyl
 occasioning a much smaller heat-disturbance than that of
 either the second or third atom, the amounts being very
 nearly the same in the case of these latter however. The
 difference may arise either because the hydrogen atoms in
 ammonia are of different value, or because the change is
not of the nature supposed. In the former case one of the
hydrogen atoms must be regarded as more firmly held than
the other two, and in the formation of methylamine that which
is most firmly held would be first displaced; but it is not
easy to explain why this should be the case. Moreover, in
the formation of the group C. NH2, on the one hand in the
primary amines containing methyl, ethyl, propyl and amyl, on
the other in aniline and allylamine, there is a difference in the
amounts of heat evolved of about 7000 units.                       It is also im
probable, if the constitution of the amines be that commonly
supposed, that the introduction of the first methyl or ethyl
into ammonia should involve an increase in the heat of neu
tralization, and that of the second and third a considerable
diminution*.           Thomsen therefore seeks to deduce the heat of
formation of the primary amines of the first group on the
assumption that they differ in constitution from those of the
second group. Assuming the nitrogen to be pentadic, the
constitution of methylamine may be represented by the for
mula H2C : NH3, i.e. it may be regarded as formed by direct
combination of methylene with ammonia. The heat of for

An almost identical value (5530 units) was previously de
duced from the heat of formation of cyanogen for C. N.
Hence Thomsen concludes that the interpretation thus put upon
the reaction involved in the formation of methylamine is
justified.
   If methylamine be represented by the formula H2C: NH3,
the formulae of di- and trimethylamine will be

The heat of formation of the group associated with the hydro
 carbon radical in each of these amines may be calculated
 from the following equations:
       C: NH3=2C. N+3N. H-#N. N = 16510 units.

 The value of C. N has previously been determined; that of
 N.H is given by the equation
             6N. H = (N2, 3H3) + N. N +3H. H.;
 but we have no means of determining H. H. Hence
        N.H = 5940+ + H. H and #(2N. H2)=5940.
 Adding the values for the hydrocarbon radicals, the heats of
 formation of the three methylamines will be as follows :
                                                    Found.
       Methylamine = 2n + 16510= 46510              46760

    If aniline were constituted like methylamine, it would be
  represented by the formula C. H. : NH3; but in a body of
 this formula #. nitrogen atom would be united to two carbon
  atoms, as each carbon atom in benzene carries but a single
  hydrogen atom, so that if it be assumed that in the amines
  the nitrogen is always combined with only a single carbon

 100     Prof. H. E. Armstrong on the Determination of
 atom of the radical such a formula is impossible, and the
 ordinary formula must be assigned to aniline. The heat of
 formation would then be
        5r--9v +N. C+2N. H-4N. N=210770 units.
 The value found experimentally is 211090 units, thus con
 firming the formula NH2. C.H.
    (17) Heat of Formation of Pyridine.—Pyridine is usually
 represented by the formula
                         HC=CH-CH
                                      |
                         Hé- N –CH
 The heat of formation of such a compound would be
        5r + 2vi + 2v3 + C=N–C = 131800 + C=N–C.
 The difference between the heat of formation calculated from
 the heat of combustion, P=171370 units, and 131800 units,
 viz. 39570 units, should represent the amount of heat deve
 loped in the fixation of the nitrogen atom; but it so exceeds
 the values found in the case of all other nitrogen compounds
 that the assumption that doubly-linked carbon atoms are
 present in pyridine must be abandoned. If a formula similar
 to the prism formula for benzene be adopted, the heat of for
 mation may be expressed as follows:—
              5r-i-6v1+N = Cs=160200+ N = Cs.
The value of N=C; thus found, 11170 units, is also unusually
high; pyridine therefore must differ from benzene in consti
tution; Thomsen suggests the formula
                               ZCH-CH
                        N–CH

                            >Cí-CH
the calculated heat of formation of such a compound being
very nearly that found for pyridine (171370 units), thus:
                 5r +7v + C. N=170490 units.
   (18) Nitro-paraffins.—Nitromethane and nitroethane are
commonly regarded as compounds of the form R. N.O. De
ducting the heats of formation of the hydrocarbon radicals
from the observed heats of formation of the compounds, the
difference will be the heat developed in the formation of the
radical C. NO2.

    Nitroethane     . 101900     57. --2" = 89.200     12700
The mean value of P-R is thus 11760 units: deducting from
this the heat developed on combination of a carbon and a
nitrogen atom by a single affinity, 2600 units, the remainder,
9160 units, is the heat developed in the formation of nitrogen
dioxide; but this has previously been stated to be -84.15
units (§ 14). So that the value deduced from the two nitro
compounds under consideration differs to the extent of 17575
units from that determined experimentally by means of nitric
peroxide. This result is again suggestive of a constitution
different from that commonly attributed to the nitroparaffins.
Thomsen points out that by formulating them as nitroso
alcohols, heats of formation may be deduced which agree with
those found; thus:—
Nitromethane=CH2(NO).OH                  =2r + C.OH + C.N + N.O
                                                   = 55820 units.
 Nitroethane =CH(CH3)(NO).OH =4r-+ v 4 C.OH+C.N+NO
                                                   =101900 units.
     Putting r=15000, e=14200, C. OH=44520 ($ 10), and
 C. N=2600 ($15), the heat of formation of NO will be—
          If calculated from Nitromethane, -21300 units,
                 32        , Nitroethane, -19420 ,
 These values differ but slightly from that found, viz. –21575
 units.
     (19) Heat of Formation of Sulphur Compounds.—It will not
 be necessary to discuss Thomsen's conclusions regarding these
 compounds; it will suffice to call attention to the one instance
 in which he arrives at a result at variance with received
 opinion. This is in the case of thiophen, which is usually
 represented by the formula
                                CH=CH
                            <'' CH=CH
  On grounds similar to those advanced in the case of benzene
  and pyridine, Thomsen concludes, however, that the carbon
 atoms cannot be doubly linked, but that they are united by
  five single bonds, and that the sulphur atom is united to a
  single carbon atom by two affinities, as shown by the formula
                          s—c.'Pol,

  102     Prof. H. E. Armstrong on the Determination of
     (20) Thus far I have only endeavoured to give an abstract
  of Thomsen's arguments and conclusions, quoting as far as
 £         his own words. Many of his deductions are in the
   ighest degree remarkable. Recalling the more striking, he
 not only finds that the same amount of heat is developed in
  the combination of carbon atoms as they occur in      £
 and as in the paraffins—in other words, that even in the ole
 fines the carbon atoms are united only by single bonds—that,
 in fact, there are no such things as “double £ ”; but he
 also arrives at the startling conclusion that in the formation
 of acetylene the carbon atoms unite without any evolution of
 heat: so that we are forced to assume that in an acetylene
 not only is there no treble or double bond, but not even a
 single bond Then ethylene oxide is pronounced to be methy
 lene oxide; the aldehydes are hydroxy-compounds; and pro
 bably methylal and methylic orthoformate are also alcoholic
 bodies. Lastly, the amines are to be regarded as derivatives of
pentad nitrogen; and pyridine is not analogous in constitution
 to benzene.
    (21) Now, admitting even that a more careful consideration
 of the chemical evidence might result in our acknowledging
the correctness of Thomsen's conclusions in some few cases,
it is impossible to do this in the majority of instances: we
cannot admit that the carbon atoms in ethylene oxide are dis
united, and that this compound is in reality a methylene oxide;
and every chemist must regard Thomsen's formulae for the
amines as altogether lacking probability. Moreover, the
method by which the constitution of bodies like ethylene oxide
and the amines is ordinarily arrived at, is the method b
which the constitution of compounds generally is £
Hence, if we accept Thomsen's conclusions in their entirety,
results arrived at by the strict application of the same method
throughout are to be accepted in some instances but rejected
in others. To admit this would be to acknowledge that our
entire system of constitutional formulae is based upon a false
conception, to which there is no possible key. That current
views of structure require modification in some not unessential
£             I have long been of opinion; but that they will
  ave to be modified to the extent which Thomsen's arguments
indicate appears to me altogether improbable.
   (22) It remains, therefore, to seek for some explanation of
his anomalous results, and one of the first questions to be
answered is: Are we justified in regarding the value 135340
units as the true heat of combustion of gaseous atomic carbon?
Thomsen's determination of this value involves the assump
tion: that when a molecule of oxygen combines with two
molecules of gaseous carbon monoxide, the same amount

             the Constitution of Carbon Compounds.           103
of heat is developed as if combination were to take place
between an oxygen molecule and a single carbon atom, due
allowance being made for the change in volume. But it is
by no means certain that this is the case—that the addition
of the first and second atom of oxygen to a carbon atom
involves the development of the same amount of heat. The
argument that it does, which has been based on the results
obtained for certain solid oxides in cases where both higher
and lower oxide are ultimately obtained in the same state of
aggregation as the element oxidized, cannot, in my opinion,
be accepted in evidence, for the very reason that in the cases
in question solids are dealt with throughout. If we consider
what are the properties of carbon monoxide, they are such as on
the whole favour the contrary view, viz. that, of the total heat
developed in the formation of carbon dioxide, the larger pro
portion is given out in the combination of the carbon atom
with a single oxygen atom. It is especially noteworthy, in
fact, that carbon monoxide does not appear to be so markedly
unsaturated, combining directly with but a limited number of
 other bodies and, as a rule, only under special conditions. If
 this view be accepted, 135340 units is too low a value for
f. Ci (§ 4); in other words, f. C1=135340+ v ; and I think
 facts justify the conclusion that a has a high value.
     (23) As the value f. C1 is made use of in deducing the
 amount of heat developed in the formation of carbon com
 pounds generally, the calculation of the amount of heat
 £           in the combination of hydrogen with carbon from
 the heat of formation of methane and other hydrocarbons
 must also be affected by the error which possibly has been
 made in determining f. C.
    (24) Thomsen's conclusion that vs=0 (§ 7) is also, I
 imagine, evidence of a flaw somewhere in the argument by
 which so improbable a conclusion is arrived at. Now, it is
 assumed by him that the heat developed in the formation of
 methane (59.550 units) is given out in the combination of two
 molecules of hydrogen with a single atom of carbon; as pre
 viously explained (§6), it amounts in round numbers to 60000
 units=2(2r). The corrected value for the heat of formation of
 methane will therefore be 60000+ w units, and the corrected
 value of 2r will consequently be 30000+}a units. But if
 this be granted, it follows that, in order to determine vs, it is
 necessary to add to the heat of formation of acetylene calcu
  lated by Thomsen (28990 units) twice the value of c, and to
  deduct only 2r +$v=30000+!". This will give – 1010+14a,
  instead of zero, as the value of vs; so that the heat of forma
  tion of acetylene may well be a fairly high positive value.

104     Prof. H. E. Armstrong on the Determination of
Although acetylene is especially prone to undergo change, I
think it is incorrect to speak of it as an “easily decomposable”
hydrocarbon (p. 84); its apparent instability is probably the
direct outcome of its “unsaturatedness”—of the readiness
with which it consequently enters into combination.
   (25) I certainly believe, with Lossen and Thomsen, that
compounds of the olefine and acetylene type are truly un
saturated bodies; and that the affinities of the carbon atoms
cannot be supposed to have satisfied each other in the manner
indicated by the formulae usually employed”. But, on the
other hand, I hold it to be both possible and probable that in
the formation of the olefines, for example, there is a partial
neutralization—a partial outgoing of energy—beyond that
which occurs in the formation of paraffins. What appears to
be direct confirmation of this view is afforded by Thomsen's
observations that the heat of combustion of trimethylene
exceeds that of its isomer propylene by 6690 units. Tri
methylene is regarded by many as a “closed chain’’ hydro
carbon, consisting of three CH2 groups, while propylene is
methylethylene, the formulae being
                       CH,                 CH. CH:
                      /N                   |

                 Trimethylene.              Propylene.
Trimethylene combines much less readily with bromine than
does ordinary propylene; but, in my opinion, there is no
chemical evidence to justify the assumption that the former
is a “closed-chain.” compound. The properties of trimethy
lene may be explained by regarding it as an open-chain
hydrocarbon of the formula CH2. CH2. CH2, which exhibits
two of the carbon atoms as possessing each a “free affinity;”
and the sluggish behaviour with bromine may be attributed
to the fact that the “free affinities” are not associated with
contiguous carbon atoms. Thomsen's observation, assuming
it to # correct, not only affords evidence in support of this
conclusion, but may also, I think, be held to prove that in
'' the affinities of the              carbon atoms partially satisfy
each other beyond the point which would be typified by the
formula H.C. CH. CH3, as the difference of 6690 units
between the heats of combustion of the isomers is considerably
below the probable value of "I.. If this view be correct, the
value of v2 is not determined by deducting the difference
between the heats of combustion of a paraffin and the corre
sponding olefine ($4) from the heat of combustion of gaseous

             the Constitution of Carbon Compounds.          105
atomic carbon : the value thus calculated is less than v2, but
greater than v1.
   (26) As regards Thomsen's conclusion that v1=vs—in
other words, that there is no such thing as a double bond, it
is to be remarked also that no great confidence can be placed
in the determination of the value of v2, involving as it does
the use of the heat of combustion of carbon monoxide.     More
over it cannot be assumed, as a matter of course, that if a
compound C2O2 did exist (§ 4), it would be strictly speaking
an analogue of C2H4; i. e. that the energy of combination of
two carbon atoms would be the same in the two cases, whether
they were associated with oxygen or hydrogen—this, in fact,
is the point to be proved. The non-existence of a compound
CaO2 may even be regarded as disproving any such conclusion.
The agreement between theory and practice, i.e. between the
calculated and observed heats of formation of olefines, might
be claimed on behalf of Thomsen ; but the amount of evidence
of this kind is too small at present, added to which marked
discrepancies actually do occur among olefine derivatives—
as in the case of the allyl compounds, to which attention has
already been more than once directed.
    (27) Finally, another argument against the correctness of
Thomsen's conclusions may be based upon the values which
he has put forward (it is right to say, with reservation) as
representing the affinities of certain elementary atoms, viz.:
                      C. C =    14200 units
                      N. N = 13020 ,
                      O, 0 = 2.13970 ,
                      I. I = 2.13160 ,
   Except in the case of carbon, these values are supposed to
be the amounts of heat developed in the formation of the
molecules from the atoms. In the case of carbon, as pointed
out in § 7, Thomsen considers it probable that the atoms in
the molecule are united in such a manner that at most two
affinities are exerted per atom: so that of 38380 units—being
the difference between the heat of combustion of ordinary
amorphous carbon and the hypothetical heat of combustion
of gaseous atomic carbon-2.14200 units are required to sepa
rate the carbon atoms from each other; the remaining 99.80
units are supposed to be absorbed in gasifying the carbon.
But if we take into account the properties of the four elements
in question, it is inconceivable that the numbers given by
Thomsen can represent the amounts of energy to be expended
in effecting their molecular simplification. Iodine we know,
from V. Meyer’s experiments, and from those of Meier and
   Phil. Mag. S. 5. Wol. 23. No. 141. Feb. 1887.        I

 106 Prof. H. E. Armstrong on the Determination of
 Crafts, is resolved into monatomic molecules with compara
 tive ease, although far less readily than nitrogen peroxide is
 resolved into nitrogen dioxide; but the entire behaviour of
 oxygen, nitrogen and carbon would seem to show that the
 stability of their molecules is enormously greater than that of
 diatomic iodine molecules. Thomsen's conclusion also appears
 the less likely to command acceptance when the mode of de
 ducing the values for nitrogen and oxygen is considered, and
 it is remembered that the value for nitrogen is nothing more
than the heat of dissociation of nitrogen peroxide. All the
 facts, so far as I can interpret them, appear to me to show
that nitrogen peroxide and nitrogen are to be placed at the
 very opposite extremes in the scale of molecular stability.
 Another instance of the unsatisfactory nature of the argument
upon which Thomsen's determinations of the affinity values
for nitrogen compounds is based is afforded by nitric oxide,
the formation of which, from its atoms, would, it is supposed,
take place without evolution of heat. Meyer and Züblin have
shown, however, that this gas is stable at 1200°, although it
is entirely decomposed at about 1700°.
    (28) It remains to consider those results which are inde
pendent of any correction in the value off. C., &c. Among
the most interesting are those relating to the chlorides ($9),
and to isomeric alcohols (§ 10). As regards the former it
will be recollected that whereas the addition of a single atom
of chlorine is attended by a heat-evolution of only 13500
units, that of two involves the production of no less than
2.16500 units, that of three of 13500+2.16500 units, and that
of four of 2.13500+2.16500 units.         It appears to me that
the greater amount of heat developed in the formation of the
symmetrical di-derivative (symmetrical as regards the relation
of the chlorine atoms to the carbon atom or atoms) is pro
bably due to the partial neutralization of the (residual) affinity
of the one chlorine atom by that of the other. It is unfortu
nate that no chlorine compound, in which the two chlorine
atoms are associated with non-contiguous carbon atoms, has
been examined. According to the view here put forward it is
scarcely to be expected that in such a case there will be the
extra development of heat which Thomsen has noticed,
although it is conceivable, however, that the association of an
even number of chlorine atoms either with a single carbon
atom, or with contiguous or symmetrically placed carbon
atoms, may involve an extra    £         of affinity.
    (29). Passing to the alcohols, we have to note Thomsen's
conclusion that the primary have the highest, and the isomeric
tertiary the lowest heats of combustion, the secondary occu

            the Constitution of Carbon Compounds.            107
pying an intermediate position. To judge from the compara
tively greater stability of the primary alcohols, an opposite
result might fairly have been looked for.—Here, again, I con
tend that it is to the local accumulation of negative elements
that we must attribute the increased development of heat ob
served in the formation of tertiary alcohols, &c.
   The peculiar behaviour of the amines may, I think, be ex
plained on similar lines.
   Thomsen's observations on ethylene oxide and aldehyde are
also of great interest from this same point of view; they
clearly prove that these compounds are not only unsaturated
in the ordinary sense, but that they are actually to a con
siderable extent unexhausted bodies. Retaining the formula
ordinarily assigned to ethylene oxide, I am inclined to think
that it is a direct consequence of the structure of the com
pound—especially of the relation in which the single oxygen
atom stands to the two carbon atoms, that the affinities of the
oxygen atom—and probably of the carbon atoms likewise
are far from being satisfied. And in the case of aldehyde,
whether the oxygen atom is or is not associated by two affinities
with the carbon atom, as ordinarily supposed, there can
be little doubt that any formula in which the oxygen atom is
represented as “fully combined ” with the carbon atom is
 more or less misleading; meanwhile, therefore, it is advisable
to formulate the aldehydes as containing the radical C(O)H.
    The very low values found for the heats of formation of the
 simpler cyanogen compounds would appear to furnish addi
tional evidence in support of the view that the polyad nega
 tive elements are endowed with peculiarities which limit the
 extent to which on entering into combination they can
 mutually satisfy or neutralize their affinities.
    (30) Thomsen has contended, time after time, that his
 results afford a solution of the problem which has of late
years very properly excited so much attention, viz. that of
the constitution of benzene. As pointed out in § 8, he
maintains that the six atoms of carbon in this hydrocarbon
are linked together by nine “single bonds,” and not, in the
manner indicated by Kekulé's '' formula, by three
single and three double bonds. Although of opinion that we
cannot at present accept so absolute an interpretation of the
thermochemical data, I yet think that Thomsen's results,
 taken together with all that is known of benzene, must be
 held to prove that benzene is in no sense a compound of the
 same order as an olefine; and that Kekulé's formula, if used
at all, must be literally interpreted as indicating that the
 carbon atoms are held together by nine affinities, there being

 108      Prof. H. E. Armstrong on the Determination of
 abundant evidence to show that in the olefines the carbon
 atoms are not held together by double bonds. In other
 words, if we employ Kekulé's benzene formula, we are bound
 to abandon the use of the conventional formula for olefines.
  From this point of view I see little difference between
  Kekulé's symbol and the prism formula or the modification
  of the latter quite recently advocated by Thomsen (Deut.
  chem. Ges. Ber. xix. p. 2944). Objections have, however,
 been urged against the prism formula which appear to be
 justified; the symbol advocated by Thomsen can scarcely be
 regarded as marking any particular advance; and Kekulé's
 symbol is open to the oft-raised objection that it indicates
 the existence of four distinct di-derivatives.    I venture to
 think that a symbol free from all objections may be based on
 the assumption that of the twenty-four affinities of the six
 carbon atoms twelve are engaged in the formation of the six
 carbon ring and six in retaining the six hydrogen atoms, in
 the manner ordinarily supposed; while the remaining six
 react upon each other,-acting towards a centre as it were:
 so that the “affinity” may be said to be uniformly and sym
 metrically distributed. I would, in fact, make use of the
 following symbol:—
                            H      H
                            C—C
                          /\ /\
                       HC—-       -—CH
 The only difference between this symbol and those employed
 hitherto arises from the fact that I do not consider that,
apart from its connexion with the other carbon atoms owing
to their association in a ring, any one carbon atom is directly
 connected with any other atom not contiguous to it in the
ring; my opinion being that each individual carbon atom
exercises an influence upon each and every other carbon
atom. The idea here expressed is, I believe, essentially diffe
rent from that embodied in the somewhat similar symbol
used by Lothar Meyer (Modernen Theorien der Chemie, ed. 4,
1883, p. 262; comp. also Brühl, loc. cit. p. 12): as, £
to my view, there is an excess of (negative) affinity beyon
what is required to maintain the C.H. ring; and as I do not
consider that each carbon atom can be supposed to have
an affinity free.

   (31) While of opinion therefore that the arguments ad
vanced by Thomsen, as a rule, do not suffice to substantiate
his views, I would yet express my conviction that even in
their present form his results are of the very greatest value,
and that it is already possible to base important theoretical
conclusions upon them. It may be doubted whether it will
ever be possible to determine the value off. C, in the manner
he suggests; but fortunately many of the problems of che
mical affinity which press for solution may be solved without
the knowledge of this value by comparing isomeric compounds,
as in the case of the alcohols, for example $$ 10, 29 : and it is
in this direction that further investigation appears to be most
likely to lead to valuable results.
   It is before all things important, however, that independent
investigators should occupy themselves with thermochemical
studies, in order that the fundamental values may be placed
beyond doubt and that accurate thermochemical data may
be accumulated for discussion; moreover, it is essential to
extend the field of study so as to include members of every
class of compound.
XII. Note on the foregoing Communication. By SPENCER
   UMFREviLLE PICKERING, M.A., Professor of Chemistry at
   Bedford College".
IN      the foregoing communication Professor Armstrong
      makes a suggestion which must recommend itself to
most chemists—that the heat evolved on the fixation of one
atom of oxygen by one atom of carbon is greater than that
evolved on the subsequent addition of a second oxygen atom
to the compound thus formed. The fundamental value, f. Cl,
on which all Thomsen's calculations are based, will thus be
erroneous; and the only meaning which can then be attached
to his values for vi, v2, and v3 will be the differences between
their actual values.
   Thus, v2 is given by the equation
            v2=f. C1-[(C, H, 3O2)-(CH4, 20)]
              =f. Cl–(333350–211920); . . . . . (I.)
and v1 is deduced from the heat of formation of ethane,

                       =2 x 68360 +f. C1–211930,
may be substituted, thus giving

ence between the values of v2 and v1, independent of the

mined experimentally,

 Similar results are obtainable with vs.
    Now, adopting Professor Armstrong's view that Thomsen's
value for f. C, should be increased by some unknown quantity,
a, it will follow that the value for r will become r + #, while
those   for v1, t2, and v3 will be converted into v1 +     # "2+ æ,
and v3 +   # respectively;    or
                        v1=14056 +       #

                        v3 =   –81    + 2
    The importance of these values can scarcely be overrated.
 If, as seems very probable, a represents some number con
 siderably larger than 14000 cal., the heat evolved in the union
of two carbon atoms will be very nearly, though not quite,
proportional to the number of bonds by which they are united;
 a view which, I think, must be admitted to be highly probable.
We at once obviate the necessity for denying that carbon atoms
 can be joined by anything but single bonds, and that com
pounds containing trebly-bound carbon atoms are not really
 compounds at all; while the slight loss of energy entailed in
 substituting a double bond for two single ones, and a treble
 bond for a double and single one, gives an explanation of
 the relative instability of unsaturated hydrocarbons. Thom
sen's conclusions tend to entirely destroy the bond theory;

whereas his results, when studied from the present stand
point, not only confirm it, but endue it for the first time with
a clear kinetic meaning.
   Passing on to other cases affected by the introduction of v:
it will be seen that the union of the carbon atoms in the
(hypothetical) gaseous molecular carbon by single bonds only,
and the non-existence of the fourfold bond, is no longer
tenable; and that the whole basis of the argument on which
the surprisingly small values for the formation of molecular
nitrogen and molecular oxygen rest is thus destroyed, and the
conclusions which are based on these quantities, in some cases
so opposed to all accepted views, will be destroyed also.
   w, however, will not affect the values calculated for the heat
of formation of benzene, except in so far as the difference in
these values will be comparatively a much more insignificant
quantity than formerly. But the difficulty experienced in
adopting Kekulé's formula will vanish if we accept in its en
tirety the kinetic conception of bonds here developed. All that
Thomsen has proved is that in certain classes of compounds—
so-called open-chain bodies—v2 is somewhat less than twice v1;
but it by no means follows that, in compounds constituted on
such a different principle, and possessing such perfect sym
metry as benzene, this should be the case: in benzene the
second bond has probably the full value of the first bond,
v2=2vi, and hence the stability of the substance. The con
ception that the value of a bond, between even the same
atoms, has a somewhat variable value dependent on the nature
of the other atoms present in the compound, has already been
developed in another direction by the author (“Atomic
Valency,” Chem. Soc. Proc. 1885, p. 122), and has been in
dependently brought forward by Professor Armstrong, and
used by him to explain many of the apparently anomalous
results arrived at by Thomsen in other parts of the work
under discussion.
   As with the value of r, so also with the heat evolved on the
combination of a chlorine atom with carbon and of hydroxyl
with carbon, Thomsen's numbers will have to be increased by #
for each Clor (OH). With the ethers, the value assigned to
C–0–C will be         ; greater;  in the aldehydes, H–C–0 will
become    #   greater; in the ketones HC=O will be # greater;
and in the acids O=C–OH will become              : greater".
  * In all these cases the numbers represent the heat of formation from
gaseous atomic carbon and the other elements in the molecular condition.

112         On the Constitution of Carbon Compounds.
   It will be remembered that, on the strength of the fact that
the heat of formation of H–C–0 in the aldehydes together
with that of C=O in the ketones was found equal to that of
O=C—(OH) in the acids, Thomsen arrived at the startling
conclusion that the aldehydic radical consists of hydroxyl;
so that
       Aldehyde.     Ketone.                       Acid.
      C—(OH) + O=C may be equal to O=C—(OH).
Now the introduction of a destroys this equality; for the sum
of the heat of formation of the aldehydic and ketonic radicals
will exceed that of the acid radical by 5. and this excess brings
the results into full accordance with the generally accepted
views concerning the constitution of these bodies. The actions
concerned in the formation of these groupings will be
          Aldehyde.          Ketone.              Acid.
         O=C–H               O=C             O=C—(OH)
   (O=C)+(C–H)             (0=C)         (0=C)+(C–( OH)).
But (C–H) has been shown equal to (C–(OH)), and hence
the aldehyde +ketone will exceed the acid by (C=O), which
quantity, as shown above, will be within 15000 cal. of #.
   It is important to remark that the value obtained by
Thomsen for (=C=O) in the ketones (54250) is by no means
identical with that obtained for (C=O) in carbonic oxide
(77670), showing that the heat developed is certainly depend
ent on the presence of other atoms in the compound, and not
on the number of bonds concerned only. This difference is
still further increased if v be introduced into the calculation;
for (=C=O) becomes 54250 +
77670+ v.
                                     ; whereas (C=O)     becomes
   A fuller study of Thomsen's results can scarcely fail to
bring to light a large number of important conclusions which
have been omitted here; and there can be few chemists who
will not appreciate the services which Professor Armstrong
has rendered to science in criticising a work of such extreme
importance, and indicating the direction in which some of the
apparently anomalous results to which it leads may be brought
into accordance with views which we cannot afford to reject.

                        Pg=0)=f(x, t) . . . . . . . (7),
  where f denotes an arbitrary function of the two independent
 variables.
     Suppose now the water to be at rest at time 0. It is clear
 from dynamical considerations that the solution of (4), subject
 to the conditions (5), (7), (3), is fully determinate : and when
 it is found, (1) gives the position at time t of the fluid-particle
 which at time 0 was in any position (x, y); and so completes
  the solution of the problem.
     The particular £ which we are now going to work
 out to represent a uniform procession of waves commencing
 at time 0, and produced and maintained by the application of
 changing pressure to the surface in the neighbourhood of the
 zero of c, must, as its appropriate form of (7), fulfil the
 condition
                  po-0=%(*) sin ot--F(x) cosot             . . (8),
 where $(x) and F(x) denote functions which vanish for all
 large positive or negative values of v.
    If we wish to make only a single procession, in the direc
 tion of a positive for example, we may take
                      $(v)=F(v- 'gT/o") .          . . . . (9).
    A perfectly general formula is easily (by the Fourier
 Poisson-Cauchy method) written down to express the value
of P; and so, by (1) and (6), the complete solution of the
problem: for 5 and F any given arbitrary functions.
    It is obvious that, so far as 0 is concerned, the general
solution for r any considerable multiple of +1, and exceeding
 +l by not less than two or three times the wave-length,
27tg/a”, must, for values of t great enough to have let the
front of the procession pass the place v, be

the time one of the wave-crests takes to travel through a

Rayleigh, we know that it advances at half the speed of a
wave-crest; but their theory, so far as hitherto developed,
does not teach us the law according to which the front, as
it advances, becomes longer and longer in proportion to Vt,
nor even the fact that it does become longer and longer. All
the details of this interesting question are explicitly given
in what follows: having been found with great ease for the
particular case,                                  !

   Remembering Cauchy and Poisson's discovery that every
surface of particles which are in a horizontal plane when un
disturbed, fulfils the condition of a free upper-surface (so that
if all the water above it were annulled the motion of the water
remaining below it would be undisturbed,) in the case of free
waves of infinitely deep water; we see that when p, , = const.,
we have also, in our notation, p = const., for every constant
value of y. Hence, looking to (3) above, we must find, in
the case of free waves,               d?

   wave-velocity; which agrees with the result of Stokes.
      We may arbitrarily define “the front” as the succession of
   augmenting waves which pass between the times corresponding
   to m= + 10 and m = -10 (or any other considerable number
   instead of 10). Thus the time taken by the front, in passing
   the place r=nx, is 40o- V27n. The space travelled by the
   mid-front in this time is 20go." V2tn, which may, arbitrarily,
   be defined as the length of the front. It increases in pro
   portion to Vn ; and therefore in proportion to Vt, as said
   above. The effect upon phase of the changigg waves in the
   front; due to the fluctuations of e, and to the law of augmen
   tation of Q from zero to its final value; is to be illustrated by
   calculations and graphic representations, which I hope will be
   given on a future occasion.
      The rear of a wholly free procession of waves may be quite
   readily studied after the constitution of the front has been
   fully investigated, by superimposing an annulling surface
   pressure upon the originating pressure represented by (12)
   above, after the originating pressure has been continued so
   long as to produce a procession of any desired number of
   WaVeS.

XIV. Note on a Method of Determining Coefficients of Mutual
          Induction. By G. CAREY FosTER, F.R.S.*
    HE determination in absolute measure of the coefficient
       of mutual induction of two electric circuits by the ordi
nary method founded on the throw of a ballistic galvanometer
is a somewhat complicated matter, necessarily occupying a
good deal of time. But the process may be greatly simplified
if we have available a condenser of which the capacity is
accurately known. For instance, if P and s are two coils
whose coefficient of mutual induction is required, let them
first be joined up, as indicated in fig. 1–P in a primary
                              Fig. 1.

  at K, the galvanometer is traversed by a quantity Q', such that
                              Q = yCR.                            -
  If the points A and D are found by trial so that the deflection
  of the galvanometer is the same in both cases, we have
                              M = CRr.
     This mode of working, however, has the obvious defect that
  the result, as stated, implies that the current in the battery
  circuit is of exactly the same strength during each part of the
  experiment. As this cannot be looked for, it would be needful
  to include a measuring galvanometer in the battery-circuit, so
  as to take account of the variation of the current.     The re
  quired coefficient is then obtained in the form
                            M = ?? CRr.
                                  "Y1
     But, instead of making two separate experiments, as above,
  it is simpler to adopt an arrangement of apparatus which is
  very nearly a combination of the two arrangements just
 described. A single experiment then takes the place of two,
 and, instead of having to reproduce a particular deflection of
 the galvanometer, we have to adjust a resistance so as to
 prevent deflection. The connections will be understood by
 reference to fig. 3, where, so far as the reference-letters used
                                Fig. 3.
 in the previous figures recur, they have the meanings already
 given to them. The observation consists in adjusting a set
 of resistance-coils at F, between the galvanometer and the
coils, until there is no throw of the galvanometer on making
or breaking contact at K.
    Let the resistances As F E, A GE, AD be represented by
p, q, r respectively, and the corresponding currents by v, y, z.
Further, let the current in the battery and primary coil be

                Coefficients of Mutual Induction.               123
denoted by y, the coefficient of self-induction of the coils by
L, and the potentials at the points A and E by A and E
respectively.
   When : battery-current has attained its steady value, it
is evident that the currents x and y will both be nothing, and
therefore that A=E, and that the charge of the £
will be Cyr. But if there has been no throw of the galvano
meter-needle, the average value of the current y during the
whole time of establishment of the battery-current has been
=0. Consequently, the total quantity conveyed by the cur
rent x has been equal to the charge of the condenser, or
                         | adt = Cyr.
                          0.
But, if the average strength of the current y=0, the average
difference of potentials A-E=0, and the effective electro
motive force in the conductor         #.  is that due to the mutual
induction of the coils P and s (for the integral value of the
                               M (” dy must vanish). Hence

or                             M = Cpr.
    In order that the galvanometer-current y may be zero at
every instant, as well as on the average, during the establish
 ment of the primary current, it is essential that the coefficient
 of self-induction, L, of the coil s should be equal to the
 coefficient of mutual induction M. This may be proved
 as follows:—Since, in the case supposed, we have always
 A-E=0, we may write
                                d        dy –
                       pa;+L    #– M# =0.
 But a =y-2 (since y=0, always), consequently the instan
 taneous value of the current w is
    *               –1                dry       d2
 and the simultaneous charge of the condenser is

                                              that M=Cpr when the

124       Prof. G. C. Foster on a Method of Determining
average current through the galvanometer vanishes, the last
equation becomes
                         (M-L)) = (M-L)2,
which requires either (1) that y=2 (that is, that the primary
current has become steady), or (2) that M-L=0.
    When the last-mentioned condition is satisfied, we ought to
be able to replace the galvanometer between the points A and
E by a telephone, and to employ a rapid make-and-break*.
    By using a pair of coils of known and invariable coefficient
of mutual induction, the experimental process described above
may afford a ready way of determining the capacity of a
 condenser; but for this purpose the method does not appear
 to possess any advantage over the well-known methods of
 De Sauty and Sir William Thomson for determining the
capacity of condensers by comparison with a known standard,
 more especially as a known condenser is more frequently at
 hand than a pair of coils of known coefficient f.
     The limit of accuracy attainable in measurements by the
 method here described depends essentially upon the sensi
 tiveness of the galvanometer employed; but with a given
 galvanometer, the method is susceptible of various degrees of
 accuracy according to the relative values given to the two
 variable resistances p and r.
     These should be so adjusted that, for a given value of the
 difference Cpr–M, that is, for a given error in the adjustment
 of the product of the resistances p and r, the quantity of elec
 tricity traversing the galvanometer may be as great as possible.
  This requires that the resistances should fulfil the condition
                                  # = #,
 where r is the resistance between A and D through the
 primary coil and battery.            Let X and Y stand for the
    * Experiments in this direction, made since the reading of this paper
 before the Physical Society by Mr. F. Womack, have not yet led to a
 fully satisfactory result.
    + Since this paper was read, Professor Röiti, of Florence, has kindly
  sent me a copy of a paper communicated by him to the Royal Academy
  of Sciences of Turin (Memoirs of the Academy, series ii., vol. xxxviii.), in
  which he describes a method, very similar to that indicated in the text,
  for the absolute measurement of the capacity of condensers, using for the
  purpose a pair of coils whose coefficient of mutual induction is accu
  rately known from their dimensions and relative positions. The chief
  difference between Professor Röiti's arrangement and that given in this
  paper is that, instead of inserting the galvanometer between the points
  marked A and E in fig. 3, he includes it in the branch, AFE, containing
  the secondary coil. Between A and E he places a contact-key H, which,
  as well as the key K, is opened and closed mechanically, the two keys
  being moved by cranks attached to the same axle at right angles to
  each other.

integrals Wadi and £yd respectively, that is, for the total
currents through the secondary coil and through the galvano
meter. Then, equating the integral values of the electromotive
force between A and E derived by considering the paths
A G E and AFE, respectively, we get
                         px-qY=M:
E being here the electromotive force of the battery B.

and this is to be as great as possible.

                        pr (1 +++++ qr'            ;

the last term inside the bracket is the product of the second
and third, and may be taken as constant, since q, the resistance
of the galvanometer, and r", the resistance of the part of the
circuit containing the primary coil, are practically determined
by the apparatus employed, while prhas the constant value
 M/C. Hence, Y/(Cpr—M) is greatest when (p+q)(r--r')
is least, or when p/q = 1/r', which is identical with the con
 dition of maximum sensibility given above".
    In conclusion, I may give a few numerical results as
 examples of the applicability of the method; they are derived
 from experiments made in the laboratory of University College,
 London, by Mr. F. Womack, B.Sc.

   As a further test of the accuracy of the method, the
secondary wires of Apps's coil and of the small coil (A) were
connected in circuit with each other and with a galvanometer,
and the two primaries were connected so that the battery
current was divided between them, as shown in fig. 5. The
                              Fig. 5.
connections being arranged so that the induced electromotive
forces opposed each other, it was possible, by the proper
adjustment of the resistances of the branches containing the
two primary coils, to prevent the galvanometer being deflected
when the battery-circuit was made or broken. When this adjust
ment is made, it is evident that the ratio of the resistances of
the two primary circuits is the same as the ratio of the two co
efficients of mutual induction. In this way, 39-45 was obtained
as the ratio of the coefficients; whereas the condenser method
                         118.96
described above gives    3-0403
                                 =39:13, giving a difference of
 about 1 per cent. As, however, the current in the primary
 of the smaller coil has to be about forty times as strong as
 that in the large coil in the comparison experiments, in order
 that the induced electromotive forces may balance—and as,
 moreover, the resistance of the copper wire of the former was

resistance of the larger primary coil was not much more than
one fifteen-hundredth of the whole resistance in circuit with it
—the ratio of the resistances was no doubt somewhat disturbed
by the unequal heating of the two primary circuits, and was
in reality rather less than what was inferred from the marked
values of the coils used.    That this was the case was shown
by the fact that the apparent ratio decreased progressively
from 40.3 to 39:45, as the strengh of the testing current was
diminished from its first value to rather less than one sixth.
A better arrangement of the apparatus would have been to

  ave connected the two secondaries in parallel circuit; but
the matter was not thought important enough to require a
repetition of the measurements.
   The method of measuring coefficients of mutual induction
described in this paper may perhaps be of use in the experi
mental study of dynamo-electric machines, whose whole action
depends upon the variation of the coefficient of mutual induc
tion between the field-magnet coils and the armature coils, as
the latter take various positions during the course of a
revolution.
XV. On the Nature of Liquids, as shown by a Study of the
    Thermal Properties of Stable and Dissociable Bodies. By
   WILLIAM RAMSAY, Ph.D., and SYDNEY YoUNG, D.Sc."
TH:        fundamental concept of Chemistry, as well as of
        Physics, is the molecular and atomic constitution of
 matter. This concept serves to represent to the chemist the
 definite composition of compounds, and, to some degree, the
 nature of isomerism, while all attempts to realize £ explain
 the progress of chemical change depend on its adoption.
 This concept also furnishes to the physicist the means of
 conceiving the relations of heat, light, magnetism and elec
 tricity to matter; and where the action of one of these agents
 involves not merely a change in the form, but also in the
 nature of the matter, the problem becomes of deep interest
 to both chemist and physicist. The action of heat on matter,
 from the physical side, involves an increased molecular
 motion, tending to separate individual molecules from each
 other, on the one hand; or, on the other, if this separation be
 opposed by confining walls, to increase the momentum and
 number of impacts on those walls, and therefore to raise the
 pressure. But this increased molecular motion is accom

130               Drs. Ramsay and Young on
panied by greater internal vibration, which eventually leads,
in almost all cases, to a simplification or rearrangement of the
molecules, involving chemical change.          When increased
molecular motion is imparted to gases at temperatures much
above their points of condensation, and at moderate pressures,
the problem is a comparatively simple one; and has been
solved with great success by Clausius, Maxwell, Thomson,
and others, from the physical side, and from the chemical side
by Pfaundler, Naumann, and Willard Gibbs. But near their
condensing points, and also at high pressures, Boyle's and
Gay-Lussac’s laws no longer hold, owing partly no doubt to
the mutual attraction of the molecules, and      : to the fact
that the absolute size of the molecules is no longer insigni
ficant relatively to the space which they occupy. Both these
causes of deviation may be relegated to the class “physical,”
inasmuch as the mutual attraction alluded to is not confined
to any small number of molecules, but is exercised by each
molecule on all its neighbours, and limited in absolute amount
only by the relative masses of the attracting molecules
and by their distances from each other. But it is also con
ceivable that this attraction may be wholly or in part of a
chemical nature, tending towards the formation of complex
molecules, resulting from combination of two or more simple
molecules. Now as this deviation from the simple gaseous
laws occurs both with what are commonly termed “stable”
and with “dissociable ” substances, it is of importance to
enquire whether the abnormality of the vapour-density of
stable substances is at all due to chemical association of mole
cules; and how much of the abnormality of dissociable sub
stances is to be ascribed to purely physical attraction of the
molecules for each other, due to mere propinquity.
   At any temperature below the £ one, when the volume
of gas is decreased, pressure rises until a certain maximum is
attained, when it becomes constant, and change of state
 occurs. It is conceivable, on the one hand, that the liquid
condition is a purely physical one, and that a liquid consists
of molecules similar in all respects to those of its gas, but,
 owing to their closer proximity, exhibiting that form of at
 traction which is known as cohesion.     And on the other hand,
it has been advanced by Naumann and others that the gaseous
molecules, in changing to liquid, form molecular groups of
definite complexity, exercising cohesive attraction on each
other; and,   £           to this view, the problem is both a
£         and a chemical one. According to the first view, if
  eat be imparted to a liquid, work is done in expansion
against pressure, and in overcoming cohesion; and, according

                     the Nature of Liquids.                    131
to the second view, additional work is done in dissociating the
complex molecules into their simpler constituents, ' in
imparting increased velocity and internal motion to those
constituent molecules (see “Evaporation and Dissociation,”
part i., Trans. Roy. Soc. 1886, Part I.).
   When a substance, such as chloral hydrate or ammonium
chloride, passes from the solid or liquid into the gaseous state,
the physical change is obviously accompanied by a chemical
one, for dissociation into simpler molecules occurs. There is
an obvious analogy between evaporation and such cases of
dissociation; and we have recently undertaken experimental
work to test whether this analogy is a real one.
    In part i. of this series of papers the phenomena attending
the volatilization of such solids as dissociate wholly or partially
on their passage from the solid to the gaseous state have been
studied. There are two ways of measuring the vapour
pressure of a stable substance, which have been termed b
Regnault the statical and the dynamical respectively. The
first consists in measuring the pressure exercised by the
vapour of the substance     #      at a uniform temperature; and
 the second in measuring the highest temperature attainable
 by the substance at given pressures, when evaporation freely
 takes place. It has been shown by Regnault, and by nume
 rous other observers, that these methods give identical results
 with liquids, and by ourselves with £ (Trans. Roy. Soc.
 Part I. 1884, p. 37). But in the case of the majority of the
 dissociable bodies examined, the results of the two methods
 were not identical; indeed, in many cases in which dissociation
 is complete, or nearly so, the temperature of volatilization is
 independent of pressure. With nitrogen peroxide, acetic
 acid, and ammonium chloride, however, the two methods
 gave identical results. This method, therefore, cannot be re
 garded as a means of deciding the question of the analogy
 between evaporation and dissociation, unless, indeed, two
 kinds of chemical combination be conceived, one of which
 may be termed “molecular combination” as distinguished
 from “atomic combination.”
    In parts ii. and iii. the thermal behaviour of stable liquids
 has been investigated, as exemplified by alcohol and ether.
 For a complete account of these researches reference must be
 made to the original papers (Trans. Roy. Soc. 1886, Part I.").
 We are here concerned chiefly with the densities of the
 saturated vapours, and with the heats of vaporization. ...We
 found, with alcohol, that the density of the saturated vapour
 was normal at temperatures below 40° or 50°, and remained
          * The constants for ether will be published shortly.

132                Drs. Ramsay and Young on
normal down to a temperature of 13°, the lowest temperature
at which observations could be made. With ether the vapour
density was approaching normality at 13°, and from the form
of the curve would have doubtless become normal at a lower
temperature. In both cases, with increase of temperature
and corresponding increase of pressure, the density of the
saturated vapour increased towards the critical point with
great rapidity, until at the critical point the weight of unit
volume of the saturated vapour was equal to that of the
liquid.
   '' the critical point the heat of vaporization of a stable
liquid is theoretically zero; below that temperature we found
 it to increase with alcohol and with ether as the temperature
 fell; with ether the increase was found to be continuous to the
 lowest observed temperature 13°; whereas, with alcohol, it
 becomes practically constant below about 20°. Our calculated
 numbers correspond well with direct measurements by various
 observers at the boiling-points under atmospheric pressure.

134                Drs. Ramsay and Young on
   It appears to us that these results negative the “chemical”
explanation of the constitution of liquids, or, to confine our
selves to known cases, of the liquids alcohol and ether. The
molecules of these liquids cannot, we think, be regarded as
complex, consisting of gaseous molecules in chemical combi
nation with each other, as, for example, n(C2H5O), where n is
any definite number. We believe, rather, that the physical
explanation of the nature of liquids is the correct one, and
that the difference between liquids and gases lies merely in
the relative proximity of their molecules.
   The £ argument for this view is that it is difficult to
conceive that the rise of vapour-density of acetic acid, both
at high and at low temperatures, can be due to the same
cause, under conditions so radically different; for at high
temperatures we have conditions unfavourable to chemical
combination, but owing to the necessarily high pressure, the
molecules are in close proximity; whereas, at low tempera
tures, the conditions are £ to chemical combination,
while the molecules, owing to the corresponding low pres
sures, are very far apart. Now we have shown that, with
alcohol and with ether, a rise of density does not accompan
fall of temperature; indeed, the saturated vapour of alcohol,
at low temperatures, obeys the laws of Boyle and Gay-Lussac;
 while the rise of vapour-density at high temperatures is com
mon to all bodies.     But with acetic acid, the lower the tem
perature the higher the density of its saturated vapour—a fact
which indicates the formation of complex molecules; at high
temperatures, however, it forms no exception in behaviour to
ordinary liquids.
   We have shown that with stable substances there is proof
of the absence of complex molecules in their vapours; but it
might be asserted that in the passage from the gaseous to the
liquid state, combination might occur. That this cannot be
the case, is evident from a consideration of the behaviour of
liquids near their critical point. For the specific volumes of
liquid and gas just below the critical point are nearly equal;
and were the liquid to consist of congeries of gaseous mole
cules, there would necessarily be fewer molecules in unit
volume of the liquid than in unit volume of the gas—an im
probable conception.
   It is impossible to decide from our experiments whether
the higher limit of vapour-density of acetic acid is 60; and
the difficulty of measuring small pressures with sufficient
accuracy renders an answer to this question apparently im
possible; but it is a remarkable circumstance that our observa
tions, as well as those of Bineau, should so closely approximate

                     the Nature of Liquids.                    135
to this limit. Although the curves representing the density
of the saturated vapour in figs. 1 and 2 apparently point to a
vapour-density greater than 60, yet a trend in the curve is
not impossible; and it is conceivable that at lower tempera
tures than those represented, the density might remain normal
for C.HsO4.
   If there is a definite limit to the vapour-density of acetic
acid, then the following considerations will hold. It has been
pointed out in our paper on acetic acid, that condensation
took place before pressure ceased to rise; and the same phe
nomenon was observed with chloral ethyl-alcoholate, where
dissociation is known to occur.        Now with alcohol and with
ether absolutely no sign of this behaviour was observable;
condensation £ the moment the vapour-pressure was
reached, but not till then. This behaviour corresponds to that
of a mixture. If an indifferent gas, to take an extreme
instance, is compressed along with the vapour of a conden
sable liquid, pressure continues to rise after condensation has
commenced, until the gas, if possible, has been dissolved, or
has itself condensed. On the other hand, if a small quantity
of liquid of high boiling-point be present along with a large
quantity of liquid of low boiling-point, the liquid of higher
boiling-point separates out first, on reduction of volume,
while pressure continues to rise. This was indeed noticed
with an impure sample of ether; and the absence of this
behaviour affords proof of the homogeneity of a liquid.
   Supposing the vapour of acetic acid to consist of molecules
of two different degrees of complexity, it is probable that the
more complex would be first condensed, and that pressure
would rise until the less complex molecules had also con
densed.    This was in fact observed.         But below a certain
temperature the substance would consist almost wholly of
more complex molecules, and the phenomenon would then be
less visible.   This is indeed the case with the isothermals at
50° and at 78°4. At higher temperatures the phenomenon
becomes evident.     That this behaviour is not the effect of im
purity has been proved by the fact that the vapour-pressures
at low temperatures, measured by the statical and by the
 dynamical methods, were identical.
   Formulae representing the dependence of dissociation on
pressure and temperature have £ proposed from thermo
dynamical considerations by Prof. Willard Gibbs". The
 formula is for acetic acid

136              Drs. Ramsay and Young on
The numbers 2-073 and 4.146 are the densities referred to
air of the molecules C2H2O, and C, HsO, respectively; D is
the observed density; and 3520 and 11:349 are constants
deduced from the determinations of Cahours and Bineau.
This formula, of which the constants in its author's opinion
can claim only approximate correctness, is quite inadequate
to represent actual facts at high temperatures and high
pressures where cohesion becomes marked. For example, it
gives at a temperature of 280° for the density of the saturated
vapour 35:13 instead of the observed number 62.62.
   If our opinion be correct, and if the abnormal density of
saturated vapours and of vapours near their saturation-points
and also above their critical points, at high pressures, of stable
substances, be due to mere molecular proximity, and not to
any form of molecular combination; then a dissociating sub
stance must exhibit a vapour-density which may be partly
due to this cause.    With such a substance as ammonium
chloride, which, we have shown, is almost completely disso
ciated at 280°, the products of dissociation (hydrogen chloride
and ammonia) are under such conditions of temperature and
pressure that they would probably behave as perfect gases;
the relatively few molecules of ammonium chloride which
remain undecomposed in the gaseous state are under such low
£ that their density is        I'         normal for the formula
  H.Cl; and in this case it is probable that the chemical
factor alone determines the vapour-density. But with acetic
acid the increase of density above 150° is evidently wholly
due to the physical cause; while the abnormality is partly
due to a physical, partly to a chemical, cause. It is, how
ever, impossible in this case to ascertain at what temperature
the physical cause begins to operate. It is evidently to be
wished that, from a study of the behaviour of stable substances,
some general law could be discovered which would embrace
all instances of physical abnormality; and many attempts
have been made in this direction, but as yet with only partial
success. Willard Gibbs, on the other hand, has attacked the
problem from the chemical side; and we have shown that his
formula ceases to apply when the physical change becomes
predominant.
   Messrs. E. and L. Natanson" have recently published a
research on the vapour-densities of nitric peroxide (N2O, or
NO2), which, taken in conjunction with experiments of ours
on the vapour-pressures of that body (Phil. Trans. 1886,
Part I.), affords a striking confirmation of the correctness of
our views. They give an isolated observation at –12°6;

and isothermals at 0°, 21°, 49°7, 73°7, 99°8, 129°.9, and
151°4. The limit of pressure was 800 millim. Now the
boiling-point of nitric peroxide is, from our measurements,
21°8; hence the densities of the saturated vapour are de
ducible from only the first three of the Messrs. Natansons'
isothermals. We have plotted their results on curve-paper;
this has shown us the regularity and trustworthiness of their
observations; and by continuing the curves in the direction
in which they run until they intersect the straight lines
denoting vapour-pressures at the temperatures at which their
measurements were made (using for this purpose the vapour
pressures determined by us), the density of the saturated
vapour is determined with but small error.
    The Natansons' numbers are as follows:—
      Temp.    Pressure.   Density.  Temp.    Pressure. Density.
         O      millim.     millim.     O      millim.   millim.

                 250-66      41.90
At –12°6 the vapour-pressure of nitric peroxide is 125 mm.
The density of the saturated vapour must therefore be a little
above 52-54. Now the theoretical density of N2O, is 46. It
may be that the higher density is due to experimental error;
but from graphic representation of the Natansons’ results
this appears improbable. If the measurement is correct, it
would imply that the chemical combination of molecules of
NO, is not complete when the molecular complexity is repre
sented by the formula (NO2)2, but may extend to (NO2)3, or
even further. At 0° the vapour-pressure is 255 millim.; again
the density found by the £ must be nearly that of
saturation. At 21° the vapour-pressure is about 700 millim.;
and a   £ of the curve constructed                 from the above
numbers would cut the line representing the large alteration
of volume with no rise of vapour-pressure at a vapour-density
of about 40. It is evident, then, that with nitric peroxide, as
 with acetic acid, the density of the saturated vapour rises with
 fall of pressure and temperature. Now it is known that nitric
peroxide dissociates, for the physical properties (colour, &c.)
change, on change of (NO2), into n(NO3); and the similarity
of £ between nitric peroxide and acetic acid renders

       XVI. On the Atomic Weights of Silver and Copper.
                      By W. N. SHAw, M.A."
 IN the table of atomic weights given by Landolt and Börn
       stein in their Physikalisch-Chemische Tabellen, p. 1, that
of copper is quoted as 63:18 from L. Meyer and K. Seubert,
and as 63:17 from Clarke. These numbers give the chemical
equivalent of dyad copper as 31:59 and 31:585, respectively.
If we take the value of the atomic weight of silver as 107.66,
we get for the ratio of the chemical equivalents of silver and
copper 3.4080 or 3.4086.
    The atomic weight of silver is given as one of those whose
accuracy is of the first order, with a possible error less than
-05; that of copper is, on the other hand, placed in Class III.,
for which the possible error may reach 0.5. The possible
limits assigned by this to the ratio of the chemical equivalents
are 3.381 and 3.435. The principal determinations of the
atomic weight of copper are by Berzelius, Erdmann and Mar
chand and Hampe; and the methods used may be called strictly
chemical. Hampe used an electric current to extract all the
copper from a solution of the metal, and further tried to de
termine the ratio of the equivalents by comparing the electro
lytic deposits of silver and copper in the same circuit; but he
abandoned the method as unsatisfactory. I have communi
cated to the Electrolysis Committee of the British Association
the details of a number of experiments carried out at the
Cavendish Laboratory under my direction, designed to deter
mine the amount of copper deposited in cells with different
current-densities from a nearly saturated solution of copper
                   * Communicated by the Author.

sulphate, and, if possible, to establish some formula of correc
tion by which t'. deposit of copper at any current-density
could be reduced to that at a standard density. The results
show that the amount of copper deposited tends to a maximum
value when the current-density reaches the highest limit with
which it will give coherent deposits, this limit being about
 13 ampere per square centimetre. The amount of deposit
does not, however, vary appreciably from this until the
current-density is below 025 ampere per square centimetre.
For current-densities less than 02 and down to 0014 the
amount of deposit can, with fair concordance between the
results of different experiments, be reduced to that at the
higher current-densities by multiplying by a factor 1+  *
where d is the current-density; although it is possible that a
slightly different value may have to be assigned to the nume
rator of the fraction when all the circumstances of the state
of the solution, temperature, and other variables are taken
into account.
   The fact that the amount of deposit tends to a limiting
value for high current-densities, but not for low ones, has led
me to examine the results of adopting this as a method of
determining the atomic weight of copper from that of silver.
And the first result that appears is that the ratio of the che
mical equivalents of silver and copper is given, as the mean
of fifteen final experiments with current-densities above '025,
as 3.39983; which differs so little from 3.4000 that this value
may be adopted as the true ratio within the limits of error of
the experiments. The amounts of copper deposited were
 enerally speaking, about 1 gramme, and were weighed to
  1 milligramme. The greatest error from the mean of the
fifteen experiments is 0.058, or nearly 2 per cent.; while the
mean error is .00175, or less than 06 per cent.
   The ratio has been determined experimentally by Lord
Rayleigh in three experiments with      £        bowls, quoted
in the paper by himself and Mrs. Sidgwick in the Philoso
phical Transactions, Part II. 1884, p. 458. His results are
   #}        with current-density about 012 ampere per square
centimetre, and 3.404 with a current-density about 026.
And the subject was brought to the notice of readers of the
Philosophical Magazine by the paper by Mr. T. Gray, last
November. Mr. Gray's number for the ratio is 3:4013, when
the current-density is 02 ampere per square centimetre. The
number that I have here given is derived from experiments
with platinum-wire     £L 2      generally with higher current

densities, and is correspondingly lower. At any rate the
results point to a limiting value for the ratio differing very
little from 3:4000.
   Now if the atomic weight of copper be taken to be 63:18,
as determined by purely chemical methods, the ratio would
be, as stated above, 3.4080. This is the ratio obtained, as the
result deduced from the experiments I am referring to, when
 the current-density is 0085 ampere per square centimetre.
 The variation with current-density is, however, quite con
 tinuous through that value; and there seems to be no good
 reason for supposing that there are a number of secondary
 actions which exactly balance each other at that value. More
 over the number 3:400 lies well within the possible limits
 3.381 and 3.435, assigned in Landolt and Börnstein's table.
    Accepting, then, the value of the ratio of the chemical
 equivalents of silver and copper as 3.4000, it follows that the
 ratio of the atomic weight of silver to that of copper is 17: 10;
 and if the atomic  #       of silver be 107.66, the atomic weight
 of copper is 63.333. These two numbers are evidently thirds
 of whole numbers, and we get the following numerical rela
 tions, which are somewhat remarkable:—
                                  323     17 x 19
                Cu =      $3.43 – 190

                             Cu T 10
   There are many lines of speculation which start from the
grouping of whole numbers suggested by these results. For
instance, if we refer the atomic weights to a unit which is one
third of the weight of the hydrogen atom, the numbers for
silver and copper are whole numbers resolvable into factors.
The resolution of the numbers into factors may correspond to
 the different valencies of the elements: thus the only possible
valencies for silver would be 1, 17, and 19; for copper, 1, 2,
5, and 19. The several groups might then be regarded as
practically separate atoms, each associated with the same
charge of electricity in electrolysis as is always associated with
a monad atom.       The valencies 1 for silver and 1 and 2 for
copper do actually occur. If the atomic weight of oxygen
£ this unit be regarded as 48, the number of possible
valencies would be very great; and the same may be said of
carbon, with the atomic weight 36 referred to the same unit.

    If a compound of silver with a valency 17 or 19, or one of
copper with a valency of 19, were known, this suggestion
might become a somewhat plausible hypothesis; in their
absence it must, I fear, be regarded merely as an idle specu
lation. The only reaction of silver that has occurred to me
as likely to give any evidence of such a compound is its
behaviour with oxygen when melted. I have not, however,
been able to find # composition of the compound or mixture
given more accurately than by the statement that silver gives
out twenty-two times its volume of oxygen when it is nearly at
the point of solidification. Taking this rough statement of
the composition and assuming values for the density of the
silver and oxygen, the formula for the compound works out
to be Ag"O, which is sufficiently near to AgO, to make one
wish that the composition were more accurately known.
    It is perhaps merely a remarkable coincidence that, taking
the atomic weight of potassium as 39.1, and that of sodium as
23, the ratio of the two gives
                          K 1
                         Na T 10 exactly;
or the same as the ratio of the atomic weights of silver and
copper; and in the absence of more complete certainty in the
determinations of atomic weights it may be unwise to speculate
about the matter.

   XVII. On the Foundations of the Kinetic Theory of Gases.
                  Part II. By Professor TAIT".
IN      a former paper   ''   which a brief abstract appeared in
       the Philosophical Magazine for April 1886, p. 343, and
which has since been printed in full in Trans. Roy. Soc.
Edin.) I showed that the recovery of the “special” state by
al # supposed to consist of equal hard spheres takes place, at
ordinary pressures and temperatures, in a period of the order
of 10-9 seconds, at highest.                               *
    This forms the indispensable preliminary to the present
investigation. For it warrants us in assuming that, except
in extreme cases in which the causes tending to disturb the
“special” state are at least nearly as rapid and persistent in
   *Abstract of Papers read to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Decem
ber 6, 1886, and January 7, 1877. Communicated at the instance of Sir
W. Thomson.

142             Prof. Tait on the Foundations of
their action as is the tendency to recovery, a local “special”
state is maintained in every region of the space occupied by a
gas or gaseous mixture. This may be, and in the cases now
to be treated is, accompanied by a common translatory motion
of the particles (or, of each separate class of particles) in the
region—a motion which at each instant may vary conti
nuously from region to region, and may in any region vary
continuously with time.
   A troublesome part of the investigation is the dealing with
a number of complicated integrals which occur in it, and
which (so far as I know) can be treated only by quadratures.
All are of the form
                                y”"
                                    •
                             0   e
where v is that fraction of the whole number of particles of
one kind per cubic unit whose speeds (relatively to those of
the same kind, in the same region, as a whole) lie between v
and v+dv ; and 1/e is the mean free path of a particle whose
speed is v. Throughout the paper regard has been had to the
fact that e must be treated as a function of v. So long as the
particles are of the same kind, or at least of equal mass if
of different diameters, such integrals are easy to evaluate;
but it is very different when the masses differ in two mixed
gases. In what follows, the merely numerical factor of the
expression above will be denoted by C, so that the value of
the expression is, when the masses and diameters are equal,
C./nts”h”, and the introduction of different diameters merely
introduces another factor. Here 3/2h is the mean square speed,
n the number of particles per cubic unit, and s their common
diameter.
   When the masses are unequal there will, in general, be
different mean free paths for particles of two different kinds,
and the integrals cannot be simplified in the above way. In
this case the integrals will be expressed as r, 2G, .
   (1) In the first part of the paper I showed that the Virial
equation is, for equal hard spheres exerting no molecular
action other than the impacts,
                  nPv°/2=3 p(V–2nts'/3),
where n is the number of particles, P the mass of one, sits
diameter, v” the mean-square speed, p the pressure, and V the
volume. The quantity subtracted from the volume is four
times the sum of the volumes of the spheres; and I pointed
out that this expression exactly agrees in form with Amagat’s
experimental results for hydrogen, which were conducted

                   the Kinetic Theory of Gases.               143
through wide ranges of pressure, and between 18° C. and
100°  #
   In a mixture of equal numbers of two kinds of particles, of
diameters s1, s2, I find that for s” in the above formula we
must put
                        + (si" + 283 + s:"),
where s= (s1+s2)/2. Thus the “ultimate volume” is in
creased if the sizes of the particles differ, though the mean
diameter is unaltered.
   (2) For the coefficient of viscosity in a single gas the value
found is
                     PnC.     - p. o.
                   37tns”./h T    #0412,
where p is the density, and A the mean free path. The pro
duct pA is the same at all temperatures, so that the viscosity
is as the square root of the absolute temperature.
   (3) The steady linear motion of heat in a gas is next
considered, temperature being supposed to be higher as we
ascend, so as to prevent complication by convection. It is
assumed, as the basis of the inquiry, that :
   Each horizontal layer of the gas is in the “special” state,
compounded with a vertical translation which is the same for
all particles in the layer.
   *'. following are the chief results:—
   (a) Since the pressure is constant throughout, we have
                                   Pn

so that m/h is constant.                                  -
   (b) Since the motion is steady, no matter passes (on the
 whole) across any horizontal plane. This gives for the speed
 of translation of the layer at v,
                •= (#/." #!"). 3.
    (c) Equal amounts of energy are (on the whole) transferred
 across unit area of each horizontal plane, per unit of time.
 The value is
           E=   £ "( #/n: #/) -5°/d).
 By the above value of p, and its consequence as to the ratio

   Since E is constant, by the conditions, we see that a also
must be constant. Hence, as ht (where r is absolute tempe
rature) is constant, we have    *#    constant, or
                          *=A+B.",
which, when the terminal conditions are assigned, gives the
steady distribution of temperature. The motion of the gas is
analogous to that of liquid mud when a scavenger tries to
sweep it into a heap. The broom produces a general transla
tion which is counteracted by the gravitation due to the
slope, just as the translation of the gas is balanced by the
£         number of particles escaping from the colder and
 enser layers than from the warmer and less dense.
  In thermal foot-minute-centigrade measure, the conductivity
of air, at one atmosphere and ordinary temperatures, appears
from the above expressions to be about

or about 1/28,000 of that of iron. No account, of course, is

   (4) In the case of diffusion, in a long tube of unit section,
suppose that we have, at section v of the tube, ni Pis and
n2 P2s per cubic unit, with translational speeds a1 and 22,
respectively. If G be the whole mass of the first gas on the
negative side of the section, it is shown that the rate of flow

where the right-hand side depends on the collisions between
the two kinds of gas in the layer, s being the semi-sum of the
diameters.    From these we obtain

   In the special case, when the masses and diameters are
equal in the two gases, the diffusion-coefficient (the multiplier
of £da:2 above) has the value

It is therefore inversely as the density, and directly as the
square root of the absolute temperature. And in the case of
two infinite vessels, connected by a tube of length l and sec
tion S, and containing two gases whose particles have equal
masses and diameters, the rate of flow of either is   #    1.785
in mass per unit of time.
   Other cases are treated; and among these it is shown that
with equal masses, and constant semi-sum of diameters, differ
ence of diameters favours diffusion.
XVIII. On the Amount of the Elevations attributable to Com
   pression through the Contraction during Cooling of a Solid
   Earth. By Rev. O. FISHER, M.A., F.G.S."
   T is now thirteen years since I first published in the
      ‘Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society’t,
and, at a later date, in my “Physics of the Earth's Crust’t,
an attempt to estimate the mean height of the elevations
which compression, resulting from the contraction due to
cooling, might give rise to upon the earth considered as a solid
globe.
   A remark   from my friend Mr. Davison, who is working on
this subject, has suggested to me that the investigation I have
given is not quite satisfactory; and I now offer the following
as an improvement.
   If we are to attribute the corrugations which we meet with
in the earth’s crust to compression arising from the secular
cooling of a solid globe, we must assume, as I have tacitly
               * Communicated by the Author.

 146        Rev. O. Fisher on Elevations attributable to
 done in my former work, that the matter in each layer retains
 its horizontal extension during the settlement into its present
 position. On this supposition the corrugations will clearly be
 influenced by the sphericity of the surface. But if we make
 use of Sir W. Thomson's expression" for the temperature at
 any depth, we must recollect that he neglects the sphericity.
 Still it seems probable that his law of cooling for an infinite
 plain will be sufficiently applicable to the globe to make the fol
 lowing of some value. For it is evident that the temperature
 curve for the sphere will be of a similar character, though not
 exactly of a similar form; the more rapid escape of heat to
 wards the convex surface causing the ordinates to decrease
 somewhat more rapidly as the free surface of the sphere is
 "I'  et a layer of the globe at a distance 2 descend, by coolin
 of the matter beneath it, to the distance 2 from the centre         #
Then our assumption, that this layer retains its horizontal
extension, necessitates that we suppose the voluminal con
traction to take place wholly in the vertical dimension.
    Let E be the coefficient of voluminal contraction. If, then,
the layer in question has fallen through 6° since it solidified,
 we must have
                  d2 =(1-E6)dz';
Or                dz'= (1+E6)dz, approximately.
The volume of this layer on first solidifying was
                              4Tr. 2” d2'.
And, after cooling, the thickness of this layer has contracted
to dz, but has retained its horizontal extension. Its volume
therefore becomes
                               47r 2” d2.
Also, the proper volume of the spherical layer of the same
thickness at this depth is
                               47r 2° d2.
And the difference between these volumes will be the contri
bution to the surface-corrugations from this particular layer.
Call the volume of the whole corrugations 4tr°h; we then
shall have
                   47rr? # d2 = 47tz'*dz-47tz’dz.

the contraction of the earth cooling as a solid, were levelled

was 866 feet.
    Practically, these two numbers do not materially differ; and
they show that, if we take into consideration the land and the

than can be accounted for by the theory of compression

too highly favourable suppositions made in the present paper.
The strictly geological arguments against this theory stand
upon their own merits.

my “Physics of the Earth's Crust’ is therefore simply to
confirm the arguments I have built upon the less satisfactory
calculation given in chapter vi. of that book.
        XIX. Silk v. Wire.      By R. H. M. BosANQUET.
    To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
    N a note in the December number of the Philosophical
  H. Magazine for 1886, entitled “Silk v. Wire, or the “Ghost’
in the   Galvanometer,” I mentioned reasons for distrusting
silk, and alluded amongst other things to the way in which it
untwists when stretched. Condensation of expression has its
inconveniences, and in the January number for 1887 Mr.
Gray infers that I used a twisted silk thread, by which, I
presume, he means an artificially-twisted silk thread; but
that is not so. The thread used was prepared from suspension
silk supplied by Elliott Brothers. #. consists of a small
number of fibres more or less aggregated together, and pre
sents no appearance of twist.         is is picked to pieces until
the substance desired is left. It is then fine enough to be
hardly visible.
    I abandoned the use of cocoon-fibres and very small needles
years ago in consequence of the impossibility of accurately
determining the error introduced by the fibre.
    I made at one time a great many observations on silk fibres
of various descriptions. The phenomenon, to which I alluded
 in speaking of the untwisting when stretched, may be de
 scribed as structural twist: it has shown itself as follows, in
 all silk fibres I have ever examined.

 150              Silk v. Wire in Galvanometers.
    If a small weight with a pointer is suspended from a silk
fibre, and it is brought to rest and left covered under glass,
the position will continue slowly to change for some days.
This is what I regard as a consequence of structural twist. It
and the taking of set combined lead to the phenomenon of the
change of zero in galvanometers, leaving the “ghost” out of
consideration for the present.
    With me, sensitiveness is far from being the first require
ment in galvanometers. The elimination of elements of an
inconstant character stands first. Now, when we so greatly
 diminish the moment of the needles as to admit of the pro
 perties of the silk suspension causing changes of the zero, which
 is admittedly the case, we have a demonstration that changes
 depending on the silk are able to influence the results. The
 increase in the length of the silk, according to my experience,
 increases some at least of the irregular effects instead of dimi
nishing them. By the elimination of the silk we can obtain
 instruments quite sufficiently sensitive for practical purposes,
 and entirely free from errors which I regard as introduced by
an incorrect identification of refinement with accuracy.
    Since my former note was written I have wound a pair of
 coils for the galvanometer in question, consisting of about
 500 turns of 16 B.W.G. By employing a cement of shellac
varnish thickened with red lead I was able to wind these solid
without any frame, and so to get all the thick wire into the
same space as before. I thus obtain nearly the same delicacy
as with the old silk suspension. The clearness of the indica
tions, as compared with those of the old galvanometer, is
evidenced by the facility with which the thermoelectric cur
rents, arising from the binding-screws of the circuit, are
identified, a considerable deflection being produced by laying
the finger on the brass binding-screw. With the silk such
effects were not so easily isolated, movements often continuing
even though the circuit was not joined up.
    Mr. Gray deprecates going back, “something like half a
century,” to galvanometers with large needles. I doubt
whether the older experimenters realized the advantages of
wire suspension. But I have always wondered that so little
weight is now attached to the deliberate opinion of Gauss,
that accuracy in such measurements is to be best attained by
enlarging the dimensions of the apparatus. In this matter I
am occasionally tempted to think that the old is better.

XX. An Account of Cauchy's Theory of Reflection and Refrac
    tion of Light. By JAMES WALKER, M.A., Demonstrator at
    the Clarendon Laboratory, Oxford".
Th: theory of reflection and refraction of holds such   #
        an important place among the problems of Optics which
await their solution that it is         £ to have a clear
idea of the work which has been previously done in the subject.
    The theory advanced by Green has been so thoroughly
discussed by Lord Rayleigh and Sir W. Thomson that all
questions connected with it may be considered as completely
settled. But this is by no means the case with Cauchy's
work on the subject; and some account of it may be of in
terest, even though the theory cannot be said to contribute
much towards a solution of the problem.
    Several “reproductions”f of Cauchy's work have indeed
appeared in French and German, but in most of them the
elegance, and therewith the clearness, of Cauchy's method
have been given up; while they leave in more or less ob
scurity the reasoning which led him to enunciate his “principle
of continuity,” and make no mention of a point of considerable
interest, viz. the mistake which originally led to his adoption
of a theory involving the strange assumption of a negative
value for the coefficient of compressibility of the aether.
                                     I.
    Cauchy, at different periods, gave three distinct theories of
reflection: the first two, however, require only a passing
notice, as they were afterwards rejected by him as in no
respect affording a complete solution of the problem.
    The first theory was published in the Bulletin de Férussac
of 1830. It rested on the true dynamical basis of the equality
of pressures: at the interface of the media; but was vitiated
by the neglect of the pressural waves, which must take part
in the act of reflection and refraction. The method led, on
the assumption of the equality of the density of the aether in
the two media, to the formulae given by Fresnel $.
    The second theory was based on a method of obtaining the

 152             Mr. J. Walker on Cauchy's Theory of
 equations of condition at the interface, which was given in a
 lithographed memoir published in 1836. This method assumes
 a change in the equations of motion near the interface to a
 distance comparable with the radius of the sphere of activity
 of a molecule, and leads to the following theorem:—
    “Etant donnés deux milieux ou deux systèmes de molécules
 separés l'un de l'autre par le plan de y2, supposons que des
 equations d'équilibre ou de mouvement généralisées de manière
 a subsister pour tous les points de l’un et de l'autre système
 et même pour les points situés sur la surface de séparation,

membre de chacune des formules les resultäts que fournit la
réduction de a â zéro, dans les deux valeurs de la fonction
#    ou 8 relatives aux points intérieurs du premier et du
second système.”
    The equations of condition resulting from the application of
this theorem were published in Cauchy's memoir on Dispersion
in the same year". They express that the linear dilatation of
the aether normal to the interface is the same for both the
media, and that the rotations in the three coordinate planes
of a particle at the interface is the same, whether the particle
is considered as belonging to the first or second medium.
    The method of deducing these conditions was given in a
memoir presented to the French Academy on October 29,
1838f. This memoir has never been published; and all we
know is that the method involved the assumption that the
velocity of propagation of the pressural waves is very great
compared with that of the distortional wavest. In 1842 Cauchy
showed that these conditions lead to Fresnel's formulaeS.
    The final theory was published in detail in the years 1838
and 1839, and is contained in the 8th and 9th volumes of
the Comptes Rendus, and in the Evercises d’Analyse et de

                                   II.
   Cauchy's final methodt of determining the conditions at the
interface of the media depended on finding the relations
which must exist between the known values of the displace
ments in the interior of the medium, and the values, consistent
with the conditions of the problem, which these displacements
take when the change in the form of the equations of motion
near the interface is taken into account.
   Treating the aether as an isotropic elastic solid, for which
the density is p, and the coefficients of compressibility and
rigidity are k, n, the equations of motion are

Near the interface, and for values of a less than the small

addition of terms whose coefficients are functions of x, which
vanish when v exceeds the small quantity e. These additional
terms may be reduced to linear functions of £, n, £, and their
differential coefficients with respect to wit, since the equations
will still be satisfied by taking—at

   158            Mr. J. Walker on Cauchy's Theory of
   These equations express Cauchy's principle of the continuity
   of the motion of the aether, according to which the incident
   wave passes into the reflected and refracted waves “Sans
   transition brusque.”
      Judging from the historical sequence of Cauchy's papers,
   there can be little doubt that he enunciated this principle as
   the physical interpretation of the result arrived at by reason
   ing analogous to the above; it is, however, impossible to
   agree with v. Ettingshausen that “Cauchy hat diese Gleich
   ungen (6) anfänglich aus Gründen gerechtfertigt, die sich
   auf das Werfahren der Variationen der Constanten zurück
   führen lassen;”* as the principle is already involved in the
   assumption (5)f.
       All that the above analysis really leads to, and all that
   Cauchy! claimed to have established by it, is the necessity for
   including the pressural waves in the problem of reflection and
   refraction.
       Since the true dynamical equations of condition, given by
   the equality of displacements and pressures, are that for w=0,

   it is clear, as has been often pointed out, that Cauchy's
   assumption involves that of the identity of the statical pro
   perties of the aether in the two media. LundquistS, however,
   considers that “Cauchy has established his principle of con
   tinuity by the aid of analysis, the exactitude of which it is
   not easy to contest;” and hence that this result, combined
   with the dynamically exact conditions (7), proves “the legiti
   macy of Green's assumption of the equality of the compres
   sibility and the rigidity of the aether in the two media.”
       Cauchy himself did not see that this was involved in his
      * Sitzb der Wien. Akad. xviii. p. 371.
      t I do not think Cauchy contemplated a continuous rapid transition
   of one medium into the other (cf. C. R. x. p. 347); neither does
   v. Ettingshausen in his paper. Supposing the assumption justified on
   these grounds, yet, as von der Mühl has  '        out, the former assump
   tion respecting the coefficients of the additional terms in the modified
   equations precludes the assumption of a finite change in the statical pro
   perties of the media (Matt. Ann. v. p. 477).

   Taking, as before, the interface of the media as the plane

   No attempt has been made, so far as I am aware, to indi
cate the reasons which led to Cauchy's adoption of the above
remarkable relations between the coefficients of compressibility
and rigidity of the aether in a medium.
   In order to find a relation between the coefficients, Cauchy
considered     the    condition     which must be fulfilled if the
incident light is completely polarized by reflection.
   This condition is that M=0, giving since

   In his first memoir on the subject, Cauchyt, forgetting to
take into account the fact of the media being on different sides

   He then argued that incomplete polarization must be due
to the fact that these expressions differ slightly from zero, and
that their value must be negative, in order that the pressural
waves should be insensible at a distance from the interface for
all angles of incidence.
   In a memoir published in 1840 and in the Exercises
d’Analyse et de Physique", this mistake was corrected, and the
true condition p/(m+n)=p'/(m'+ n’) was given; but, appa
rently led astray by his original mistake and by a desiref
(afterwards given up, Compt. Rend. xxviii. p. 125) to make
complete polarization depend on the properties of the refracting
medium alone, and not on any relation between the two
media, he still adopted the solution
                            m+n=0=m'+n';
though he mentioned; also the true solution, viz. that the coeffi
cient of compressibility of the aether is infinite, and the wave
lengths of the pressural waves in the two media are equal.
   Assuming that the aether is incompressible, the polarization
of the reflected ray will be elliptical when the wave-lengths of
the pressural waves are unequal, and we get
                     M=(#–1)(#1)
where Xu, X" are the wave-lengths of the pressural waves in
the two media. This is Eisenlohr's suggestion; but the
form in which he made it does not show that it involves the
absolute incompressibility of the aether. If Am/A"=X/A, we
get Green's formula: , EisenlohrS says that this assumption
is absolutely untenable: it is, however, as Green shows, a
direct consequence of the assumption made by him, and in
volved in Cauchy's conditions, viz. the identity of the statical
properties of the aether in the two media.
   £ than that, if we assume only the equality of the
rigidities, the equations of condition become (8), (9b); whence

 166            Mr. J. Walker on Cauchy's Theory of
    Haughton's" suggestion that the coefficient of compressi
 bility is very great, but not infinite, does not help matters;
 so that it would appear that the only way to escape the diffi
 culty is by one of Lord Rayleigh'st suggestions:—
    (1) That “although the transition between the two media
is so sudden that the principal waves of transverse vibrations
are affected nearly in : same way as if it were instantaneous,
yet we may readily imagine that the case is different for the
surface-waves, whose existence is almost confined to the layer
of variable density.”
    (2) That “the densities concerned in the propagation of the
so-called longitudinal waves are unknown, and may possibly not
be the same as those on which transverse vibrations depend.”
   Eisenlohr # gives another (it appears entirely empirical)
value for M: it involves, as Cauchy’s, a negative value for
the coefficient compressibility of the aether, and leads to
formulae closely agreeing with experiment; as, however, they
contain a third disposable constant, this close agreement is
hardly to be wondered at.
                                    W.
    Cauchy's formulae for metallic reflection were originally
published on April 15, 1839$, and thus were obtained from his
second set of equations of condition, in which the pressural
waves were neglected. The formulae were republished on
January 17, 1848, and apparently no attempt was made to
obtain equations in which the influence of the pressural waves
was included.
   Cauchy considers the peculiarities of metallic reflection to
be due to a complex value of the refractive index.

Green's equations gives the reflection total at all angles of
incidence. For this result there is no experimental evidence
at present, except in the case of silver. The same will result
from Lord Rayleigh’s extension of Green’s theory, unless, as
seems scarcely probable, the refractive index of the pressural
waves is a complex quantity.

    In the same year (1850) Cauchy extended his method to
 the problem of crystalline reflection: the complete solution
 was given in a memoir presented to the French Academy on
 September 16, 1850*.                                              -
    ' memoir was never published, though it was announcedf
 to appear in the 23rd volume of the Mémoires de l'Académie ;
 and we have only slight indications of Cauchy's manner of
 dealing with the problem.
    In accordance with the results of his theory of double
 refraction, Cauchy does not suppose the vibrations to be
 necessarily strictly transversal ' longitudinali. In order
 to eliminate the amplitudes of the latter vibrations, he assumes
 as an approximation the strict transversality of the former,
 and thus obtains' four equations between the quasi-transversal
 amplitudes, which contain three coefficients, whose values are
 known when coordinate axes are taken depending on the re
 fracting surface and the plane of incidence.
    A second memoir          is devoted to the determination of the
 value of these coefficients, when fixed directions in the crystal
 are taken as the axes.          The value of this determination is
 lessened by the fact, that at the very commencement an
 approximation is made depending on the peculiar relation
 between the coefficients of elasticity, which we have considered
 above.
    This is all that has been published, except some notes indi
  cating a few of the results of his analysis; it is, however,
 probable" that Cauchy first obtained a solution on the assump
  tion of the strict transversality of the luminous vibrations,
  and then proceeded to apply corrections to the values thus
  obtained, and it is possible" that he adopted in the solution
  MacCullagh's idea of uniradial directions.
     There is no need to enter further into this part of Cauchy’s
  work, as Briotff has employed both these methods in his excel
  lent adaptation of Cauchy's theory to the problem of Crystalline
  Reflection.

        XXI. On the Self-induction of Wires.—Part VI.
                     By OLIVER HEAVISIDE".
TH:of most       important as well as most frequent application
           Mr. S. '' Christie's differential arrangement, known
at various times under the names of Wheatstone's parallelo
gram, lozenge, balance, bridge, quadrangle, and quadrilateral,
is to balance the resistances of four conductors, when sup
porting steady currents due to an impressed force in a fifth,
and is done by observing the absence of steady current in a
sixth. But its use in other ways and for other purposes has
not been neglected. Thus, Maxwell described three ways of
using the Bridge to obtain exact balances with transient cur
rents (these will be mentioned later in connection with other
methods); Sir W. Thomson has used it for balancing the
capacities of condensersf; and it has been used for other
purposes. But the most extensive additional use has been
probably in connection with duplex telegraphy; and here,
along with the Bridge, we may include the analogous differ
ential-coil system of balancing, which is in many respects a
simplified form of the Bridge.
   On the revival of duplex telegraphy some fifteen years ago,
it was soon recognized that “the line” required to be balanced
by a similar line, or artificial line, not merely as regards its
resistance, but also as regards its electrostatic capacity-ap
proximately by a single condenser; better by a series of smaller
condensers separated by resistances; and, best of all, by a more
continuous distribution of electrostatic capacity along the
artificial line.   The effect of the unbalanced self-induction
was also observed. This general principle also became clearly
recognized, at least by some,—that no matter how complex a
line may be, considered as an electrostatic and electromag
netic arrangement, it could be perfectly balanced by means
of a precisely similar independent arrangement; that, in fact,
the complex condition of a perfect balance is identity of the
two lines throughout. The great comprehensiveness of this
principle, together with its extreme simplicity, furnish a strong
reason why it does not require formal demonstration.         It is
sufficient to merely state the nature of the case to see, from
the absence of all reason to the contrary, that the principle is
COrrect.
   Thus, if ABC and AB,C be two identically similar inde
pendent lines (which of course includes similarity of environ
               * Communicated by the Author.

174                  Mr. O. Heaviside on the
ment in the electrical sense in similar parts), joined in parallel,
having the A ends connected, and also the C ends, and wejoin
A to C by an external independent conductor in which is an
impressed force e, the two lines must, from their similarity,
be equally influenced by it, so that similar parts, as B1 in
 one line and B, in the other, must be in the same state at the
same moment. In particular, their potentials must always be
equal, so that, if the points B1 and B, be joined by another
conductor, there will be no current in it at any moment, so far
as the above-mentioned impressed force is concerned, however
it vary. The same applies when it is not mere variation of
the impressed force e, but of the resistance of the branch in
which it is placed. And, more generally, B1 and B, will be
always at the same potential as regards disturbances origina
ting in the independent electrical arrangement joining A to C
externally, however complex it may be.
   There is, however, this point to be attended to, that might
be overlooked at first. Connecting the bridge-conductor from
B1 to B, must not produce current in it from other causes
than difference of potential; for instance, there should be, at
least in general, no induction between the bridge-wire and the
lines, or some special relation will be required to keep a balance.
This case might perhaps be virtually included under similarity
of environment.
   If we had sufficiently sensitive methods of observation, the
statement that one line must be an exact copy of the other
would sometimes have to be taken literally. '' the word
copy may practically be often used to mean copy only as
regards certain properties, either owing to the balance being
independent of other properties, or owing to our inability to
recognize the effects of differences in other properties. Thus,
in the steady resistance-balance, we only require AB1 and AB,
to have equal total resistances, and likewise BIC and B,C ;
resistances in sequence being additive. But evidently, if the
balance is to be kept whilst B, and B, are shifted together
from end to end of the two lines, the resistance must be
similarly distributed along them.
   If, now, condensers be attached to the lines, imitating a sub
marine cable, though of discontinuous capacity, we require
that the resistance of corresponding sections shall be equal, as
well as the capacities of corresponding condensers, in order
that we shall have balance in the variable period as well as in
the steady state; and the two properties, resistance and ca
pacity, are the elements involved in making one line a copy
of the other.
   In case of electromagnetic induction, again, if ABIC and

                       Self-induction of Wires.                  175
 AB2C each consist of a number of coils in sequence, they will
 balance if the coils are alike, each for each, in the two lines,
 and are similarly placed with respect to one another. But
 the lines will easily balance under simpler conditions, coeffi
 cients of self-induction being additive, like resistances; and
 it is only necessary that the total self-inductions of AB1 and
 AB, (including mutual induction of their parts) be equal, and
 likewise of BiC and B2C. Again, if a coil al in the branch
 AB1 have another coil b1 in its neighbourhood (not in either
 line, but independent), and as be a copy of a1, in the branch
 AB2, we can complete the balance by placing a coil b2 which
 is a copy of b1 in the neighbourhood of the coil a, so that the
action between a, and b1 is the same as that between as and b2.
 But it is not necessary for b1 and b2 to be copies of one another
 except in the two particulars of resistance and self-induction;
 whilst as regards their positions with respect to ai and a2, we
 only require the mutual induction of a1 and b1 to equal that of
as and b2.
    On the other hand, if bi be a piece of metal, not a coil of
 fine wire, that is placed near the coil ai, many more specifica
 tions are required to make a copy of it. The piece of metal
 is not a linear conductor; and, although no doubt only a small
 number (instead of an infinite number) of degrees of freedom
 allowed for would be sufficient to make a practical balance,
yet, as we have not the means of simply analyzing pieces of
metal (like coils) into a few distinct elements, we must generally
make a copy of b1 by means of a similar piece of the same
metal, b2, and place it with respect to as as b1 is to ai, to secure
a good balance. But very near balances may be sometimes
obtained by using quite dissimilar pieces of metal, dissimilarly
Placed.
    So far, copy signifies equality in certain properties. But
one line need be merely a reduced copy of the other. It is
only when we inquire into what makes one line a reduced copy
of another, that we require to examine fully the mathematical
conditions of the case in question. In the state of steady flow
the matter is simple enough. If AB1 has n times the resist
ance of AB2, then must BIC have n times the resistance of
B,C to keep the potentials of B1 and B2 equal. If condensers
be connected to the lines, as before mentioned, we require,
first, the resistance-balance of the last sentence applied to
every section between a pair of condensers; and next, that
the capacity of a condenser in the line ABIC shall be, not
n times (as patented by Mr. Muirhead, I believe), but 1/n of
the capacity of the corresponding condenser in the line AB2C".

 176                 Mr. O. Heaviside on the
 If the lines are representable by resistance, self-induction,
 electrostatic capacity, and leakage conductance (R, L, S, K
 of Parts IV. and W., per unit lengths), one line will be a
 reduced copy of the other if, when R and L in the first line
 are n times those in the second, S and K in the second are
 n times those in the first, in similar parts.
    After these general remarks, and preliminary to the con
 sideration of the quadrilateral, let us briefly consider the
general theory of the conjugacy of a pair of conductors in a
connected system, when an impressed force in either can cause
no current in the other, either transient or permanent. The
direct way is to seek the full differential equation of the cur
rent in either, when under the influence of impressed force in
the other alone. Let W =ZC be the differential equation of
any one branch, C being the current in it, W the fall of
potential in the direction of C, and Z the differential operator
concerned, according to the notation of Parts III., IV., and
V. If there be impressed force e in the branch, it becomes
e+W =ZC. We have XV=0 in any circuit, by the potential
property; therefore Xe=XZC in any circuit. Also the cur
rents are connected by conditions of continuity at the junctions.,
These, together with the former circuit equations, lead us to a
set of equations:—
                    FC, Jue, + fixes +
                         :                - - -
                    FC2 = fuel + f22e2+...                    (1c)
C1, C2, ..., being the currents, and e1, e2,... the impressed
forces in branches 1, 2, &c.; F being common to all, and it
and the f’s being differential operators. We arrive at similar
equations when the differential equation of a branch is not
merely between the V and C of that branch, but between
those of many branches; for instance when
                    V1 = Z11C1+Z12C2+. . . . . . . (2c)
is the form of the differential equation of branch 1.
   Now let there be impressed force e in one branch only, and
C be the current in a second, dropping the numbers as no
longer necessary. We then have
                           FC = f(e). . . . . . . (3c)
   Conjugacy is therefore secured by f(e)=0, making C inde
pendent of e. Therefore f(e)=0 is the complex condition of
conjugacy. If, for example,
                   f(e) = age--aiè-H agè-H..., . . . . (4c)

cannot have conjugacy.
    What C may be then depends only upon the initial state of
the system in subsiding, or upon other impressed forces that
we have nothing to do with. As depending upon the initial
state, the solution is

obvious, but after that it is less easy.
   If F contain inverse powers of p, the steady current may
be zero. But in spite of that, it will be found that to secure
perfect conjugacy for transient currents, we must have a true
resistance-balance, or that relation amongst the resistances
which would make the steady current zero, if we were to
allow the possibility of a steady current by changing the
value of other electrical quantities concerned. I will give an
example of this later.
   I have elsewhere" pointed out these properties of the func
tion F, in the case where there is no mutual induction, or
W=ZC is the form of the differential equation of a branch.
Let n points be united by $n (n-1) conductors, whose con
ductances are K12, K13, &c., it being the points that are
numbered 1, 2, &c. Then the determinant
                         Kni, K, ..., Knn
is zero, and its first minors are numerically equal, if any K
with equal double suffixes be the negative of the sum of the
real K's in the same row or columnf.           Remove the last row
and column, and call the determinant that is left F. It is the
F required, and is the characteristic function of the combina
tion, expressed in terms of the conductances. If every branch
have self-induction, so that R+L(d/dt) takes the place of
K-1, then F=0 is the differential equation of the combination,
without impressed forces, and F=0 is always the differential
equation subject to the condition of no mutual induction. In

special form to K.
   When K is conductance merely, the characteristic function
contains within itself expressions for the resistance between
every two points in the combination, which can therefore be
written down quite mechanically. For it is the sum of pro
ducts each containing first powers of the K’s, and therefore

 The proof by determinants is rather troublesome, using the
 K’s, but, in terms of their reciprocals, and extending the
  roblem, it becomes simple enough. Thus if we turn K to
 '' in   F, and then clear of fractions, we may write F=0 as

 where X's, Ylis, do not contain R12; &c. From this we see
 that the differential equation of the current Cl2 in 1, 2, sub
ject to e12 only, is

 if R'l=Y12/X's. For this make the dimensions correct,
 and that is the only additional thing required, when we
 observe that it makes the fixed steady current

 so that R's, is the resistance complementary to R12.
    Although it is generally best to work in terms of resist
 ances, yet there are times when conductances are preferable,
 and, to say nothing of conductors in parallel are, the above
 is a case in point, as will be seen by the way the characteristic
 function is made up out of the K’s. There is also less work
 in another way. Thus, $n(n-1) conductors uniting n points
 give #(n-1)(n–2) degrees of freedom to the currents. It
 is the least number of branches in which, when the currents
 in them are given, those in all the rest follow. Thus, if 10

 180                Mr. O. Heaviside on the
 conductors unite 5 points, the currents in at least 6 conductors
 must be given, and no four of them should meet at one point.
 The remaining conductors are n-1 in number, or one less
 than the number of points, and n-1 is the degree of the
 characteristic function in terms of the conductances.          Now
 put F=0 in terms of the resistances, by multiplying by the
 product of all the resistances. It is £ made of degree
#(n-1)(n-2) in terms of the resistances, which is the num
 ber of current freedoms. If n=4, the degree is the same,
viz. three, whether in terms of conductances or resistances;
but if n=5, it is of the sixth degree in terms of resistances
and only of the fourth in terms of the conductances; and if
n=6, it is of the tenth degree in terms of the resistances, but
 only of the fifth in terms of the conductances, and so on; so
that F becomes enormously more complex in terms of resist
ances than conductances.
   When every branch has self-induction, Z= R+Lp, and the
degree of p in F=0 is the number of freedoms, so that there
are n-1 fewer roots than the number of branches.           It is the
same when there is mutual induction. The missing roots
belong to terms in the solutions for subsidence from an arbi
trary initial state which instantaneously vanish, producing a
jump from the initial state to another, which subsides in time.
    On the other hand, if every branch (without self-induction)
is shunted by a condenser of capacity S1, S2, &c., K becomes
K+Sp, so that the degree of p in #" is the same as that
of K, or #(n-1)(n-2) fewer than the number of con
densers *.
   Coming next to the Wheatstone quadrilateral self-induction
balance, let there be six conductors, 1, 2, &c., uniting the four
points A, B1, B, C in the figure. ABIC and AB2C are the
lines referred to in the beginning. Let R be the resistance
and L the inductance of a                              B

   “Practically, take
                     R = R2, and L1=L2; . . . . (28c)
that is, let branches 1 and 2 be of equal resistance and induct
ance. Then the second and third conditions become identical;
and, to get perfect balance, we need only make
                     R3= R4, and L3=L4. . . . . (29c)
   “This is the method I have generally used, reducing the
three conditions to two, whilst preserving exactness. It is
also the simplest method. The mutual induction, if any, of
1 and 2, or of 3 and 4, does not influence the balance when
this ratio of equality R1 = R2 is employed (whether L1=L, or
not)*. So branches 1 and 2 may consist of two similar wires
wound together on the same bobbin, to keep their tempera
tures equal.” +
   Of the eight quantities, four R's and four L’s, only five
can be : arbitrarily, of which not more than three may
be R's, and not more than three may be L’s. We may state
the matter thus :—There must first be a resistance-balance.
Then, if we give definite values to two of the L’s, the cor
 responding time-constants become fixed, and it is required
that the other two time-constants shall be equal to them;
thus
                  either       w1=a's and wa=w,
                  or else      wi=ws       and    v3–w.
    Thus the remaining two L's become usually fixed. In fact,
 eliminating R, and L, from (26c) by (25c) and (27c), the
 second condition may be written
                          (v1-v2)(a1-x5)=0.
    Suppose R1, R2, R, given, then R, is fixed by (25c).
 Two of the inductances may then be given, fixing the
 corresponding time-constants.             If these inductances be Li
 and L2, then we must have (unless wi=ws)
                            a'1'=w8,   a 2 = 4'4.
 But if L, and L3 be given, then we require (unless wi=ws)

manipulating the Z's like resistances. The absence of
branch 5 thus reduces the number of free-subsidence systems
to two. Now, if we choose v1=ws, we shall make
             (L1+ L2)/(R1+ R3) = (L2+ L.)/(R, +R.),
or the time-constants of the two branches 1+3 and 2+4
equal. Then one of the p’s is
                       p1=
                          __ R1+Rs.
                                Li+ L2 °
and this is only concerned in the free subsidence of current
in the circuit ABICB2A. Consequently the second p, which is
              1,–– (Li(#if:{{s}'at'it':2)
                          + L2)R2+ L2(R1+R2)’
is alone concerned in the setting-up of current by the im
 pressed force in 6; and the current divides between ABC
and AB2C in the ratio of their conductances, in the variable
 period as well as finally. In fact, the fraction in the above
equation of C, will be found to contain Z1+Z, as a factor in
 its numerator and denominator, thus excluding the p1 root,
 so far as e is concerned. On the other hand, if we choose
 wi=ws, we do not have equality of time-constants of ABIC
and AB,C, so that there are two p’s concerned, which are not
 those given ; and the current Co does not, in the variable
 period, divide between ABIC and AB,C in the ratio of their
 conductances, but only finally.
    In the above statement it was assumed that when Li and
 Ls were chosen, it was not so as to make wi=ws. When this
 happens, however, it is only the ratio of L3 to L, that becomes
 fixed, for we have als=w = anything.
    Similarly, when Li and L3 are so chosen that wi=ws, we
 shall have a 2–w. = anything, so that only the ratio of L2 to
 L. is fixed.
    And if L3, L be so chosen that wa=v, then wi=ws = any
 thing, only fixing the ratio of L1 to L2. But should wa not
 =w, then we require wi=a's and v2 =w, thus fixing Li and L2.
    And if L2, L be so chosen that a' =w, then a' =ws= any
 thing, only fixing the ratio of R1 to Rs. But if so that as not
  =w, then w1–42 and w8 =w, fix L1 and L3.
    There are yet two other pairs that may be initially chosen,
 and with somewhat different results. Let it be Li and L, that
 are chosen; if not so as to make wi=w, there are two ways

184                 Mr. O. Heaviside on the
of fixing L2 and L3, viz. either by wi=ws and wa=w, or by
w =ws and vs=w, ; but if so that v1=w, in the first place, then
they must also =ws=ws.
   £          the choice of L2 and L3 so as not to make vs =ws
gives two ways of fixing Li and Li, by vertical or by hori
zontal equality of time-constants, as before; whilst v2=ws
produces equality all round.
   The special case of all four sides equal in resistance may be
also noticed. Balance is given in two ways, either by hori
zontal or by vertical equality in the L’s.
   Leaving the mathematical treatment for a little while, I
  roceed to give a short general account of my experience of
induction-balances. I did not originally arrive at the method
of equal ratio just described through the general theory, (20c)
to (27c), but simply by means of the general principle of
balancing by making one line a copy of the other, of which I
obtained knowledge through duplex telegraphy, and inves
tigated the conditions (25c) to (27c) more from curiosity than
anything else, though the investigation came in useful at
last. In 1881 I wished to know what practical values to
give to the inductances of various electromagnets used for
telegraphic    ": and to       get this knowledge went to the
£, .             Not having coils of known inductance to start
with, I employed Maxwell’s condenser method", with an
automatic intermitter and telephone. Let 1, 2, and 3 be
inductionless resistances, and 4 a coil having self-induction.
Put the telephone in 5, the battery and intermitter in 6. We
require first the ordinary resistance-balance, RIR = R2R3.
But the self-induction of the coil will cause current in 5 when
6 is made or broken. This will be completely annulled by
shunting 1 by a condenser of capacity S1, such that
                         RIS = LA/R1,
signifying that the time-constant of the coil on short-circuit
and that of the condenser on short-circuit with the resistance
R1 are equal.
   The method is, in itself, a good one. But the double
adjustment is sometimes very troublesome, especially if the
capacity of the condenser be not adjustable. For when we
vary Ri, to approximate to the correct value of R1S, we
upset the resistance-balance, and have therefore to make
simultaneous variations in some of the other resistances to
restore it.  But the method has the remarkable recommenda
tion of giving us the value of the inductance of a coil at once
in electromagnetic units.

                         Self-induction of Wires.                      185
     In the course of these experiments I observed the upsetting
 of the resistance- and induction-balance by the presence of
 metal in the neighbourhood of the coils, which is manifested
 in an exaggerated form in electromagnets with solid cores.
 So, having got the information I wanted in the first place, I
 discarded the condenser method with its troublesome adjust
 ments, and, to study these effects with greater ease, went to
 the equal-ratio method with the assistance that I had obtained
 by the condenser method, the values of the inductances of
 various coils, to be used as standards.
    “To use the Bridge to speedily and accurately measure the
 inductance of a coil, we should have a set of proper standard
 coils, of known inductance and resistance, together with a
 coil of variable inductance, i.e. two coils in sequence, one of
which can be turned round, so as to vary the inductance from
a minimum to a maximum *.               The scale of this coil could be
 calibrated by (12a), first taking care that the resistance
balance did not require to be upset. This set of coils, in or
 out of circuit according to plugs, to form say branch 3, the
coil to be measured to be in branch 4, Ratio of equality.
 Branches 1 and 2 equal. Of course inductionless, or prac
 tically inductionless, resistances are also required to get and
keep the resistance-balance. The only step to this I have
 made (this was some years ago) . . . . was to have a number
 of little equal coils, and two or three multiples; and get
 exact balance by allowing induction between two little ones,
 with no exact measurement of the fraction of a unit.”f
    Although rather out of order, it will be convenient to
 mention here that although I have not had a regular induction
box made (the coils, if close together, would have to be closed
 solenoids), yet shortly after making these remarks, I returned
 to my earlier experiments by calibrating the scale of the coil
 of variable inductance.       As it then becomes an instrument of
 precision, it deserves a name ; and as it is for the measure
ment of induction it may, I think, be appropriately termed
an Inductometer. Of course, for many purposes no calibra
tion is needed.
    I found that the calibration could be effected with ease and
rapidity by the condenser method more conveniently than by
comparisons with coils. Thus, first ascertain the minimum
and the maximum inductance, and that of the coils separately.
Suppose the range is from 20 to 50 units (hundreds, thou

arbitrary size of the instrument). It will then be sufficient
to find the places on the scale corresponding to 20, 21, 22, &c.,
49, 50. Starting at 21, set the resistance-balance so that L.
should be 21 units; turn the movable coil till silence is
reached, and mark the place 21. Then set the balance to suit
22, turn again till silence comes, and mark again; repeat
throughout the whole range. Why this can be done rapidly
is because the resistance-balance is at every step altered in the
same manner.         We have thus an instrument of constant
resistance and variable known inductance, ranging from
                  li + l2–2mo    to   li + l2 +2mo,
if li and l, are the separate inductances and mo the maximum
mutual inductance. The calibration is thoroughly practical,
as no table has to be referred to to find the value of a certain
deflection.
    I formerly chose 10° centim, as a practical unit of in
ductance, and called it a tom; the attraction this had for me
arose from L toms--R ohms equalling L/R seconds of time.
But it was too big a unit, and millitoms and microtoms were
wanted. Another good name is mac. 10" centim. might be
called a mac. Since Maxwell made the subject of self
induction his own, and described methods of correctly mea
suring it, there is some appropriateness in the name, which,
as a mere name, is short and distinctive.
    The two coils of the inductometer need not be equal; but
 it is very convenient to make them so, before calibration, by
 the equal-ratio method, which, of course, merely requires us
 to get a balance, not to measure the values. Let 1 and 2 be
 any equal coils; put one coil of the inductometer in 3, the
 other in 4, and balance. It happened by mere accident that
my inductometer had nearly equal coils; so I made them
quite equal, to secure two advantages. First, there is facility
 in calculations; next, the inductometer may be used with its
 coils in parallel or in sequence, as desired. When in parallel,
the effective resistance and inductance are each one fourth of
the sequence values. Thus, let V =ZC be the differential
equation of the coils in parallel, C being the total current,
and V the common potential fall; it is easily shown that

thus proving the property stated. We may therefore make
one inductometer serve as two distinct ones, of low or high
resistance.                                             -
   There does not seem to be any other way of making the
two coils in parallel behave as a single coil as regards external
electromotive force. Any number of coils whose time
constants are equal will, when joined up in parallel, behave
as a single coil of the same time-constant; but there must be
no mutual induction. (An example of the property * that any
linear combination whose parts have the same time-constant
has only that one time-constant.) This seriously impairs the
utility of the property. This reservation does not apply in
the case of the equal-coil inductometer.
    Having got the inductometer calibrated, we may find the
inductance of a given coil, or of a combination of coils in
sequence, with or without mutual induction, nearly as rapidly
as the resistance. Thus, 1 and 2 being equal, put the coil to
 be measured in 3, and the inductometer in 4.             We have to
make R3 = R, and L3=L, or to get a resistance-balance, and
 then turn the inductometer till silence is reached, when the
 scale-reading tells us the inductance. This assumes that La
 lies within the range of the inductometer. If not, we may
 vary the limits as we please by putting a coil of known
 inductance in sequence with branch 3 or 4 as required, putting
 at the same time equal resistance in the other branch.
    Or, the inductometer being in 4, and 1, 2 being induc
 tionless resistances, put the coil to be measured in 3. If it has
 a larger time-constant than the inductometer's greatest, insert
 resistance along with it to bring the time-constants to equality.
 The conditions of silence are R1R = R2R3 and L3/R3=LA/R4.
 Here a ratio of equality is not required. The method is
 essentially the same as one of Maxwell’sf, and is a good one
 for certain purposes.
    Or, 1 and 2 being any equal coils, put one coil of the

gives the induction-balance, L, being here the inductance of
the coil of the inductometer in 4, and M4s the mutual induc
tance of the two coils, in the position giving silence. This is
known in all positions, because the scale-reading gives the
value of li + l2 +2m (or else 2(l-H m) if the coils are equal),
and li + l2 is known. If the range is not suitable, we may,
as before, insert other coils of known inductance.
   There are other ways; but these are the simplest, and the
equal-ratio method is preferable for general purposes. I
have spoken of coils always, where inductances are large and
small errors unimportant. When, however, it is a question of
small inductances, or of experiments of a philosophical nature,
needing very careful balancing, then the equal-ratio method
acquires so many advantages as to become the method.
   “So long as we keep to coils we can swamp all the irregu
larities due to leading wires &c., or easily neutralize them, and
can therefore easily obtain considerable accuracy. With short
wires, however, it is a different matter.         The inductance of a
circuit is a definite quantity: so is the mutual inductance of
two circuits. Also, when coils are connected together, each
forms so nearly a closed circuit that it can be taken as such ;
 so that we can add and subtract inductances, and localize
 them definitely as belonging to this or that part of a circuit.
 But this simplicity is, to a great extent, lost when we deal
 with short wires, unless they are bent round so as to make
 nearly closed circuits. We cannot fix the inductance of a
 straight wire, taken by itself. It has no meaning, strictly
 speaking. The return current has to be considered. Balances
 can always be got, but as regards the interpretation, that
 will depend upon the configuration of the apparatus.
    “Speaking with diffidence, having little experience with
 short wires, I should recommend 1 and 2 to be two equal
 wires, of any convenient length, twisted together, joined at
 one end, of course slightly separated at the other, where they
join the telephone wires, also twisted. The exact arrangement
 of 3 and 4 will depend on circumstances. But always use a
 long wire rather than a short one (experimental wire). If
 this is in branch 4, let branch 3 consist of the standard coils
 (of appropriate size), and adjust them, inserting, if necessary,
 coils in series with 4 also. Of course I regard the matter
 from the point of view of getting easily interpretable
 results.” +

                     Self-induction of Wires.                189
   Consider the equations (24e) to (27c). Three conditions
have to be satisfied, in general, the resistance-balance (25c)
and the balance of integral extra-current (26c) not being
sufficient. To illustrate this in a simple manner, let 2 and 3
be equal coils, by previous adjustment, and 1 and 4 coils
having the same resistance as the others, but of lower induc
tance, or else two coils whose total resistance in sequence is
that of each of the others, but of lower inductance when
separated. The resistance-balance is satisfied, of course.
Now, if the next condition were sufficient to make an
induction-balance, all we should have to do would be to make
Li+ L =2L3.       For instance, if Li is first adjusted to equal
L2 and L3, then, by increasing either L1 or L, to the right
amount, silence would result.     It does result when it is L4
that is increased, but not when it is Li. If the sound to be
quenched is slight, the residual sound in the L1 case is feeble
and might be overlooked ; but if it be loud, then the residual
sound in the L1 case is loud and is comparable with that to
be destroyed, whilst in the L. case there is perfect silence.
   The reason of this is that in the L1 case we satisfy only the
:
well.
        condition, whilst in the L4 case we satisfy the third as
   Another way to make the experiment is to make 1, 2, and
3 equal, and 4 of the same resistance but of lower inductance,
much lower. Then the insertion of a non-conducting iron
core in 1 will lead to a loud minimum, but if put in 4 will
bring us to silence, except as regards something to be men
tioned later.
   Supposing, however, we should endeavour to get silence by
operating upon Li, although we cannot do it exactly, yet by
destroying the resistance-balance we may approximate to it.
Thus we have a false resistance- and a false induction-balance,
and the question would present itself, If we were to wilfully
go to work in this way in the presence of exact methods,
how should we interpret the results? As neither (25c) nor
(26c) is true, it is suggested that we make use of the formula
based upon the assumption that the currents are sinusoidal
or pendulous, or S.H. functions of the time. Take p"=-n”
in (24c), the frequency being n/2T, and we find
                 R. R.,(wl + w.) R2R3(r, + a's) 3 * * * (34c)

                (R,R,-R2R3) = n°(LiL1-L2 La) . . (35c)
are the two conditions to be satisfied; and we can undoubtedly,
if we take enough trouble, correctly interpret the results, if
the assumption £ has been made is justifiable.
   I should have been fully inclined to admit (and have no

 190                     Mr. O. Heaviside on the
 doubt it is sometimes true) that, with an intermitter making
 regular vibrations, we might regard the residual sound as
 due to the upper partials, and that n/2T could be taken as
 the frequency of the intermitter, and (34 c), (35 c) employed
 safely, though not with any pretensions to minute accuracy,
 if circumstances compelled us to ignore the exact methods of
 true balances, were it not for the fact that this hypothesis
 sometimes leads to utterly absurd results when experimentally
 tested. Of this I will give an illustration, and, as we have
 only to test that intermittences may be regarded as S.H.
 reversals, simplify by taking R1 = R2, Li = L2, which makes
 an exact equal-ratio balance, R3 = R4, L3=L4.
    Since a steady or slowly varying current does not produce
 sound in the telephone, if a battery could be treated as an
 ordinary conductor, we could put it in one of the sides of the
 quadrilateral and balance it, just like a coil, in spite of its
 electromotive force. So, let 1 and 2 be equal coils, 3 the
 battery to be tested, and 4 the balancing coils. I find that a
 good battery can be very well balanced, though not perfectly,
 with intermittences, as regards resistance, which is, however,
 far less with rapid intermittences than with a steady current".
 Thus: steady, 2% ohms; intermittent (about 500), 1% ohm.
 Another battery: steady, 166 ohms; intermittent, 126 ohms.
 The steady resistances are got by cutting out the intermitter,
 using a make-and-break instead; the deflection of a galvano
 meter in 5 must be the same whether 6 is in or out.                 If we
 leave out the battery in 6, it becomes Mance’s method. The
 sensitiveness is, however, far greater when the battery is not
 left out, although other effects are then produced.
    So far regarding the resistance. As regards the inductance,
 or apparent inductance, of batteries, that is, I find, usually
 negative. That is to say, after bringing the sound to a
 minimum by means of resistance-adjustment, the residual
 sound (sometimes considerable) may be quenched by inserting
 equal coils in branches 3 and 4, and then increasing the
 inductance of the one containing the battery under test. I
 selected the battery which showed the greatest negative induc
 tance, about $ mac, or 500,000 centim, got the best possible
 silence by adjustment of resistance and inductance, and then
 found the residual sound could be nearly quenched by allowing
 induction between the coil in 3 and a silver coin, provided, at
 the same time, R4 were a little increased.
    It was naturally suggested by the negative inductance and

tences to find the resistance of electrolytes, but have no knowledge of how
he gets at the true resistance.

 lower resistance that the battery behaved as a shunted con
 denser, or as a shunted condenser with resistance in sequence,
 or something similar; and I examined the influence of the
 frequency on the values of the effective resistance and induc
 tance. The change in the latter was uncertain, owing to the
 complex balancing, but the apparent resistance was notably
 increased by increasing the frequency, viz. from 125 to 130
 ohms, when the frequency was raised from about 500 to about
 800, whilst there was a small reduction in the amount of the
 negative inductance. The effect was distinct, under various
 changes of frequency, but was the opposite (as regards
 resistance) of what I expected on the S.H. assumption. To
 see whereabouts the minimum apparent resistance was (being
 165 steady), I lowered the speed by steps. The resistance
 went down to 113 with a slow rattle, and so there was no
 minimum at all. The S.H. assumption had not the least
 application to the apparent resistance, as regards the values
 165 steady, 113 slow intermittences, although it no doubt is
 concerned in the rise from 113 to 130 at frequency 800.
 The balance (approximate) was some complex compromise,
 but was principally due to a vanishing of the integral extra
 current. Of course in such a case as this we should employ
a strictly S.H. impressed force; a remark that applies more
 or less in all cases where the combination tested does not
 behave as a mere coil of constant R and L.
   The other effects, due to using a battery in branch 6 as well,
are complex. It made little difference when the current in the
cell was in its natural direction; but on reversal (by reversing
the battery in 6) there was a rapid fall in the resistance—for
instance, from 46 ohms to 18 ohms in half a minute in the
case of a rather used-up battery, but a comparatively small
fall when the battery was good.
   Besides the advantage of independence of the manner of
variation of the impressed force (in all cases where the re
sistance and inductance do not vary with the frequency), and
the great ease of interpretation, the equal-ratio method gives
us independence of the mutual induction of 1 and 2 and of
3 and 4; and this, again, leads to another advantage of an
important kind. If the arrangement is at all sensitive, the
balance will continually vary, on account of temperature
inequalities occurring in experimenting, caused by the breath,
heat of hands, lamps, &c. Now, if the four sides of the
quadrilateral consist of four coils, equal in pairs, it is a
difficult matter to follow the temperature changes. To restore
a resistance-balance is easy enough; but more than that is
needed, viz. the preservation of the ratio of equality. But, by

192                     Mr. O. Heaviside on the
reason of the independence of the self-induction balance of
M12, we may, as before mentioned, wind them together, and
thus ensure their equality at every moment. There is then
only left the inequality between branches 3 and 4, which
must, of course, be separated for experimental purposes, and
that is very easily followed and set right.               hen a sound
comes on, holding a coin over the coil of lower resistance will
quench it, if it be slight and due to resistance inequality, and
tell us which way the inequality lies. If it be louder, the
cancelling will be still further assisted by an iron wire over or
in the same coil, or by a thicker iron wire alone, for reasons
to be presently mentioned.
    On the other hand, a small inequality in the inductance may
be at once detected by a fine iron wire, quenching the sound
 when over or in the coil of lower inductance; and when the
 resistance- and induction-balances are both slightly wrong, a
combination of these two ways will show us the directions of
departure. These facts are usefully borne in mind and made
 use of when adjusting a pair of coils to equality, during
 which process it is also desirable to handle them as little as
possible, otherwise the heating will upset our conclusions and
 cause waste of time. But a pair of coils once adjusted to
equality, and not distorted in shape afterwards, will practically
 keep equal in inductance; for the effect of temperature
variation on the inductance is small, compared with the
resistance change.
    Regarding the intermitter, I find that it is extremely de
 sirable to have one that will give a pure tone, free from harsh
 irregularities, for two reasons: first, it is extremely irritating to
 the ear, especially when experiments are prolonged, to have
to listen to irregular noises or grating and fribbling sounds;
next, there is a considerable gain in sensitiveness when the
tone is pure".
    Coming now to the effects of metal in the magnetic field of
 a coil, the matter is more easily understood from the theoretical
point of view in the first instance than by the more laborious
 course of noting facts and evolving a theory out of them—a
quite unnecessary procedure, seeing that we have a good
theory already, and, guided by it, have merely to see whether
it is obeyed and what the departures are, if any, that may
require us to modify it.
    First, there is the effect of inductive magnetization in
increasing the inductance of a coil. Diamagnetic decrease is
   * I. e. pure in the common acceptation, not in the scientific sense of
having a definite single frequency, which is only needed in a special class
of cases, when no true balance could be got without it.

                       Self-induction of Wires.               193
quite insensible, or masked by another effect, so that we are
confined to iron and the other strongly magnetic bodies.
The foundation of the theory is Poisson’s assumption (no
matter what his hypothesis underlying it was) that the
induced magnetization varies as the magnetic force; and
when this is put into a more modern form, we see that
impressed magnetic force is related to a flux, the magnetic
£ through a specific quality, the inductivity, in             the
same manner as impressed electric force is related to electric
conduction-current through that other specific quality, the
conductivity of a body. Increasing the inductivity in any
part of the magnetic field of a coil, therefore, always increases
the inductance L, or the amount of induction through the
 coil per unit current in it, and the magnetic energy, #LC".
 The effect of iron therefore is, in the steady state, merely
 to increase the inductance of a coil, without influence on its
 resistance. I have, indeed, speculated" upon the existence of
 a magnetic conduction-current, which is required to complete
 the analogy between the electric and magnetic sides of
 electromagnetism; but whilst there does not appear to be any
 more reason for its existence than its suggestion by analogy,
 its existence would lead to phenomena which are not ob
 served.
    But this increase of L by a determinable amount—deter
 minable, that is, when the distribution of inductivity is
 known, on the assumption that the only electric current is
 that in the coil-breaks down when there are other currents,
 connected with that in the coil, such as occur when the latter
 is varying, the induced currents in whatever conducting
 matter may be in the field. L then ceases to have any
 definite value. But in one case, that of S.H. variation, the
 mean value of the magnetic energy becomes definite, viz.
 #L'C', where L' is the effective L, and Co the amplitude of
 the coil-current, the change from to } being by reason of
 the mean of the square of a sine or cosine being 4. This
 definiteness must be, because the variation of the coil-current
 is S.H., as well as that of the whole field. That L' is less
 than L, the steady-flow value, may be concluded in a general
  though vague manner from the opposite direction of an in
  duced current to that of an increasing primary, and its
  magnetic field in the region of the primary; or, more dis
  tinctly, from the power of conducting-matter to temporarily
  exclude magnetic induction.
     In a similar manner, the resistance of a coil, if regarded as
  the R in RC", the Joulean generation of heat per second,

194                  Mr. O. Heaviside on the
ceases to have a definite value when the current is varying, if
C be taken to be the coil-current, on account of the external
generation of heat. But in the S.H. case, as before, the mean
value is necessarily a definite quantity (at a given frequency),
making 'R'C, the heat per second, where R is the effective
resistance. That R is always greater than R is certain, and
obvious without mathematics; for the coil-heat is #RC,”, and
there is the external heat as well. It is suggested that, in a
similar manner, a non-mathematical and equally clear demon
stration of the reduction of L is possible. The magnetic
energy of the coil-current alone is #LC,”, and we have to
show non-mathematically, but quite as clearly as in the
argument relating to the heat, that the existence of induced
external current reduces the energy without any reference to
a particular kind of coil or kind of distribution of the external
conductivity. Perhaps Lord Rayleigh’s dynamical generali
zation" might be made to furnish what is required.
   When the matter is treated in an inverse manner, not
regarding electric current as causing magnetic force, but as
caused by or being an affection of the magnetic force, there is
some advantage gained, inasmuch as we come closer to the facts
as a whole, apart from the details relating to the reaction on the
coil-current. Magnetic force, and with it electric current, a
certain function of the former, are propagated with such
immense rapidity through air that we may, for present pur
poses, regard it as an instantaneous action. On the other
hand, they are diffused through conductors in quite another
manner, quite slowly in comparison, according to the same
laws as the diffusion of heat, allowing for their being vector
magnitudes, and that the current must be closed, thus pro
ducing lateral propagation. The greater the conductivity and
the inductivity, the slower the diffusion. Hence a conductor
brought with sufficient rapidity into a magnetic field is, at the
first moment, only superficially penetrated by the magnetic dis
turbance to an appreciable extent; and a certain time—which
is considerable in the case of a large mass of metal, especially
copper, by reason of high conductivity, and more especially
iron, by reason of high inductivity more than counteracting
the effect of its lower conductivity—is required before the
steady state is reached, in which the magnetic field is calcul
able from the coil-current and the distribution of inductivity.
And hence a sufficiently rapidly oscillatory impressed force
in the coil-circuit induces only superficial currents in a piece
of metal in the field of the coil, the interior being com
paratively free from the magnetic induction.

    The same applies to the conductor forming the coil-circuit
itself; it also may be regarded as having the magnetic dis
turbance diffused into its interior from the boundary, and we
have only to make the coil-wire thick enough to make the
effect of the approximation to surface-conduction experi
mentally sensible. But in common fine-wire coils it may be
wholly ignored, and the wires regarded as linear circuits.
There is no distinction between the theory for magnetic and
for non-magnetic conductors; we pass from one to the other
by changing the values of the two constants, conductivity and
inductivity. Nor is there any difference in the phenomena
produced, if the steady state be taken in each case as the basis
of comparison. But, owing to copper having practically the
same inductivity as air, there seems to be a difference in the
theory which does not really exist.
    A fine copper wire placed in one (say in branch 3) of a
pair of balanced coils in the quadrilateral, under the influence
of intermittent currents, produces no effect on the balance.
Its inductivity is that of the air it replaces, so that the steady
magnetic field is the same; and it is too small for the diffu
sion effect to sensibly influence the balance. On the other
 hand, a fine iron wire, by reason of high inductivity, requires
the inductance of the balancing-coil (say in 4) to be increased.
The other effect is small in comparison, but quite sensible, and
 requires a small increase of the resistance of branch 4 to balance
it. A thick copper wire shows the diffusion effect; and if
 we raise the speed and increase the sensitiveness of the
 balance, its £ may be decreased as much as we please,
 if other things do not interfere, and still show the diffusion
effect. If thick, so that the disturbance is considerable, the
approximate balancing of it by change of resistance is insuffi
cient, and the inductance of coil 4 requires a slight decrease
or that of 3 a slight increase. A thick iron wire shows both
effects strongly: the inductance and the resistance of branch 3
must be increased. These effects are greatly multiplied when
big cores are used; then the balancing, with intermittences,
at the best leaves a considerable residual sound.          The in
fluence of pole-pieces and of armatures outside coils in
increasing the inductance, which is so great in the steady
state, becomes relatively feeble with rapid intermittences.
This will be understood when the diffusion effect is borne in
mind.
    If the metal is divided so that the main induced conduction
currents cannot flow, but only residual minor currents, we de
 stroy the diffusion effect more or less, according to the fineness
 of the division, and leave only the inductivity effect. In my

196                  Mr. O. Heaviside on the
early experiments I was sufficiently satisfied by findin
that the substitution of a bundle of iron wires for a         £
iron core, with a continuous reduction in the diameter
of the wires, reduced the diffusion effect to something
quite insignificant in comparison with the effect when the
core was solid, to conclude that we had only to stop the
flow of currents to make iron, under weak magnetizing
forces, behave merely as an inductor. More recently, on
account of some remarks of Prof. Ewing on the nature
of the curve of induction under weak forces, I immensely
improved the test by making and using nonconducting cores,
containing as much iron as a bundle of round wires of the
same diameter as the cores. I take the finest iron filings (sift
ings) and mix them with a black wax in the proportion of 1 of
wax to 5 or 6 of iron filings by bulk. After careful mixture
 I roll the resulting compound, when in a slightly yieldin
state, under considerable pressure, into the form of solid £
cylinders, somewhat resembling pieces of black poker in
appearance. ($ inch diameter, 4 to 6 inches long.) That
the diffusion effect was quite gone was my first conclusion.
 Next, that there was a slight effect, though of doubtful
 amount and character. The resistance-balance had to be very
 carefully attended to. But, more recently, by using coils
 containing a much greater number of windings, and thereby
 increasing the sensitiveness considerably, as well as the
 magnetizing force, I find there is a distinct effect of the
 kind required. Though small, it is much greater than could
 be detected ; but whether it should be ascribed to the cause
 mentioned or to other causes, as dissipation of energy due to
 variations in the intrinsic magnetization, or to slight curvature
 in the line of induction, so far as the quasi-elastic induction is
 concerned, is quite debateable. To show it, let 1 and 2 be
 equal coils wound together (L=3 macs, R=47 ohms), 3 and
 4 equal in resistance (R3 = R =93 ohms), but of very unequal
 inductances, that of coil 3 (L3=24 macs) being so much
 greater than that of coil 4 that the iron core must be full
 inserted in the latter to make L = L2. (Coils 3 and 4; 14 £
 external, inch internal diameter, and # inch in depth. Fre
 quency 500.) The balancing of induction is completed by
 means of an external core.        Resistance of branch 6 a few
 ohms, E.M.F. 6 volts. There is, of course, immense sound
 when the core is out of coil 3, but when it is in there is merely
 a faint residual sound which is nearly destroyed by increasing
 R; by about who part, a relatively considerable change. On
 the other hand, pure self-induction of copper wires gives
 perfect silence, and so does Moi, a method I have shown to be

                     Self-induction of Wires.                197
exact *. [I may, however, here mention that in experiments
with mere fine copper-wire coils there are sometimes to be
found traces of variations of resistance-balance with the fre
quency of intermittence, of very small amount and difficult to
elucidate owing to temperature-variations.] Balancing partly
by Ms. and partly by the iron cores, the residual sound in
creases from zero with Me only, to the maximum with the
cores only. Halving the strength of current upsets the
induction-balance in this way. The auxiliary core must be
set a little closer when the current is reduced.      This would
indicate a slightly lower inductivity with the smaller magne
tizing force, and proves slight curvature in the line of induc
tion. But, graphically represented, it would be invisible
except in a large diagram.
    It is confidently to be expected, from our knowledge of
the variation of u, that when the range of the magnetizing
force is made much greater, the ability of nonconducting iron
to act merely as an increaser of inductance will become con
siderably modified, and that the dissipation of energy by
variations in the intrinsic magnetization will cease to be
insensible. But, so far as weak magnetizing oscillatory
 forces are concerned, we need not trouble ourselves in the
 least about minute effects due to these causes.       Under the
 influence of regular intermittences, the iron gets into a
 stationary condition, in which the variations in the intrinsic
 magnetization are insensible. It seems probable that u
 must have a distinctly lower value under rapid oscillations
 than when they are slow. The values of u calculated from
 my experiments on cores have been usually from 50 to 200,
 seldom   higher.  I should state that I define u to be the ratio
 B/H, if B is the induction and H the magnetic force, which is
 to include h, the impressed force of intrinsic magnetization.
 (See the general equations in Part I. f.) It is with this u, not
 with the ratio of the induction to the magnetizing force as
 ordinarily understood, that we are concerned with in experi
 ments of the present kind.
     Knowing, then, that iron when made a nonconductor acts
 merely as an inductor, when we remove the insulation and
 make the iron a solid mass, it requires to be treated as both a
  conductor and an inductor, just like a copper mass, in fact, of
  changed conductivity and inductivity. When the coil is a
  solenoid whose length is a large multiple of its diameter, and
  the core is placed axially, the phenomena in the core become
  amenable to rigorous mathematical treatment in a compara

it is to be found, as he remarks, by calculating the reaction of
the core on the coil-current. This I have fully done in my
article on the subject. Another method is to calculate the
heat in the core, to obtain the increased resistance. This I
have also done.      When the diffusion effect is small, its in

calculations. The same applies to a considerable number of
unpublished investigations concerning coils and cores that I
made, including the effects of dielectric displacement; the
analysis is all very well, and is interesting enough for educa
tional purposes, # the interpretations are so difficult in
general that it is questionable whether it is worth while either
publishing the investigations or even making them.
   Professor Hughes" has also devoted some attention to
induction in cores, and has arrived at the remarkable conclu
                      * Proc. Roy. Soc. 1886.
   Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 23. No. 141. Feb. 1887.          P

202                 Mr. O. Heaviside on the
sion that he has obtained experimental evidence of the exist
ence of induced currents therein. Now, although when it
is considered that although induced currents in wires were
known to exist, yet the possibility of their existing in metal
not in the form of wires was only a matter of the wildest
speculation, Professor Hughes's conclusion must be admitted
to be very comforting and encouraging.
   Leaving now the question of cores and the balance of
purely electromagnetic self-induction, and returning to the
general condition of a self-induction balance ZIZ, = Z.Z.,
equation (23c), let the four sides of the quadrilateral consist
of coils shunted by condensers. Then R, L, and S denoting
the resistance, inductance, and capacity of a branch, we have
                  Z={Sp+(R+Lp)"#"; . . . . (550)
so that the conjugacy of branches 5 and 6 requires that
           {Sp+(R, +Lip)"}{Sp+(R,+Lp)")
         ={S-p+(R,+Lip)"}{Sp+(R.--Lip)="), (56c)
wherein the coefficient of every power of p must vanish,
giving seven conditions, of which two are identical by having
a common factor. It is unnecessary to write them out, as
such a complex balance would be useless; but some simpler
cases may be derived. Thus, if all the L’s vanish, leaving
condensers shunted by mere resistances, we have the three
conditions
                       R1|R1= R2R3,
               SI/R4 + S/R1  :  S./Rs + S3/R3,   -  -  -  (57c)
                        SIS, :- S2S3,
 which may be compared with the three self-induction condi
 tions (25c) to (27c).
   If we put RS=y, the time-constant, the second of (57c)
 may be written
                       3/1 +y,  - 3/2 +3/3, *  * *  *  *  (58c)
 which corresponds to (26c).      If S =0=S, the single con
 dition in addition to the resistance-balance is y1=ys. If
 S1=0=S2, it is y2=y.
    Next, let each side consist of a condenser and coil in
 sequence. Then the expression for Z is
                    Z= R+Lp+ (Sp)-', . . . . . (592)

                         Self-induction of Wires.              203
    which gives rise to five conditions,

                      LIL = L.L.
       Here it looks as if the resistance-balance were unneces
    sary; and, as there can be no steady current, this seems a
    sufficient reason for its not being required. But, in fact, the
    third condition, by union with the others, eliminating
    S3, L3, S, and L, by means of the other four conditions,
    becomes
 = (R. R._R RA SIS2(R.S.-R.S.)(L1R2-RIL)-(L.S.-LiS)”
o=(RR-R-R) *#####" (olo
    So the obvious way of satisfying it is by the true resistance
    balance.
       If there are condensers only, without resistance-shunts,
    we have
                               Z= (Sp)",     .   .  . . . .   (62c)
    so that
                               SIS1=S2S3 .      .  .  . . .   (63c)
    as the sole condition of balance.
       If two sides are resistances, R1 and R2, and two are con
    densers, S3 and S4, we obtain
                             R1/R2=S/Ss . . . . . . (64c)
    as the sole condition. The multiplication of special kinds
    of balance is a quite mechanical operation, presenting no
    difficulties.
       Passing now to balances in which induction between diffe
    rent branches is employed, suppose we have, in the first
    place, a true resistance-balance, RIR = R2R3, but not an
    induction-balance, so that there is sound produced. Then,
    by means of small test coils placed in the different branches,
     we find that we may reduce the sound to a minimum in a
     £ many        ways   ly  allowing induction between different
      ranches. If the sound to be destroyed is feeble, we ma
     think that we have got a true induction-balance; but if it is
                                   P 2

204                  Mr. O. Heaviside on the
loud, then the minimum sound is also loud, and may be com
parable to the original in intensity. We may also, by upset
ting the resistance-balance by trial, still further approximate
to silence, and it may be a very good silence, with a false
resistance-balance. £ question arises, Can these balances,
or any of them, be made of service and be as exact as the
previously described exact balances? and are the balances
easily interpretable, so that we may know what we are doing
when we employ them?
    There are fifteen M’s concerned, ard therefore fifteen ways
of balancing by mutual induction when only two branches at
a time are allowed to influence one another, and in every case
three conditions are involved, because there are three degrees
 of current-freedom in the six conductors involved. Owing
 to this, and the fact that in allowing induction between a pair
 of branches we use only one condition (i. e. giving a certain
 value to the M concerned), whilst the resistance-balance makes
 a second condition, I was of opinion, in writing on this sub
ject before", that all the balances by mutual induction, using
 a true resistance-balance, were imperfect, although some of
 them were far better than others. Thus, I observed experi
 mentally that when a ratio of equality (R1 = R2, Li = L2) was
 taken, the balances by means of Mg3 or Me, were very good,
 whilst that by Mos was usually very bad, the minimum sound
 being sometimes comparable in intensity to that which was
 to be destroyed.
     I investigated the matter by direct calculation of the in
 tegral extra-current in branch 5 arising on breaking or
 making branch 6, due to the momenta of the currents in the
 various branches, making use of a principle I had previously
  deduced from Maxwell's equations f, that when a coil is
 discharged, through various paths, the integral current divides
  as in steady flow, in spite of the electromotive forces of in
  duction set up during the discharge. This method gives us
  the second condition of a true balance.
     But more careful observation, under various conditions,
  showing a persistent departure from the true resistance
  balance in the Mes method (due to Professor Hughes), and
  that the Mg3 and Me, methods were persistently good and
  were not to be distinguished from true balances, led me to
  suspect that the second and third conditions united to form
  one condition when a ratio of equality was used (just as in
  (28c), (29c) above) in the M63, and Me, methods, but not in
  the Mes method.      So I did what I should have done at the

beginning: investigated the differential equations concerned,
verified my suspicions, and gave the results in a Postscript.
I have since further found that, when using the only practi
cable method of equal ratio, there are no other ways than those
described in the paper referred to of getting a true balance of
induction by variation of a single L or M, after the resistance
balance has been secured. This will appear in the following
investigation, which, though it may look complex, is quite
mechanical in its simplicity.
   Write down the equations of electromotive force in the
three circuits 6+1+3, 1+5–2, and 3-4-5, when there
is impressed force in branch 6 only. They are (p standing
for d/dt),

    Now, eliminate C1, C2, Cs by the continuity conditions
         C = Cs+C, C2=C1-C5, C = Cs+C., .                .   (66c)
 giving us
            €6= XuC, + XI.C. + XiaCs,

 is the complex condition of conjugacy of branches 5 and 6.
 This could be more simply deduced       #    assuming Cs=0 at

         206                 Mr. O. Heaviside on the
         the beginning, but it may be as well to give the values of all
        the X's, although we want but four of them. Thus
XII =    R1+R2+ Re-H (Li + L2+ Le +2Mg1+2Mg2+2M31)p,                       \
XI2 =   Re-H (La --Me-H Me -- Mi2+ M114-Mis-H Mas + M3 + Ms)p,
X13 =   R1+ (L1 + Mel-Me2+ Mos-Mi2+ MI5+ Mai-Max + M35)p,
X21=    R1+(L1+MI5+ MI5+ MI6+ Mg2+ M,6-M21–M23-M26)p,
X*= -R2+ (–L2+MI2 + Mia-H MI6+ M.: + M, + Mos-M2,-Ms.)p, 2 (69c)
X23= R1+R2+R, + (Li + L2+ L; --2M15–2M25–2Mi2)p,

X33––R,+ (-L5 + Mai-Max + Mas-Mu + M,2-M is + M,2-M51).p.
            Now, using the required four of these in (68c), and arranging
         in powers of p, it becomes
                            0=Ao + Alp-HA2p*. . . . . . (70c)
        So Ao =0 gives the resistance-balance; A1=0, in addition,
        makes the integral transient current vanish; and A2=0, in
        addition, wipes out all trace of current.
            There is also the periodic balance,
                           A1=0,        Ao=A2n", .      .  .   . .   (71c)
        if the frequency is n/2t.
           The values of Ao and A1 are
                              Ao–R2R3-R. R., . . . . . (72c)

      In this last, let the coefficients of R2, R2, R1, R, in the
     brackets be q2, q3, q1, q2. Then the value of A2 is
     A2=L2 L3-L,L, + L2% + L293 + Liqi + L(Q.--q273-qaq.            . (7.4c)
            It is with the object of substituting one investigation for a
        large number of simpler ones that the above full expressions
        for A1 and A2 are written out.
            If we take all the M’s as zero, we fall back upon the self
        induction balance (25 c) to (27c). Next, by taking all the
        M’s as zero except one, we arrive at the fifteen sets of three
         conditions. Of these we may write out three sets, or, rather,

                     Self-induction of Wires.               207
the two conditions in each case besides the resistance-balance
condition, which is   ''     the same.
   All M’s=0, except Mss.
          R. R.(x1 + v.-a'-a') = (R, +R2)     :      •    (75c)

                   LIL1-L2L3= - (Li +L4)M16.
   As these only differ in the sign of the M, we may unite
these two cases, allowing induction between 6 and 3, and 6
and 4. The two conditions will be got by writing Mas-Mio
for M36 in (75c).
   All M’s=0, except Ms. (Prof. Hughes's method).
   0=R1|R1(x, +w,-a'-a') + M58(R1 + R2 + R3 +      *      (77c)
   0=LIL4-L2L2+ Msg(L) + Ls + Ls + Ls).
   Now choose a ratio of equality, R = R2, L = L2, which is
the really practical way of using induction-balances in
general. In the M36 case the two conditions (75 c) unite to
form the single condition
                        L1-L3=2M38,      •  •  * *  *  *  (78c)
and in the M16 case (76c) unite to form the single condition
        -               L1-L3=-2M16. . . . . . (79c)
We know already that the same occurs in the simple Bridge
(29c), making
                             L1=Ls; . . . . . . (80c)
so that we have three ways of uniting the second and third
conditions. Now examine all the other M’s, one at a time,
on the same assumption, R1 = R2, L1=L2. With M12 we
obtain
            (L1-L3)(L1-M12) =0,         and   L1=Ls.
But L1-M12 cannot vanish; so that
                             L1=Ls . . .       . .   .  . (81c)
is the single condition. Similarly, in case of Mus,
                             L =Ls . . . . .         .  . (82c)
again. All these, (77 c) to (82 c), were given in the paper
referred to ; the last two mean that M12 and M3, have abso
lutely no influence on the balance of self-induction.
   All the rest are double conditions. Thus, in A1 and As

       If we compare the two general conditions (83c), (84c), we
   shall see that whenever
                              Q194-q973–0,
   we may obtain the reduced forms of the conditions by adding
   together the values of La–L, given by every one of the M’s
    concerned. We may therefore bracket together certain sets
    of the M’s. To illustrate this, suppose that Mis and M24 are
    existent together, and all the other M's are zero. Then (92c)
    and (93c) give, by addition,
               L-L-(M.–M)(1– #).
                                          L       L
               L-L-M.-Met Mai: –Mai:
    which are the conditions required.
        Similarly M12 and M3, may be bracketed. Also Mg1, Meg,
    Mes, Ms., and Mss. Also Mal, Mg2, Mss, Ms., and M56. But
    M11 and M2s will not bracket.
        As already observed, the self-induction balance (28c) (29c)
     is independent of M12 and Ms., when these are the sole mutual
     inductances concerned; that is, when R1 = R2, L = L2, R3 = R,
     L3= L. By (92c) and (93c) we see that independence of
     M13 and M21 is secured by making all four branches 1, 2, 3,4
    equal in resistance and inductance.
        But it is unsafe to draw conclusions relating to inde
     pendence when several coils mutually influence, from the
     conditions securing balance when only one pair of coils at a
    time influence one another. Let us examine what (83.c) and
     (84c) reduce to when there is induction between all the four
     branches 1, 2, 3, 4, but none between 5 and the rest or
     between 6 and the rest.     Put all M’s=0 which have either
     5 or 6 in their double suffixes, and put L = L3. Then we may
     write the conditions thus:—
0=(1+RA/R1)(M14-M23)+(1-R/R1)(M24-M13),                 . . . . . (96c)
0=(Ln+L)(M11–M2s) + (L1-L3)(M24-M13) + M's-M', .
    + (M24-M13)(M31-M12) + (M14–M2s) (M2i + M13-M12-Ma.),           (97c)
     The simplest way of satisfying these is by making
                      M11=M23 and        M24= M13. .  .  . .  (98c)
     If these equalities be satisfied, we have independence of M12
      and  Ms.
        Now, if we make the four branches 1, 2, 3, 4 equal in

210                   Mr. O. Heaviside on the
resistance and inductance, so that in (96c) and (97c) we have
R = R and L1=L, the first reduces to
                         0=M14-M38,       -   -  -  - - -  (99e)
so that it is first of all absolutely necessary that M11=Mes, if
the balance is to be preserved; whilst, subject to this, the
second condition reduces to
                    0=(M24-Mis)(Ma-M12), . . . (100c)
so that either M24= M13, or else M3 – M12. Thus there are
two ways of preserving the balance when all four branches
are equal, viz. M =M. and M21=Mus, independent of the
values of M12 and M3a; and M11=M25 and M31=M12, inde
pendent of the values of M2, and M13.
   The verification of these properties, (98c) and later, makes
some very pretty experiments, especially when the four
branches consist, not merely of one coil each, but of two or
more. The meanings of some of the simpler balances are
easily reasoned out without mathematical examination of the
theory; but this is not the case when there is simultaneous
induction between many coils, and their resultant action on
the telephone-branch is required.
   Returning to (96c) and (97c), the nearest approach we can
possibly £ to independence of the self-induction balance
of the values of all the M’s therein concerned, consistent with
keeping wires 3 and 4 away from one another for experi
mental purposes, is by winding the equal wires 1 and 2
together. Then, whether they be joined up straight, which
makes M13= M23 and M14=M2, identically, or reversed, making
M13= -M23      and  M11= -M24, We shall     find that
                              M14=M23
is the necessary and sufficient condition of preservation of
balance.
   At first sight it looks as if Mai and M32 must cancel one
another when wires 1 and 2 are reversed. But although 1
and 2 cancel on 3, yet 3 does not cancel on 1 and 2 as regards
the telephone in 5. The effects are added. On the other
hand, when wires 1 and 2 are straight, 3 cancels on them as
regards the telephone, but 1 and 2 add their effects on 3.
Similar remarks apply to the action between 4 and the equal
wires 1 and 2 when straight or reversed; hence the necessity
of the condition represented by the last equation.
   On the other hand, Mol and Ms. cancel when 1 and 2 are
straight, and add their effects when they are reversed; whilst
Mg1 and MR2 cancel when 1 and 2 are reversed, and add their
effects when they are straight, results which are immediately

                     Self-induction of Wires.                  211
evident. But wires 1 and 2 must be thoroughly well twisted,
before being wound into a coil, if it is desired to get rid of
the influence of, say, Mol and Mes, when it is a coil that
operates in 6, and this coil is brought near to 1 and 2. [This
leads me to remark that a simple way of proving that the
mutual induction between iron and copper (fine wires) is the
same as between copper and copper, which is immensely more
sensitive than the comparison of separate measurements of the
induction in the two cases, is to take two fine wires of equal
length, one of iron, the other of copper, twist them together
carefully, wind into a coil, and connect up with a telephone
differentially. On exposure of the double coil to the action
of an external coil in which strong intermittent currents or
 reversals are passing, there will be hardly the slightest sound
 in the telephone, if the twisting be well done, with several
 twists in every turn. But if it be not well done, there will
 be a residual sound, which can be cancelled by allowing in
 duction between the external or primary coil and a turn of
 wire in the telephone-circuit. A rather curious effect takes
 place when we exaggerate the differential action by winding
 the wires into a coil without twists, in a certain short part of
 its length. The now comparatively loud sound in the telephone
 may be cancelled by inserting a nonconducting iron core in
 the secondary coil, provided it be not pushed in too far, or go
 too near or into the primary coil. This paradoxical result
 appears to arise from the secondary coil being equivalent to
  two coils close together, so that insertion of the iron core does
  not increase the mutual inductance of the primary and secon
  dary in the first place, but first decreases it to a minimum,
  which may be zero, and later increases it, when the core is
 further inserted. Reversing the secondary coil with respect
 to the primary makes no difference. Of course insertion of
  the core into the primary always increases the mutual induc
  tance and multiplies the sound. The fact that one of the
  wires in the secondary happens to be iron has nothing to do
  with the effect.]
    Another way of getting unions of the two conditions of the
 induction-balance is by having branches 1 and 3 equal, instead
  of 1 and 2. Thus, if we take R1 = R3, L = L3, R2 = R, in Al
  and A, (73e) and (74c), we obtain fifteen sets of double con
  ditions similar to those already given, out of which just four
  (as before) unite the two conditions. Thus, using Mis only,
  we have
                              L2 :  Ls,  -   -  -  *  -   -  (101c)
  and the same if we use M2, only, and the same when both M13

212             On the Self-induction of Wires.
and M2, are operative. That is, the self-induction balance is
independent of Mis and M2. This corresponds to (81c) and
(82c).
   The other two are M25 and M4s.       With M2s we have
                      0=L3-L4–2M2s,           -  •  -   -  (102c)
and with M4s,
                       0= L3-L4–2M-5.         . . . . (103c)
   The remaining eleven double conditions corresponding to
(85c) to (95b) need not be written down.
   Several special balances of a comparatively simple kind
can be obtained from the preceding by means of induc
tionless resistances, double-wound    'i.   whose self-induction
is negligible under certain circumstances, allowing us to put
the L’s of one, two, or three of the four branches 1, 2, 3, 4
equal to zero. We may then usefully remove the ratio of
equality restriction if required. This vanishing of the L of a
branch of course also makes the induction between it and any
other branch vanish.
   For instance, let L1=L3-L4=0; then
                  0= R2L: + Msc(R1 + R2)      - •   -  •   (104c)
£      the induction-balance when M36 is used, subject to
  1R1-R2R3. And
                  0= R2L3-M35(R2+ R4)         -  •  -  -   (105c)
is the corresponding condition when Mas is used. But Mss
will not give balance, except in the special case of S.H. cur
rents, with a false resistance-balance. The method (104c)
is one of Maxwell's. His other two have been already
described.
   In the general theory of reciprocity, it is a force at one
place that produces the same flux at a second as the same
force at the second place does at the first. That the reciprocity
is between the force and the flux, it is sometimes useful to
remember in induction-balances.       Thus the above-mentioned
second way of having a ratio of equality is merely equivalent
to exchanging the places of the force and the (vanishing)
flux. We must not, in making the exchange, transfer a coil
that is operative. For example, in the M6 method (79c),
there is induction between branches 6 and 4; Mas (equation
(88c)), on the other hand, fails to give balance. But if we
exchange the branches 5 and 6, it is the battery and telephone
that have to be exchanged; so that we now use M54, which
gives silence, whilst Mg, will not.
   I have also employed the differential telephone sometimes,
having had one made some five years ago. But it is not so

adaptable as the quadrilateral to various circumstances. I
need say nothing as to its theory, that having been, I under
stand, treated by Prof. Chrystal. Using a pair of equal coils,
it is very similar to that of the equal-ratio quadrilateral.

The Origin of Mountain-Ranges, considered Experimentally, Struc
    turally, Dynamically, and in Relation to their Geological History.
    By T. MELLARD READE, C.E., F.G.S., F.R.I.B.A. London:
    Taylor and Francis, 1886.
IT is now twenty years since Mr. George L. Wose published his
      ‘Orographic Geology, containing an admirable review of all
that had, up to that time, been done in the way of explaining the
structure and origin of mountain-chains. Strange to say, the
author of the work now before us does not appear to be acquainted
 with the labours of his predecessor in the same field; but the large
amount of original research bearing upon the subject in question,
which has been carried on in the interval, fully justifies the pre
 paration of this new book by one so competent to undertake it as
 Mr. Mellard Reade has shown himself to be.
    The author aims at nothing less than framing a complete and
consistent theory of the origin of mountain-ranges; and whatever
divergences of opinion may arise as to the soundness of particular
 portions of that theory, or of the force or value of certain of the
arguments by which they are supported, there can be no hesitation
 among candid readers in admitting the great value of the mass of
 facts relating to the question which have been obtained by the author
by ingenious experiment and patient observation, or the interest
 attaching to the conclusions which he has founded upon those
 facts.
    If the theory, as a whole, can lay no claim to absolute novelty,
 there are certain new and striking features introduced into it by
 the author, and the principles on which it is based are certainly
 exemplified and enforced by him with much freshness, ingenuity,
 and vigour.
    Mr. Mellard Reade insists on the principle so well recognized by
 Hall, Rogers, Dana, Le Conte, and most recent authors who have
 treated on the subject, that the first stage in the origination of a
 mountain-chain consists in excessive sedimentation. After giving
 an outline of the main facts made known by recent researches
 concerning the Appalachians, the Rocky Mountains, the Andes, the
 Himalayas, the Alps, and the mountains of our own islands, he sum
 marizes his conclusions as follows:—“No great range of mountains
  was ever ridged up excepting in areas of great previous sedimenta
 tion. Out of these sediments the mountains are mostly built and
 carved, but along with the newer and originally horizontal sedimen
  tary beds, the older gneissic and Archaean rocks are usually thrust

 214                Notices respecting New Books.
 up, and often enclose in their folds strata of a newer age, which
 have become thereby considerably metamorphosed.
    “It is only in the great or in the old mountain-ranges that these
 old gneisses and schists are seen, because it is by denudation alone
 that they become exposed” (p. 84).
    While agreeing with his predecessors as to the proofs of great
 sedimentation prior to the formation of a mountain-chain, the
 author to some extent differs from many of them in questioning
 the necessity for that progressive subsidence which the majority
 of geologists believe must have gone on side by side with the depo
 sition. In support of this view, Mr. Mellard Reade cites the case
 of the a'. of strata probably of great thickness in deep
 water off the mouth of the Amazon; but he would probably himself
 admit that such an explanation is only capable of being applied to
 the occurrence of great thicknesses of clays, and not to alternating
 strata of coarse- and fine-grained sediments, such as so constantly
 constitute the materials out of which mountains are made.
    The second stage of mountain-making is explained by the
 author as arising from the upward displacement of the isogeo
 therms, consequent upon the sedimentation in a particular area.
In this he follows the line of reasoning previously suggested with
greater or less precision by Scrope, Babbage, Herschel, and other
authors.
    It is in applying this well-recognized principle to the explanation
of the contortion and crumpling of the thick masses of sediments
that the author shows much novelty in his treatment of the
question. Mallet and many other authors have insisted that the
tangential thrusts, by which the folding of the strata was evidently
produced, must have resulted from the contraction following from
the secular cooling of the globe, whereby the outer crust is con
tinually tending to accommodate itself to the central nucleus. Our
author not only combats this view with many arguments that de
serve to be very carefully weighed, but offers an alternative hypo
thesis, which does not appear to be open to the objections to which
the older theory is liable. We cannot do better than allow the
author to explain this hypothesis in his own words. After insist
ing that the rise of the isogeotherms is the necessary consequence
of excessive sedimentation, he goes on to say:—
    “The rise of temperature exerts a tendency to expand the new
sedimentaries, in every direction, in proportion to their extent and
mass. The tendency to expand horizontally is checked by the
mass of the Earth's crust bounding the locally heated area. The
expanding mass is therefore forced to expend its energies within
itself; hence arise those foldings of lengthening strata, repacking
of beds, reversed faults, ridging up, and elevatory movements which
occur in varied forms, according to the conditions present in each
CalSe.
    “The upper layers of the Earth's crust being less and less
affected by these variations in temperature as the surface is neared,
are by the ridging-up thrown into a state of tension, while the
lower beds of the sedimentaries are in a state of energetic com

                   Motices respecting New Books.                   215
pression. The mean rise of temperature of the whole sedimentary
mass is half the total rise of the lowest beds.” (P. 326.)
   The author then goes on to show that at a certain depth the
“cubical expansion” of the mass must cause the heated though
still solid materials to actually flow, and in so doing they will pene
trate along the lines of least resistance, giving rise to the gneissic
axial cores so constantly exhibited in all great mountain-chains.
The actual transfer of this flowing material adds considerably to the
solidity and the consequent permanency of mountain-ranges.
    That this rise of temperature in the lower portions of a sedi
mentary mass is competent to produce the results he ascribes to
it, the author illustrates by many ingenious experiments, and en
forces by very cogent reasoning. He shows that flat masses of
 lead, stone, and other material ridge up during heating in their
centre if their edges be not free to move outwards; and he further
 insists upon a consideration which has not hitherto received the
 attention which it deserves, namely, that the effects of repeated
 heating and cooling are to a great extent cumulative. A local in
 crease of temperature causes expansion; but in the subsequent fall
 of temperature, the contraction, or drawing back of the particles is
 very partial, and thus the changes all work towards the same end.
 This principle is illustrated by a number of ingenious experiments,
 and it is argued that in the corrugation of strata we have illustrated
 the results of accumulations of small effects from simple causes.
    Wherever it is possible, the author endeavours to test his own
 results and those of others by calculations based on data obtained
 by actual experiment. He has determined the coefficients of ex
 pansion of a number of sandstones, marbles, slates, and granites,
 and the results of these experiments show a very satisfactory agree
 ment with those previously published by Adie and Totten. The
 mean of the whole of his results is a linear expansion of 2.77 feet
  per mile for every 100°Fahr. This the author points out is equal
 to about 8.25 feet of cubic expansion; that is to say, the surface of
 a cubic mile of rock, if the base and sides were not free to move,
  would be raised, not 2.75 feet, but 8.25 by a rise of temperature of
  100°F. In a mass of rock 500 miles square and 20 miles thick—
  one which would equal only the #th part of the bulk of the
  globe—an increase of 1000°F., or, what would amount to nearly
  the same thing, a series of alternations in temperature amounting
 to 1000°, would, it is calculated, cause an expansion of no less than
  52,135 cubic miles !
     The latter part of the work before us is occupied by descriptions
  of varieties of mountain-structure, and an explanation of the
  manner in which these may be accounted for on the author's
  theory, as outlined above. Incidentally, many important geological
  problems are discussed, such as the origin of cleavage, foliation
  and jointing, the causes of ordinary and reversed faulting, the
  significance of the “fan-structure,” the connection between vol
  canic activity and mountain-building, the time required for the
  formation of mountain-chains, the cause of earthquakes and earth

 216               Motices respecting New Books.
 tremors, &c. On all of these questions Mr.   £              advances
 views which are well worthy of the consideration of geologists.
   The work is very amply illustrated by no less than forty-two
plates containing many figures. Some of these are reproductions
of the sections and maps published by the United-States Geolo
gical Survey and the Second Geological Survey of Pennsylvania,
while a few are taken from the sections published by our own Geo
logical Survey. But the majority of the illustrations are repro
ductions by photo-lithography of the author's own drawings and
sepia-sketches.
   We very heartily recommend this valuable work to the attention
of geologists, as an important contribution to terrestrial dynamics.

THIS Catalogue of one hundred and seventy pages is one of the
many useful works published in connection with the Colonial and
Indian Exhibition. It is compiled by the Geological Corps of
Canada, acting under the direction of Dr. A. R. C. Selwyn.
Although essentially a list of the specimens exhibited in the Cana
dian Collection, the minerals and rocks are fully described, with
their properties, localities, and the geological horizon from which
they were obtained, thus rendering the work of permanent value as
a reference book to the mineralogist, geologist, and prospector.
The districts represented are—British Columbia, North-west
Territories, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, North-east Territory, New
Brunswick, Prince-Edward Island, and Nova Scotia; and from
these upwards of 700 specimens are described. The more impor
tant minerals, as Coal and Apatite, receive especial attention; and
the notes on the latter are rendered more valuable by the addition
of plans and sections illustrative of the occurrence of the mineral
and of the two finest examples that were exhibited. The work is
divided into eleven sections, the most noteworthy of which are the
following:—I. Metals and their Ores; II. Materials used in the
Production of Heat and Light; III. Minerals applicable to certain
Chemical Manufactures and their Products; IV. Mineral Manure;
VII. to X. Materials applicable to various Constructions, Fine Arts,

        for 1885. Vol. XIX. 8vo. Sydney, 1886: 240 pp.
THIS volume contains eleven papers, besides the usual valuable
Meteorological appendix, and a Rainfall Map for 1884. In the
Anniversary Address the President, Mr. H. C. Russell, gives some
important notes on the movement of the “East Coast, if not all
Australia,” quoting the late Rev. W. B. Clarke, Mr. John Kent,
Mr. Ellery, and others, and giving the results of his own observa
tions for twelve years past. “The evidences,” Mr. Russell says,
“for elevation and subsidence of the land are about equal;” and,
as accurate observations have as yet been made only at Sydney, where
in the twelve years no appreciable change has been noticed, it is

 difficult to say whether the movement has an upward or a down
 ward direction. Some account of Lake George, and interesting
 notes on the gradual rise and fall of its waters, are given, together
 with a description of a self-recording gauge, which gives a con
 tinuous record of changes of level by evaporation and otherwise. A
 remarkable “impulse” was recorded on the 14th April, 1884, when
 the water had been unusually still for the three previous days. At
 11 A.M. the observer at the gauge saw a thunderstorm coming
 from the North, and, watching the instrument, saw that the
 lake rose at that point four inches in thirty minutes. As soon
as the storm passed, the water began to fall, reaching its previous
 level in fifteen minutes, sank two inches more, and began to
rise again. The whole series of pulsations lasted five days. The
 Lake is referred to as “a body of water eighteen miles long, five
 wide, and 15 or 20 feet deep,” and in its wet period “at least forty
miles long and ten or twelve wide.” The “seiches” of the Lake
of Geneva are noticed in connection with this subject.
    Mr. Russell has also a paper on “Local Wariations and Vibra
tions of the Earth's Surface,” in which he especially deals with the
effect of lunar attraction upon the solid portion of the globe.
 After quoting from the British-Association Reports for 1881 and
1882, he proceeds to give the result of his own observations, more
particularly those taken with the Lake-George tide-gauge, and he
notes the “Level-errors of the Sydney Transit-Instrument” in
relation to the sandstone hill upon which the Observatory is built.
Important photolithographic copies of the sheets from the recording
instrument at Lake George, together with Level-, Temperature-,
Azimuth-, and Barometer-curves at Sydney Observatory are given.
This paper and Mr. Russell's Address form very important con
tributions to our knowledge of the level-changes of the Earth's
surface.
   The Rev. P. MacPherson deals with “Some causes of the Decay
of the Australian Forests.” After discussing the various theories
advanced to account for the decay, the author dismisses “Wet
ground,” “Drought,” “Bush Fires,” “Differences of Soils,” “Sheep
manures,” “Caterpillars,” and “White Ants,” as inadequate to
effect the mischief observed; and he refers the majority of the
damage done to the Opossums and a “Copper-coloured Beetle,”
the name of which is unfortunately omitted. A plate is given in
illustration of the remarks. Another paper by the same author
deals with the “Stone Implements of the Aborigines of Australia
and some other countries” in Australasia. After describing the
specimens exhibited, the author discusses their antiquity, and
comes to the conclusion that “up to date, direct evidence for a
geologic antiquity on behalf of the Australian Aborigines seems to
be very scanty.” Three illustrations accompany the paper, one
of which represents the incisions made by the natives into trees,
to get food and for other purposes, and shows the permanent
effect on the tree so treated.
   In a “History of Floods in the Hawkesbury River,” Mr. J. P.
Josephson gives a table of “heights of floods from years 1795 to

with a sketch-plan, is given by Mr. S. H. Cox.
   Microscopy is represented by Mr. William Morris, who has
devoted twelve pages to the various methods employed in mounting
the rare diatom Amphipleura pellucida.

Hours with a Three-Inch Telescope. By Capt. W.M. NoBLE, F.R.A.S.,
   F.R.M.S., Honorary Associate of the Liverpool Astronomical Society.
   London: Longmans, Green, and Co., 1886.
“THIs little book,” the author tells us at the outset, “is written
to furnish the very beginner in observational Astronomy with such
directions as shall enable him to employ, to the greatest possible
advantage, the kind of instrument with which he will, in all
probability, at first provide himself.” He therefore only pre
supposes the possession, on the part of the reader, of a small
telescope mounted on the ordinary pillar-and-claw stand, of some
such work as the ‘Stars in their Seasons, and of an ardent desire
to become familiar with the beauties and glories of the celestial
vaults. To such beginners—for whose guidance there has been
hitherto no perfectly suitable book—Capt. Noble will be a true
friend. He thoroughly understands the needs of those for whom
he writes, and he gives them the information they require in
a simple and straightforward manner, free from perplexing techni
calities. No pains, too, have been spared to make the book
accurate; the descriptions and drawings were all made at the eye
end of a telescope of three inches' aperture, and are not taken at
secondhand from any other work, however trustworthy. There
are twelve chapters: the first treating of the instrument (the three
inch telescope) itself, and here Lord Crawford's device for giving
an approximately equatoreal motion to an altazimuthly mounted
instrument is described. The sun and moon form the subjects of the
two next chapters; the latter is one of the most interesting and
important in the book; the principal lunar formations being
passed in review during seven nights’ work. A short chapter on
the observation of occultations follows. Then come the planets,
Jupiter naturally receiving most attention; whilst the eleventh
chapter gives some useful hints on drawing the planets. The last
chapter is devoted to the fixed stars and nebulae, and the work of
nine nights is described in detail. Here, we fear, the student
will find Capt. Noble's help least effective, for there are no star
maps given. It is true he supposes his readers to possess some

                     Notices respecting New Books.                    219
 elementary star-atlas, but that is hardly what is required so much as
 a series of little simple diagrams giving all the brightest stars in
 the various districts under examination with the relative positions
 of the objects to which attention is called. Such diagrams as
 those given of several of the constellations in Sir R. S. Ball's
 ‘Story of the Heavens’ are what are required, and could be easily
 and cheaply supplied. We trust Capt. Noble may see his way to
 introduce something of the kind in a second edition; he has
 already provided for the study of the Moon by an excellent
 reproduction of Webb's well-known map.
    The book is to a great extent a reprint of papers which
 originally appeared in the columns of ‘Knowledge, and there are
 occasionally references to the positions of the planets which were
 appropriate enough at the time of writing, but which of course no
 longer apply, and read rather strangely when published in this more
 permanent form. There are one or two other incidental points
 which might be criticised: it is to be hoped, for example, that the
 student will not imagine that the rather rough and ready method
 on p. 15 for computing the longitude of the Moon's terminator gives
 it correctly to 0":1, though certainly it would be excusable for him
 to draw that inference. But these little flaws are not serious enough
 to detract from the value of the work as a whole; it is useful,
 clear, and practical, and will be of the most essential service to many
 a young beginner, and, without doubt, will, as its author hopes,
 prove in many an instance a suitable introduction to works of a
 more advanced character, such as Webb's ‘Celestial Objects.’
 Algebra: an Elementary Textbook for the higher classes of Secondary
    Schools and for Colleges. By G. CHRYSTAL, M.A. Part I.
    Edinburgh: A. & C. Black, 1886; pp. xx+542.
 THIs first part is composed of twenty-two chapters, which treat
 of the subject of Algebra (and of allied subjects which do not
 usually come into an Elementary Treatise) under the following
heads. 1. Fundamental Laws and processes of Algebra: a valuable
introduction which discusses the laws of Association, Commutation,
and Distribution, and the properties of 0 and 1, and closes with an
interesting historical note. 2 treats of Monomials, the laws of
Indices and Degree. 3, with the heading “Theory of Quotients,
first principles of Theory of Numbers,” lays open to view the
fundamental properties of Fractions, treats of prime and composite
numbers, and gives several theorems connected with factors and
primes. , 4 is a most important chapter on distribution of Pro
ducts, elements of the Theory of Rational Integral functions,
in which are explained the X and r Notations, the principles of
Substitution, Homogeneity, Symmetry, and the principle of Indeter
minate Coefficients. This chapter was written “as a suggestion to
the teacher how to connect the general laws of Algebra with the
former experience of the pupil. In writing this chapter I had to
remember that I was engaged in writing, not a book on the philo
sophical nature of the first principles of Algebra, but the first
chapter of a book on their Consequences.” 5 discusses at some

 220                 Notices respecting New Books.
 length the transformation of the Quotient of two integral functions,
 treating under this head of the Remainder theorem and its appli
 cation to Factorisation, of a new basis for the principle of Indeter
 minate Coefficients and of Continued Division. 6 gives much
 useful matter under the heads of Greatest Common Measure and
 Least Common Multiple. 7, on the Factorisation of Integral
 Functions, introduces the consideration of surd and imaginary
 Quantity and of Complex Quantity. In 8 are discussed Rational
 Fractions; in 9 we have a continuation of Theory of Numbers, com
 prising Scales of Notation and Lambert's Theorem; in 10 we have
 a general discussion of irrational functions ... interpretations of ap/7,
 a”, a 2", and a general theory of rationalization; and in 11 is an
 account of the Arithmetical theory of Surds. One of the best
 chapters to our thinking is 12, which gives an excellent account of
 complex numbers and herein of Argand's diagrams and of De
 moivre's theorem. 13 is good on Ratio and Proportion. 14 at some
 length discusses conditional equations in general; 15 at equal
 length treats of the Variation of a function (a good introduction to
 the theory of Maxima and Minima for a student of the Calculus);
 and 16, 17 are concerned with equations of the first and second
 degree respectively. In 18 is an account of a general theory of
 Integral Functions, in which figure Symmetric functions of the
 roots of an Equation, Newton's theorem regarding sums of powers
 of roots, special properties of Quadratic Functions (including La
 grange's Interpolation formula), and Variation of a Quadratic
 Function for real values of its Variable (analytical and graphical
discussion of three fundamental cases, Maxima and Minima). 19
is devoted to the Solution of Problems by means of Equations. 20
discusses the Arithmetic, Geometric, and allied series; 21 is occu
pied with Logarithms (interpolation by first differences); and 22
closes the work with an account of the Theory of Interest and
Annuities. Numerous historical notes impart considerable interest
to the perusal of the text.
   It is evident that there are many subjects handled which do not
come within the range of an elementary student's reading; but
these are all handled in such a way as to be most valuable to more
advanced students and to teachers.       The author warns us on the
very threshold, that his work is not intended for the use of
absolute beginners. His great object in laying down the three
fundamental laws is to introduce the idea of Algebraic Form,
“which is the foundation of all the modern developments of Algebra
and the secret of analytical Geometry, the most beautiful of all its
applications.” We advise higher-form boys and others, who have a
desire to go more deeply into the subject than they can do with the
aid of ordinary textbooks, to get or borrow Prof. Chrystal's splendid
treatise and make a careful study of its well-arranged contents.
It is the pure Mathematical Elementary textbook of the year 1886.
    Elements of the Theory of the Newtonian Potential Function.

by Neumann (“Untersuchungen über das Logarithmische und
Newton'sche Potential”)*.
   There is no attempt made at original investigation, for the notes
are professedly elementary in character, and to a great extent
reproduce work given in Todhunter's ‘Analytical Statics’ and
Minchin's ‘Statics. Dr. Peirce has, however, carefully consulted
numerous other authorities, the most important works both by
English and Continental writers, and derives much of his matter
from original Memoirs. There are five chapters in all. In the first
the author treats of the Attraction of Gravitation; in the second of
the Newtonian Potential Function in the case of Gravitation; in the
third of the same function in the case of Repulsion; in the fourth
of the properties of Surface Distributions and of Green's Theorem
(also of Thomson's Theorem); and in the last Chapter he applies
his preceding results to Electrostatics. It will be thus seen that
the writer has endeavoured to meet the difficulty experienced by
his class of getting “from any single book in English a treatment of
the subject at once elementary enough to be within their easy
comprehension, and at the same time suited to the purposes of such
of them as intended eventually to pursue the subject farther, or
wished, without necessarily making a speciality of mathematical
Physics, to prepare themselves to study Experimental Physics
thoroughly and understandingly.” To the list of 20 works recom
mended to students, we would add such parts of Todhunter's
‘History’ as bear upon the subject. We have detected a few simple
misprints, but the “get up” maintains the reputation already
acquired by the printers and publishers.

 By W. Whitaker, Esq., B.A., F.G.S.
    This paper contained some details on the borings at Chattenden
 Barracks and at the Dover Convict Prison, in addition to those
 already published in the Quarterly Journal of the Society for 1886.
 Sections of the new borings, one at Strood the other at Lydd, were
 also given.
   The Chattenden boring had been successful in reaching the Lower
 Greensand, and a supply of water had been obtained. This result
 showed that on the section accompanying the previous paper the
 beds of the Lower Greensand should have been carried rather fur
 ther to the northward.
    The Dover boring was abandoned at 931 feet from the surface.
 The examination of the specimens showed that the thickness
 formerly assigned to the Lower Greensand should be reduced to
31 feet, the upper 5 feet referred to that stage belonging to the
 base of the Gault, whilst the bottom, 13 feet, together with an addi
tional 69 feet, mostly of clay, subsequently cut through, were, for
 reasons given, assigned to the Wealden series and probably to the
Hastings beds.
   The results of these additional details went to show (1) that,
though the Lower Greensand itself was rather thicker at Chatham
than at Dover, comprising two divisions, the Folkestone and the
Sandgate beds at the former place, and only the Sandgate at the
latter, the Lower Cretaceous beds, as a whole, were much thinner at
Chatham, owing to the disappearance of the Wealden series; and (2)
that in passing to the eastward the Weald clay thinned out before
the Hastings beds, instead of the reverse, which was previously
suggested.
   The Strood and Lydd sections were merely of importance as fur
nishing details. The paper concluded with some remarks on the
best site for additional borings at Dover, in order to prove the deeper
lying rocks.

“TO WHAT ORDER OF LEVER DOES THE OAR BELONG P” BY
 FRANCIs A. TARLETON, FELLOW OF TRINITY COLLEGE, DUBLIN.
IN a paper published in the Philosophical Magazine for January,
      1887, Mr. Abbott has discussed the question, “To what order
of Lever does the Oar belong?”
   The conclusion at which Mr. Abbott has arrived seems to me
substantially correct; but he has, I think, stated it in language
which, to say the least, is rather paradoxical, and has supported
it by arguments which leave the mind of the reader in a somewhat
unsatisfied state.
   To simplify the discussion of the problem, I shall suppose the
boat to be moved by two oars on which equal pulls are exerted, and
to be perfectly symmetrical on both sides.
   If weregard the rower, boat, and oars as one system, the only forces

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              223
external to the system, which need be considered, are the pressures
of the water on the blades of the two oars and the resistance of the
water to the motion of the boat. If the boat be on the point of
moving, these forces must equilibrate each other, and as they
are parallel, the semi-resistance of the water to the motion must be
equal and opposite to the pressure on the blade of one oar. Again,
for the equilibrium of this oar, the moments round the rowlock of
the pull exerted by the rower and of the pressure against the blade
must be equal and opposite. Hence the moments round the row
lock of the pull of the rower, and of a force equal to the semi
resistance of the water to the motion, supposed to act at the blade
of the oar, must be equal.
   This is the proposition which Mr. Abbott seeks to establish, and
which he has, I think, paradoxically, if not inaccurately, expressed
by stating that the oar is a lever of the first order.
   The word lever has a kinematical reference, and implies a rigid
body having a fixed point. The division of levers into different
orders is an obscure way of stating the relative position of the
fixed point, and of two forces which are supposed to act upon the
body.
   Now in the case of the oar, the fixed point is the blade, and the
resistance of the water to the motion of the boat does not act on
the oar at all.   To say, then, that the oar is a lever of the first order
acted on by the pull of the rower and the semi-resistance of the
water to the motion of the boat applied at the blade of the oar, the
rowlock being the fulcrum, cannot be regarded as accurate, except
we look upon the rower, not as moving on the boat, but as moving
back the world.
   The investigation of the question, regarding the oar as a lever
whose fixed point is the blade, can be easily accomplished.
   Let P be the pull of the rower, R the reaction between the oar
and the boat at the rowlock, S the semi-resistance of the water to
the motion of the boat, and a and b the distances of the rowlock
from the hand of the rower and the blade of the oar.
   We have then, from the equilibrium of the oar,
                              P(a+b)=Rb. . . . . . . . (1)
   Again, as the boat is just about to move, the forces acting on it
equilibrate each other, and these are 2S, 2R, and a force equal and
opposite to 2P, exerted by the feet and body of the rower against
the boat. As these forces are parallel, we have S+P= R. Sub
stituting for Rin (1) and reducing, we get
                                Pa=Sb ;
the same result as before.
ON THE SPECIFIC HEATS OF THE WAPOURS OF ACETIC ACID AND
                         NITROGEN TETROXIDE.
     To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
 GENTLEMEN,
     Amongst others, it has lately been my business to read a very

224           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
interesting paper by Berthelot and Ogier in the Annales de Chimie
et de Physique for 1883, in which the authors set forth the result of
their careful experiments on the Specific Heats of the Wapours of
Acetic Acid and Nitrogen Tetroxide. The quantities of heat absorbed
at different temperatures are compared with the percentage disso
ciation, as deduced from the vapour-density experiments of Nau
mann, Soret, and other experimenters. The experiment is very
close (as may easily be seen by placing the several series of num
bers on curves), and well within the limits of experimental error.
In spite of the valued opinion of M. Berthelot, I therefore venture
to consider that the experiments referred to do afford additional
evidence in favour of the hypothesis of the dissociation of these
gases; the alternative theory involving, so far as I can see, the
relinquishing of Avogadro's law as far as these gases are con
cerned.
   Assuming therefore, for the moment, that dissociation does take
place, and that the thermal changes measured by Berthelot and
Ogier are the natural expression of this effect, some information,
it seems to me not altogether devoid of interest, may be gained by
a comparison of these results with those obtained by Regnault for
the specific heats of those gases which undergo a condensation in
the course of their formation from their elements.          As is well
known, the specific heats of nitrous oxide and carbonic acid have,
according to Regnault, a small temperature-coefficient, showing
that, as the temperature rises, the specific heats increase, at all
events up to 200° Centigrade. This, however, is precisely what
has been found to hold true in a more complicated form for
nitrogen tetroxide and acetic-acid vapour, where the temperature
coefficient is much greater and reaches a maximum. If, however,
we decide to attribute this to a molecular change tending from
greater to less molecular complexity in the case of acetic-acid vapour
and nitrogen tetroxide, why should we not apply the same argu
ment to the gases examined by Regnault, and regard the tempera
ture-coefficient of the specific heats of nitrous oxide and carbonic
acid &c. as evidencing a similar molecular change? Might we not
argue, in fact, that at low temperatures the molecular composition,
as expressed by the ordinary formulae for carbonic acid and nitrous
oxide, only refers to the vast majority of the molecules; and that
the number of molecules of a higher degree of complexity, as well
as of a lower (i. e. dissociated), is not negligibly small.  On raising
the temperature, those of higher than normal complexity might
decompose and account for the extra absorption by heat, evidenced
by Regnault's temperature-coefficient.        Such a view seems to me
to be in harmony with the views set forth by Clausius and Wil
liamson, which are daily gaining ground among physical chemists.

XXV. Notes on Electricity and Magnetism.—III. On the
   Behaviour of Iron and Steel under the Operation of Feeble
   Magnetic Forces. By Lord RAYLEIGH, Sec. R.S."
                                [Plate II.]
Th: question whether or not iron responds proportionally
       to feeble magnetic forces is of interest not only from
a theoretical point of view, but from its bearing upon the
actual working of telephonic instruments. Considerable dif
ference of opinion has been expressed concerning it, several of
the best authorities inclining to the view that a finite force is
required to start the magnetization. Prof. Ewing remarksf:—
“As regards the hysteresis which occurs when the magnetism
of soft iron is changed, my experiments confirm the idea
already suggested by other observers, that when the molecular
magnets of Weber are rotated they suffer, not first an elastic
and then a partially non-elastic deflection as Maxwell has
assumed, but a kind of frictional retardation (resembling the
friction of solids), which must be overcome by the magneti
zing force before deflection      '         at all.” In a subsequent
passaget Prof. Ewing treats the question as still open, re
marking that though his curves suggest that the initial value
of k (the susceptibility) may be finite, they afford no positive
proof that it is not initially zero, or even negative.
   My attention was first called to the matter about a year
and a half ago in connection with the operation of iron cores

226 Lord Rayleigh on the Behaviour of Iron and Steel
in the coils of an induction-balance. Experiment showed
that iron responded powerfully to somewhat feeble forces;
and I endeavoured to improve the apparatus in the hope of
being able thus to examine the subject more thoroughly.
Two similar long helices were prepared by winding fine insu
lated wire upon slender glass tubes. These were connected in
series with a battery, a resistance-box, and a microphone
clock, so as to constitute a primary circuit. The secondary
consisted of a large quantity of copper wire, mounted upon a
bobbin, through the opening in which both primary coils were
 inserted. The circuit of the secondary was completed by a
 telephone. When neither primary coil contained a core,
 silence at the telephone £ readily be obtained. The iron
 cores used were those described in Part II.”; and it was found
 that all of them (including the bundle of seventeen very fine
 wires) disturbed the silence until the resistance was so far
 increased that the magnetizing force was less than about £o of
 the earth’s horizontal force (H). Moreover, there was no
 indication that the absence of audible effect under still smaller
 magnetizing forces was due to any other cause than the want
 of sensitiveness of the apparatus.
    I did not pursue the experiments further upon these lines,
 because calculation showed that the feeble magnetization of a
 piece of iron could more easily be rendered evident directly
 upon a suspended needle (the magnetometric method), than
 indirectly by the induction of currents in an encompassing coil
 connected with a galvanometer. Nearly all the results to be
 given in this paper were obtained by a form of the magneto
 metric method, specially adapted to the inquiry whether or not
 the magnetization of iron continues proportional to the mag
 netizing force when the latter is reduced to the uttermost.
     The magnetizing-spiral first used was one of those already
 referred to. It consists of a single layer of fine silk-covered
 copper wire wound on a glass tube and secured with shellac
 varnish (A, Plate II. fig. 1). The total length of the spiral
 is 17 centim., its diameter is about 6 centim., and the wind
 ings are at the rate of 32 per centim. The resistance is about
 5} ohms.
     The magnetometer was simply a small mirror backed by
  steel magnets (B), and suspended from a silk fibre, as supplied
 by White for galvanometers. It was mounted between glass
 plates at about 2 centim. distance from the magnetizing-spiral.
 The earth's force was compensated by steel magnets, which
 also served to bring the mirror perpendicular to the helix in
 spite of the influence of residual magnetism in the iron core.

The deflections were read in the manner usual with Thomson's
galvanometers, by the motion of a spot of light thrown upon
a scale after reflection by the mirror. The division is in
millimetres, and with the aid of a lens a displacement of Ilo of
a division can usually be detected with certainty.
   The direct effect of the magnetizing-spiral upon the sus
pended needle was compensated by a few turns of wire C,
7 centim. in diameter, supported upon an adjustable stand D.
This adjunct might have been dispensed with ; but what is
essential is the larger coil, E, by which the effect of the iron
core is compensated. This coil consisted of 74 convolutions,
of mean diameter 18 centim, tied closely with string, and
mounted upon an independent stand, F. By sliding this
stand, and ultimately by use of the screw, G, the action of
this coil upon the suspended needle can be adjusted with
precision. All the coils are connected in series; and pro
vided that the magnetic condition of the iron under given
force is definite, matters may be so arranged that the imposi
tion of the force produces no movement of the suspended
needle, or, more generally, the compensation may be adjusted
so as to suit the transition from any one magnetic force to any
other. If the susceptibility (k) and permeability u (=47tk+1)
were constant, as has often been supposed in mathematical
writings, the compensation suitable for any one transition
would serve also for every other, and the magnetometer-needle
would remain undisturbed, whatever changes were permitted
in the strength of the magnetizing current". The question
now presenting itself is, How far does this correspond to fact?
or, rather, How far is it true for magnetizing forces which are
always very small? for we know already that, under the ope
ration of moderate forces exceeding (say) 1 or 2 C.G.S., not
only is u not constant, but there is no definite relation at all
between magnetic induction and magnetizing force, whereby
the one can be inferred from the other without a knowledge
of the previous history of the iron.
   The magnetizing force of the spiral is of course easily cal
culated. The difference of potential in passing through n
convolutions of current C is 4tnC.         If the n convolutions
occupy a length l, the magnetizing force is
                                 7t.

employed by Koosen (Pogg. Ann. Bd. lxxxv. S. 159, 1852) to exhibit the
phenomena of “saturation.”

C is here expressed in C.G.S. measure, on which scale the
ampere is 1.
    t may be objected that the magnetic force of the spiral is
not the only external force operative upon the iron. It is
true that the compensating-coils must have an influence, and
in the opposite direction. But calculation shows that the
influence must be small. The radius of the large coil is
9 centim., and (to take an example) the distance of its mean
plane from the suspended needle in one set of experiments on
hard iron was 13.6 centim.        Under these circumstances the
magnetic force in the spiral, even at the nearer end, is influ
enced less than 2 per cent. by the large compensating-coil.
The effect of the smaller    £ is       about the same.   For the
present purpose it is hardly worth while to take these correc
tions into account.
   As has been remarked, the coils of the apparatus were
always connected in series; but a reversing-key (serving also
to make and break) was introduced so as to allow of the re
versal of the compensating-coil in relation to the others. In
one position of the key (–) the action of the coil and of the
magnetized iron are opposed; in the other (+) the actions
conspire. When the currents to be used were not exceedingly
small, the whole apparatus was in simple circuit with a Daniell
cell and such resistance-coils as were necessary. Exclusive
of the cell and of the added resistances, the whole resistance
was 7% ohms.
   As an example, I will now give the details of some obser
vations on December 6 made to test the behaviour of unan
nealed Swedish iron wire. The diameter of the wire is
1.6 millim.; it is from the same hank as a piece used in the
experiments of Part II.” The compensating-coil was adjusted
until it made no difference whether the key was open or
closed (–), the additional resistance being 1000 ohms. In
stating the result it will for the present be sufficient to give
the German-silver resistances, that of the apparatus and of the
battery being relatively of no importance. The corresponding
current is about 10-‘C.G.S., and the strength of the magnetic
field in the spiral is given by
                      12877-C= -04 C.G.S.
We shall have a better idea of this if we recall that, on the
same system of measurement,
                             H=-18;
so that the force in action is about       of that which the earth
exercises horizontally.

     When the resistance was altered to 11,000 ohms, the com
  pensating-coil of course remaining undisturbed, contact (–)
 produced no visible motion, showing that the same compen
 sation is suitable for the much smaller force.                 But at this
 point we require to be assured that the absence of disturbance
 is not due merely to want of sensitiveness. The necessary
 information is afforded at once by making reversed contact
  (+), which (with 11,000 ohms) gave a swing of 57 divisions.
    To diminish the magnetizing force still further, a shunting
 arrangement was adopted. The current from the Daniell was
 led through 10,000 ohms and then through a box capable
 of providing resistances from 1 to 1000. The circuit of the
 apparatus included another coil of 10,000 ohms, and its ter
 minals were connected to those of the box. The battery
 current was thus about 0001 ampere, or 10-* C.G.S. If a
 be the (unplugged) resistance in the box, the E.M.F. at the
 terminals of # apparatus-circuit is a x 10" volts; and the
 current C through the magnetizing helix and compensating
 coil is a x 10-9 C.G.S.
    When a = 1000 ohms, (-) gave no visible deflection, while
 (+) caused a swing of 5 divisions.
    At this stage recourse was had to the “method of multipli
cation” in order to increase the sensitiveness".             A pendulum
was adjusted until its swings were synchronous with those of
the suspended needle. It was then easy to make and break
contact in such a way as to augment the swing due to any
outstanding force. Thus, when a = 1000, the swing was in
creased by the use of the timed contacts and ruptures (+)
   * The advantage of the method of multiplication seems to be hardly
sufficiently appreciated. It is not merely that the effect is presented to
the eye in a magnified form. That object can be attained by optical
appliances, and by diminishing the directive force upon the suspended
parts, whether by using a nearly astatic system of needles, or by com
pensating the field. For the most          these devices augment the un
avoidable disturbances (which exhibit themselves by a shifting zero) in
the same proportion as the effect to be measured, or at any rate rendered
apparent. The real ultimate impediment to accuracy of measurement is
almost always the difficulty of distinguishing the effect under examination
from accidental disturbances, and it is to overcome this that our efforts
should be directed. The method of multiplication is here of great service.
The desired effects are largely magnified, while the disturbances, which
are not isoperiodic with the vibrations of the needle, remain unmagnified,
and therefore fall into the background.
   It is obvious that, in order to secure this advantage, the vibrations
must not be strongly damped. No doubt a highly damped galvanometer
needle is often convenient, and sometimes indispensable.     But it seems to
be a mistake to use it where a null method is applicable, and when the
utmost delicacy is required. In such a case the inertia of the needle, and
the forces both of restitution and of damping, should all be made small.

230 Lord Rayleigh on the Behaviour of Iron and Steel
until it measured 26 divisions instead of 5 only. But a
similar series of operations with reversed currents (–) caused
no swing amounting to l'o division; so that we may consider
the compensation proved to be still perfect to about 1 per cent.
   In applying the method to still smaller forces we cannot
avoid a '' of sensitiveness. With a = 100, (+) gave 3 di
visions, while the effect of (–) remained insensible. The
correctness of the compensation is thus verified to about 6 per
cent. of the separate effects. Had the iron, even at this stage,
refused to accept magnetization, the fact would have mani
fested itself by the equality of the swings obtainable in the
two ways, (+) and (-), of making the connections.
   In the last case mentioned the current was 10-7 C.G.S.,
and the magnetic force was 4 x 10-* C.G.S. We may there
fore regard the proportionality of magnetic induction to mag
netic force over the range from H to 5000 H as an experi
mental fact. In view of this, neither theory nor observation
give us any reason for thinking that the proportionality
would fail for still smaller forces.
   Quite similar results have been obtained with steel.      On
December 13 a piece of drill steel (unannealed) was examined,
the delicacy of the apparatus, as evidenced by the (+) effect,
being about the same as in the above experiments on hard
Swedish iron. No failure of proportionality could be detected
with forces ranging from about H to Tobot, H.
   Annealed iron is a much less satisfactory subject. With
unannealed iron and steel the compensation for small forces
may be made absolute, so that neither at the moment of closing
the circuit nor afterwards is there any perceptible disturbance.
This means that (so far as the magnetometer-needle can
decide) the metal assumes instantaneously a definite magnetic
condition which does not afterwards change. But soft iron
shows much more complicated effects. The following obser
vations were made upon a piece of Swedish iron (from the
same hank as the former) annealed in the flame of a spirit
lamp. When an attempt was made to compensate for the
imposition of a force equal to # H, no complete balance could
be obtained. When the coil was so placed as to reduce as
much as possible the instantaneous effect, there ensued a drift
of the magnetometer-needle represented by about 170 divi
sions of the scale, and in such a direction as to indicate a
continued increase of magnetization. Precisely opposite
effects followed the withdrawal of the magnetizing force.
The settling down of the iron into a new magnetic state is
thus shown to be far from instantaneous.      On account of the
complication entailed by the free swings of the needle, good

          under the Operation of Feeble Magnetic Forces.              231
observations on the drift could not be obtained with this ap
paratus; but it was evident that, whilst most of the anomalous
action was over in 3 or 4 seconds, the final magnetic state
was not attained until after about 15 or 20 seconds*.
    The operation of feebler forces was next examined, rather
with the expectation of finding the drift reduced in relative
importance. But the imposition of £, H was followed by a
drift of 13 or 14 divisions, no very small fraction of the whole
action; as was seen from the observation that the (+) effect
was now 300 divisions, of which 150 are due to the iron.
With 20,000 ohms in circuit, giving a force equal to rio H,
the drift was 6 or 7 divisions. By still further diminishing
the force the drift could be reduced to insignificance; but it
appeared to maintain its proportion to the instantaneous effect.
Apart from the complication due to the drift, the magneti
zation was proportional to magnetizing force from To H to
st'in H or lessf.
   The question now presents itself, What is the actual value
of the permeability which has been proved to be a definite
constant for small forces? In consequence, however, of the
nearness of the operative pole to the suspended needle in the
preceding experiments, no moderately accurate value of u.
can be deduced.        But the observations described in Part II.
are sufficient to show that the constant permeability for hard
iron has some such value as 90 or 100, the forces then opera
tive being within the prescribed limits. The fact that the
initial value of u is so large is obviously of great theoretical
and practical importance. Further evidence will be brought
forward presently in connection with observations made with
an arrangement better suited to an absolute determination.
   Too definite a character must not be ascribed to the above
mentioned limit of #H. Below this point the deviations from
the law of proportionality, though mathematically existent, are
barely sensible. In order to understand this, it is well to con
sider what happens when the limit is plainly exceeded. If a
force of the order H be imposed, the compensating-coil (ad
justed for small forces) appears to be overpowered, and a
   * Prof. Ewing (loc. cit. $52) describes “a time lag in magnetization,”
especially noticeable in the softest iron and at points near the beginning
of the steep part of the magnetization-curve. It should have been stated
that my apparatus was very firmly supported, and, being situated under
ground, was well protected from vibration. The drift or creeping did
not appear to be due to this cause.
  +  '' results here set forth were announced in    a discussion following
Prof. Hughes's address to the Society of Telegraph Engineers on Fe
bruary 11, 1886 (Journ. Tel. Eng. xv. p. 39), on the strength of prelimi
nary experiments tried towards the close of 1885.

232 Lord Rayleigh on the Behaviour of Iron and Steel
large deflection occurs. He the force be now removed, the
recovery is incomplete, indicating that the iron retains residual
magnetism. Subsequent applications and removals of the
force produce a nearly regular effect, and always of such a
character as to prove that the magnetic changes in the iron
exceed those demanded by the law of proportionality. As
might be expected, the excess varies as the square of the
force; and thus, when the force is small enough, it becomes
insignificant, and the law of proportionality expresses the
facts of the case with sufficient accuracy. But the precise
himit to be fixed to the operation of the law depends neces
sarily upon the degree of accuracy demanded.
   The readings with and without the force being tolerably
definite, it would of course be possible, by pushing in the
compensating-coil, to bring about an adjustment in which the
application or removal of the force causes no deflection. But
this state of things must be carefully distinguished from the
compensation obtainable with very small forces, in that it is
limited to one particular step in the magnitude of force. If
we try a force of half the magnitude, we find the compensation
fail. Not only so, but the reading will be different under the
same force according as we come to it from the one side or
from the other. The curve representing the relation between
force and magnetization is a loop of finite area.
   Except for the purpose of examining whether the whole
magnetization is assumed instantaneously (absence of drift),
there is little advantage in the compensation being adjusted
for the extreme range under trial. It is usually better to
retain the adjustment proper to very small forces. Even
though it fails to give a complete compensation, the coil offers
an important advantage, which will presently appear; and its
use diminishes the displacement to be read upon the scale.
   We have seen that when the forces are very small there is
a definite relation between force and magnetization, of such a
character that one is proportional to the other: the ratio k
(the susceptibility) is a definite constant. When, however,
certain limits are exceeded there is no fixed relation between
the quantities; and if k is still to be retained, it requires a
fresh definition. It is not merely that k, as at first defined,
ceases to be constant, but rather that it ceases to exist. Upon
this point the verdict of experiment is perfectly clear. There
is no curved line by which the relation between force and
magnetization can be unambiguously expressed, and which
can be traversed in both directions.       As soon as the line
ceases to be straight, it ceases also to be single.       I have
thought it desirable to emphasize this point, because the term

         under the Operation of Feeble Magnetic Forces.      233
“magnetization-function,” introduced by Dr. Stoletow, rather
suggests a different conclusion.
     he curves given by Stoletow and by Rowland in their
celebrated researches are not exactly magnetization-curves in
the more natural sense; that is to say, they do not exhibit
fully the behaviour of a piece of iron when subjected to
a given sequence of magnetic forces. But a number of such
curves have been drawn by Ewing which afford all necessary
general information. Among these we may especially dis
tinguish the course followed by the iron in passing from
strong positive to strong negative magnetization and vice
versá, and that by which iron starting from a neutral con
dition first acquires magnetization under the action of a force
constantly increasing.
   Attention is called by Ewing to the loops which are formed
when the forces are carried round a (not very small) cycle of
any kind. “Every loop in the diagram shows that when we
reverse the change of magnetizing force from increment to
decrement, or vice versá, the magnetism begins to change
very gradually relatively to the change of 5 (the force), no
matter how fast it may have been changing in the opposite
direction before. So much is this the case that the curves,
when drawn to a scale such as that of the figure, appear in all
cases to start off tangent to the line parallel to the axis on
which 5 is measured whenever the change of 5 is reversed in
sign.”
  £e question here raised as to the direction of the curve,
after the force has passed a maximum or minimum, is one of
great importance. If it were strictly true that this direction
were parallel to the axis, it would follow generally that iron in
any condition of magnetization would be uninfluenced by
small periodic variations of magnetic force; for example, that
in many telephone experiments iron would show no magnetic
properties. The experiments already detailed prove that when
the whole force and magnetization are small (they were not
actually evanescent) very sensible proportional changes of
 magnetization accompany small changes of force, the ratio
 being such as to give a permeability not much inferior to
 100. Nothing is easier than to show that this conclusion is
 not limited to very small mean forces and magnetizations.
 As regards the latter, we may apply and remove a force
 (say) of 5 H. By this operation the iron is left in a different
 magnetic condition, and the zero-reading of the magnetometer
 is altered, probably to the extent of driving the spot of light
 off the scale. But if we bring the needle back with the aid of
 external magnets, we can examine, as before, the effect of

  234 Lord Rayleigh on the Behaviour of Iron and Steel
  imposing a small force (under H). If this be in the opposite
  direction to the previous large force, it will produce, in spite
  of the compensating-coil, a very sensible effect; for in this
  case the movement from 0 to - H is in continuation of the
  previous movement from 5H to 0. But subsequent appli
  cations and removals of #H produce no visible effect upon the
  needle, as would have happened from the first had the small
  force operated in the positive direction. We may conclude,
 then, that the compensation for small forces suitable when the
 iron is nearly free from magnetization is not disturbed by the
 presence of considerable residual magnetism.
    To examine the action of a small increment or decrement,
 when the total force is relatively large, we must either intro
 duce a second magnetizing helix or effect the variation of
 current otherwise than by breaking the circuit. I found it
 most convenient simply to vary the resistance taken from the
 box, so arranging matters that the small alteration of current
 required could be effected by the insertion or removal of a
 single plug. The corresponding change of current is obtained
 by inspection of a table of reciprocals; and it was readily
 proved that within the admissible range of the apparatus the
 compensation was just as effective whether a step (not ex
 ceeding #H) was made from zero or from a force (say) of 5H,
 20 or 30 times as great as the increment or decrement itself.
 It need scarcely be repeated that there is an exception as
 regards the first step, in the case where it is in the same
 direction as the large movement preceding it.
    At this stage the original magnetizing-coil, having been
arranged for the investigation of the smallest forces, was
replaced by another at a greater distance from the suspended
 needle. When the magnetization of the iron in its various
parts fails to vary in strict proportion to the force, the effective
pole is liable to shift its position; and this is an objection to the
horizontal arrangement adopted in the earlier experiments.
The helix was therefore placed vertically, the lower end of the
iron core being a trifle below the level of the magnetometer
needle. The upper pole was at such a distance as to give
but little relative effect. The length of the new helix, wound
like the other upon a glass tube, is about 30 centim. The
windings are in four layers, at the rate altogether of 65 per
centim. ; so that (under the same current) the magnetizing
force is about twice as great as before. The resistance is
4.75 ohms.
    A large number of observations have been made upon a
core of rather hard Swedish iron, 3.30 millim in diameter.
The same compensating-coil as before was found suitable, and

         under the Operation of Feeble Magnetic Forces.          235
the arrangements were unaltered, except that an additional
reversing-key was introduced, by which the poles of the
Daniell cell could be interchanged.          The total resistance of
the circuit, independently of the box, was 7 ohms. The
length of the core—or, rather, of the part exposed to the
magnetizing force"—being about 100 diameters, is scarcely
sufficient for an accurate determination ; but from the observed
£          necessary for the compensating-coil we can get at
 east a rough estimate of the susceptibility for small forces.
Thus, on December 28th, there was compensation for small
forces when the distances of the needle from the mean plane of
the compensating-coil and from the operative pole of the iron
core were respectively 17.2 centim. and 9.3 centim. The
magnetic force at the needle, due to unit current in the com
pensating-coil, is
                        27 x 74 X 92
                                       = 5:15.
                       {92 + 17.2°}}
The magnetizing force in the interior of the helix for unit
current is
                           47r X 65 = 817.
If k be the susceptibility, the strength of the pole is
                        #7 x 330° x 817 x k ;
and since the distance of this from the needle is 9.3 centim.,
 we have, to determine k,
                            5-15 x 9.32
                     T TX-330°x817 =6:36;
so that
                          p = 1 +4tk=81.
 This is probably an underestimate.
    In order to obtain results comparable with those of Stoletow
 and Rowland, the iron was submitted to a series of cycles of
  ositive and negative force. According to Ewing, the
   haviour is simplest when the iron is first treated to a
 process of “demagnetization by reversals.” This was effected
 in situ as a preliminary to the experiments of January 4th,
 the resistance in the box being increased by small steps from
 a few ohms to a thousand ohms; while at each stage the
 battery was reversed several times. It must be remarked,
 however, that the iron was all the while under the influence
 of the earth's vertical force; so that the resulting condition
 was certainly not one of demagnetization. But even as thus
          * At the upper end the iron projected beyond the coil.

236 Lord Rayleigh on the Behaviour of Iron and Steel
carried out, the operation was probably advantageous as obli
terating the influence of the previous history of the iron
COre.
   The compensation was in the first place adjusted so that no
displacement could be detected, whether the resistance was
infinity or 2007 ohms". This, of course, was in the position
of the reversing-key denoted (-). When the iron and the
compensating-coil acted in the same direction (+), the dis
placement was 8 divisions.
   In Table I, the first column gives the total resistance of
the circuit in ohms, and the second gives the reciprocals of
the first, numbers proportional to the current or magnetizing
force. Repetitions of a cycle are shown on the same hori
zontal line, for greater convenience of comparison. Thus the
first application of current + 197 gave the reading 242; a
second application, after the cycle + 19.7, 0, -197, 0, gave
241}. After two of these cycles had been completed, the
current + 326 gave the reading 245. To the readings as
entered a small correction to infinitely small arcs has been
applied. The letters R, L in the first column indicate the
alternative positions of the battery reversing-key. It will
be seen that very nearly the same numbers are obtained
on repetition of a cycle, and that even the first application
of an increased force gives a normal result.
   The first question # suggests itself is the law connecting
the magnitude of a current with the alteration of magneti
zation caused by its reversal. The quantities under conside
ration are exhibited in Table II., where the first column gives
the current (a) and the second column the displacement (y)
due to reversal. The relation between a and y is well ex
pressed by the formula

    It will of course be borne in mind that the magnetization

 compensating-coil, and that the existence of the small linear
term may be attributed to a defective adjustment of that coil.

table (from 1007R to 1007L), is
                  y= – 13+06=-07 division.
This is the step for which the coil was adjusted; and the dif
ference between the calculated and observed (zero) value of y

238 Lord Rayleigh on the Behaviour of Iron and Steel
is perhaps as small as could have been expected. It is fair to
conclude that, if the compensating-coil could have been per
fectly adjusted for a very small step (the actual step was
scarcely small enough), the uncompensated effects visible with
larger currents would have been expressible by a quadratic
term simply.
   The currents (v) given in the tables are reduced to C.G.S.
measure when divided by 10". On the same system the mag
netizing force is
                         8.2 x 10"x r ;
so that the force due to the strongest current referred to in
the table is 1:2 C.G.S., or about 7 H.      When the current is
reversed, the change of magnetic force is of course the double
of this quantity.
   In extending the definition of susceptibility to cases in
which the force is not very small, we might proceed in more
than one way. If we take the ratio of the change of mag
netization to change of force when the force is reversed, we
are following good authorities; and we get a definition which
is at any rate consistent with the definition necessary when
small forces are concerned.      The values of k for different
forces are not given by a direct comparison of the numbers in
Table II., since the magnetometer-scale is arbitrary; but we
may find for what force the susceptibility is (for example) the
double of that applicable to infinitely small forces.

   For this purpose we must note that the conjoint effect of
the magnetization due to current 50, simply applied or re
moved, and of the compensating-coil, was 8 divisions, of
which half is due to each cause.       e effect of the coil for a

          under the Operation of Feeble Magnetic Forces.        239
reversal of current 50 is thus 8 divisions, and being propor
tional to the current can be deduced for any other case. At
the bottom of the table, where the current is 1493, the dis
placement rendered latent by the coil is thus about 240 divi
sions; and since at this point the uncompensated displacement
is nearly of the same amount, we see that the value of k (as
above defined) is here doubled. Thus, if £5 denote the mag
netizing force in C.G.S. measure, we have
                           k=64 (1+'85).
The form of the relations of k to $5 for small forces is pretty
accurately demonstrated by the observations. On the other
hand, the reduction to absolute measure is rather rough"—a
point of less consequence, inasmuch as the constants may be
expected to vary according to the sample and condition of the
1ron.
    The observations in Table I, give a good deal more than the
extreme range of magnetization due to the reversal of a force.
In all cases the two residual magnetizations (when the force
is zero) are recorded; while in the two latter, where the range
is greatest, further intermediate points are included. The
results are plotted in Plate II. fig. 2, where it will be seen
that the curves start backwards in a horizontal direction after
 a maximum or minimum of force. Special observations (not
 recorded in the table) were directed to this point. Neither at
 the maxima nor at the zeros of force was there any evidence
 of failure of compensation when a small backward movement
 was made.
    The curves do not differ much from parabolas; and in
 other cases, where the applied magnetic forces were all of
 one sign, I have found that after a large movement in one
 direction, the curve representing a backward movement
 coincides somewhat closely with a parabola whose magnitude
 is nearly the same under different circumstances, and which
 is placed so that its axis is vertical and vertex coincident with
 the point where the backward movement commences. The
 reader will not forget that to obtain the real curves fully ex
 pressing the relation between magnetization and force, we must
 add the effect, proportional to the force, rendered latent by the
 compensating-coil.
    On the basis of this parabolic law we may calculate the
 influence of hysteresis in the magnetization of iron upon the
 apparent self-induction and resistance of the magnetizing
 coil, when periodic currents of moderate power are allowed

   These expressions coincide at the limits $5= +$', but differ
   at intermediate points. Since the force is supposed to be
   periodic, we may conveniently write
                             & = & cos 6;
   whence, putting also for brevity a' in place of a $5’, 8' in place

    If the range of magnetization be very small, 8' vanishes,
    and the influence of the iron upon the enveloping coil is
    merely to increase its self-induction; but if 8' be finite, the
    matter is less simple. The terms in sin 36, sin 56, &c. indicate
    that the response of the iron to a harmonic force is not even

          under the Operation of Feeble Magnetic Forces.     241
purely harmonic, but requires higher components for its ex
pression. If we put these terms out of account as relatively
small, we must still regard the phase of 3 as different from
that of £5. The term in sin 6 will show itself as an apparent
increase in the resistance of the coil, due to hysteresis, and
independent of that which may be observed even with very
small forces as a consequence of induced currents in the
interior of the iron. The augmentation of resistance now
under consideration may be expected to be insensible when
 the extreme range of magnetizing force does not exceed one
 tenth of the earth's horizontal force.
     In the absolute determination (p. 235) of the susceptibility
 to very small forces of the hard Swedish iron wire (3:30
 millim. diameter), the length (about 100 diameters) was
 scarcely sufficient for an accurate estimate. Similar experi
 ments on a thinner wire (1:57 millim. diameter) of the same
 quality of iron gave k=6'85, corresponding to u=87. This
 is in the hard-drawn condition. After annealing the same
  piece of wire gave a higher result, but in this case the obser
 vation is complicated by the assumption of the magnetic state
  occupying a sensible time. The susceptibility applicable to
  the final condition is as high as 22.0, more than three times
  as great as before annealing. But a lower number would
  better represent the facts, when the small magnetic force is
  rapidly periodic ; and it may even be that under forces of
  frequencies such as occur in telephonic experiments, most of
  the difference due to annealing would disappear. Such a con
  clusion is suggested by the slight influence of annealing in
  the experiment described in Part II,” where is determined
  the increment of resistance of an iron wire due to the concen
  tration of a variable current in the outer layers. But the
  matter is one requiring further examination under better ex
  perimental conditions.
      The sensitiveness of the magnetometer-needle in the ex
  periments directed to prove the constancy of susceptibility to
   small forces, suggests the inquiry whether iron should be
   used when the object is purely galvanometric. An attempt
   to produce a sensitive galvanometer by hanging a mirror and
   needle between the pointed pole-pieces of a large electro
   magnet, arranged as in diamagnetic experiments, was not
   very successful. A better result was obtained with an astatic
   needle system, and an electromagnet on a much smaller scale.
   This was of horseshoe form, the core being of hard Swedish

 242 Lord Rayleigh on the Behaviour of Iron and Steel
 iron wire 3.3 millim. diameter. The insulated copper wire was
 in three layers, of resistance 34 ohm, and the total weight of the
 electromagnet was 283 grams. It was held so as to embrace
 the upper needle system. When the time of swing from rest
 to rest was 4 seconds, the movement due to a current of about
 * ampere was 100 divisions.         The zero was steady enough
 to allow a displacement of half a division to be detected with
 tolerable certainty in each trial; so that, as actually used, the
 arrangement was sensitive to a current of 4 x 10" ampere.
 The addition of a similar electromagnet embracing the lower
 needle system, and connected in series, would double the
 sensitiveness, and raise the resistance to 68 ohm. A galva
 nometer thus constructed, and of resistance equal to 1 ohm,
 would show a current of 10-7 ampere. Using finer wire, we
 might expect an instrument of 100 ohms to show a current of
 10" ampere, and so on.
    For comparison with the above I tried, in as nearly as
 possible the same way, the sensitiveness of a good Thomson
 astatic galvanometer of resistance 1.3 ohm. With an equal
time of vibration, a current of * ampere produced a move
 ment of 300 divisions. The zero was perhaps a little steadier
 than before; but it will be seen that the sensitiveness was of
the same order of magnitude. In both cases, by taking pre
cautions and by using repetition, the delicacy might have been
increased, probably tenfold.
   The experiments show that there is no difficulty in con
structing a galvanometer of high sensitiveness upon these
lines. According to theory, with ideal iron of permeability
100, it should be possible to attain a much higher degree of
sensitiveness than without iron. But the tendency to retain
residual magnetism would certainly be troublesome, and pro
bably neutralize in practice most of the advantage arising
from the higher permeability, which allows of windings more
distant from the needles being turned to good account. Another
inconvenience may be mentioned. If the iron poles are
brought at all close to the needles, there is a strong tendency
to instability at moderate angles of displacement.
   Experiments already described proved conclusively that the
response of iron and steel to small periodic magnetic forces is
not affected by the presence of a constant force, or of a re
sidual magnetization, of moderate intensity. At the same time
it appeared in the highest degree    £         that the indepen
dence was not absolute, and that the response to a given small
change of force would fall off as the condition of “saturation”
is approached, even though we admit, in accordance with

         under the Operation of Feeble Magnetic Forces.           243
 recent evidence, that saturation is attainable only in a very
 rough sense. The question was too important to be left un
 decided, but it was difficult to deal with by the magneto
 metric method. If the arrangement is sensitive enough to
 allow the effect of the small force to be measured with reason
 able accuracy, it is violently disturbed by the occurrence of
 high degrees of magnetization. Moreover it is undesirable
 to depend so much, as in this method, upon what may happen
 near the free extremities of the iron rod, where the magnetic
 forces must vary rapidly. The “ballistic method,” in which
 the changes of magnetization are indicated by the throw of
 a galvanometer-needle in connection with a secondary coil
 embracing the central parts of the rod, has the great advan
 tage for this purpose, that the reading is independent of the
 stationary condition of the iron. In the first experiments by
 this method the magnetizing helix was similar to one already
 described (p. 234); and the small, as well as the large, altera
 tions of force were effected by varying the resistance of the
 circuit. By suitably choosing the resistances from a box, the
 small alterations of current could be obtained with sufficient
 suddenness by the simple introduction or removal of a plug,
 and were taken of the same order of magnitude at different parts
 of the scale. A comparison of effects (with the aid of a table of
 reciprocals) proved that a pretty strong total force" or mag
 netization did not interfere much with the response of the
 iron to a given force of small magnitude.
    This arrangement did not well allow of the investigation
 being pushed further so as to deal with stronger magnetizing
 forces. If, with the view of increasing the current, we cut
 down the german-silver resistance too closely, the estimate of
 total resistance depends too much upon the battery, and the
 current becomes uncertain. This difficulty is evaded by the use
 of a double wire—one conveying the strong current, of which
 the measurement does not require to be very exact; the other
 conveying the weak current, of which the effect at different
 parts of the scale is to be examined.
    In order to obtain a satisfactory ratio of length to diameter,
 without the loss of sensitiveness that would accompany a
 diminution in the section of the iron, a helix was prepared
 of length 59.6 centim. It was wound upon a glass tube
 with a double wire in three layers, the whole number of turns
of each wire being 1376. The magnetizing force due to unit

    The resistance of each wire is 3.2 ohms; and thus when
two Grove cells are used in connection with one of the wires,
a current of about an ampere (1 C.G.S.) can be commanded.
Smaller currents were obtained by the insertion of resistances
from a box.
    Although the secondary coil, connected with a delicate
galvanometer, contained a large number of convolutions, the
sensitiveness was insufficient to allow of the small magnetizing
force being taken as low as would otherwise have been de
sirable. It was obtained by means of the second wire of the
helix, which was included in the circuit of a Daniell cell and
200 ohms from a resistance-box.              When the circuit was com
pleted (or broken) at a key, the force brought into operation,
or removed, was

     In making a series of observations it was usual, after each
alteration    # the strong magnetizing force, to apply and re
move the small magnetizing force several times before
attempting to take readings.
     The results obtained by this method were of a pretty de
 finite character. The small force produced a constant effect
 upon a wire of unannealed Swedish iron, 3.3 millim. in
 diameter, until the large force was increased from 0 to about
 5 C.G.S.      At about 10 C.G.S. the effect of the small force
 fell off 5 per cent. The highest force used, about 29 C.G.S.,
 reduced the effect to about 60 per cent. of its original amount.
 On complete removal of the force due to the Grove cells, there
 was but a partial recovery of effect, doubtless in consequence
 of residual magnetization. After the wire had been removed
 from the helix and well shaken, the small force was found to
 have recovered its full efficiency.
     The wire was then annealed and submitted anew to a similar
  series of operations. The magnetization due to the alternate
  application and removal of the small force was found to be at
  first, i.e. in the absence of a constant force, twice as great as
  before *.
      The increase, however, is not long maintained, a steady force
  of 2 C.G.S. being already sufficient to cause a marked falling
  off (of about 20 per cent.). Under the operation of 29 C.G.S.,
  the effect of the small force fell to about of its original
     * It should here be remembered that any part of the change of mag
  netization which lags behind for more than a second or two, fails to
  manifest itself fully in the indications of the galvanometer.

amount. Removal from the helix and shaking in a zero
field sufficed to restore the wire to its initial condition.
   Similar experiments upon an annealed wire of “best spring
steel” showed no sensible change of effect when the steady
force was varied from 0 to about 16 C.G.S.          In this case the
ratio of length to diameter was about 300.
    We may now regard it as established :—
    That in any condition of force and magnetization, the sus
ceptibility to small periodic changes of force is a definite, and
not very small, quantity, independent of the magnitude of the
small change.
    That the value of the susceptibility to small changes of force
is approximately independent of the initial condition as regards
force and magnetization, until the region of saturation is ap
proached.

 XXVI. The Permanent and Temporary Effects on some of the
    Physical Properties of Iron, produced by raising the Tempe
    rature to 100° C. By HERBERT TOMLINsoN, B.A. *
                            Introduction.
 Fol. many years         I have been carrying on researches re
         specting the effects of stress on the physical properties of
 matter, and during this period I have become acquainted with
 certain phenomena, which, though pertaining more or less to
 most metals, are so conspicuous in iron as to render it worthy
 of special attention. As these phenomena bear importantly on
 what Sir William Thomson has designated the thermodynamic
 qualities of metals, the investigation of which seems to be
 attracting daily more and more attention, I propose to lay
 before the Physical Society, from time to time, such informa
 tion concerning them as a patient study has enabled me to
 acquire.
     On the present occasion I would invite attention to certain
 remarkable effects produced on some of the physical proper
 ties of iron, by merely raising the temperature to a degree
 not exceeding 100° C.
                     The Internal Friction of Iron.
     If an iron wire be suspended vertically with its upper extre
  mity clamped to a rigid support, and its lower one clamped or
  soldered to the centre of a horizontal bar of metal, attached
    * Communicated by the Physical Society: read January 22, 1887.

246                  Mr. H. Tomlinson on some
to which, at equal distances from the wire, are two cylinders
of equal mass and dimensions, and the whole system be set
in torsional oscillation, the amplitude of the vibrations will be
found to diminish more or less gradually until finally rest
ensues. This diminution of amplitude is almost entirely due
to two causes, namely, the friction of the air, and the internal
friction of the metal. The internal friction of the wire may
be measured by the logarithmic decrement of arc for a single
                    log A-log B
vibration, or by          78
                                    , where A is the initial arc, and
B is the arc after n vibrations.          By the aid of Prof. G. G.
Stokes’s mathematical formulae", and an experimental deter
mination by myself f of the coefficient of viscosity of air, I
have been able to eliminate the resistance of the air, and to
compute the damping effect due to the internal friction of the
metal. Where the deformations produced are sufficiently
small, I have proved the following laws respecting the loga
rithmic decrement of arc # :—
   1. It is independent of the amplitude;
   2. It is independent of the vibration-period.
   These laws only hold good when the wire has been allowed
to rest for a considerable time after any change has been
made in the arrangements, and when there has been a large
number of oscillations executed previously to the actual
testing.
   What is the nature of this so-called internal friction of the
metal?     It cannot resemble fluid friction; because for such
velocities as we have here the friction of fluids is proportional
to the velocity. Neither can it resemble altogether the ex
ternal friction of solids; because the latter is not nearly so
independent of the velocity as is the internal friction, nor
would the logarithmic decrement be independent of the am
£           Some experiments by Prof. G. Wiedemanns throw
 ight on the subject. Let A, B, represent the original posi
tion of equilibrium of the axis of the bar to which the wire is
attached, and let a torsional couple be applied so as to bring
the bar to A1 B1. On reducing the torsional stress gradually
to zero the bar will not come back to Ao Bo, but remain in a
new position A2 B2, however small may have been the angle
of torsion A10A0. Again, if the bar be twisted by an equal
torsional stress in the opposite direction to As Bs and the stress
be then reduced to zero, the bar will remain permanently

twisted in the position A. B. Now if we keep on applying
and removing the torsional couple in this way, first in one
direction and then in the other, the region A30 A, will gra
dually diminish until a minimum is reached. According to
Wiedemann, this is exactly what takes place when we allow
the wire to vibrate freely; the permanent position of equili
brium is constantly shifted to and fro. Within the regions
A10A2 and A30 A, the elasticity is perfect, and there is on
the whole no gain or loss of energy. The loss of energy ex
perienced in a torsionally vibrating wire arises from the work
expended in the region A20 A4 in shifting the permanent
position of equilibrium from A2 to A, and back again; and,
provided the amplitudes of the oscillations do not exceed a
certain limit, the extent of the region A20 A, is proportional
to the amplitude. Wiedemann goes further than this; for he
says what is true with respect to the wire as a whole is true
with respect to each molecule of the iron, and that the internal
friction is really due to the rotation to and fro of the perma
nent positions of equilibrium of the molecules. We need not
stop to discuss here this last point; but what does seem pro
bable is, that the main part of the loss of energy is experienced
as the bar swings from A3 to A4. When, as in my own ex
periments, the deformations produced by the oscillations are
very small, it would seem that the positions A2, A, are really
subpermanent rather than permanent; and if time were given
and the molecules agitated, the bar would of itself return to
the position Ao, when the torsional couple was reduced to zero.
   I have said, that as the wire oscillates, the region A20 A.
becomes narrower and narrower, and Wiedemann speaks of
the period during which the diminution takes place, as “the
accommodation period.” My own experiments have verified
the results of those of Wiedemann and Sir William Thomson *,
                   * Proc. Roy. Soc. May 18, 1865.

248                     Mr. H. Tomlinson on some
in showing that repeated oscillation will reduce the internal
friction; but they also show a very large influence to be
exerted by long rest, either with or without oscillation, and have
further proved that considerable diminution, both temporary
and permanent, can be produced by merely raising the
 temperature of the wire to 100°C. Thus a well annealed
 iron wire, when tested about ten minutes after suspension,
 was found to have a logarithmic decrement due to the
 internal friction of the metal of 003011, after one hour of
 -001195, and after one day of 001078. After the last period
 the friction became sensibly constant, and after four days was
 found to be still the same ; the wire had apparently “accom
 modated ” itself as far as possible.
     Great, however, as was the reduction of the internal friction
 !' by oscillation and rest, the minimum had by no means
    een reached; for on repeatedly heating the wire to 100° C.,
  and then allowing it to cool, the logarithmic decrement rapidly
  diminished, until after six days, on each of which the wire was
  heated to 100°C., and then allowed to cool slowly, it became only
  -000412, when further repetition of the above process ceased to
  sensibly affect the friction. The greater part of the diminution
  occurred after the first heating and cooling, but several repeti
  tions were necessary to produce the minimum mentioned above.
      Still more marvellous is the temporary effect of a rise of
  temperature not exceeding 100° C. on the internal friction of
  annealed iron. A careful examination of the above specimen
  at temperatures ranging between 0°C. and 100°C., revealed
  the astonishing fact that, at a temperature of 98°C., the
  logarithmic decrement was only 000112, and was considerably
  less than one fourth of its amount at 0°C.”            At 98°C. the
  friction was a minimum, further rise of temperature resulting
  in increase of the logarithmic decrement. It may perhaps
   assist us in forming some notion of the very small amount of
  internal friction in the above specimen of iron at 98°C., if we
   estimate the number of vibrations which would be required
   before the amplitude would be reduced to one half of its initial
   value by molecular friction only: this number is nearly 3000.
   It follows that if we could make the wire and its appendages
   vibrate in vacuo, and maintain the temperature constantly at
   98°C., with a vibration-period of ten seconds, more than eight
   hours would elapse before an initial amplitude of 100 would
   be reduced to 50.
       The internal friction of the wire when reduced to its
   minimum by all the above-mentioned processes was only one
   thirtieth of its original amount.
      * The temporary diminution of the internal friction of annealed iron
    was shown at the meeting of the Society.

    When the wire has fully “accommodated” itself, a very
small cause will disturb the accommodation: a mechanical
shock, a change of load, a slight rise or fall of tempera
ture, or even rotation of the molecules by magnetic stress, will
necessitate fresh oscillations before the friction again reaches
its minimum. Consequently, if a wire be raised to 100°C.,
and be then cooled again rather quickly, it does not imme
diately regain the accommodation which it had before heating.
The time taken by the wire to reaccommodate itself when
the accommodation has been disturbed by change of tem
perature, depends considerably upon the direction of the
change. Thus, when the wire is raised from the temperature
 of the room to 100°C., the reaccommodation is effected in a
 very much shorter time than when the accommodation has
 been disturbed by lowering the temperature from 100°C. to
 the temperature of the room.
     I am inclined to regard both the temporary and permanent
 alterations of the internal friction of iron, which are produced
 by rise of temperature not exceeding 100°C., to be partly due
 to mere agitation of the molecules, but the permanent effects
 do not seem to be entirely due to molecular agitation; for the
 maintaining of the temperature at 100° C. for some time does
 not bring down the friction anything like so much as repeated
 heating and cooling. . It would seem that the slow shifting
 backwards and forwards of the molecules induced by the last
 process is in a great measure to be credited with the permanent
 diminution of friction, in the same manner that the shiftin
  backwards and forwards of the molecules caused by i.'
 oscillation has been shown to produce permanent diminution.
         The Longitudinal and Torsional Elasticity of Iron.
      It might readily be imagined that since the internal friction
  of iron is so considerably altered by change of temperature,
  the elasticity would be correspondingly £. This, how
  ever is not so ; both the torsional and longitudinal elasticit
  of iron are affected by raising the temperature to 100°C., but
  not nearly to the same extent as the internal friction. Thus
  an annealed iron wire, when suspended ready for torsional
  vibration, was heated slightly by passing the flame of a
  Bunsen’s burner rather quickly up and down it several times.
  The time of vibration before heating was 1:154 second; and in
  5 minutes, 35 minutes, and 245 minutes after cooling was
   1147, 1142, and 1.136 second respectively. Here we have
  a small, though distinct, permanent increase of elasticity; and
   it will be noticed that time is an important element in the
   amount of increase. Again, by a very carefully conducted
   set of observations, I have shown that    #. torsional elasticity

250                   Mr. H. Tomlinson on some
of annealed iron is temporarily decreased to the extent of 2.693
per cent., when the temperature is raised from 0° to 100°C."
   Again, an annealed pianoforte-steel wire, when tested with
a certain load at the temperature of 12°C., was temporarily
elongated to the extent of 1:502 half-millimetres; when heated
to 100°C. in an air-chamber the elongation was 1.487 half-milli
metres; and when cooled again and tested 24 hours afterwards,
was elongated by 1:450 £ f. Thus, as with the
torsional elasticity, there was a permanent increase of elasticity,
and a temporary decrease of 2.58 per cent. Time in this case
also is an important element, for the elasticity immediately
after cooling was very appreciably less than when a long rest
had been given.
   Similarly, I have shown both for longitudinal and torsional
elasticity that an iron wire, after having been permanently ex
tended by traction, has its elasticity very perceptibly increased
by long rest. It is also well known that the portative power of a
magnet can be considerably increased by putting on the load by
small quantities at a time, with long intervals of rest between.
   These and other considerations prove beyond a doubt, that if
the molecular arrangement of iron be disturbed by any kind of
stress whatever, exceeding a certain small limit, the molecules
will not assume at ordinary temperatures those positions which
will secure a maximum of elasticity, until a rest of many hours
has been given.
                   The Velocity of Sound in Iron.
   According to Wertheim, the velocity of sound in iron and
steel is increased by a rise of temperature not extending beyond
100° C.       Now in no sense whatever is this statement correct.
It is true that the longitudinal elasticity of iron, as determined
by the method of statical extension, may be found greater at
100°C. than at 0°C., provided we begin with the lower tempe
rature first and the wire has not been previously tested at
100° C. But, as we have seen, the apparent temporary
increase of elasticity is really a permanent one; and if the wire
be repeatedly heated to 100° C. and then cooled, subsequent
tests will always show a less elasticity at the higher tempe
rature than at the lower, if sufficient rest after cooling be
allowed.    When, however, we come to such small molecular
displacements as are involved in the passage of sound through
a wire, even the apparent increase of elasticity, mentioned
above as taking place at the first heating, vanishes. I have
been able to prove that, when an iron or steel wire is thrown

 the pitch of this note becomes lower as we raise the temperature
 even when the wire is heated for the first time.*
    It seems rather strange that the error should have been so
 long allowed to remain uncorrected; for it has been known
 for many years that the pitch of a steel tuning-fork is lowered
 by small rises of temperature to a greater extent than would
 follow from mere change of dimensions. Calling the fre

    From (2) and the value of the coefficient of thermal expan
 sion of steel, it follows that if the pitch of the note is lowered
 by rise of temperature to the extent to which it is known to
 be, the velocity of sound must be lowered also. Indeed from
 the coefficient of thermal expansion of steel and from my own
 determination of the effect of change of temperature on the
 longitudinal elasticity of steel, I have calculated what would be
 the lowering of pitch of a certain fork, and find it in sufficient
accord with the lowering of pitch as determined by direct
experiment.
   Wertheim inferred the increase of velocity of sound in iron
 and steel from the apparent increase of longitudinal elasticity
produced by rise of temperature.              From his experiments on

    All that it is necessary to know of the medium is the rela
tion between the wave-velocity and the wave-length of an
endless procession of periodic waves. The result of our work
 will show us that the velocity of progress of a zero, or maxi

 is equal to the velocity of progress of periodic waves of wave
 length equal to a certain length, which may be defined as the
 wave-length in the neighbourhood of the particular point
 looked to in the group (a length which will generally be inter
 mediate between the distances from the point considered to its
 next-neighbour corresponding points on the preceding and

Running Water” (London Mathematical Society, December 13,
1883), the important peculiarity of example (4) in respect to
the critical wave-length which gives minimum wave-velocity,
and therefore group-velocity equal to wave-velocity. The
working out of our present problem for this case, or any case
in £, there are either minimums or maximums, or both
maximums and minimums, of wave-velocity, is particularly
interesting, but time does not permit its being included in the
present communication.

XXVIII. On the Formation of Coreless Vortices by the Motion
   of a Solid through an Inviscid Incompressible Fluid. By
   Sir W. THOMsoN, LL.D., F.R.S.*
TA: the simplest case : let the moving solid be a globe,
       and let the fluid be of infinite extent in all directions.
Let its pressure be of any given value, P, at infinite distances
from the globe, and let the globe be kept moving with a given
constant velocity, V.
   If the fluid keeps everywhere in contact with the globe, its
velocity relatively to the globe at the equator (which is the
'       of greatest relative velocity) is # W. Hence, unless
   > #V*f, the fluid will not remain in contact with the globe.
   Suppose, in the first place, P to have been > #V”, and to
be suddenly reduced to some constant value <$V3. The fluid
will be thrown off the globe at a belt of a certain breadth, and a
violently disturbed motion will ensue. To describe it, it will
be convenient to speak of velocities and motions relative to the
globe. The fluid must, as indicated by the arrow-heads in fig. 1,
flow partly backwards and partly forwards, at the place, I,
where it impinges on the globe, after having shot off at a tan
gent at A. The back-flow along the belt that had been bared
must bring to E some fluid in contact with the globe; and
the free surface of this fluid must collide with the surface of
the fluid leaving the globe at A.         It might be thought that
the result of this collision is a “vortex-sheet,” which, in virtue
of its instability, gets drawn out and mixed up indefinitely,
and is carried away by the fluid further and further from the
globe. A definite amnout of kinetic energy would thus be
practically annulled in a manner which I hope to explain in
an early communication to the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
   But it is impossible, either in our ideal inviscid incom
pressible fluid, or in a real fluid such as water or air, to

under consideration, and in every real and imaginable case of
two portions of liquid meeting one another (as, for instance,
a drop of rain falling directly or obliquely on a horizontal
surface of still water), is that continuity and the law of con
tinuous fluid motion become established at the instant of first
contact between two points, or between two lines in a class of
cases of ideal symmetry to which our present subject belongs.
   An inevitable result of the separation of the liquid from the
solid, whether our supposed globe or any other figure per
fectly symmetrical round an axis, and moving exactly in the
line of the axis, is that two circles of the '' liquid surface
come into contact and initiate in an instant the enclosure of
two rings of vacuum (G and H in fig. 2, which, however,
": be enormously far from like the true configuration).
     he “circulation” (line-integral of tangential component
velocity round any endless curve encircling the ring, as a
ring on a ring, or one of two rings linked together) is deter
minate for each of these vacuum-rings, and remains constant
for ever after : unless it divides itself into two or more, or
the two first formed unite into one, against which accidents
there is no security.

   It is conceivably possible" that a coreless ring-vortex, with
irrotational circulation round its hollow, shall be left oscillating
in the neighbourhood of the equator of the globe; provided
(#V*-P))P be not too great. If the material of the globe
                                    Fig. 2.
be viscously elastic, the vortex settles to a steady position round
the equator, in a shape perfectly symmetrical on the two sides
of the equatorial plane; and the whole motion goes on steadily
henceforth for ever.
    If (#W*-P)/P exceed a certain limit, I suppose coreless
 vortices will be successively formed and shed off behind the
 globe in its motion through the fluid.
 XXIX. On the Relative Wave-lengths of the Lines of the Solar
            Spectrum. By Prof. HENRY A. Rowlandf.
 Fo: several years past I have been engaged in making a

 ordinary engraved maps, and I have now finished the map

258 Prof. H. A. Rowland on the Relative Wave-lengths
wave-length 5790. In order to place the scale correctly on
this map, I have found it necessary to measure the relative
wave-lengths of the spectrum and to reduce them to absolute
wave-lengths by some more modern determination. I have
not yet entirely finished the work; but as my map of the
spectrum is now being published, and as all observers so far
seem to accept the measures of Angström, I have decided
that a table of my results would be of value. For as they
stand now, they have at least ten times the accuracy of any
other determination. This great accuracy arises from the use
of the concave grating, which reduces the problem of relative
wave-lengths to the measure of the coincidences of the lines
in the different spectra by a micrometer.
   The instrument which £ employed has concave gratings
5 or 6 inches in diameter, having either 7200 or 14,400 lines
to the inch and a radius of 21 ft. 6 in. By my method of
mounting, the spectrum is normal where measured, and thus
it is possible to use a micrometer with a range of 5 inches.
The spectrum keeps in focus everywhere, and the constant of
the micrometer remains unchanged except for slight variations
due to imperfections in the workmanship. The micrometer
has no errors of run or period exceeding * inch. The
probable error of a single setting on a good clear line is
        £ of the wave-length. 1" of arc is about 0012 inch.
about 200,000
The D line in the second spectrum is 17 inch or 4.4 millim.
wide. Determinations of relative wave-length of good lines
seldom differ 1 in 500,000 from each other, and never exceed
1 in 100,000, even with different gratings. This is, of course,
for the principal standard lines, and the chance of error is
greater at the extremities of the spectrum. The interpolation
of lines was made by running the micrometer over the whole
spectrum, 5 inches at a time, and adding the readings together
so as to include any distance, even the whole spectrum. The
wave-length is calculated for a fixed micrometer constant, and
then corrected so as to coincide everywhere very nearly with
the standards. I suppose the probable error of the relative de
terminations withothe weight 1 in my table to be not far from
1 in 500,000. Angström thinks his standard lines have an
accuracy of about 1 in 50,000, and ordinary lines much less.
 o As to the absolute measure, it is now well determined that
Angström's figures are too small by about 1 part in 6000.
This rests, first, on the determinations of Peirce made for the
U.S. Coast Survey with Rutherford's gratings, and not yet
completely published; secondly, on an error made by Tresca in
the length of the standard meter used by Angström", which

obtained in my laboratory with two of my gratings by Mr.
Bell, which is published with this paper. Mr. C. S. Peirce
has kindly placed his grating at our disposal; and we have
detected an error of ruling which affects his result and makes
it nearly coincide with our own. The wave-length of the

    The greatest variation in these differences is evidently due
 to the poor definition of Angström's grating, by which the
 numbers refer to groups of lines rather than 2 to single
 ones. Selecting the best figures, we find that Angström's
 wave-lengths must be multiplied oby 1.00016 to agree with
 Bell's, while the correction for Angström's error of scale
 would be 1.000110.

260 Prof. H. A. Rowland on the Relative Wave-lengths
   It is impossible for me to give at present all the data on
which my determinations rest; but | have given in Table I.
many of the coincidences as observed with several gratings,
the number of single readings being given in the parentheses
over each set.
    Table II. gives the wave-lengths as interpolated by the
 uicrometer. It is scarcely possible that any error will be
found (except accidental errors) of more than 02; and, from
 the agreement of the observations, I scarcely expect to make
any changes in the final table of more than 01, except in the
 extremities of the spectrum, where it may amount to 03 in
 the region of the A and H lines. The wave-lengths of weight
 greater than 1 will probably be found more exact than this.
 The lines can be identified on my new photograph of the
 spectrum down to 5790. Below this there is little trouble in
 finding the right ones. All maps of the spectrum, especially
 above F, are so imperfect that it is almost impossible to
 identify my lines upon them. The lines can only be properly
 identified by a power sufficient to clearly divide bs and b4.
 Some of them are double, and most of these have been
 marked; but as the table has been made for my own use, I
have not been very careful to examine each line. This will,
however, be finally done. Micrometric measures have now
 been made of nearly all the lines below b, with a view of
 making a map of this region.
    Table I. gives the coincidences of the different orders of
the spectra as observed with several concave gratings on both
sides of the normal, the numbers in the brackets indicating
the number of observations.       The observations have been
reduced as nearly as possible to what I consider the true
wave-length, the small difference from the numbers given in
 Table I. being the variation of the observations from the
mean value. The true way of reducing these observations
would be to form a linear equation for each series and reduce
by the method of least squares. A simpler way was, how
ever, used, and the relative wave-lengths of the standard lines
(marked S in Table II.) were obtained; however, some other
observations were also included.
    Table II. gives the wave-lengths reduced to Bell's value for
the absolute wave-length of the D line. These were obtained
by micrometric measurement from the standards, as described
before. The weights are given in the first column, and some
of the lines, which were measured double, have also been
marked. But the series has not yet been carefully examined
for doubles. The method is so much more accurate than by
means of angular measurement, that the latter has little or no
weight in comparison.

   f Peirce's standard, given by him 5624,825 (Amer. Journ of Science),
later corrected by him to 5624 86, and finally corrected by Rowland and
Bell for error of ruling of grating and of standard to 5624.66. The latter
can be considered as very near to what the final corrected value of Peirce
will be, though it may be even so high as 5624,76.

   This table is to be used in connection with my photographic
map of the normal spectrum, to determine the error of the
latter at any point. The map was made by placing the pho
tograph in contact with the scale, which was the same for
each order of spectrum, and enlarging the two together. In
this way the map has no local irregularities, although the
scale may be displaced slightly from its true position and may
be a little too long or short, although, so far as I have tested
it, it seems to have very little error of the latter sort. The
scale was meant in all cases, except the ultra-violet, to apply
to Peirce's absolute value, and so the correction is generally
negative, as follows:—

 XXX. On the Absolute Wave-length of Light.              By Louis
       BELL, Fellow in Physics in Johns Hopkins University."
 UP       to the present time, Angström's map of the solar
         spectrum, and with it his determination of absolute
 wave-length, has remained the final standard of reference in
 all spectroscopic matters. But since Angström's work was
 published, optical science, particularly that part of it which
 deals with the manufacture and use of diffraction-gratings,
                    * Communicated by the Author.

266                Mr. L. Bell on the Absolute
has made enormous progress. It is now possible with the
concave grating to measure relative wave-lengths with an
accuracy far greater than can be claimed for any one of the
absolute determinations. The numbers given by Angström
are now known to be too small by as much as one part in
seven or eight thousand, as has been shown by Thalén, in
his monograph Sur le Spectre du Fer; and since Angström’s
work but one careful determination has been made.        This is
by Mr. C. S. Peirce, and was undertaken some eight years
since for the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. No full
report of this work has as yet been published, though it is
evidently very careful, and has already consumed several
years. Certain results were communicated to Prof. Rowland
of this University, to serve as a standard of reference for his
great map of the solar spectrum now nearly completed; and
it was to serve as a check on these results and to furnish a
value of the absolute wave-length as nearly as possible com
mensurate in accuracy with the micrometrical observations,
that the experiments detailed in the present paper were under
taken. Only the work with glass gratings has been as yet
completed; but since the relative wave-lengths, which are
intrinsically of far greater importance, are now ready for
publication, and have been reduced by the value herein given,
the result is published, leaving for further work with speculum
metal gratings its final confirmation or correction.
   This portion of the determination is delayed awaiting better
facilities for carrying it out, but the writer intends under
taking it at the earliest possible moment, and hence leaves for
a future paper the complete discussion of the problem.
   The writer desires here to express his deep obligations to
Prof. Rowland, under whose guidance the work has been
carried on, and to whom a very important correction is due ;
and to Profs. W. A. Rogers and C. S. Peirce for information
given and courtesies extended.
                          Experimental.
   The determination of absolute wave-length involves two
quite distinct problems—first, the exact measurement of the
angle of deviation of the ray investigated, and second, the
measurement of the absolute length of the gratings used.
Each portion of the work involves its own set of corrections,
frequently quite complicated and difficult, but it is the latter
  art that is peculiarly liable to errors, which will be treated
in detail further on. As to the former part, several import
ant questions arise at the very outset. First is the choice
between transmission- and reflection-gratings. The principal

                      Wave-length of Light.                    267
work heretofore has been done with the former; but metallic
    tings possess certain advantages, notably from the ease
with which their temperature can be accurately measured, and
the fact that they can easily be made of a size much larger
than glass gratings, and consequently a small inaccuracy in
measuring them involves much less error in the result.
   On the other hand, the coefficient of expansion of speculum
metal is more than twice as great as that of glass, and being a
good conductor it is far more sensitive to small changes of
temperature. And this property increases the liability to
irregularities in the ruling, particularly in large gratings
which require several days for completion. In ruling on
glass change of temperature is less serious, but this advantage
is more than offset by the faults caused by the wearing away
of the diamond point, which breaks down so rapidly that it
is enormously difficult to produce a glass grating free from
flaws and at all comparable in optical excellence with those
upon speculum metal. The determination of absolute wave
length should rest on measurements made with both classes;
and with sufficiently exact instruments and very careful ex
perimentation, the better results can probably be obtained
from the metallic gratings. For the reasons previously stated,
this paper is confined to the results from glass ones.
   Now there are two quite distinct ways of using transmission
gratings—first, perpendicular, or nearly so, to the collimating
or the observing telescope; and second, in the position of
minimum deviation.       The method in the first case is familiar;
the properties of the second are as follows:—
   The general relation between the incident and the diffracted
ray is
                      -   - - -        ...     m\.
                     Sin i + Sin   (3-)=#.
When i=0°, this gives the ordinary formula for normal in
cidence. Putting it in the form
                     _2(a) ...
                   x==:              8
                              Sin 5 cos    (-$).
                                             .. 8
the deviation represented by the angular term will evidently
be a minimum when       i=5 ;   and the wave-length will then be
given by the formula
                           X=  2(a) sin 8
                                772.       2"
   It is not easy to say which method of procedure is prefer

268                Mr. L. Bell on the Absolute
able; but on the whole the ordinary plan of normal incidence
offers fewer experimental difficulties, and therefore was
adopted particularly as the spectrometer used was specially
well suited to that method. It is quite certain that either
method will, with proper care, give the angular deviation with
a degree of exactness far surpassing that attainable in the
measurement of the gratings.
                       The Spectrometer.
   This was a large and solid instrument by Meyerstein, with
a circle on silver 32 centim. in diameter divided to tenths of
a degree. This is read by two micrometer-microscopes 180°
apart. The pitch of the micrometer-screws is such that one
turn equals about 2"; and as the head is divided into sixty
parts, each of these represents 2". The micrometer can,
however, be set with certainty to less than half this amount.
The collimating and observing telescopes are of 4 centim.
clear aperture and 35 centim. focal length, and the lenses are
well corrected.   The collimator is fixed to the massive arms
which carry the reading microscopes; while the observing
telescope is attached to a collar on the axis of the main circle,
and moves freely upon it or can be firmly clamped so as to
move with the circle. The grating is carried on an adjustable
platform with a circle 12.5 centim. in diameter, divided to
30', by verniers to 1", and moving either upon or with the
large circle.
   This arrangement of parts does not admit of fixing the
grating rigidly normal to the collimator; so in all the experi
ments it was placed normal to the observing telescope, a
position which was particularly advantageous in the matter
of adjustment. The instrument was set up in a southern
room in the physical laboratory, and throughout the experi
ments the collimator pointed about south-south-east. With
the eye-piece used, the observing telescope had a power of
very nearly sixteen diameters.
                            Gratings.
   Very few glass gratings have ever been ruled on Prof.
Rowland’s engine, since for most purposes they are much
inferior to the metallic ones, and are very much more diffi
cult to rule, as they run great risk of being spoiled by the
breaking down of the diamond-point. A very few, however,
were ruled in 1884 with special reference to wave-length
determination; and of these the two best were available for

                       Wave-length of Light.               269
these experiments. They are both ruled upon plane sextant
mirrors, and are of very nearly the same size—thirty milli
metres long, with lines of about nineteen millimetres. Each
hundredth line is longer, and each fiftieth line shorter, than
the rest; so that the gratings are very easy to examine in
detail. The ruling of both is smooth and firm, without breaks
or accidental irregularities, and almost without flaws. They
were ruled at different temperatures and on different parts of
the screw; and while one was ruled with the ordinary arrange
ment of the engine, the other was ruled to a very different
space by means of a tangent-screw. This great diversity of
conditions in the two gratings is far from favouring a close
agreement in the results; but tends to eliminate constant
errors due to the dividing-engine, and hence to increase the
value of the average result. It must be remembered that
two gratings ruled on the same part of the screw are in most
respects little better than one. The grating designated I. in
this paper contains 12,100 spaces, at the rate of very nearly
400 to the millimetre, and was ruled (by tangent-screw) at
a temperature of 6°7 C. in January 1884. It gives excellent
definition with almost exactly the same focus for the spectra
on either side, and is quite free from ghosts or other similar
defects.
    The grating designated II. has 8600 spaces, at the rate of
about 7200 to the inch, and was ruled in November 1884,
at 11°6 C. Its definition and focusing are very nearly as
£ as in I., and, like it, it shows no trace of ghosts or false
  ines. They are both exquisite specimens of the work which
Prof. Rowland's engine is capable of doing, though, as the
event showed, I. is decidedly the better grating, in the
matter of regularity of ruling.
                     Angular Measurements.
    At the beginning of the work a serious question of adjust
 ment arose. There are two ways of using a grating perpen
 dicular to one of the telescopes. In the first place it may be
 placed and kept accurately in that position; and, secondly, it
 may be placed nearly in the position for normal incidence,
 and the error measured and corrected for.        Angström used
 the latter method, which involved a measurement on the
 direct image of the slit as well as on the lines observed.
        o
 Using Angström's notation-let 2 and a' be the readings on
 the spectra, and M that on the slit.    Let also
                a + x'                2–2.'
                  2. – M = A and *2          = }.

270               Mr. L. Bell on the Absolute
   Then if y is the angle made by the incident ray with the
normal to the grating, and N the order of spectrum,
                     +
                    * =cos(y-HA) sin p ;
also
                  sin y=sin(y+A) cos b,
and
                            cos qi
                  tan 'y= 1-cos     b  -
But from the second of the above equations,
                    -
                   sin (y-HA) =    sin p'
                               – cos   y
Now it was found that with the collimating-eyepiece belong
ing to the spectrometer, y would never exceed and seldom
reach 10", while the angles of deviation observed were about
45°. Substituting these values in the last equation, it at
once appeared that the cosine of (y-HA) was a quantity dif
fering from unity by considerably less than one part in a
million, and hence entirely negligible. Further, it was found
that the grating once set could be trusted to remain perpen
dicular through a series of measurements; and though at the
end of each series the grating was adjusted to a new part
of the circle, and a close watch kept for its slipping out of
adjustment, it was never found necessary to reject a series
from that cause.
   The grating was centred and adjusted with reference to
the circles and their axes by the ordinary methods. Through
out the experiments the light was concentrated on the slit by
an achromatic lens of about half a metre focus, which was
placed behind a sheet of deep yellow glass, which served to
cut off the overlapping blue rays, which might otherwise have
proved troublesome. A heliostat enabled the sun's image to
be kept centrally upon the slit.
   The method of observation was as follows:—When instru
ment and grating were in exact adjustment, readings were
taken on D1 in the spectra on either side of the slit, and the
angle measured from three to six times in rapid succession,
the last reading being of course on the same side as the first.
   Then the grating was rotated about ten degrees, readjusted,
and the process repeated.
   The angles observed in one series were combined to elimi
nate errors of setting, while the use of all portions of the
circle served to correct errors of subdivision, since the num
ber of independent series of observations was quite large.

                      Wave-length of Light.                 271
    To eliminate any errors which might be due to imperfec
tions of figure in the gratings, they were used in all the four
possible positions. No such error, however, became apparent
either from critical examination of the gratings themselves, or
from the results obtained in the different positions.
    Observations with grating I. were begun late in October,
1885, and occupied the clear days for a month. Forty-eight
series of measurements were made, and the agreement be
tween them was very satisfactory. After correcting for tem
perature, thirty-six of the number fell within a range of three
seconds, and the rest were clustered closely about them.
Observations on the various days were as follows:—

    All the above were in the third spectrum, to which mea
 surements were in the main confined, as in it the definition
 was particularly good; and it being the highest order which
 £ be conveniently observed, an error in the angle would
produce the minimum effect. The spectra on both sides of the
 slit were about equal in brilliancy and definition.
    The observations were weighted as nearly as possible accord
 ing to the favourable or unfavourable conditions under which
 they were made; and when finally combined, gave as the value
 of the angle of deviation for grating I. :
                    $=45° 1' 48"24+0"11.
    The above probable error is equivalent to a little less than
 one part in a million, and can introduce no sensible error into
 the resulting wave-length.
    Other work intervened, and the measurements with grating

272                 Mr. L. Bell on the Absolute
II. were not taken up until early in the succeeding March.
Precisely the same method of observation was employed, and
the results were nearly as consistent and satisfactory.

   When collected thus by days, the observations do not
appear to agree nearly as well as those made with grating I.,
particularly since a solitary wild reading, that of March 15,
is retained. The distribution of the various readings, how
ever, is such that, after weighing and combining, the final
result is by no means deficient in accuracy. It is
                     $=42°4'59":28+0"-2.
   The above probable error amounts to about one part in six
hundred thousand. The observations with grating II. were
uniformly in the fourth order of spectrum.
   Throughout the measurements with both gratings, the tem
perature was kept uniform within a few degrees. 20°C. had
been selected as the standard temperature, and the variation
was rarely more than two or three degrees on either side of
that figure. The question of temperature determination is a
serious one in case of glass gratings; for it is very hard to
tell what heating effect the incident beam has on the grating,
and equally hard to measure that effect. It is hardly safe,
without extraordinary precautions, to assume that the grating
has the same temperature as the air near, and it is such a
bad conductor that it would not easily assume the tempera
ture of the apparatus. In these experiments a sort of com
promise was effected. A small thermometer was attached to
the thin metallic slip that held the edge of the grating, and
shielded by cotton from air-currents, which of course would
affect it much more than they would the grating. The
thermometer was a small Fahrenheit graduated to quarter
degrees, and quite sensitive. It was carefully compared,
throughout the range of temperatures employed, with thermo
meter Baudin 7312, which served as a standard in all the

                       Wave-length of Light.                   273
measurements regular and linear, and during part of the
time was placed directly over the grating to give a check on
the attached thermometer. This expedient was finally aban
doned as unlikely to be of much use.
   The corrections for temperature were deduced from the
assumed coefficient of expansion of glass, which was taken as
0.0000085. This was reduced to angular correction for the
approximate value of b, and applied directly to the observed
angles. Since the temperatures at which observations were
made varied little from 20°C., and were quite equally distri
buted on both sides of that figure, any error in the assumed
coefficient would hardly affect the average result, but would
appear, if at all, as a slight increase in the probable error.
   760 millim. (reduced) was taken as : pressure, and
the values for the days of observation were taken from the
U.S. Signal-Service observations for the hours of 11 A.M.
and 3 P.M. on those days. The average for the measurements
made with grating I. was 761 millim., and for those with
grating II. 760 millim.; so that corrections for pressure were
uncalled for.
   The effect of the velocity of the apparatus through space is
a subject concerning '. there has been much discussion.
Angström deduced a correction; but Van der Willigen, in
quite a lengthy discussion of the whole matter, came to the
conclusion that there was no error due to the above cause.
Since that period the question has been raised from time to
time, but no decisive investigations on the subject have yet
been published. At present, however, it seems to be tolerably
well settled that no correction is needed, as the error, if there
be any, is of an order of magnitude entirely negligible, and
in the present paper none has been applied.
   The angular measurements, after all corrections were ap
plied, may thus be regarded as determined with a high degree
of accuracy—most probably to less than one part in half a
million.
                   Measurement of the Gratings.
   The exact determination of the grating-space is by far the
most difficult portion of a research on absolute wave-length,
and has been uniformly the most fruitful source of errors.
Besides the experimental difficulties of the task, it is far from
an easy matter to secure proper standards of length. The
standards used in various former investigations have proved
to be in error, sometimes by a very £ amount; and
indeed very few of the older standards are above suspicion.
As Peirce has very justly remarked in connection with this
   Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 23. No. 142. March 1887.          U

274                 Mr. L. Bell on the Absolute
subject—“All exact measures of length made now must wait
for their final correction until the establishment of the new
metric prototype.” Short standards of length are in some
respects peculiarly liable to error, since they must be com
pared with the subdivisions (often not sufficiently well deter
mined) of secondary standards; and small sources of uncer
tainty, such as poor defining-lines, slight changes in the
apparatus and the like, of course are much more serious as
the length is less.
   Fortunately, there were available for the measurement of
the gratings two standard double decimetres, which have been
£ with almost unprecedented care by Professor W.
A. Rogers. They are upon speculum metal; were graduated
and determined by Professor Rogers early in 1885, and were
purchased by the University late in the same year. They are
designated respectively S' and S', and are discussed at length
in the ‘Proceedings’ of the American Society of Microsco
pists for 1885.
   The bar S1 is 23 centim. in length. Near one edge is the
double decimetre S, divided to centimetres, the 5-centim.
lines being triple. S, is 27 centim. in length, and graduated
in the same way. The defining-lines in both are fine and
sharp, and the surfaces are accurately plane. They are stan
dard at 16°.67 C.; and from an elaborate series of compari
sons with four different standards, the coefficient of expansion
was found to be
                17.946 u per metre per degree C.
S; and S: depend for their accuracy on a long series of inde
pendent comparisons with Professor Rogers’ bronze yard and
metre R2, and steel standards whose relation to R, was very
exactly known. R2 has been determined by elaborate com
parisons with various standard metres and yards, and is
described and discussed at length in the ‘Proceedings” of
the American Academy, vol. xviii. The length of the metre
was determined, both directly and through the yard, by com
parison with the following standards:—
   I. The metre designated T, copper with platinum plugs,
traced and standardized by Tresca in 1880 from the Conser
vatoire line-metre No. 19, which bears a very exactly known
relation to the Métredes Archives.
   II. The yard and metre designated C. S., brass with silver
plugs, belonging to the Stevens Institute. The yard was
compared with the Imperial Yard in 1880, so that it is directly
and exactly known. It was afterwards sent to Breteuil; and

                      Wave-length of Light.               275
the metre was determined with great exactness by elaborate
comparisons with Type I. of the International Bureau of
Weights and Measures.
   III. “Bronze 11,” a primary copy of the Imperial Yard,
presented to the United States in 1856. It was taken to
England in 1878; and finally determined by direct compari
son with the Imperial Yard, Bronze Yard No. 6, and Cast
Iron Yards B No. 62 and C No. 63.
   The subdivisions of R2 have been determined with very
great care; and thus St and S., whose lengths relative to R,
are accurately known, may finally be referred to the ultimate
standard Type I. of the International Bureau.
    Only the 5-centim, spaces of Sí and S were investigated
by Prof. Rogers; but these were determined by various methods
under widely different conditions, and their relations to the
standards with which they were compared may be regarded
as definitely known. From a combination of all results the
subdivisions of St have the following lengths at the standard
temperature :
                    Standard St-199.99918
                         dm.1 S = 99.99995

                       5-cm., S = 49.99985
                       5-cm.4 S = 49.99901
                       5-cm., St- 50.00022
    Similarly the following values were derived for S#:—
                                   millim.
                     Standard S.: = 199.99968
                          dm.1 S:=100.00001
                          dm.5 S = 99.99967
                        5-cm.1 S:= 50.00020
                        5-cm., S. = 49.99981
                        5-cm.8 S:= 49.99931
                        5-cm., S:= 50.00042
    As to the degree of accuracy attained in determining St
 and S3, Prof. Rogers says that, including all sources of un
 certainty, either standard may have an error of +0.3a; but
 the mean of the two, since the determinations were inde
 pendent, ought to be even more reliable. Taking all things
 into consideration, it seems very improbable that the mean

276                Mr. L. Bell on the Absolute
value of St and S. can be in error by as much as one part in
half a million.
   So much for the standards of length. The comparator used
in the measurements was a very efficient instrument, particu
larly suited for the purpose. It consisted essentially of a long
carriage (! metre) running on V-shaped ways and carrying
the microscope. This carriage slides against adjustable stops,
and is pressed against them with perfect uniformity by means
of weights. An adjustable platform below carries the stan
dards and objects to be measured. The ways of both carriage
and platform had been ground till they were perfectly uniform
and true, and the working of the instrument left little to be
desired in the way of accuracy. Throughout a long series of
measurements the stops would not be displaced by so much
as 0.1" if proper care were used in moving the carriage.
 The microscope was attached so firmly as to avoid all shaking,
and was armed with a half-inch objective and an excellent
eyepiece-micrometer. The objective was made specially for
micrometric work, and was fitted with a Tolles' opaque illu
minator. Measurements were made as follows:—The standard
bar, and the grating mounted on a polished block of speculum
metal, were placed side by side—or sometimes end to end—
on the platform and very accurately levelled. The stops were
set very nearly three centimetres apart, one end of the grating
brought under the microscope resting against one of the steps,
and the micrometer set on the terminal line.          Then the
carriage was   ''       against the other stop, and the micro
meter again set.       e same process was then gone through
on three centimetres of the standard, and then going back
to the grating it was compared in the same manner with
succeeding triple centimetres till the fifteen-centimetre line
was reached, thus eliminating the errors of the single centi
metres and making the determination rest only on the fifteen
centimetre line. The temperature was given by a thermo
meter placed against the standard bar or the block that carried
the grating. In this manner each grating was repeatedly.
compared with the first fifteen centimetres of each bar, at or
 near 20°, the temperature at which the gratings had been
 used. The micrometer constant was determined by measuring
tenths of millimetres ruled on Prof. Rowland's engine; but in
practice the stops were so adjusted that it was almost elimi
nated. Each division of the micrometer-head equalled
0.28u, and the probable error of setting was less than half
that amount.
   All measurements were reduced to 20°C., as in the case of
the angular determinations. The line along which the linear
measures were made was that formed by the terminations of

                       Wave-length of Light.                277
the rulings. It was therefore necessary to know very exactly
the angle between this line and the direction of the individual
rulings; in other words, the angle between the line of motion
of the grating and the direction of the diamond stroke in the
dividing-engine. This was ascertained by means of two test
plates each some twelve centim. long ruled in centims, and
then superimposed line for line. By measuring the minute
distances between each end of a pair of superimposed lines,
the length of the lines and the amount by which their ends
overlapped at each end of the test plate, the required angle
could be deduced with great exactness. It differed so little
from 90°, however, that the correction produced, barely one
part in a million, was entirely negligible.
  After all reductions and corrections, the following series
of values were obtained for the grating-spaces of gratings I.

278                 Mr. L. Bell on the Absolute
     The probable error appears to be rather less than in the
measurements of grating I. As, however, the angular deter
minations made with I. are the better, so far as probable
errors of observation are concerned, the results from the two
gratings are about equal in value.
     Computing now the wave-lengths corresponding to the given
values of p and A for each grating, we have finally for the
wave-length of D, at 20° C. and 760 millim. pressure:
        From grating I. uncorrected, 5896:11 tenth metres.
        From grating II.         33      5895.95       3%
     The difference in the above results is by no means large
compared with the results obtained from different gratings by
other investigators, but it certainly is enormously great com
pared with the experimental errors alone.
     As nearly as can be judged, these ought not in either
    rating to exceed one part in two hundred thousand, while
the above discrepancy is about one part in thirty-five thousand.
     Its cause must be sought in the individual peculiarities of
the gratings, rather than in the method of using them.
     All gratings are subject to irregularities of ruling, and the
effects of these are various, according to the nature and
magnitude of the defects. Linear or periodic errors in
ruling, unless very small, will make themselves apparent by
changing the focus of the spectra or producing ghosts, re
 spectively; and if such errors are large, render the gratin
 totally unfit for exact measurement. Accidental errors, £
 as a flaw or break in the ruling, are also serious, but are
 easily detected and may be approximately corrected, as was
 done by Angström in the case of one of his gratings. Any
 marked and extensive irregularities of spacing will produce
 bad definition or false lines, and in most cases both. If, then,
 tl  £        on microscopical examination is free from flaws
 and on the spectrometer gives sharply defined spectra, alike
 in focus and free from ghosts, it is safe to conclude that it is
 tolerably free from the errors above mentioned; but, unfor
 tunately, there is one fault that does not at once become
 visible, while it introduces a very serious error in the measure
 ments: this is a rather sudden change in the grating-space
 through a portion of the grating, usually at one end. Such
 an error is usually due to abnormal running of the screw
 when the dividing-engine is first started, and may in this
 case be avoided by letting the engine run for some time
 before beginning to rule. Thus grating I., ruled with this
 precaution, is nearly free from this error. Sometimes, how
ever, it is the terminal or an intermediate portion of the

                       Wave-length of Light.                   279
£ that is thus affected, in which case the error may be
  ue to a change of temperature or to a fault in the screw. If
an error of this kind is extensive, it will produce the effect of
two contiguous    £         of different grating-space, injuring
the definition and widening or reduplicating #. lines. When,
however, the abnormal spacing is confined to a few hundred
lines, it produces no visible effect when the whole grating is
used, but simply diffuses a small portion of the light, and
increases or decreases the average grating-space. ' it is
evident that such a portion of the grating must possess little.
brilliancy and less resolving power; and #. more its spacing
differs from that of the rest of the grating, the less chance of
visible effect and the greater error introduced. Such a fault
is compatible with the sharpest definition, but can be detected
by cutting down the aperture of the grating till the spectrum
from the abnormal portion is relatively bright and distinct
enough to be seen. The effective grating-space, producing
 the spectra on which measurements are made, is, of course,
 that of the normal portion only. Both the gratings used in
these experiments were affected by the above error, No. I.
 very slightly, No. II. somewhat more seriously. Not only
 the discrepancies between different gratings, but those between
 different orders of spectra in the same grating are due to this
 cause.    For while in one order, where the effect due to the
 abnormal portion is imperceptible, the spectrum as measured
 is produced by the effective grating-space alone, in another
 order there may be produced a slight shading-off of the lines,
 so that their apparent centres may correspond approximately
 to the average grating-space. In any case, it is quite clear
 that a combination of the results from different orders of
 spectra will not eliminate the error.
    The remedy lies either in stopping out the imperfect por
 tion of the grating, or measuring it and introducing a cor
 rection. As the work of angular measurements was nearly
 finished before the study of the gratings was begun, owing
 to a delay in getting apparatus, the latter course was adopted
 in these experiments. Each grating was examined in detail,
 and the relation of the grating-spaces in the various portions
  of it carefully determined. From these data a simple gra
  phical method gave the correction to be applied to the wave
  length. In each grating the fault was confined to a small
  portion; and as the order of the spectrum employed in each
  was selected on account of its good definition and freedom
  from anything like haziness or shading-off of the lines, it seems
  safe to assume that the abnormal portion produced no visible
  effect, and that, consequently, the correction above mentioned

280                Mr. L. Bell on the Absolute
counteracts the error quite effectually. In grating I. the
correction was one part in 300,000, and in grating II. one
part in 60,000. Applying these to the wave-lengths we have
for grating I.:—
           Wave-length . . . . . . 5896.11

                Corrected w.-l.    .  .  . .   5896.05
    Combining these, and giving to grating I. the greater
weight on account of its very small error of ruling, we have
finally for the wave-length of D, at 20° C. and 760 millim.
pressure,               -     5896-08
or in vacuo,                  5897.71.
   It is no easy matter to give any well-founded estimate of the
probable error of the above result. So far as experimental
errors are concerned, the result with either grating should be
correct to one part in two hundred and fifty thousand; but
the error in the gratings introduces a complication by no
means easy to estimate. As nearly as the writer can judge,
however, it seems probable that the error of the final result
does not exceed one part in two hundred thousand. For
comparison, the values deduced from the work of      Peirce and
of Angström are subjoined:—
   Micrometer measure by Rowland, from Peirce's
     preliminary result o. . . . . .              •     5896-22
   Thalén's correction of Angström . . . . . . 5895-89
Both being in air at ordinary temperature and 760 millim.
   As neither result was corrected for errors in the gratings,
the cause of the discrepancy is obvious.
   Two determinations of absolute wave-length have been
published since this work was undertaken by the writer.
One is a very elaborate one by Müller and Kempf, who
employed four gratings by Wanschaff, and used the method
of minimum deviation.      Their results were as follows:—
Grating . . . . (2151)            (5001)     (8001)     (80014)
Wave-length . 5896.46 5896:14 5895.97 5896.33
   By a correction founded on the unwarrantable assumption
that the mean value was correct, the above results are brought
into apparent agreement.      Nothing, however, short of a study

in detail of each grating can furnish data for obtaining any
thing like an accurate result from the above figures. It
£ seem that (5001), which had the smallest probable
error, should show but a trifling error of ruling, while one
would expect to find a portion or portions of (2151), in which
the grating-space is abnormally large. Corresponding errors
of ruling should appear in (8001) and (80014). A similar
study of the gratings used by Angström would be of no little
interest.
    The other determination alluded to is one by M. de
 Lépinay, using a quartz plate and Talbot's bands. Without
 discussing the method, it is sufficient to say that the result
 obtained depends on the relation of the litre to the decimetre,
 a ratio not at present exactly determined.
    The results detailed in this paper are in a certain sense
 preliminary. The writer hopes that in the near future, ex
 periments with metallic gratings will enable him to lessen the
 probable error very materially, and therefore defers, for the
 present, further discussion of the problem.
    Through the courtesy of Mr. Peirce, the writer has been
 enabled to test the legitimacy of the above correction and, at
 the same time, check his own results. Mr. Peirce kindly
 forwarded his gratings and standard of length for examination
 and comparison, and the results were £ instructive.
     Grating “H,” with which a large part of the work was
 done, showed, as was suspected, a local error, equivalent to a
 correction of one part in 55,000 in the resulting wave-length.
 Tested in the spectrometer, the portion including the error
 showed a grating-space distinctly greater than that of the
 grating taken as a whole, showing £ both the necessity for
 and the algebraic sign of the correction. The other gratings
 showed similar errors varying in amount, but the same in
  sign, the correction requiring in every case a reduction in
 the wave-length. The abnormal portion was invariably at
 one end or the other of the grating concerned, never in the
 middle.
    The standard of length used by Mr. Peirce (“No. 3” a
 glass decimetre) was compared with S: and S; and the pre
  liminary results show that the length assigned to it was too
  great by very nearly 2u, 1 part in 50,000. Now the wave
  length of D1, as deduced from grating H, was

  obtained by the writer. A more complete discussion of
  Peirce's results is reserved until the relation between “No. 3”
 and S: and S: shall be more exactly known. The latter
 standards would appear to be the more trustworthy, since
 they are based on various independent determinations; while
 “No. 3” is based on an indirect comparison with metre
 “No. 49,” a standard concerning the exact length of which
 there seems to be some little doubt.
  XXXI. Measuring-Instruments used in Mechanical Testing.
                By Prof. W. C. UNwIN, F.R.S."
      HE determination of the exact distance between two fine
        marks on a standard of length is an operation of some
 difficulty, as is well known to physicists. But that operation
 is free from many of the difficulties which attend the measure
 ments which have to be made in the engineering laboratory.
 Among these the determination of the modulus of elasticity
 (Young’s modulus) of a bar by measuring its change of length
 by stress is one of the most important. Now the bars sub
jected to test are usually, in the part which can be measured,
 not more than 10 inches in length; and the whole elastic ex
 tension of such a bar is generally only about 0.007 inch. It
is obvious, therefore, that measurements must be made with
considerable accuracy and refinement to be of any value.
 But the bar cannot be placed in a position convenient for
measurement; and the attachments to the testing-machine are
more or less in the way of the measuring-apparatus to be
applied. The bar itself is a somewhat rough bar, the form of
which must not be interfered with to facilitate the measure
ments. Then also bars of very different forms have to be
tested, flat and round, of various widths and diameters; and
the measuring-apparatus must be applicable to all these with
equal readiness. Last, but not least, the work of an engi
neering laboratory is pressing, and measurements must be
carried out with rapidity.
    In some cases, two diamond scratches have been made on
the bar, and the distance between these measured by two
micrometer-microscopes. Apparatus of this kind is awkward
to apply on the testing-machine, and tedious to adjust and
read.
    A cathetometer has been used.       But then two adjustments
   * Communicated by the Physical Society: read January 22, 1887.

                   used in Mechanical Testing.                 283
have to be made, and two readings taken for each elongation.
Also the limit of accuracy of the cathetometer is hardly suf
ficient for the purpose.
   Very often mechanical magnification by a lever is adopted.
But there are some difficulties in satisfactorily attaching a
lever-apparatus to the bar : if a leverage of 100 to 1 is adopted,
the fulcrum distance becomes very short, and the range of the
apparatus is limited. There is also some difficulty in the
calibration of the instrument to determine the value of the
readings.
   A micrometer-screw is sometimes used as a means of me
chanical magnification. With this there is, again, the diffi
culty of suitable attachment to the bar; and, as generally
used, it is difficult to ascertain when exact contact of the
screw is obtained without excessive pressure.
    There is a special difficulty in measuring the elongation of
ordinary test-bars which has been overlooked in the construc
tion of most of the apparatus of this kind. It is difficult to
get test-bars which are rigidly straight. Even if the test-bar
 is strictly straight, it is difficult to hold it in the testing
 machine, so that the resultant of the stress on any cross section
 passes strictly through the centre of figure of the section.
 Now if this condition is not satisfied, the bar becomes curved
 during the test. The straightening of an initially curved bar,
 or the curving of an initially straight one, introduce errors
in the measurements of very considerable amount.
    If the measurements could be made at the axis of the bar,
 the errors of this kind with any amount of curvature likely
 to occur would not be very serious; but this is of course
 impossible. The best that can be done is to measure at the
 surface of the test-bar. But, in straightening, the surface of
 the bar on one side lengthens and on the other shortens, and
 thus introduces a not inconsiderable error of measurement.
 If, as in many forms of elongation measuring-apparatus, the
 measuring-points are two inches or more from the axis of the
 bar, the errors become very large relatively to the elongations
 to be measured.
    Let fig. 1 represent a bar bent in the plane of the paper,
 the centre of curvature being 0. Then, if measurements
 could be made on the axis of the bar, between the points a b,
 the straightening of the bar would introduce an error equal
 to the difference of the length of the chord a b and arc a c b.
 With any amount of curvature likely to occur in a test-bar,
 this error would not be very serious. Generally, however,
 the best that can be done is to measure the distance between
 points a1 b1 on the surface of the bar. Then, since by

284       Prof. W. C. Unwin on Measuring-Instruments
straightening the lines a 0, b0 become parallel, the error
introduced is the difference between a bi and the arc a cb ;
and this is much more serious. Most commonly, however,
measurements are made between points on clips fastened to
the bar at 1 or 2 inches distance from its surface, such as
as bo.    Then the error introduced by straightening is the
difference between a, b, and the arc a c b; and this may be a
serious error, even with a very small amount of initial cur
Vature.
   If simultaneous measurements are taken of a bi and as bs,
the mean of these will have no greater error than the mea
surement of a b.    That is, the mean of measurements on two.
sides of the bar reduces the error due to initial or induced
curvature to the same amount as a measurement actually
made at the axis of the bar.
    Prof. Bauschinger, of Munich, appears to have been the
first to recognize the importance of this double measurement
symmetrically on the two sides of the bar. He has always
used an apparatus in which a finger, or touch-piece, attached
to one end of the bar, presses on a roller attached to the other
end. As the bar extends, the roller rotates by friction against
the finger. A mirror is attached to the roller; and the amount

                   used in Mechanical Testing.                285
of rotation is observed by noting the image of a scale in the
mirror through a reading-telescope. In this way measure
ments to    IX'" of an        inch can be taken.     To eliminate
errors due to curvature, two rollers are placed, one on each
side of the bar, and two sets of readings are taken. This
involves the adjustment of two instruments and the taking of
two sets of readings. But the principle is perfect; and no
more accurate measurements than Bauschinger's have pro
bably been made.
    Touch-Micrometer Extensometer.—The first instrument used
by the author was a kind of callipers. Two bars, one sliding
in the other, could be set by touch to the distance between
two fixed clips on the test-bar. A scale was engraved on
 silver on one bar; and the distance of the nearest division from
a fixed zero-mark on the other was taken by a microscope
 micrometer. Readings could be taken to TENTE-th of an inch.
 The instrument is easy and rapid to use. £adings can be
 taken on both sides of the test-bar; and the readings are direct
 on to a carefully graduated scale, so that no calibration of the
 instrument is necessary.
    Screw-Micrometer Extensometer.—This aims at obtaining
 the extension along the axis of the bar by a single reading.
 Two clips are fixed on the bar, each by a pair of steel points,
 one on each side, gripping the bar in a plane through its axis.
 If, then, these clips can be made to preserve the same relative
 position to the bar, the middle points of the clips will move in
 the same way as points on the axis of the bar. Fig. 2 is a
 diagrammatic sketch of the apparatus. a a and b b are the
 clips on the test-bar, fixed to #     points in its middle plane.
 c c are projections on the clips, to which are fixed delicate
 spirit-levels; d is a small screw which just touches the test-bar;
 e is a micrometer-screw with graduated head, which supports
 the upper clip on the lower # . In use the lower clip is
 first levelled by the screw d'; 'm the upper clip is levelled
 '.  the micrometer-screw, and a reading taken. The clips being
  always accurately levelled, in a plane perpendicular to that in
  which the four points attaching the clips to the test-bar lie,
  the micrometer-readings are the distances between the middle
  points of the two parallel clips; and their differences are the
  mean of the elongations on the two sides of the test-bar, or
  virtually are readings at the axis of the test-bar. Readings
  to IT'Uoth of an inch can be taken.
    R'ani. Mirror Extensometer.--Fig 3 is a diagrammatic
  sketch of another instrument on the same principle. a and b

lower clip presses on the roller. If the ' extends, the roller
approaches the lower clip by an equal amount; it turns
against the finger f; and the amount of rotation is read by a
telescope and scale. This instrument will easily read to
 in on th of an inch. The roller being at the centre of the
clip, its movement is the mean of the elongations on the two
sides of the test-bar.
   The author showed a third instrument on the same principle,
for obtaining the compression of small blocks of stone.

XXXII. On the Equilibrium of a Gas under its own Gravita
                 tion only. By Sir W. THOMSON".
Th:          problem, for the case of uniform temperature, was
         first, I believe, proposed by Tait in the following
highly interesting question, set in the Ferguson Scholarship
Examination (Glasgow, October 2nd, 1885):—“Assuming
Boyle's Law for ' pressures, form the equation for the
equilibrium-density at any distance from the centre of a
spherical attracting mass, placed in an infinite space filled
originally with air, Find the special integral which depends
on a power of the distance from the centre of the sphere
alone.”
    The answer (in examinational style!) is:—Choose units
properly; we have
                        "=–           or dr

     Tait informs me that this question occurred to him while
writing for ‘Nature’ a review of Stokes's Lecture f on
Inferences from the Spectrum Analysis of the Lights of
 Sun, Stars, Nebulae, and Comets; and in the ‘Proceedings

 the Possible Duration of the Sun's Heat.”
     Helmholtz's explanation, attributing the Sun's heat to
 condensation under mutual gravitation of all parts of the
 Sun's mass, becomes not a            £            but a statement of
 fact, when it is admitted that no considerable part of the heat
 emitted from the Sun is produced by present in-fall of meteoric
 matter from without. The present communication is an
 instalment towards the gaseous dynamics of the Sun, Stars,
 and Nebulae.
    To facilitate calculation of practical results, let a kilometre
 be the unit of length; and the terrestrial-surface heaviness
 of a cubic kilometre of water at unit density, taken as the
 maximum density under ordinary pressure, be the unit of force
 (or, approximately, a thousand million tons heaviness at the
 earth's surface). If p be the pressure, p the density, and t the
temperature from absolute zero, we have, by Boyle and
 Charles’s laws,

Regnault’s determination of density,

    If the gas is enclosed in a rigid spherical shell, impermeable
to heat, and left to itself for a sufficiently long time, it settles
into the condition of gross-thermal equilibrium, by “conduc
tion of heat,” till the temperature becomes uniform through
out. But if it were stirred artificially all through its volume,
currents not considerably disturbing the static distribution of
£ and density will bring it approximately to what I
    ve called convective equilibrium" of temperature—that is to
say, the condition in which the temperature in any part P is
the same as that which any other part of the gas would acquire
if enclosed in an impermeable cylinder with piston, and dilated
or expanded to the same density as P. The natural stirring
produced in a great free fluid mass like the Sun's, by the
cooling at the surface, must, I believe, maintain a somewhat
close approximation to convective equilibrium throughout the
whole mass. The known relations between temperature,
pressure, and density for the ideal “perfect gas,” when con

u=f(x) belongs to this class, u=C/(ma) also belongs to it;
and (18) is the general solution for the class. We have
therefore, immediately, the following conclusions:—
    (1) The diameters of different globular" gaseous stars of
 the same kind of gas are inversely as the #(k-1)th powers
 (or # powers) of their central temperatures, at the times when,
in the process of gradual cooling, their temperatures at places
 of the same densities are equal (or “T” the same for the dif
 ferent masses). Thus, for example, one sixteenth central
 temperature corresponds to eight-fold diameter: one eighty
 first central temperature corresponds to twenty-seven fold
diameter.
   * This adjective excludes stars or nebulae rotating steadily with so
great angular velocities as to be much flattened, or to be annular; also
nebulae revolving circularly with different angular velocities at different
distances from the centre, as may be approximately the case with spiral
nebulae. It would approximately enough include the sun, with his small
 angular velocity of once round in 25 days, were the fluid not too dense
 through a large part of the interior to ''             obey gaseous law.
 It no doubt applies very accurately to earlier times of the sun's history,
 when he was much less dense than he is now.

   (2) Under the same conditions as (1) (that is, H and T the
same for the different masses), the central densities are as the
kth powers (or # powers) of the central temperatures; and

diameters.
   (3) Under still the same conditions as (1) and (2), the
quantities of matter in the two masses are inversely as the
(# –3)h          powers, (inversely as the cube roots) of their
diameters.
   (4) The diameters of different globular gaseous stars, of the
same kind of gas, and of the same central densities, are as the
square roots of their central temperatures.
   (5) The diameters of different globular gaseous stars of
different kinds of gas, but of the same central densities and
temperatures, are inversely as the square roots of the specific
densities of the gases.

and scale of abscissa (y) properly assigned according to (18),

  XXXIII. Preliminary Experiments on the Effects of Percus
    sion in Changing the Magnetic Moments of Steel Magnets.
    By WILLIAM BRowN, Thomson Experimental Scholar,
    Physical Laboratory, University of Glasgow".
                                PART I.
TH: experiments described in             this paper were made in
        the Physical Laboratory of Glasgow University. They
were first suggested by some casual observations made while I
was assisting Mr. T. Gray during his recent determination of
the horizontal intensity of the Earth’s magnetic force, and I
am greatly indebted to him for many hints and much valuable
advice during the progress of the experiments.
    This paper is an account of some preliminary observations
on a subject which is at present being investigated in this
Laboratory, and I hope to give the results of further experi
ments in an early number of this magazine.
    The effects of percussion in changing the magnetic moments
of steel magnets have not (so far as I know) been made the
subject of special observation. The results hitherto published
have, for the most part, formed less important sections of other
investigations.
    A number of interesting experiments on magnets were made
by Joule at intervals from 1864 to 1882. Among other results,
he gives an interesting set on “the effect of mechanical
violence on the intensity of magnetic bars,” an account of
which is published in his Scientific Papers, vol. i. p. 596.
    In 1878, Mr. T. Grayt published a very accurate series of
investigations on magnetic moments in absolute measure.
One of the objects of his investigation was to obtain informa
tion as to the permanence or non-permanence of magnetism
in steel bars when left undisturbed for a length of time. On
page 328 of the same paper, however, he gives a short series
of observations on the direct effects of percussion, which, so
far as they go, agree with my own results.
   There has been published quite recently an excellent series
of papers on the “Electrical and Magnetic Properties of the
Iron  ''             by C. Barus and V. Strouhal, of the U.S.A.
Geological Surveyi.

  294     Mr. W. Brown on the Effects of Percussion in
     In one of these papers the authors treat incidentally of
  magnetic retentiveness, but more with respect to the effects
 of annealing than of direct percussion. Annealing appears to
 play an important part in the ultimate retentive power of
 magnets, and on the constancy of their magnetic moments.
 My own experiments on annealed magnets are not yet com
 plete enough to be put into presentable form, and with two
 exceptions the results given are for magnets tempered glass
 hard. Regarding the effects of annealing generally, the
 results of Barus, Strouhal, and Gray appear to agree on the
 whole.
    On pages 326 & 327 of T. Gray’s paper it appears that an
 nealing increased the magnetic moment. This is the result
 stated generally in the text; but a marginal note and curve
 in the copy in my possession show that the magnetic moment
 did not increase continuously as the annealing went on, but
 increased at first, then diminished, then again increased—
 thus passing a maximum when the annealing temperature was
about 150°C., and a minimum when the temperature was
about 230°C.
    Another set of results given in this paper is a series of
 magnetic moments for bars of the same steel tempered in oil,
 the temperature of which was varied so that the bars should
 be suddenly cooled only to the same temperature as that to
 which in the first set they were heated in the annealing pro
 cess. The results in this second set show precisely the same
characteristics as those of the first set, only that the maximum
and minimum points are much more pronounced.
    The curves given by Mr. T. Gray indicate an interesting
peculiarity which does not seem to have been noticed by
any previous observer, inasmuch as they show that the
minimum point may be preceded by a maximum, the effects
of annealing depending greatly on the kind of steel used.
The steel used by Gray was almost a pure charcoal steel,
whereas that used by Barus and Strouhal was of the kind
known as “English silver steel; ” that is to say, of a kind
similar to that which I have been experimenting on.
    Mr. Gray in his paper refers very briefly to some experi
ments on other steels, chiefly, it would appear, for the purpose
of showing how very different results may be expected from
different specimens. In one set, which took an average mag
netic moment of about 50 per gramme, the magnetic moment
was slightly diminished by hardening; whilst in another set
the direct opposite was arrived at in a very marked manner,
showing how very much the effect of annealing depends on
metallic impurities in the steel. The diminution of the mag

        Changing the Magnetic Moments of Steel Magnets. 295
netic moment of one of his specimens by annealing, Mr. Gray
tells me, he believes to be due to the known presence of
manganese in it.
   The behaviour, however, of alloys in the annealing and
magnetic retentiveness of steel magnets needs further eluci
dation before anything very definite can be said on the subject.
The effects of small quantities of tungsten in increasing the
magnetic retentiveness of steel are well known; whereas the
recent experiments of Dr. J. Hopkinson, J. T. Bottomley,
and others tend to show that a very moderate quantity of
maganese in steel almost totally destroys, not only the mag
netic retentiveness, but even the magnetic susceptibility.
   With respect to the “silver steel,” of which my magnets
are made, I am in doubt as to whether it really contains silver.
 Some well-known steelmakers say it is only a trade name.
    In preparing the magnets, great care was taken to have
them made straight, and the ends made as accurately as pos
sible at right £      to their length. In tempering them they
were put into an iron tube having one end closed, and the
whole put into a brisk coal fire and left there till they attained
a bright red heat. The tube, with the magnets inside, was
then taken out, and, with the open end temporarily closed by
a glass plate, was held vertically above a vessel of water at a
 temperature of 15° C. and about 20 inches deep. The glass
 cover was then quickly withdrawn, and the magnets were
allowed to drop perpendicularly into the water, thus making
them all glass-hard.
    A greater number of magnets than were actually required
 were treated in this manner, and only the straightest and most
 uniform in temper were chosen for the experiments. This
 was the method employed in tempering all the glass-hard
 magnets, and was adopted mainly in order to obtain an indi
 cation of what kind of results were to be expected. In sub
 sequent experiments, however, a method somewhat similar to
 that used by T. Gray and Barus will be employed. The two
 exceptions to glass-hardness already referred to (those tem
 pered blue and yellow) were first tempered glass-hard along
 with the others; they were then laid on the top of a hot
 metallic plate, where they were allowed to remain till they
 £ the oxide tints characteristic of those tempers.
    The magnets were all magnetized to saturation by placing
 them between the poles of a large Ruhmkorff electromagnet,
 excited by a dynamo giving a potential of between 80 and 90
 volts. During the process of magnetizing, the magnets were
 reversed several times between the poles of the electromagnet
 and then finally magnetized. This was done in every case

296       Mr. W. Brown on the Effects of Percussion in
for the first set of six magnets, when they were remagnetized
after a series of observations.
   In order to obtain the deflections for calculating the mag
netic moments, the apparatus used consisted of a lamp and
scale, a magnetometer, and a cradle for holding the magnets.
The magnetometer was of the ordinary Bottomley type, con
sisting of a small circular mirror, with two short magnetic
needles attached to the back of it, and suspended by a single
torsionless silk fibre, the whole being enclosed in a slot cut in
a pyramidal block of wood, and the slot covered by a plate of
thin glass. On the base of this pyramid were fixed three
conical feet, which fitted accurately into the conical hole,
groove, and plane arrangement of Sir William Thomson. The
hole and groove were cut out of a piece of thick plate glass,
which was firmly fixed to the table in a position where the
horizontal component of the Earth's magnetic force was
known. When the magnetometer was put in position, the
mirror and the attached needles of course placed themselves
in the magnetic meridian.
    Immediately to the west of the magnetometer, at a distance
of 40 centim., was placed a cradle for holding the magnets
during the deflection observations. The base of this cradle
was made on the same geometrical principle as that of the
magnetometer, and was so arranged that the magnet could be
reversed relatively to the magnetometer, without touching the
magnet by hand. This cradle, I may say, was made and used
by Mr. Gray in his recent determination of the Earth's hori
zontal magnetic force; the whole arrangement is fully
described and illustrated by a drawing in his paper".
    To the east of the magnetometer, at a distance of 129 centim,
was a glass scale divided to millimetres, and having a lamp
  laced immediately behind it. The deflection of the spot of
 ight from the lamp when reflected by the mirror of the mag
netometer upon the scale could be read to 'o of a millimetre,
by means of the shadow cast by a fine wire stretched across
the orifice in the side of the copper funnel of the lamp.
    The magnet and magnetometer being placed in position,
the magnetic moment of the magnet,            ''   is given by the

               needle.
    In order to test the constancy of the magnetic field during
the experiments, the deflections given by a standard magnet
were occasionally taken.
    The method employed to obtain the effects of percussion,
with the least possible amount of handling of the magnets,
was as follows:—A series of glass tubes, wide enough inside
to allow the magnets to fall through them freely, were fixed
on a long narrow board by means of brass clamps, which were
just loose enough to allow the tubes to slip easily through them.
This was for the purpose of raising the tube vertically in order
to take the magnet out after falling through it. A thick shelf
was firmly fixed at one end of this board and a thick plate of
glass fastened to it. The magnets were held in the hand and
allowed to fall vertically through the tube upon the glass plate
at the bottom, and always £ the true north end of the
magnet downwards.
    A few trial experiments were made in letting the magnets
 fall through a height of a half metre and one metre respec
tively; but to give uniformity in the results, the 1.5 metre
hei # was adopted throughout.
    £ plan of experimenting was as follows:—The magnets
 were magnetized and laid aside undisturbed for the periods of
 time specified in Table I. One of them was then taken, and
 the deflection for calculating its magnetic moment was ob
 served. It was then allowed to fall once through the height
 of 1.5 metre, and the deflection again taken. It was then let
 fall three times in succession through the same height, and the
 deflection again taken. Each magnet in turn was put through
 the same series of operations.
    The percentage loss in the magnetic moment due to the
 one fall, and that due to the three falls, and, finally, that due
 to the whole four falls, were all calculated, and are shown for
 the fourteen glass-hard magnets in Table II.
    In Table I, the percentage loss due to the four falls alone
 is given. The magnets specified in Table II. had been lying
 aside for a period of six months after being magnetized, and
 before they were experimented on.

        By inspection of Table I., we see that in the case of the
    two glass-hard magnets the percentage loss diminishes the
    longer they are left undisturbed before they are subjected to
    percussion; it would also appear that the smaller the dimen
    sion ratio the greater is the loss.
        The other four magnets, so far as the experiments go,
    appear to show that the                  £         the amount of annealing the
    greater is the loss; the observations, however, have not been

                   Notices respecting New Books.                 299
sufficiently extended to allow any detailed deductions to be
made; and the effects of annealing will form one of the chief
parts of subsequent investigations.
    From Table II. it will be seen that the greater part of the
magnetism has been shaken out by the first fall; this holds
throughout, except in the case of magnet No. 10. I am in
clined to think that this is due to an error in placing the magnet
in position; in this case also the percentage loss was calcu
lated from a diminished deflection of one scale-division only.

Annual Companion to the ‘Observatory, a Monthly Review of Astro
   nomy. Edited by E. W. MAUNDER, F.R.A.S., A. M. W. Down
   ING, M.A., F.R.A.S., and T. LEwis, F.R.A.S. London : Taylor
   and Francis. 1887.
OU."     contemporary ‘The Observatory, which was started, some
       ten years ago, by the present Astronomer Royal, to supply a
want then very greatly felt, used to supply its readers every month
with an Astronomical Ephemeris.
   This Ephemeris was useless to its many subscribers in the
Colonies and other distant parts of the world.        Partly for this
reason, and partly in order to extend the scope of the work, the
Editors resolved to prepare all the information desirable more than
a year in advance, and this they have carried out in the ‘Companion
to the Observatory.     The idea suggested itself to them towards
the end of 1885, and, acting upon it at once, the ‘Companion’ for
1886 appeared in time. The present number, for 1887, is so com
plete, so well arranged, and so admirably suited to the wants of the
practical Astronomer, that it is difficult to suggest any improve
ment to it.
   It begins with a short Introduction, stating the sources whence
the Ephemerides have been derived, frequently such as are not
generally available to the English reader; such as the Annuaire du
Bureau des Longitudes, the American Nautical Almanac, the
Astronomische Nachrichten, &c.
   The first part of the work is a Calendar, giving for every day the
times of rising, culminating, and setting of the Sun and Moon;
the Equation of Time, in the form of Mean Time at Apparent
Noon; the Sidereal Time at Mean Noon; the fraction of the year
elapsed since January 1; the quarterings of the Moon; and the
principal showers of Shooting-stars.
   Next follow the places, diameters, times of rising, culminating,
and setting of the major Planets; particulars of Eclipses and of
Occultations of fixed Stars by the Moon, visible at Greenwich, in
 which a better mode of reckoning the angles is introduced. The
 phenomena of Jupiter's Satellites are given in extenso from the

   300                Notices respecting New Books.
   ‘Nautical Almanac, than which no better exist. They are founded
   on Damoiseau's Tables, with the modifications introduced by Adams
   and Woolhouse.
     The complete Ephemerides of the Satellites of Saturn, Uranus,
   and Neptune, together with the diagrams of their orbits, will be
  duly appreciated by the now sufficiently numerous possessors of
  large telescopes. For Physical observations of the Sun, we are
  given the positions of the Sun's axis, and the latitude and longitude
  of the centre of disk for every fifth day of the year. For Jupiter,
  the time is given of every third passage of the famous Red Spot
  over the central meridian of the planet.
     Stars with remarkable spectra are treated at some length, and
  the information in regard to Variable Stars is more complete than
  exists anywhere else in the English language. The work closes
  with a table of the Selenographical Latitudes and Longitudes of 100
  lunar formations.
     In this work the public is supplied, at a merely nominal cost,
  with a vast amount of accurate, well chosen, and well arranged
  information, some of which is original. Even the professional
  Astronomer will frequently turn to its pages from mere conve
  nience, while to the amateur it is almost indispensable. We can
  only hope that the care and judgment displayed in its compilation
  will be appreciated by the numerous class for whom it is intended.
 A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure Mathematics; containing
    Propositions, Formulae, and Methods of Analysis, with abridged
    Demonstrations. By G. S. CARR, M.A. London: Francis
    Hodgson, 1886; pp. xxxviii.4936+285 diagrams.
 THOUGH the first sections of this book were issued in 1880, the
 compilation of it commenced about twenty years ago, many of
 the abbreviated methods and mnemonic rules having been drawn
 up for the use of the author's pupils.              -
    The completed work admirably serves the object Mr. Carr set
 before himself, viz. that of presenting in a moderate compass the
fundamental theorems, formulae, and processes in the chief branches
of Pure Mathematics. We hope he will be encouraged by the
reception accorded to the present venture to complete his original
plan, and supplement this work by a similar one on Applied Mathe
matics. We will let the author speak as to his intentions. “The
work is intended, in the first place, to follow and supplement the
use of the ordinary textbooks, and it is arranged with the view of
assisting the student in the task of revision of book-work. To
this end I have, in many cases, merely indicated the salient points
of a demonstration, or merely referred to the theorems by which
the proposition is proved. I am convinced that it is more bene
ficial to the student to recall demonstrations with such aids than
to read and re-read them. Let them be read once but recalled
often. . . . In the second place, I venture to hope that the work
may prove useful to advanced students as an aide-mémoire and

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.             301
 book of reference. The boundary of mathematical science forms,
 year by year, an everwidening circle, and the advantage of having
 at hand some condensed statement of results becomes more and
 more evident. To the original investigator occupied with abstruse
 researches in some one of the many branches of Mathematics, a
 work which gathers together synoptically the leading propositions
 in all, may not therefore prove unacceptable.” In an undertaking
 of such magnitude it would not be difficult to detect faults, but
these are in the main corrected by the lists of Errata; and some
 others, as the unfortunate wrong numbering of a limited number
 of sections in Section viii., which is indicated on p. 473, are allowed
for in the Index. Every subject that can be classed under the
 head of Pure Mathematics, with the exception perhaps of Quater
nions, appears to us to have been carefully treated on the author's
lines. A little difficulty is at first experienced in working with
such a vast Index; but it will be found with use that this part is
as carefully done as the rest of the work. To many of our readers
a most useful part will be found to be comprised in that portion
which is represented by the closing words of the titlepage,
“Supplemented by an Index to the Papers on Pure Mathematics
which are to be found in the principal Journals and Transactions
of learned Societies, both English and Foreign, of the present
Century.” These are thirty-two in number, are tabulated with
great care, and references to the British Museum Catalogue are
appended. This is such a valuable feature of the book that we
should like to see the list considerably extended, so as to include for
instance references to our own columns, in which from time to time
most important articles on Pure Mathematics have been furnished
by Cayley, Sylvester, Boole, and others of our leading men.
   The typography, arrangement of text, colour of paper, and
figures leave little, or we would rather say nothing, to be desired,
for readers can consult the book with comfort under almost any
light.

ON THE ACTION OF THE DISCHARGE OF ELECTRICITY OF HIGH
   POTENTIAL ON SOLID PARTICLES SUSPENDED IN THE AIR.                BY
   A. VON OBERMAYER AND M. VON PICHLER.
THE purification of air from dust by electrical discharges has been
       observed by Aitken (“Nature, vol. xxviii. p. 322), and Lodge
(Phil. Mag. [5] xvii. p. 214). The authors have examined the dis
charges of a double-influence machine in turpentine-smoke; this
was contained in a glass tube, 11 centim in diameter and 111 cen
tim. in length, provided with brass mounts. The discharge took
place between rods provided with combs at the ends, and which
were supported in insulated mounts nearly parallel to the axis of
the tube. The smoke was deposited in large flakes near the combs
in less than a second. The spark of an induction-coil and of a

302                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
magneto-electrical machine acted more slowly. In like manner,
when the brush-discharge was produced from sixteen points in the
chimney-pipe of a stove towards the sides, the smoke was almost
completely deposited, especially if the points were connected with
the negative, and the pipe with the positive electrode of the ma
chine; and two double induction-machines connected together were
used.
   Kundt's dust-circles were also obtained, when the points and
the plate were connected with the poles of an induction-machine,
and the discharge continued for some time. They are equal for
the two electricities. If the metal disk is not dusted with sulphur
or lycopodium until the discharge takes place, dust-rings are formed
instead of dust-circles. Here also the rings are equal, whether the
point is positive or negative. If the point is very close, dust
circles appear surrounded by an annular surface almost entirely
free from dust, and again surrounded by slight dust near the edge
of the plate.
   With a positive plate 215 millim. in diameter, with a fine nega
tive point at a distances, the magnitude of the rings is as follows
(D, and D, being the outer and inner diameter of the dust-circle or
dust-rings, D that of the dusted surface:–
   8   . . . . . .   5     10     15    20     30      45    60 millim.

   D . . . . . . 70       100    130   160         >215 mm.
   The explanation of the various figures is ascribed by the authors
to the electrification of the badly-conducting particles of dust
which lie on the plate, and which in consequence adhere to the
plate as in Kundt's figures. If to this is added the electrical aura,
it blows the particles away from the middle and lodges them
towards the edge, where they adhere in consequence of permanent
electrification.
   If, instead of metal plates, vertical networks of 1 centim. width
 of mesh are used, a horizontal point being brought to within a dis
 tance of 7 centim., while the net and the point are connected with
 the conductors of two influence-machines connected with each
 other, and if sulphur-powder is dusted on the net while the brush
 discharge takes place from a negative point, a dust-ring is formed of
 38 centim. external and 15 centim. internal diameter. If the powder
 blown through the net is caught on a horizontal paper, a tongue
 about 15 centim. in width appears free from dust, to which fol
 low zones on each side of tolerably dense powder. With a positive
 point the same result is obtained, except that the dust-free zone is
 not so distinct. Lycopodium flies further away.
    If a fine point, and a wire gauze of 1 centim. width of mesh, is
 placed at a distances parallel in the electrodes of an induction
 machine, and these latter are adjusted at a distance D so that
 sparks alternately pass between the electrodes, and brush-discharges
 take place from the point, the following values were obtained for

   The equivalent striking distances D approach a limit as sincreases;
they increase more rapidly than the corresponding potentials.
   In the discharge of electricity from points towards a wire gauze,
the velocity of the electrical aura could be determined by means of
an anemometer placed behind the wire gauze.
   When the point was at a distance s = 7 centim. between the
point and the wire gauze, the following velocities, in metres and
seconds, were obtained:—

   Hence, by means of the electrical aura, fine particles of dust can
be carried to great distances.—Wiener Berichte, xciii. p. 408(1886);

     ON A SIMPLE AND CONVENIENT FORM OF WATER-BATTERY.
                             BY HENRY A. ROWLAND.
    For some time I have had in use in my laboratory a most simple,
 convenient, and cheap form of water-battery, whose design has
 been in one of my note-books for at least fifteen years. It has
proved so useful that I give below a description for the use of other
physicists.
    Strips of zinc and copper, each two inches wide, are soldered
 together along their edges so as to make a combined strip of a little
less than four inches wide, allowing for the overlapping. It is
 then cut by shears into pieces about one fourth of an inch wide,
each composed of half zinc and half copper.
    A plate of glass, very thick and a foot or less square, is heated
and coated with shellac about an eighth of an inch thick. The
 strips of copper and zinc are bent into the shape of the letter U,
 with the branches about one fourth of an inch apart, and are
heated and stuck to the shellac in rows, the soldered portion being
 fixed in the shellac, and the two branches standing up in the air, so
that the zinc of one piece comes within one sixteenth of an inch of
the copper of the next one. A row of ten inches long will thus
contain about thirty elements. The rows can be about one eighth
of an inch apart, and therefore in a space ten inches square nearly
800 elements can be placed. The plate is then warmed carefully
so as not to crack, and a mixture of beeswax and resin, which melts
more easily than shellac, is then poured on the plate to a depth of
half an inch to hold the elements in place. A frame of wood
is made around the back of the plate with a ring screwed to the
centre, so that the whole can be hung up with the zinc and copper
elements below.
   When required for use, lower so as to dip the tips of the ele

304           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
ments into a pan of water and hang up again. The space between
the elements being I's inch, will hold a drop of water which will
not evaporate for possibly an hour. Thus the battery is in opera
tion in a minute, and is perfectly insulated by the glass and cement.
  This is the form I have used; but the strips might better be
soldered face to face along one edge, cut up and then opened.—

        ON THE GALVANIC POLARIZATION OF ALUMINIUM.
                          BY DR. F. STREINZ.
   Plates of aluminium were investigated by a method described in
Wiedemann's Annalen, vol. xxix. p. 181, and modified by openin
and closing the polarizing-current by a tuning-fork instead of by the
polarization-current itself. Phenomena were thereby observed
which were very surprising.
   The original difference of potential between amalgamated zinc in
a concentrated solution of zinc sulphate, and the bright metallic
aluminium plates of the voltameter, amounted to 0.32 volt.
   If, now, the latter were polarized, and first one and then the
other plate compared with the zinc plate at the electrometer, it
was found that the difference of potential of the plate charged with
oxygen increased within very wide limits with the electromotive
force of the polarizing-cell, while the plate charged with hydrogen
at small electromotive forces showed none, or only a very small
polarization; but at considerable electromotive forces, a difference
of potential opposite in direction to ordinary hydrogen polarization.
   A few of the numbers found are collated in proof of this. For
the two polarizations (Zn/Al-HQ and Zn/Al-HH.), fifteen minutes
after alternate closing and opening of the primary current by the
tuning-fork, there was found for the electromotive forces of
                                    Zn/Al-HO.        Zn/Al-HH.
        1  Daniell   .... ....   .. 1-12 volt.       0-31 Volt.

       11  Daniells  .... ....   .. 7:50   ,         0.76 ,
   If the primary current was permanently open, the high values
for oxygen polarization at once fell considerably, while the values
for hydrogen polarization usually changed but little. It may still be
observed that the disengagement of gas at the aluminium elec
trodes, even when the primary current has great electromotive
force, is very small compared with that observed in other metals.
The cause of this phenomenon is obviously to be sought in the
great opposing force of oxygen polarization. To confirm this,
measurements of the intensity in the primary current were made.
On this, and on the further results of the investigations, a report
will be made.—Kaiserl. Akad. der Wiss, in Wien, December 16,
1886.

PR'                   TAITt, by making a number of special
       assumptions, has given a very exact proof of Avogadro's
Law–or, rather, of the proposition that in the case of the
heat-equilibrium of two mixed gases the mean potential
energy of the molecules must be equal. Prof. Tait does not
appear to me, however, to have given the least proof that the
special assumptions which he makes as the basis of this pro
position are necessary, or even that the more general pro
positions stated by myself t and Maxwell § are incorrect.
   I believe that in my calculations I have stated precisely
the assumptions made, and have invariably drawn the logical
conclusions from them , and therefore that I have not
deserved the reproach which Prof. Tait makes, that they are
“rather of the nature of playing with symbols than of reason
ing by consecutive steps,” which must also apply to the just
mentioned treatise of Maxwell, when he accepts and further
develops the propositions of mine upon which Prof. Tait throws
doubt. The contradiction of these propositions by certain expe
rimental facts seems to me to have resulted only from too great

306 Prof. L. Boltzmann on the Assumptions necessary
a generalization thereof. We must remember that analysis
can deal only with systems more or less analogous to the
molecules of nature, but not with the molecules themselves.
   The behaviour of hot bodies is certainly influenced by heat
radiation, probably also by movements of electricity &c.—
conditions which have not been taken into account by me,
nor in any other mechanical theory of heat. Absolute agree
ment with facts cannot therefore be expected. It is therefore
only possible to consider (1) whether the propositions stated
really follow logically from the assumptions made, and
(2) whether the analogy between the properties of the
system considered and those of hot bodies undoubtedly exists.
    This analogy can only be made perfectly clear by reference
to all my papers, and in particular to those on the second law
of Thermodynamics.
    Although Mr. Burbury" has made well-founded objections
to the propositions of Prof. Tait, it appears to me desirable to
discuss still more rigorously the question, Which of Prof.
Tait's assumptions are really necessary to the proof? In doing
this I will follow Prof. Tait's method, and at first will treat
only some special cases, in order not to become unintelligible
by too great a generalization. Although he does not expressly
say so, Prof. Tait yet implicitly assumes that two molecules
 upon impact behave like elastic spheres. For under any other
 law of mutual action Prof. Tait's equations on p. 346 would
 only hold good in case the quantities which he denotes by u
and v were the components in the direction of the apsides; and
the calculations on p. 347 would then not be applicable to
these equations. I will make the same assumption, and use
the notation of my Theory of Gaseous Diffusion, part i.f
    I have there treated the impact of two elastic balls as
 #'           as possible with reference to the Theory of Gases.
   he figures and formulae are certainly a little copious, but
 are generally applicable, and, as I believe, also clear, when
 once their meaning has been comprehended.
    Let two elastic spheres (molecules) of masses m and M
 impinge upon each other. Let v = Qv and W =QV be their
 velocities before impact (see fig. 1), and v=Qv' and W=QV"
 their velocities after impact, 8 the sum of radii of the spheres,
 r=vV their relative velocity before impact, and suppose their
 relative velocity after impact to have the direction r'=v'W'.
 Let QC be the line of centre of the spheres at the moment of
 impact.               -

   The right-hand side agrees completely with the expression
which Prof. Tait finds on p. 346 for #2 (u”—u"), since,
according to equation (20) of my treatise, the quantity which
Prof. Tait denotes by u has the value v(–ga + 'yso), where
u-v is the projection of r on QC, which is equal to ra. Now
let there be very many molecules of mass m (molecules of the
first kind), as : of those of mass M (molecules of the second
kind), uniformly mixed in a space and uniformly distributive
with reference to the directions of their velocities.      Of all
possible impacts which in general may occur, we will first
select only those for which the variables v, W, T, S, O lie
between the infinitely close limits,
      v and v+dv, V and W+dV, T and T+dT,                     (2)

   In fig 1 a sphere of radius S, supposed concentric with
one of the molecules of mass M, is drawn. All straight lines
are drawn dotted from their intersections with the surface of
this sphere. The arcs are arcs of great circles of this sphere.
The molecules of mass m fly    '"      this sphere, so that their
centres describe the straight line AC relative to the first
molecule which is parallel to v V and QR. At the point C
the centres are reflected in the direction CB, which is parallel
to v'V and QR'. The relative motion before impact, with
which alone we are concerned, remains unaltered if we imagine
the molecules of mass m at rest and the sphere drawn in fig. 1
moving with the velocity r=vV in direction opposite to QR.
If its surface be divided by a plane passing through its centre
at right angles to QR, then, with our last-mentioned con
ception of relative motion, the preceding half-sphere would,
in unit time, pass through a space £ by two half-spheres
and a cylindrical surface of volume w8°r. Of this whole
space a small portion is now to be cut out, as follows:—QC
is that radius of the sphere which is parallel to the direction
of the line of centres. Whilst the point C is so moved on the
surface of the sphere that Sincreases by the amount dS without
change of direction of QR, C describes a linear element of
length 8dS. If, on the other hand, we move C so that O
increases by dO, C describes a linear element of length 8sdO.
These two determine an element of area on the surface of the
sphere of area 6's dSd0. This is inclined at an angle S to the
direction of r. Since the half-sphere moves with the velocity
r in the direction –QR, this element of surface moves through
a prism of volume r8’so dSd0. So soon as the centre of a

 molecule of the first kind lies within this prism, it impinges in
 the manner described upon a molecule of the second kind.
     Of all molecules of the first kind lying within this prism,
 we have to consider only those whose velocities lie between
 the limits v and v+dv, and which are moving in directions
 making angles with the direction of V which lie between
 the limits T and T+dT.          If there are in the unit volume
 4tv f(v)dv molecules of the first kind which fulfil the first
 condition, then, in the above-described prism, there are
                     2Tv f(v)r8’rsa. dvdSdT dO
 molecules of the first kind which also satisfy the second con
dition.
    Let us further suppose that in the unit volume there are
4TV*F(V)dW molecules of the second kind whose velocities
 lie between the limits V and V+dV. Then, by multiplying
 the above expression by this factor, the following expression
 for the total number of impacts which occur in unit time in
 unit volume between a molecule of the first kind and a
 molecule of the second kind, so that the conditions (2) are
 fulfilled,

is obtained.
    In order to obtain from this the number Z of all the
impacts which may occur altogether in the unit volume in
unit time between a molecule of the first kind and one of the
second kind, we have to integrate with reference to O from zero
to 27, with reference to T from zero to T, with reference to S
                  T          -

    J =|D dZ is the energy which is brought by all these
impacts to molecules of the first kind. If we integrate the
expression D dZ first with reference to O and S, we obtain

The quotient of the two expressions may be considered to be
the energy which, on the average, is transferred from mole
cules of the first kind to molecules of the second kind, when

the magnitudes of the velocities v and W and their angle T
are given. This quotient is

   This agrees exactly with the first expression for li-li,
which Stefan" finds in his treatise on the dynamical theory
of the diffusion of gases towards the end of the second part,
and which, after correction of some printer's errors, is as
follows:–

and
                          V*=v°4-r” +2erg.
   But the first conclusions of Stefan’s would apply only
where the molecules act upon each other with a force in
versely proportional to the fifth power of the distance. In
this case the factor r disappears from the expression dZ, and
on further integration in respect of dT the terms
                           4:14:2 +3/1/2 + <122
disappear.
   With elastic spheres, on the other hand, the impacts are so
much the more probable the greater the relative velocity r ;
therefore, for each of the products wit, yiy2, 2122, positive
values are more probable than negative values, and we cannot
therefore suppose

    In the latter case V and v must be exchanged. If, there
fore, the functions f and F are chosen quite arbitrarily,
WDaz will in general       not disappear if the molecules of the
first and second kinds have equal energy. In other words,
even though the molecules of the first and second kinds have
equal energy, yet, if f and F are chosen arbitrarily, energy
may at first be transferred from molecules of the first kind
to molecules of the second kind, or vice versá. It would be
transferred to them continuously if by any external action
the originally chosen values of the functions f and F were
maintained constant.
    If, for example, with uniform distribution in space and
equal probability of all directions of velocity, the molecules of
the first kind had all the same velocity v, the second kind all
 the same velocity W = v, then there would be at first no
 transference of energy to the molecules of the first kind by
 the molecules of the second kind if expression (5) should
 disappear. If we put the positive quantities

     If m is only a little larger than M, say m = M(1 + e), then
 this gives nearly

 for m=4M, we have
                        MV*= mv (1:21 ...).
     If m is very much greater than M, we have nearly
                        MV*=#mv2.
     The condition that, on the average, no energy shall be
 communicated in the first moment to the molecules of the first
 order, requires then that the molecules of smaller mass should
  have greater energy than the others. But it must be observed
  that this only holds good for the first moment; the velocities
  even of the molecules of the first kind immediately become
  different amongst themselves as the result of impacts, and so

312    Prof. L. Boltzmann on the Assumptions necessary
also those of the molecules of the second order; so that
the conditions at once become completely altered.
   If we assume Maxwell's law of distribution of velocities, by
putting f(r)=Ae", F(V)=Be" we find, by precisely the
same calculation as that of Prof. Tait, that there is no exchange
of energy between the molecules of the first kind and those of
the second, if the mean energy of both is the same—which,
 (following Prof. Tait) we will call Maxwell's Theorem.
   So far all Prof. Tait's conclusions are, without doubt, cor
rect. But it does not yet follow from this that the existence
of Maxwell's law of distribution must be assumed in order to
prove Maxwell's theorem. It may rather be shown that,
whatever the masses and ratio of diameters may be, if only the
molecules of the first order come generally into collision with
those of the second order, then Maxwell's distribution of velo
cities is spontaneously brought about both amongst the former
and also amongst the latter molecules.
   In this it is not even necessary to assume that the molecules
of the first order are generally in collision amongst themselves,
nor that the molecules of the second order are in collision
amongst themselves. The only assumptions are: that both
the molecules of the first and also those of the second order
are uniformly distributed over the whole space; that through
out they behave in the same way in all directions; and that the
duration of the impact is short in comparison with the time
between two impacts. I have given” the proof of this in my
paper on the Thermal Equilibrium of Gases acted on by Ex
ternal Forces, at the conclusion of § 1 ; but as I have there
only briefly indicated the mode of calculation and have only
given the result, Prof. Tait has probably quite overlooked the
passage, and I will be more explicit on the present occasion.
   Let the molecules of the first and second kinds of gas be at
the beginning of the time (t=0) uniformly distributed in a
space enclosed by rigid perfectly elastic walls; but let the
distribution of energy among them be altogether arbitrary.
Exactly as before, let
                           4tv f(v, o) dv
be the number of molecules of the first kind of gas in the unit
volume whose velocities lie between the limits
                            v and v+dv. . . . . . . (6)
In exactly the same way, let 4TV*F(V, o) dV be the number
of molecules whose velocities lie between
                            V and V+dV.             . . . . . (7)

Since no direction in space, and also no element of volume,
has any advantage over another, we may assume that the dis
tribution of energy also remains uniform for all succeeding
time. But in general this is prevented by the collisions
which occur.     At the time t, let there be in the unit volume
4tv f(v, t) du molecules of the first kind of gas whose velocities
lie between the limits (6), F(v, t) having a similar signifi
cation.
   Evidently the problem is conceived in its utmost generality
if we imagine f(v, 0) and F(V, o) having any given values,
and determine the changes of these functions in course of
time. Evidently we have first of all to determine the increase
                     of (v, t)       oF(V, t)
which the functions f and F undergo, whilst the time increases
from t to t+6. During the element of time 6, let n molecules
in the unit volume out of the 4tv f(v, t) du molecules of the
first kind therein contained, whose energies lie between the
limits (6), enter into collision with other molecules of the first
kind, and N molecules with those of the second kind. Let
us imagine 6 so chosen that n and N, although large numbers,
are yet small in comparison with 47t" f(v, t) dv.
   Since the number of those molecules for which the velocities
after impact also lie between the limits (6), or for which the
velocity of the second impinging molecule lies between the
same limits, is of an order higher only by an infinitely small
amount, we may assume that the velocities of all these n mo
lecules and also of the N molecules after lapse of the time 6,
no longer lie between the limits (6). n + N is therefore the
number of those molecules whose velocities were at the be
ginning of the time 6 between those limits, but at the end of
that time were not between the same limits.
   But during the time 6, other molecules whose velocities
were not previously between the limits (6), in consequence of
impacts acquire a velocity lying between these limits. Let,
then, p molecules of the first kind acquire a velocity lying
between these limits by impacts with other molecules of the
first kind, and P molecules of the first kind by impacts with
molecules of the second kind.     Then

   The kind and mode of impact is completely determined by
the values of the variables v, W, T, S, and O. The magnitudes
v' and W of the velocities of both molecules after impact, their
angle T'as well as the angle O' which the plane RQR of the
two relative velocities makes with the plane v'Q'V' of the two
absolute velocities v and W after the impact, may therefore
be expressed as functions of v, W, T, S, and O. For all impacts
for which the latter variables lie between the limits (2),
v', W, T', S', and O' will also lie between certain infinitely
close limits, which we may denote by

     T" and T' +dT, O' and O' + d0', S and S--dS. . (10)
   The angle S has the same meaning before and after impact,
and is therefore after impact also included within the limits S
and S + dS. But it is now clear that each impact may also
be taken in inverted order. If, therefore, inversely the values
of the variables before impact lay between the limits (10),
then they would also after impact lie between the limits (2).

has not clearly shown its truth.
   I have proved this proposition more fully, and obtained a
similar one for polyatomic molecules; on which account I
have also assumed it in my treatise on the thermal equilibrium
of gases upon which external forces act. The most general
proposition, in which all similar propositions are included, is
shown in Maxwell’s paper “On Boltzmann's Theorem.”f
But since all the necessary formulae are now at our disposal,
I will here verify equation (15) by direct calculation of the
functional determinants.
    If we first of all introduce, instead of V and T, the variables
r and G, we obtain V*dWT dT=*drydC, as is geometrically
evident.     So also
                        W^dVT/dT =r"dry/d6'.
 Since r is not altered by impact, we introduce, instead of dv,
dG, d0, the differentials of the three variables,

     For the condition of equilibrium of energy, f and F and
 also E must therefore be independent of the time; we must
 therefore have       '=0. But we see at once that the last-found
 integral for # represents a sum of infinitely small members,
 which are all negative or at most equal to zero; for if
 f'f''—ff is positive the factor           # is negative,

 versá.
     Therefore      a can only vanish when each of these members
  itself vanishes.
     If the molecules of the first kind were very small in
  comparison with those of the second kind, then would
  x=0, A=8. We may assume, still more generally, that
  the molecules of the first kind are perfectly permeable for
  each other, and so also those of the second kind for each
  other, and that each of the latter molecules only is surrounded
  by a sphere of radius 8, at which the centres of the molecules
   of the first kind are reflected like infinitely small elastic
   spheres; in the latter case we should have A=N=0. As
   soon as 8 differs from zero, f"Fi' must always be equal to
  fF, for all values of the variables under the functional sign.
      Since v, V, and v are quite independent, and only W's
   determined by the equation of energy, we find, without
   difficulty,
                           f= A-",      F=Be-"MV".
   But, in consequence of the impact of molecules of the first
   kind with those of the second, there will therefore be pro
   duced Maxwell’s distribution of velocities and equality of mean
   energy amongst all the molecules. I take the present oppor
    tunity of remarking that I do not understand how gravitation

     320 Prof. L. Boltzmann on the Assumptions necessary
     is to be explained if we ascribe to Lesage's ultramundane
     particles the properties of gaseous molecules; for, whilst the
     sun protects the earth from certain impacts, it reflects other
     particles towards the earth which would not otherwise have
     reached it. Only, if the particles are not reflected by the
     earth and sun, but absorbed or perhaps reflected with a loss
     of energy, would attraction be produced between the sun and
     the earth.
        I have carried out calculations similar to the above in my
     treatise, “Further Studies on the Thermal Equilibrium of
     Gaseous Molecules,”* for a single kind of molecules after a
     somewhat different method, which, I believe, is characterized
     by great clearness; and I venture to recommend to the
     reader who is so disposed a perusal of the first section of this
     treatise.
        We can easily apply the method there described to a mixture
     of two kinds of gas. For the first of these let Vic. p(x, t)d:
     be the number of molecules in the unit volume whose energy
     at the time t lies between the limits w and v+dv.                     Let
     f(x, t) have a similar meaning for the second kind of gas.               I
     have then used
                   v.cxd5(x, t) dep(X, t) dxy(x, X, c)do'
     to express the number of impacts which occur in unit time
     and volume between two molecules of the first kind, so that
     before impact their energies shall lie between the limits
     w and v+dv, X and X--dX, whilst after impact that of the
     one molecule lies between a' and a' + da:'.
        By variable distribution of conditions we are always to
     understand the number of impacts during a very short time
     divided by that time; y has a similar meaning for the impacts
     of the molecules of the first kind with those of the second
     kind.
        Then we easily convince ourselves that

   Before we substitute the above values in equation (24),
we have still to establish two properties of the functions \",
V, and X. In the functions N' ' Y both impinging mole
cules play the same part. It is then just as probable that
before impact the energy of the first should lie between v
and v+dv, that of the second beween X and X-dX, and,
after impact that of the first between a' and v'--da', as that
inversely before impact the energy of the first molecule should
lie between X and X+d K, that of the second molecule between
w and v+dv, and after impact that of the second between a'
and x'+da'.    Therefore that of the first lies between c + X-w'
and v+X-a'--dw'. Or, in algebraic language,
             Wr(r, X, a ') = Y(X, w, x + X-a'), . . . (25)
             Y(X, w, X)=\V(x, X, r + X-X). . . (26)
   The second property may be obtained as follows. We found
the value (3) for the number dZ of impacts which occur in
unit time and volume between a molecule of the first and one
of the second kind in such a way that the variables v, W, T,
S, O lie between the limits (2). We will first introduce the

where the integration is to be extended over all possible values
with the given a, X, a'. If we interchange the values before
and after impact, we have

   Since according to equation (16) v'y'o'=vyo, and also the
limits of the two double integrals are the same, it follows at
once that
  vaxx(x, X, w)= Va'(w-X-a')x(w', w-X—w', w). (27)
Two analogous equations hold for Wr and Y.
   The further calculations are now purely algebraical trans
formations of definite integrals, and are effected exactly as in
the first section of the already mentioned “Further Studies.”
I will therefore only briefly indicate the method to be adopted.
                                       045(x, t) and oq}(X,

After substituting the values of            Ot
                                                          Ot
equation (24), we have a term with
      lib(w, t). [b(w', t) p(x + X+a', t)-p(x, t) b(X, t)].
   This, with the aid of an equation for V analogous to equa
tion (27), is to be transformed into a similar term, with the
factor -lb(w', t) before the square bracket.         Both are, by
means of equation (25), to be transformed into two terms,
having the factors lab(X, t) and -lp(v--X-w', t) before the

        for the Theoretical Proof of Avogadro's Law.         323
square bracket. The arithmetic mean of the four expressions
thus obtained is to be substituted in equation (24) for the
transformed term.     The term
     ldp(X, t). [q,(X', t)q(t+X-X, t)—q}(X, t)q(x, t)
is to be treated in exactly the same way.
   The remaining terms have now only to be once transformed
by means of equation (27), so that the factors —lp(w', t) and
 –lop(x + X-w', t) appear instead of the factors lb (v, t) and
ldP(X, t); and again the arithmetic mean of the original and
transformed expressions is to be taken. In this way again
# prove: to be a sum of terms of which each vanishes sepa
rately if dt vanishes. Wr and Y may be equal to zero. As soon
as X vanishes for no definite set of variables, that is only so
soon as the molecules of the first kind impinge freely upon
those of the second kind, these terms only vanish separately if
Maxwell's distribution of velocities holds amongst the mole
cules of the first kind as well as those of the second kind.
   The foregoing considerations serve also to completely
establish the still more general proposition which Mr. Burbury
has stated in the place already referred to. In fact, let us
assume that the first kind of gas consists, as above, of very
many molecules (molecules A) which do not impinge amongst
themselves; but that the second kind, on the other hand,
consists but of a single molecule B which comes into collision
with the molecules of the first sort.    Let the time of its free
motion be great in comparison with the time of a collision.
Let the whole be enclosed in a vessel R with rigid elastic
walls.   Let R denote also the volume of the vessel.       There
must at length ensue a stationary condition in which the
molecules of the first kind are, on the average, uniformly dis
tributed through the vessel, and in which any direction is as
probable as another for their velocity. In this condition, let
there be in unit volume 4tv f(v)dy molecules whose velo
cities lie between the limits (6). The molecule B will of
course continually change its velocity; but if we take a very
long time after the commencement of the stationary condition,
then during that time its velocity, on the average, will, with
equal probability, have assumed all possible directions in
space; and the probability that its velocity will lie between
   elimits (7) will be expressed as some function of V, which
we will denote by
                         4TV*RF1(V)dV.
   Let us now imagine a very great number of similar vessels

324 Prof. L. Boltzmann on the Assumptions necessary
R, in each of which let there be an equal number of molecules
A constituted as before, and each with the same distribution
of velocities.   Let 4tv f(v)dv be the number of molecules in
the unit volume whose velocities lie between the limits (6).
   In each of the vessels R let there be a single molecule B
which in each vessel shall be now here, now there, now moving
in this direction, now in that with equal probability. Let the
number of vessels R for which the velocity of the molecule
B shall lie between the limits (7) be 47 NW*RF(W)dV, where
N is the number of all the vessels, of which each has the volume
R. Further, let there be no other impacts than those of the
molecule B in each vessel with the molecules A.          Then evi
dently, at least for the first moment of time,    #  is determined
by the same equation by which          ar: (V, t)
                                            t
                                                  was determined
above, since it is quite indifferent whether all the molecules
B are in the same vessel or whether each is in a separate one.
   But if we now imagine all the N vessels of volume R brought
together into one, we obtain a vessel of volume NR in which
in the unit volume there are 47W*F(V)dW molecules of the
second kind whose velocities lie between the limits (7). In
order that this may not be a proper fraction, but a very large
number, we ' imagine the unit volume to be very small in
comparison with R; that is, R as any large number, which
must, however, be still very small in comparison with N.
   The change in f will no doubt be different in the different
vessels; let us, however, denote by f the arithmetic mean of all
the values off for the different vessels; then again, at least in the
                         of
first moment of time, Ot will be given by the same equation
as before,  8:0         In the former expressions we have of
course A=A=0, since neither the molecules A impinge upon
each other nor the molecules B.      We convince ourselves most
easily of the truth of the above assertion by imagining all the
vessels R united into one large vessel of volume NR, in which
in the unit volume there are 47tW"F(W)dW molecules B whose
velocities lie between the limits (7), and 47/(v)v’dv molecules A
whose velocities lie within the limits (6). We may now sus
pect that in course of time f assumes different values in dif
ferent vessels, and not until the end becomes again equal in all.
This suspicion is most easily removed          '.  supposing that
at the beginning of the time f and F have the values denoted
above by fi and F1. Everything then remains as it was;

         for the Theoretical Proof of Avogadro’s Law.          325
# #.       and  : will vanish.         Nevertheless the former two
magnitudes must be given by the equations (19) and (20)
(where X=A=0). Therefore also              # must be given by the
same equation (22); and, from the condition that it must
vanish at the same time, it follows exactly as before that
                    - A 2-hmv2      R'- R2-hRMV2
                  f=Ae-",           F=Be          7
by which Mr. Burbury's proposition is proved. In this it is
simply assumed that the number of molecules A is very large.
This produces the effect that, so soon as the condition has
become stationary, the distribution of velocities in each sepa
rate vessel is scarcely perceptibly influenced by the condition
possessed by the molecule B in that vessel.
   It is only necessary to further remark here in passing, that
the proof may be obtained in exactly the same way if, instead
of regarding the molecules as elastic spheres, we assume any
other law of mutual action; if only, in the first place, the
Lagrange-Hamilton equations of motion are applicable, and,
in the second place, if the time of perceptible mutual action
for each molecule is vanishingly small in comparison with the
time of free motion.
                          First Appendix.
   I have just received a treatise by H. Stankewitsch", which
has for object to prove an equation which essentially is iden
tical with equation (15) of this paper. I have long ago, in
my treatise “Some General Propositions on the          £
of Heat”f, called attention to the connection of a still more
  eneral equation with Jacobi's principle of the last multiplier.
#. Stankewitsch arrives at the proof of his equation in an
altogether different way, which, however, is in every respect
similar to Jacobi's proof of the principle of the last multiplier.
However ingenious the method employed by Stankewitsch,
I hope to show in the following lines that the equation in
question may be proved much more simply in the way indi
cated by Maxwell. I will first show that the equation of H.
Stankewitsch is only an altered form of our equation (15).
If A be the angle between the velocity v and the axis of
abscissae, B the angle made by the XZ plane with the plane
which is parallel to the directions of v and OX, and, lastly, K

    Let us in fig. 2 denote the
points of intersection of all                  Fig. 2.
these lines drawn from the
centre Q of a sphere of radius 1
with the surface of the sphere
in the same way as the lines
themselves. The variables v,
 W, T, S, O determine simply
the magnitude and relative
position of the lines determi
ning the impact; they deter
mine what I have called the
form of the impact; v', 'W',
T', Q are therefore simple
functions of the first-named
 variables. We will leave these variables constant, so that the
 whole form of the impact remains unaltered. Only its position
in space, and so the variables A, B, and K are to alter; and
the product of the corresponding changes in the variables
 A', B', K', viz.
          dA dB' dK'=dAdB dK. SH dA    dA dB dK'
                                             dB dK.’
 is to be determined. It is geometrically evident that dAdB dK
 must be equal to dA' dB'd K'; for both sets of differentials
 may be supposed to be obtained by supposing that, for fixed
 position and magnitude of v, v', V, V", the axis of abscissae
 describes the w'. interior of a cone of infinitely small aper
 ture; and the system of coordinates revolves about the axis
 of abscissae at a very small angle. This follows analytically
 in the following way. We see from fig. 2 that B'= B+ 4 vXv'.
  4 vXv' is simply a function of A, K, and the now constant
 angles. If, therefore, we now introduce A', K’, B' instead of the
 variables A, K, B, we have dB'=dB. Therefore

   In the latter functional determinant, besides the angles
already put constant, B' is to be regarded as constant.
   Further

                         sinj : sin h- a : a ';

           tanj= v1-a”-a” sinh             2N-alcosh
We see, further, from the figure that
                      180°–K=h-4 v'vV,
when the latter angle depends simply on the form of the im
£      and is therefore to be regarded at present as constant.
  o also
                      j+180=K’-- 4:V'v'v.
    The latter angle again is constant; whence it follows, since
 nothing here depends upon the sign, that
                       0A'. OK'_*. OA'. 0.j.
                 2+##=2+##
    Since in the equations for a' and tanj also the angle L,
 which equally depends only on the form of the impact, plays
 the part of a constant, the determinant can be calculated
without difficulty, and we obtain for it the value     #.    We
 might also have obtained this result without any calculation
 by  £           the points v, v', V, and W" as fixed. Since A
 and h are spherical polar coordinates of the point X of the
 spherical surface, so also A', j; the element of area ad Adh
 expressed by the former polar coordinates must be equal to
 the element of area a'd A'dj expressed by the latter. We
 have then
                   a' d'A' dB' dR'= adA dB dK.
    For a fixed position of the points v, v', V, and W, A, K
 and then A', K' may be regarded as spherical coordinates of
 the point X, which would give at once
                       adA' dK=2' dA' dR'.
 Since, further, from the definition of A (equation 13),
                 dv'd W" dT dO'=AdvdW dT dO,
 it follows from equations (28), (29), (30), (31) that
             d: dn'd: dà'dn'd'' dO'_v'V"'A.

     Equation (15) is therefore proved by proving the equation
    d: dn' d', d'I'dmi' d' d'O'= d5 dm d' d', dmidt, dO, . (32)
 and vice versa.
     0 is here the angle between the planes RQR and RQv of
 fig. 1: If on the right-hand side of the equation (32) we
 introduce, instead of O, the angle \, which the former plane
 makes with the plane RQX (compare fig. 3), #, m, , #1, m1, #1,
 and therefore also the angle between the planes RQX and
 RQv remain constant; and since this is equal to the difference
 between 4: O and Wr, it follows that dy=d0. If in the same
 way we introduce upon the left-hand side of the equation (32)
 We' instead of O', it follows that
                            dO'=dy',
 and equation (32) becomes
        d: dn' d' dà'dmi' d8, dy'=d£dn d4 d5 dm dël dy,
which is exactly the form which H. Stankewitsch gives to the
equation.
    We will, however, further multiply each side by adS, by
 which at the same time we indicate that S is to be chosen as
 the eighth independent variable. The equation thus assumes
the form
d: dn'd da'dm' d', dy' adS=d: dnd dài dni dc dy, adS. (33)

note in fig. 3 the points of
intersection of the two relative
velocities before and after im
pact with the surface of the

of the two relative velocities
by R1 and R1'. Let H be the
middle point of the arc RR' of
a great circle, X the point in
which the axis of abscissa in
tersects the surface of the
sphere. We now for constants
#, m, 4, #1, mi, #1 introduce the
angles #N=XH and E=ZXH instead of 4:S=RH and
£ Since, again, for a fixed position of the points
   , Z, and R, both S and Y as well as    ' and E are spherical

         for the Theoretical Proof of Avogadro's Law.         329
polar coordinates of the point H of the sphere, we have
                        wdN dE=adS dy.
   The left side of equation (33) is next transformed into
                  d: dnd d8, dm déi vdN dE. . . . . (34)
   If, now, we denote the projections of the relative velocity
QR, before impact on the axes of coordinates by v, y, z, and
also the projections of the relative velocity QR, after impact
on the axes of coordinates by v', y', 2', and with constant #, m, &
introduce the variables
              w=#1-#, y=nl-n, z=#1-#,
expression (34) becomes
                   d: dnd div dydz v dM dE. . . .         .   (35)
   Then we leave w, y, z, N, E constant, and instead of £, m, &
 introduce the variables #, m', ''. If v, y, z be the projections
 of the line R1 R1' of the relative velocities drawn from Q on
 the axes of coordinates, we have

        #=#-F# 7–7-#5 # =#-F#
    Since, now, all the lines drawn in fig. 3 remain altogether
 unaltered in magnitude and position, wi, y1, and z1 are also
 constant, and we have
                      d: dn'd? =d: dn d8.
 Hence expression (35) becomes
                   d: dn'd dwdy d2 v dN dE. . . . . (36)
    The next step consists in introducing for constant #', m', 4',
 N, E the variables w', y', 2' instead of v, y, z; that is, the
 coordinates of the point Ri' instead of the coordinates of the
 point RI. It is at once seen from fig. 3 that the element of
 volume described by the point R1 on change of its coordinates
 is exactly equal to that which the point Ri' describes for the
 position of the point H remains unchanged. It follows,
 therefore, that
                      dwdy d2=da' dy'dz'; . . . . . (37)
 and expression (36) becomes

330     Prof. L. Boltzmann on the Assumptions necessary

becomes
                d: dn'dg da'dm' dé'v dN dE.          .  .  .  (39)
   Lastly, we introduce, instead of the spherical polar coordi
nates N, E of the point H, its spherical polar coordinates S, \';
so that we obtain
                     vd.N. dE=adS. dip'.
Lastly, expression (30) becomes therefore

by which equation (33) is proved.

    After correcting the foregoing for the press, I became ac
 quainted, by the kindness of the author, with Prof. Tait's
 paper “On the Foundations of the Kinetic Theory of
 Gases”. While reserving for a future occasion my remarks
 on Prof. Tait's observations on the mean path, and on the case
 when external forces act, I will here mention only one point.
 If in a gas on which no external forces act, and whose molecules
 are elastic spheres, F(w, y, z) dw dy dz be the probability that
 components of the velocity of a molecule parallel to the axes
 of coordinates shall at the same time lie between the limits v
 and v+da, y and y + dy, z and 2 + d2, then Maxwell bases
 the first proof which he givest of his law of distribution of
 velocities on the assumption that F(x, y, z) is a product of
 these functions, of which the first contains only v, the second
 only y, the third only 2. This is the same as the assumption
 that, for a given component of velocity at right angles to the
 axis of abscissae, the quotient of two probabilities, viz. the pro
 bability that the component of the velocity of a molecule in
 the direction of the axis of abscissae lies between a and x +dv,
 and the probability that the same quantity lies between certain
 other limits # and #--d%, is altogether independent of the
 given value of the component of the velocity of the same
 molecule at right angles to the axis of abscissae.            In a

later paper* Maxwell himself speaks of this assumption as
£              and therefore gives a proof resting on a quite
  ifferent foundation. In fact, we should expect that greater
velocities in the direction of the axis of abscissae in comparison
with the smaller ones would be so much the more improbable
the greater the component of velocity of the molecule at right
angles to the axis of abscissae. If, for example,
      F(x,y,z)=-“”---".e-º",
then the quotient just mentioned would be

            F(#, y, z)d:    d:
   The larger Vy”+2", the more would small values in com
parison with large ones gain in probability. Now, by means
of the law of distribution of velocities, which is to be proved,
we obtain the proof of the very remarkable theorem: that the
relative probability of the different values of w is altogether
independent of the value, supposed to be given, which Vy”+2”
has for the same molecule; that therefore the quotient F(x,y,z):
F(#, y, z) is independent of y and 2 ; or, '' is the same,
since the three axes of coordinates must play the same part,
that F,(w, y, z) may be represented as a product of three
functions of which the first contains only w, the second only
9, the third only 2.
   It is therefore an altogether inadmissible circulus viliosus to
make use of this assumption to prove Maxwell's law of distribu
tion of velocities. This therefore also holds good of the proof
which Prof. Tait has given (pp. 68 & 69 of the paper quoted),
and which is only a reproduction of Maxwell's first proof,
which he himself later rejected. For, from the circumstance
that the distribution of velocities must be independent of the
special system of coordinates chosen for its calculation, we can
never show that F(x, y, z) must have the form f(x) p(y)\,(2),
only when this has been already proved. One might make use
of the circumstance to show the similarity of form of the three
functions f, b, and Nr. I do not even need to enter upon known
geometrical investigations if the value of a function of three
rectangular coordinates w, y, z is independent of the choice of
the system of coordinates. For Prof. Tait has already shown
of the function denoted above by F, that it can only be a
function of Va"+y^+ 2*; but the value of the expression
 va”--y"+2" is already quite independent of the special posi

it #:    not permit of being reduced to the form f(x), p(y),

XXXVII. On an Arc-Lamp suitable to be used with the
   Duboscq Lantern. By, Professor SILVANUs P. THOMPSON,
    D.Sc.*
                             [Plate III.]
Th: lamp devised by Foucault and Duboscq, and supplied
        for so many years by the famous house of Duboscq,
fails to fulfil the electrical requirements of the modern physi
 cal laboratory, though it has rendered excellent service in the
 past. Yet the lantern and optical adjuncts of the standard
 pattern of Duboscq are so widely used that it seemed desirable
 to find some other arc lamp which, while fulfilling the elec
 trical requirements of the case, could be used with the
 Duboscq lantern.
    Before describing the lamp which I have for twelve months
 employed for this purpose, I propose to state the conditions
 to be fulfilled, and the reasons why the old Duboscq lamp
 fails to fulfil them.
    The modern physical laboratory is usually supplied with
electric energy under one of two alternative conditions, namely
 either at constant potential or with constant current; more
usually under the former condition. If supplied from a
dynamo the dynamo may be either series-wound, shunt
 wound, or compound-wound. If supplied from accumulators
the accumulators will work at constant potential, and will
 have a very small internal resistance.
    The arc-lamp for laboratory use must be capable of working
 under the given conditions. No doubt the Duboscq lamp
 worked fairly when supplied with current from 50 Grove's
 cells. But in a laboratory where there is another and better
 and less wasteful source of supply, 50 Grove’s cells are not
 desirable. Though 40 accumulators have an electromotive
 force almost exactly equal to that of 50 Grove's cells, the
 Duboscq lamp does not work well with them unless a resist
 ance of several ohms is intercalated in the circuit to represent
                 * Communicated by the Physical Society.

 334         Prof. S. P. Thompson on an Arc-Lamp
 the internal resistance of the Grove-cells; and even then the
 Duboscq lamp does not, for certain reasons, work as satis
 factorily as the lamp to be described, and its cost is about
 three times as great.
    In every arc-lamp for optical purposes there must be
 mechanism adapted to perform the four following actions:—
    1. To bring the carbons together into initial contact.
   2. To part the carbons suddenly, and with certainty, to a
short distance-about 3 millimetres—apart. This action is
technically called “striking” the arc.
   3. To supply carbon as fast as it is consumed, by moving
one (or both) of the pencils forward into the arc. This
action is called “feeding” the arc.
   4. To so move the carbons, or their holders, that the lumi
nous points retain the same position in space at the proper
focus of the optical system. This action is called “focusing”
the arc.
   It may be remarked, in passing, that the feeding mechanism
of many lamps also performs the action, set down as No. 1 of
the above, of bringing the carbons into initial contact pre
paratory to striking the arc.
   In many arc-lamps the attempt is made to unite the striking
and feeding mechanisms in one ; but in many lamps, and in
the one I have to describe, the striking and feeding mechanisms
are distinct. The striking mechanism in all the arc-lamps of
commerce consists of an electromagnet or solenoid arranged
in the main circuit of the lamp, the armature or plunger of
the same being mechanically connected with one or both of
the carbons, so that when, by the turning on of the current
through the touching carbons, there is a great rush of current,
the attraction of the electromagnet or solenoid shall instantly
part the carbons and strike the arc. In the majority of the
commercial arc-lamps it is the upper carbon only that is
raised to strike the arc; in a few other lamps, and in the one
I am using, the lower carbon is depressed. In one of the
older patterns of the Duboscq lamp the lower carbon was also
thus directly acted upon, its holder being attached to the
armature of an electromagnet beneath it. The same is true
of the Serrin lamp. But in the Duboscq-Foncault lamp the
arc is struck in a different way. The two carbon-holders are
connected by racks to a clockwork gearing which either
parts them or brings them together, the movement being
driven by a double train of wheels, either of which can be
released in turn. The weight of the upper carbon-holder
drives the train that moves the carbons together; a coiled
spring drives the train that parts the carbons.        Whether

          suitable to be used with the Duboscq Lantern.       335
either of the trains, or neither of them, shall be released is
determined by the position of a double-toothed detent which,
placed between the final spur-wheels of the two trains, locks
both of them when in its mean position, but releases one or
other when shifted to right or left. The position of this de
tent is determined by the current through the lamp, it being
attached to one end of a three-arm lever, the two other ends
of which are respectively attached to the armature of the con
trolling electromagnet and to an opposing spiral spring.
When the moment of pull of the electromagnet upon its
armature is greater than that of the opposing spring, the
detent is pulled over one way, releasing the approximating
train of wheels while retaining locked the parting train.
When the moment of the pull of the opposing spring exceeds
that of the electromagnet on its armature, the detent is pulled
 over the other way, locking the approximating train and
 releasing the parting train. When the pull of the electro
 magnet exactly balances that of the opposing spring, both
 trains are locked. Now when the current is at first turned on,
 there is a sudden pull upon the armature of the electromagnet;
 but the carbons are not instantly parted, partly because of
 the inertia of the train of wheels, and partly because of the
 backlash of the mechanism. Two or three seconds may
 elapse before the arc is struck. This delay is serious, either
 when working with dynamo or with accumulators. If the
 dynamo is shunt-wound, the shortcircuiting even for this short
 period demagnetizes the field-magnets. If the dynamo is
 series-wound or compound-wound, or if accumulators are
 being used, there is overheating during the period of delay.
 Supposing, however, the arc to be struck, then the inertia of
 the train of wheels makes itself evident in another way; for
 it parts the carbons too far, producing a long arc of consider
 able resistance; and as the current then drops below its normal
 value, the armature goes over the other way, and the other
 train of wheels is momentarily released. This alternation
 between the two trains, which often lasts for some time, pro
 duces a disagreeable instability.
    The feeding mechanism of arc-lamps next comes in for con
 sideration. The object of the feeding mechanism is to supply
 carbon as fast as it is consumed, and so keep the light constant.
 But the light cannot be kept constant unless the consumption
 of electric energy in the arc is constant. The electric energy
 is the product of two factors—the current through the arc, and
 the difference of potential between the electrodes. Calling
 the current i and the potential difference e, it is the product
 ei which is to be kept constant. Now, as remarked at the

 336          Prof. S. P. Thompson on an Arc-Lamp
 outset, the very conditions of modern electric supply are that
 either e or i is maintained constant, the usual arrangement in
 commercial lighting being i constant for arc-lamps in series,
 and e constant for glow-lamps in parallel. One of the two
 factors being a constant by the conditions of the    '       the
 other factor must be kept constant by the feeding mechanism.
 Or, in other words, the variations of the other factor should
 be made to control the action of the feeding mechanism. The
 mechanical part of the feed may consist of a train of wheels
 driven by the weight of the carbon-holder or by a spring, or
 it may consist of a friction-clutch holding the carbon from
 sliding forward, or of a worm-gearing or any other; but it
must be controlled by an electric mechanism of one of the two
following kinds. For keeping i constant, the feeding mecha
nism must be controlled by an electromagnet (or solenoid)
placed in the main circuit, working against an opposing spring
or weight. For keeping e constant, the feeding mechanism
must be controlled by an electromagnet (or solenoid) placed
as a shunt to the arc, and working against an opposing spring
or weight. In the latter case, if for any reason the arc grows
too long, the potential at the terminals will rise, more current
will flow around the shunt, which will then overcome its op
posing spring (or weight), and will release the feeding
machinery until balance is restored. The use of the shunt,
introduced first by Lontin, enables arc-lamps to be connected
two or more in series in one circuit. A less perfect solution
is the differential principle introduced by Von Hefner Alteneck,
where the difference between the attractions of a series and a
shunt-solenoid maintains constant, not the product ei, but the
difference e—i.
    The only perfect solution of the problem is a feeding
mechanism which, by combining in itself a shunt-coil and a
series-coil, shall keep the productei a constant, however either
factor may vary. All the commercial arc-lamps for lighting
in series have shunt-circuits to control the feeding mechanism;
though often the arrangement takes the form of a shunt-coil
wound (differentially) outside the series-coil of the striking
mechanism; so that feeding is accomplished by the shunt-coil
demagnetizing the striking electromagnet and momentarily
un-striking the arc.
    Returning to the Duboscq lamp, it may be observed that, as
it possesses no shunt-coil, it can only feed by a weakening of
the current in the main circuit. Hence it is obvious that a
Duboscq lamp cannot possibly work in a constant-current
circuit. Also two Duboscq lamps will not work in series with
one another, as their individual feeding is not independent of

          suitable to be used with the Duboscq Lantern.       337
the other. Neither will two work in parallel with one another;
for the weakening of current in one throws more current
through the other, and the instability before alluded to—called
“hunting” by electric engineers—becomes yet more pro
nounced.
    The lamp that I have adapted to the Duboscq lantern is one
known in commerce as the “Belfast” arc-lamp, its principles
of construction being due to Mr. F. M. Newton; but I have
had the design altered to suit the special work. In this lamp,
as previously mentioned, the striking and feeding mechanisms
are separate. The arc is struck by means of an electromagnet
E of the tubular pattern, having as its armature an iron disk
A, which, when no current is passing, is held up by a short
spiral spring at about 3 millim. from the end of the electro
magnet. The lower carbon-holder is mounted upon this disk,
so that the arc is struck by the downward movement of
the lower carbon. The feeding mechanism is both simple
and effective. The upper carbon-holder is a long straight
tube of brass: it passes through a collar in the frame of the
lamp, and also through a metal box B above. This metal box
contains a piece of curry-comb with the steel bristles of the
comb set to point obliquely inwards and downwards. They
grip the carbon-holder and allow it to be pushed downwards,
but not upwards. The box itself is mounted upon a strong
brass lever, L, close to the point of the lever. One end of this
lever is drawn downwards by an adjustable spiral spring S,
whilst the other carries an iron armature which stands imme
diately above the poles of an electromagnet, which is wound
with fine wire and placed as a shunt to the lamp. Above the
lever there is a contact-screw, platinum-tipped, making con
tact with the lever, exactly as in the ordinary trembling electric
bell, and the lever and contact-screw are included in #. shunt
 circuit. The attraction of the shunt-magnet for its armature
 is opposed by the pull of the spiral spring. Whenever, by
reason of the resistance of the arc, a sufficient current flows
through the shunt-circuit, the opposing spring is overcome,
and the lever is set into vibration like the lever of an electric
 bell, but more rapidly. The vibratory motion is thus com
municated to the box containing the steel wire comb, which
at once, by an action well known in mechanism, wriggles
 the carbon-holder downwards by innumerable small successive
impulses. So soon as the motion of the carbon has reduced
the resistance of the arc, the shunt-current diminishes and
the feeding action ceases, to recommence when required. It
is found best for lantern-purposes to send the current upwards
through the lamp, the lower carbon being the positive one.

338       Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet on Electromagnets.
A thick cored carbon of 13 to 15 millim. diameter is preferred,
as it gives a good luminous crater and burns slowly. A 10
millim. copper-plated carbon is used for the upper electrode,
and it is adjusted so that its centre falls slightly in front of
the centre of the lower carbon, thereby causing the crater to
send its light forward.
   The lamp as used in commerce has no focusing-arrange
ment. In adapting it to the Duboscq lantern, the frame was
made narrow; so that when the inner chimney of the Duboscq
lantern was removed, the lamp could be dropped entire down
the outer chimney, a metal sleeve of the same diameter as
the inner chimney being added to the lamp as a guide. At
the bottom of the lamp a gun-metal tube was added, tapped
inside with a screw-thread, into which works a steel screw
having a small hand-wheel near its lower end and a pointed
pivot at the extremity. The lamp slides down the chimney
of the lantern until the pivot touches the base-board. When
the arc burns down the lower carbon, so that the luminous
crater is no longer in the optical focus, a turn given by hand
to the wheel suffices to raise it to the proper position; but
the lamp will burn for ten minutes without requiring any
readjustment on this account. The lamp shown to the Physical
 Society was constructed by Mr. E. Rousseau, Instructor in
the Physical Workshop of the Finsbury Technical College,
assisted by Mr. A. D. Raine, now Demonstrator in the City
and Guilds Central Institution.
XXXVIII. Electromagnets.—WII. The Law of the Elec
   tromagnet and the Law of the Dynamo. By R. H. M.
   BosANQUET, St. John's College, Oxford.
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
Th: present communication will consist of two parts. First,
       the application of the measures of the bars with pole
pieces, contained in No. V. of this series (Phil. Mag. [5] xxii.
p. 298), to the establishment of the type of law which governs
electromagnets of this description, and the comparison of
 this law with the various assumptions which have been made
 on the subject, and in particular with Frölich’s law and the
law of tangents.
    Secondly, a few propositions will be stated which offer a
 general method of discussing the action of dynamos, inde
 pendent of the assumption of any particular law of magneti
 zation, and based on a consideration of the dynamic action.

          Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet on Electromagnets.            339
These will be applied to the law first obtained. A discussion
of the actual behaviour of my Gramme dynamo will follow in
a future paper.
    The average values of the magnetic resistance of a number
of bars with pole-pieces throughout the whole course of
magnetization were given in the investigation above cited.
The bars in question all had cores of the same shape, viz.
length : diameter :: 20:1. The numbers for other shapes will
no doubt be different, and the laws which deal with the shapes
will be the subject of future investigation; but it is not likely
that the general type of the law will differ materially from
that here discussed.
    It has been a matter for some consideration what scheme
 should be adopted for the representation and comparison of
the different laws. I have adopted a scheme in which the
 magnetic inductions are measured horizontally, and the
 permeabilities, or, as I prefer to call them, conductivities,
 vertically.
    The reason for adopting the magnetic induction as the
 chief variable, is the fact that the magnetic properties of the
 metal depend only on the induction. It is enough to glance
 at the figures which follow, or, better, at the reciprocal figures
 representing magnetic resistance at p. 303 of the paper above
 cited, to see that, whether the metal be in the form of rings,
 or of bars with or without pole-pieces, the resistance to
 magnetization (or its reciprocal the conductivity) changes
 always in much the same way at the same values of the
 induction. Any representation which overlooks this, overlooks
 the principal law so far known as to the variation of the
 magnetic properties of iron. And I dissent from the position
 of those who say that the magnetizing current, or magneti
 zing force, has the chief claim to be regarded as the
 independent variable in such a representation.
     I have in this case chosen conductivity, rather than the
 magnetic resistance, to be combined with the magnetic
 induction, mainly because this combination represents Frö
  lich's law, which is so generally accepted, as a straight line;
 and this facilitates the comparison of Frölich's law with other
 laws.
     A few words as to the precise meaning of the expressions
permeability and conductivity.
     The word permeability was originally used in connection
 with the old theory, and was the ratio

but the magnetizing force existing within the metal of the
bar, for instance, was supposed not to be the same as the
external magnetizing force, but to be diminished by demag
netizing forces, which resided on the ends of the bar. #.
rings, however, where there were no ends, the theoretical
magnetizing force was the same as the external magnetizing
force, and the permeability of a magnetic metal could be
determined by measures of rings.
   In dealing practically with bars, what we want to know is
the connection between the magnetism developed and the
external magnetizing force. The ratio of these two quantities,
which I call conductivity, is a quantity analogous to the
permeability of the theory, but not identical with it; the
conductivity does not take into account the supposed demag
netizing forces at the ends of the bar. The system that I
have adopted prefers to attribute the diminished magnetism in
the case of bars with ends to the increased resistance experi
enced by the magnetism in traversing space external to the
magnetic metal; and I employ the word conductivity in
connection with an entire magnetic circuit, with its air
resistances; leaving permeability with its original application
to circuits or parts of circuits lying wholly within the
magnetized substance.
   The permeability of rings and the conductivity of bars
have, then, precisely the same meaning. In both cases the
meaning is,
                          magnetic induction
                     external magnetizing force'
   If we suppose the magnetizing force uniformly extended
along the bar, as by a uniformly wound coil, we have

    The formula, known as Frölich's may be obtained by
 assuming that the conductivity of the magnet is proportioned
 to its defect of saturation. (See my letter to ‘The Electrician,’
 vol. xvi. p. 247, February 1886; and Prof. S. P. Thompson,
 Phil. Mag. xxii. p. 290, Sept. 1886.) If we measure the mag
 netism as 33 (magnetic induction), we may write this,
                  Conductivity = k (13. – 33),
 which represents a straight line on the scheme of conduc
 tivities and inductions; see figs. 1 & 2.
    For the sake of clearness I have drawn on fig. 1 the
 permeabilities of Rowland's table i., and of my ring E, and
 also the average conductivities of plain bars and bars with
 pole-pieces, deduced from the magnetic resistances given in my
 paper first above cited; also both in figs. 1 & 2 the applica
 tion of Frölich's law to the bars with pole-pieces.

by any curve, a tangent drawn to that curve at any point will
represent a Frölich's law, which will be true only so far as the
 curve and the tangent coincide.        In the present case there
appears to be a point of inflexion on the curve just before
approaching the region of what I may call super-saturation
 (tendency of 33 to increase without actual limit; see paper
first £.        The tangent drawn through this point of inflexion
coincides with the curve for a considerable distance in the
neighbourhood of 13 =      15,000; and I shall show later that the
excitation in the cores of a dynamo with such magnets may
 be confined in actual practice within very moderate limits on
either side of this value.
   The use of Frölich's law to deduce consequences where
wide variations of the magnetic intensity take place, as, for
instance, where the magnetism is supposed to be reduced to
half its maximum value, appears to be fallacious in such cases
as the present.
   The curve in fig. 2 is the same as the curve marked “Bars
with PP” in fig. 1, but drawn to a larger vertical scale.

 rather too laborious for ordinary use. It is not necessary to
 exhibit the comparison.

   This is shown by the straight line on the figures. It is
unnecessary to exhibit the calculation of the numbers. The
correspondence with the truth is about the same as in the
tangent law; but the error increases more rapidly, and ulti
mately becomes much larger, as the magnetism diminishes.

         Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet on Electromagnets.            345
  Thus the tangent and Frölich's laws, upon one or other of
which almost all treatment of the theory of dynamo machines
has been based, are shown to be far from representing the
true laws which govern electromagnets.
   In a paper by the Messrs. Hopkinson, reprinted in ‘The
Electrician, Nov. 19th, 1886, we have an example of another
way in which it has been attempted to fit Frölich's law to
represent the law of magnetization. The intersection of the
Frölich law with the true law in diagram A there given is
made to take place at about 13 = 5500. If the case be
represented by a scheme of conductivity and induction, the
straight line representing Frölich's law crosses the curve of
the true law at a considerable angle, and by the end of the
representation in about $3 = 11,000 the two diverge widely.
   Now it seems unlikely that Frölich’s law, so used, can have
any bearing '' the action of the dynamo machine. The
advantage of the law is that, being easily manipulated, it can
be made to coincide exactly with the true law in the part of
the dynamo range in actual use. Such a case is represented
by a tangent drawn to the curve in my scheme. # is very
unlikely, however, that any dynamic action, such as to be of
practical utility, could take place in the region of 33 = 5000.
   I shall now proceed to a few propositions, suitable for
application to the true laws of electromagnets as embodied in
series of numbers rather than in formulae, founded chiefly on
the dynamic action itself.
   The outlines of the theory have been explained to some
extent in my paper on Self-regulating Dynamo machines,
Phil. Mag.     £    xv. p. 275. £ the application to laws
expressed numerically, and the line of reasoning now adopted
are new.
   For the present I confine myself to the series dynamo.
   According to the mode of statement now usually adopted,
the E.M.F. developed in an armature at n revolutions is
              . . . . E = 4n. A l;A, . . . . . . (1).
where 33A is the field-intensity within the coils of the armature.
This differs only in arrangement of units from the formula
adopted in my previous paper.
    he first thing is to express 33A in terms of the 13 developed
in the field-magnets. We have measures of the 33 across the
equatorial sections of the field-magnets, and can connect it to
some extent with the potential of the magnetizing current.
In the present approximate purpose we assume
                             $3A = f$3,    . . . . . . (2)

346       Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet on Electromagnets.
where f may be called the coefficient of efficiency; it will
depend on the build of the machine, and may probably range
from # to Ilo or less. Nothing in the theory depends on it, so
far as our present purpose is concerned. We neglect varia
tions of distribution, which would give rise to change of f.
   We then put E=CR, from Ohm’s electrical law in the
circuit, and the equation stands
                         CR = 4n Af$3.         . . . . . (3)
   The next step is to express 33 in terms of the magnetizing
current.   If we make here the usual assumption,
            $3 = conductivity x magnetizing force,
                                   47rmC
or                      $3 = cyx

and substitute in (3), the current disappears from the equation,
and we have
                       lR = 167mn Af x cy; . . . . (5)
a relation between the coefficients for a given value of the
conductivity, which is not without use, but does not help us
in the general problem.
   The assumption (4) is not, however, called for by the nature
of things, for it is clear that 33 is not generally proportional
to the magnetizing current. And our present treatment will
be founded on the assumption that, so long as the conditions
of the machine vary but little, there must be some power of
the magnetizing current or of its magnetic potential to which
$  '       regarded as proportional. Assume, then, a general
form of law which can be fitted to any part of the range of
magnetization,
                             $3 = KCY. . . . . . . (6)
Substitute this in (3), and gather up the constants into the
coefficient; then,

rotation.

the speed slightly, and measure the two speeds and the two

where w is that power of the velocity with which the current
varies, in the given state of the machine.
   We immediately infer some propositions of interest with
regard to v.
   a-1 can only be finite and positive so long as the conduc
tivity diminishes as 33 increases.
   It is infinite when the conductivity is constant.            It is
negative when $3 and the conductivity increase together.
   Following the course of the changes usual in electromag
nets, which we may illustrate by fig. 2, we then have

   Thus the range of possible dynamic equilibrium is from
about 13–7000 upwards. In the lower part of this w is great,
or the current changes violently for small changes in the
velocity. In the saturation region w approximates to 1, and
the current is more nearly proportional to the velocity.
   I have calculated the values of a given by the successive
pairs of numbers on which fig. 2 is based (bars with pole

  We cannot of course assume that the magnets of the Gramme
machine follow the same law as that of our bars; in fact they
do not do so at all approximately, probably in consequence of
the large amount of cast iron in the machine. But these
numbers are enough to illustrate the limited nature of the
variations of the induction which may be possible during the
working of a dynamo, while the current produced varies in a
ratio of more than 2: 1. By carrying the magnetization
higher still, we get a further considerable range of current
with a small change of the induction. Looking at fig. 2, we
see that it would be possible to draw a secant through the
point of inflection, representing a Frölich's law, and deviating
but little from the curve from about 12,500 up to 18,000. In
this way the law of magnetization would be approximately
represented by a Frölich’s law over a very wide range.
   A word as to the physical meaning of the quantity y, which
is connected with v by the relation       1: =w.     This y may be
said to be what determines the dynamic action. The dynamic
action consists of the summation of an infinite number of ele
ments, whether of magnetism, current, or E.M.F., which
originate in one small change of velocity. It is only where
these elements are successively less and less, and so form a
 convergent series, that their sum is finite, and gives rise to a
 definite behaviour of the machine, or to what we may call a
 state of dynamic equilibrium.
    Let y be then the ratio of diminution of the successive
elements, due to the additional element of induced magnetism
being less than the element of inducing current. It is easy
to see that we may express the whole change of C, say, due
to a small change of velocity dn, thus:
                      AC                       d
                      #=(1+y+x'+...)#

        XXXIX. Note on the Tenacity of Spun Glass.
              By E. GIBSON and R. A. GREGORY *.
   T is well known that the tenacity of metallic wires increases
      as the diameter diminishes, so that very fine wires will
carry much larger loads than those obtained by calculation
based upon the assumption that the breaking weight varies
as the square of the diameter. As glass can be drawn into very
fine fibres, we have made some observations on the tenacity
of this material, comparing the strength of very thin threads
with that of rods made from the same glass, but of much
greater thickness.
   The experiments were carried out in the course of our work
in the Physical Laboratory of the Normal School of Science
and Royal School of Mines.
   In dealing with a substance so brittle as glass, it is evident
that special care must be taken to ensure that the observation
is not vitiated by rupture due to a shearing stress, at or near
the points of support. Precautions were taken to prevent
this in all cases, and no experiments are quoted in this paper
in which rupture took place near the points of support, or of
attachment of the weight.
   Three different thicknesses of glass were subjected to
experiment : viz., fibres the diameters of which were about
0.002 and 0.004 centim. respectively, and rods with dia
meters varying between 0.05 and 0.09 centim.
   The fibres were attached at the ends of two strips of paper by
means of shellac varnish; this on setting was found sufficiently
 strong to carry more than the breaking weight, without
 allowing the fibre to slip. A small paper basket suspended
 from the lower strip carried the load, consisting of fine shot
and silica, the latter being added when the fibre was near its
breaking-point.
   The diameter of the thread was measured at the place of
rupture by means of a Compound Microscope with micrometer
eye-piece. From data thus obtained the tenacity was calcu
lated with the following results:—

352              Note on the Tenacity of Spun Glass.
   Some observations were next made on rods about 1 millim.
in diameter ; the method of support and the loading being
 changed. Two pieces of angle brass, each about 8 inches
long, were substituted for the slips of paper. Through a hole
drilled near the end of the angles, a piece of $" wire was
passed, turned up and soldered to the back. The free
extremities of the wires were plaited into rings, which served
to support the load and suspend the whole from a hook above.
   The ends of the rod were laid in the angles, leaving the
glass free for about 12 inches. Small pieces of red-ochre
cement (a compound consisting of resin, red ochre, and bees
wax) were placed at intervals along the glass, and a Bunsen
flame applied. The cement speedily melted, and imbedded
the glass; on cooling, the whole was suspended vertically.
A bottle was hung on the wire attached to the lower angle
piece, into which a fine stream of mercury flowed from a
reservoir above. The apparatus was so arranged that when
the rod broke mercury would no longer fall into the bottle.
   The mode of measuring the diameters of the rods differed
from that adopted in the case of the fibres. About half an
inch of rod was broken away at the place of rupture, and
mounted in wax on a piece of looking-glass, the broken section
being upwards. Its diameter was then measured by means of
a microscope-cathetometer, and the tenacity found as in the
case of fibres. The following are the results of four
experiments:—
                                               Tenacity, in dynes
 Diameter, in centims.     Weight, in grs.       per sq. centim.
       0.090                   3908                 60 x 107
       0.082                   4443                 83 x 107
       0.050                   1948                 97 x 107
       0.042                   1781                126 x 10"
   These observations show, in the first place, that the tenacity
of fine fibres is very considerably greater than that of thick
rods, and that the strength of rods increases as the diameter
diminishes. It may be interesting to point out that the
tenacity of glass fibres studied by us is nearly as great as that
assigned by Wertheim to many of the metals; e.g., the tenacity
  iven by him for annealed steel wire 1 millim. in diameter is
499 x 10" cent-dynes, and even in the case of drawn steel the
tenacity is not greater than twice that of a glass fibre, viz.
998 x 10" cent.-dynes.
   With steel pianoforte-wire the tenacity is, however, con
siderably greater; according to Sir William Thomson (Art.

              On an Improved Form of Seismograph.            353
 ‘Elasticity, Encyc. Brit., new edition) the breaking-stress is
                                                 Cent-dynes.
      Best pianoforte steel-wire . . . . . 2318 x 10"
    The question as to what is the most probable cause of this
 increase in strength as the diameter diminishes, presents some
 difficulty.
    Quincke (Comptes Rend. de l'Acad. de Berlin, 1868,
 p. 132) has suggested that the great increase observed in the
 case of metals is due to a surface tension, analogous to that
 observed in liquids. If this were the true explanation, the
 breaking-weight could be expressed by the sum of two terms
 which vary as the diameter and the square of the diameter
 respectively. This suggestion does not receive much support
 from our observations, as the results cannot be satisfactorily
 expressed by means of such a formula. It is, perhaps, more
probable that the heating and rapid cooling undergone by the
glass when it is drawn out into a fine fibre produces an
 increase in tenacity; and it is at all events certain that no
 comparisons can be made between the strengths of different
materials unless they have undergone similar treatment, and
 unless the sizes of the rods or wires submitted to experiment
are the same.

                             [Plate IV.]
TH:        apparatus described in this paper is an improved
        form of a seismograph which was made for Prof. Milne
in the beginning of 1883, to be used by him in his investi
gations for the Committee appointed by the British Associa
tion to “Investigate the Earthquake Phenomena of Japan.”
That apparatus was exhibited to the Geological Society of
London, and a description of it by the present writer was
published in the Quarterly Journal of that Society in May of
the same vear.     It consisted of a combination of instruments
which had been devised by Prof. Milne and the writer, and
descriptions of which had appeared from time to time in the
‘Transactions of the Seismological Society of Japan, and in
the ‘Philosophical Magazine. The object of the apparatus
was to determine the time of occurrence, the amount, the
period, and the direction of the different motions in an earth
quake shock. Arrangements were made for recording three
components of the motion, one vertical and two horizontal, at

354                  Mr. T. Gray on an Improved
right angles to each other, on a band of smoked paper which
covered the surface of a cylinder. The cylinder was intended
to be kept continuously in motion round its axis by clock
work; and the recording points were, on the supposition of
no motion of the earth, expected to trace continuously the
same line on the smoked paper in a similar manner to that
introduced by Prof. J. A. Ewing, and used by him in his
experiments in Japan". Prof. Ewing used smoked glass for
his record-receiving surfaces, and that is a very good arrange
ment when it can be conveniently adopted. It had been pre
viously used by Prof. Milne in apparatus in which the
record-receiver was either stationary or automatically started
into motion by the earthquake; and it has since been much
used by him and the writer in earthquake investigations.
 Smoked paper was adopted in the apparatus here referred to,
and, when smoked surfaces are used, it is still recommended
 for the present form, because it is desirable to obtain straight
 records, written side by side and to the same scale, of all the
three components. This, combined with continuous motion,
 could only be got on a cylindrical surface; and, considering
the risk of breakage, cylinders of glass sufficiently true and
inexpensive could not be readily obtained.
    The apparatus used for recording the motions was in prin
 ciple the same as that described in this paper, but differed
 considerably in detail. A separate clock was provided for
 the purpose of recording the time of occurrence, the record
 being made on the dial of the clock, which was, at the time
 of an earthquake, automatically pushed forward into contact
 with ink-pads fixed to the ends of the hands, a mark being at
 the same time made on the record-receiver to show at what
 part of the earthquake the time was recorded. In subsequent
 instruments this method of recording time was abandoned
 because, with the improved form of record-receiving appa
 ratus, it became unnecessaryt. This will be more particularly
 referred to when the method of recording time now adopted
is being described.
    The instrument above referred to was set up in the Meteo
 rological Observatory in Tokio, where it is still in use. Ex
 perience with it, however, soon suggested many improvements,

                     Form of Seismograph.                    355
which have been introduced into later instruments.        It was
found that when the “conical pendulums” (see below, p. 362)
used for actuating the recording indices were, as in that in
strument, made to turn with very little friction, and were
adjusted to have a long period of free oscillation, that is to
say to have very little positive stability, the lines traced by
the recording points gradually broadened to a very incon
venient extent. This rendered good records of small motions
impossible after the record-receiver had been in motion for a
short time, and introduced a risk that such records might be
obliterated after they had been obtained. Such considerations
as these led Prof. Milne to abandon the continuous motion
element, and adapt the instrument to the comparatively old
method of automatic starting at the time of the earthquake.
There are, besides the     £          experienced due to the
broadening of the lines by the recording points, several other
important objections to the use of a band of paper of such
limited length as that provided by a single turn round a
cylinder of moderate dimensions. The record may, for ex
ample, extend more than once round the cylinder; that is,
the earthquake may last longer than the time taken by the
cylinder to make a complete turn. This produces great con
fusion in the record, rendering it difficult to interpret.
Again, two earthquakes may occur before the record-sheet
has been changed; and in such a case both records are practi
cally lost. Considerations such as these have led us to adopt
one or other of the forms of apparatus described in this paper.
   The new form of apparatus has for its object the determi
nation of the same elements as have been already enumerated
with reference to the old instrument. Provision is, however,
now made for the whole of the record being obtained on fresh
surface, and for any number of earthquakes which may occur
within a limited period, say a week, being recorded on the
same sheet. The record-receiver is kept continuously in
motion at a very slow rate, and time is marked on it at
regular intervals by means of a good clock; the object being
to secure with perfect certainty that most important element
in earthquake investigation—the time of occurrence of the dis
turbance. In the most complete form of the apparatus the
record-receiving surface is a long ribbon of thin paper, which
is gradually unwound from a supply drum on to another,
which may be called the hauling-off drum, by means of a
weight or spring and a train of wheelwork. The speed is
rendered uniform by taking the paper in its passage from the
one drum to the other round a third drum, which is kept
continuously in uniform motion by a train of clockwork and

356                Mr. T. Gray on an Improved
a suitable governor. A somewhat simpler arrangement is
 obtained by using a single drum covered with paper, or a
 smoked glass or metal cylinder, and giving to this cylinder a
 slow motion of translation in the direction of its axis, so that
 the record takes the form of a spiral line round it. As, how
ever, the rate of motion must be such as to give the time of
occurrence with fair accuracy within a second of time, it is
difficult to obtain a good record on a cylinder of moderate
 size, which will extend over more than twelve hours with
this arrangement. It is of course easy to adapt the apparatus
to be used either way, if that were desirable; but the con
tinuous ribbon of paper is so much the better form of re
 ceiving-surface that the description given in this paper, in so
 far as it refers to earthquakes, only includes that form. The
spiral record has some advantages in apparatus adapted to
record slow changes of level of #. earth's surface; and it will
be again referred to in that connection. For such purposes
the rate of motion may be made excessively slow; and hence
the records for a considerable length of time may be written
on one sheet.
    At the time of occurrence of an earthquake, the rate of
motion of the paper is automatically greatly increased, and a
chronographic reed is simultaneously set into vibration, and
made to mark equal intervals of time on the ribbon, thus
showing accurately the rate of motion at any instant. The
actual rate of motion of the paper on the slow speed may be
varied from about a quarter of an inch to an inch per minute,
and on the fast speed from about 25 to 50 inches per minute,
with the present form of instrument. This change of speed
is generally obtained by including in the driving clockwork
two governors, one of which can be automatically thrown out
of gear, either electromagnetically or mechanically. The
latter method has been found the best and the simplest in
practice. The arrangement commonly used is described
below, page 361, and need not be more particularly referred
to here than in a general statement of the operations it is in
tended to perform. At the time of an earthquake three
operations take place simultaneously. One is the introduction
in train with the clockwork of an adjusting mechanism which
is intended to readjust the starting apparatus, whatever that
may be, so thati t may be in readiness for another earthquake
should that occur. Another is to throw out of gear the slow
speed governor, or, if that method is adopted, to work a change
wheel lever, so as to shorten the train between the driving
power and the governor. A third is to close the circuit of
the chronographic reed, so as to cause it to mark time on the

                        Form of Seismograph.                           357
record sheet.      It will thus be seen that the instrument is
intended to be absolutely self-acting, so long as its supply of
paper lasts and the driving mechanism continues to go. The
supply-drum can take as much paper as is required in a week
on the slow speed.
    The record is made in ink by means of fine glass siphons,
in very much the same manner as that which was introduced
by Sir William Thomson in his siphon-recorder for submarine
telegraph-cable work. This is extremely well adapted for the
continuous ribbon method of working, and, besides, gives an
excellent clear record which requires no further preparation
before it is filed for reference; and, what is of great im
portance, the record is obtained with exceedingly little dis
turbance from friction at the marking-point.
    The siphons which write the horizontal components of the
motion are controlled by two pendulums, the suspending wires
of which are held out of the vertical by horizontal struts ter
minating in knife-edges which rest against the bottoms of
flat V-grooves fixed to a cast-iron pillar rigidly attached to
the sole plate of the instrument. These           p:             when set
 in vibration, describe cones, and hence they have been called
 “conical pendulums.” The degree of deflection from the
vertical can be varied from about one and a half inches to a
 foot, by sliding the pendulum-bob along the strut. The strut
 is made in two pieces, so that a part of it can be removed
when high sensibility is required, and in consequence the
mass is used near the knife-edge. The bob of the pendulum
is suspended by a fine platinum or steel wire from an arrange
ment which permits the suspending wire to be lengthened and
shortened, and also allows the points of suspension to be put
in such positions above the knife-edges as causes the struts to
 place themselves in positions at right angles to each other,
and at the same time provides the means of adjusting their
periods of free vibration to any desired length".
    It is of great importance in apparatus of this kind that the
 mass which, through its inertia, enables the record of the
 motion of the earth to be written, should be as far as possible
 from the knife-edge or point fixed to the earth; a long
 period of free vibration can thus be obtained combined with
 considerable stability of position, while the greatest motion to
 which the knife-edge is likely to be subjected does not turn
the strut through a large angle. If this latter condition be
   * This pendulum is a modification of one designed by the Author in
the beginning of 1880, in which the weight was supported by a thin wire
in line with a rigid vertical axis fixed to the end of the strut and resting
against bearings so as to keep the strut horizontal,

 358               Mr. T. Gray on an Improved
 not provided for, the interpretation of the record becomes
 exceedingly difficult; and this difficulty is likely to be greatly
  increased by the mass acquiring oscillations in its own free
  period of such large angular amplitude that the direction of the
  component which is being recorded becomes a variable quantity.
    The siphon which writes the vertical component of the
 motion is controlled by a compensated horizontal lever instru
 ment, on the same principle as that introduced by the present
 writer and exhibited to the Seismological Society of Japan,
 and described in the Transactions of that Society, vol. i.
 part 1, p. 48, and vol. iii. p. 140, and also in the Philo
 sophical Magazine for September 1881. This instrument
 consists of a horizontal lever carrying near one end a heavy
 mass, and provided at the other end with knife-edges in a
 line at right angles to the length of the lever,        £    lever
 is supported by two flat springs, acting, through a link, on
 a knife-edge attached to it at a point between the mass and
 the knife-edges before mentioned, which are by this means
 held up against the apex of inverted V-grooves rigidly
 fixed to the framework.       In the form of this instrument
 previously described in the Philosophical Magazine, the
 supporting springs were of the ordinary spiral type; but in
 subsequent instruments two flat sprirgs have been adopted,
 because for the same period of oscillation of the lever with
 out compensation they give a more compact arrangement.
 These springs are now made of such variable breadth between
 the fixed and the free ends that, when they are supporting the
 lever, each part is equally bent. They may either be initially
 straight, and bent into a circular form when in use, or they
 may be initially set to a circular form and straight when in
 use. When the lever is supported in this way it has a fairly
long period of free vibration; and this may be increased to
any desired extent by means of a second pair of springs,
which pull downwards on a light bar fixed vertically above
the axis of motion of the lever. This second pair of springs,
besides  I'         the necessary compensation for the positive
stability of the lever and supporting-spring system, gives a
ready means of obtaining a fine adjustment for bringing the
lever to the horizontal position. This is accomplished either
by giving to the points of attachment of the compensating
springs a screw-adjustment so that they can be moved a short
distance backward or forward, or by making the point of
attachment of one spring a little in front of, and of the other
a little behind, the vertical plane through the knife-edge.
The lever can then be raised or lowered by increasing #.
pull on one spring and diminishing that on the other. Sir

William Thomson has recently suggested to the writer that a
flat spring, which in its normal state is bent to such a curva
ture that it is brought straight by supporting a weight on its
end, might be found a good arrangement for a vertical motion
seismometer. This would certainly have considerable advan
tage in the way of simplicity, and with proper compensation
applied, say to the index-lever, so as to lengthen the period,
may be found very suitable. The only doubtful point seems
to be whether the want of rigidity in the spring may not lead
to false indications in the record due to the horizontal motions.
    The application of a rigid horizontal lever, pivoted on knife
edges and supported by springs as a vertical-motion seismo
 meter, was first described in the earlier of the two papers to
the Seismological Society of Japan, quoted above. The ad
 vantage of this arrangement, as rendering it possible to obtain
 a long period of free vibration by placing the intermediate
point of support below the line joining the other two, was also
pointed out. The advantage obtained by the lever itself,
 without compensation, over an ordinary stretched string was
 more specifically pointed out in the other papers referred to ;
 and a method of obtaining very perfect compensation, either
 for a lever or an ordinary spring arrangement, by means of a
 liquid, was then given. The idea of increasing the period of
 a vibrating system by the addition, as it were, of negative
 stability, which was first brought forward in these papers, has
 been worked out in various ways; but the method described
 in this paper is the most perfect yet adopted. Its application
 to the ordinary pendulum was also brought forward and dis
 cussed at a subsequent meeting of the         £                  Society
of Japan".
    The apparatus above referred to for recording the horizontal
 components of the motion during an earthquake may, when
 properly adjusted, be used for registering minute tremors and
 slow changes of level of the earth's surface. It is, however,
 absolutely necessary for such a purpose that friction of the
 different parts should be reduced to a minimum; and hence
 the siphons, or the marking-points when a smoked surface is
 used, are only brought for a few seconds at a time into contact
 with the paper, thus recording a series of dots close enough
 togethertoform practically a continuous line. Anothermethod,
 which gives excellent results and is simple, has been much
 used by Prof. Milne in Japan. It consists in passing from the
 point of the index, through the paper, to the drum a series of
 sparks from an electric induction-coil. The sparks can be

recording-point is concerned, and has the advantage that the
sheet can afterwards be used as a stencil-plate for printing
copies of the record. An ordinary simple pendulum, furnished
with a very light vertical index of thin aluminum tube giving
 a multiplication of 200, has been for some time in use. The
 record of the position of the end of the index is taken on two
 strips of paper which are being slowly pulled along, in direc
 tions at right angles to each other, under it. The sparks per
 forate both sheets simultaneously, thus automatically breaking
 up the motion into two rectangular components. The details of
 some forms of apparatus for this purpose will form the subject
 of a separate communication.

    The record-receiver consists of a long ribbon of thin paper,
about five inches broad, which is slowly wound from the
drum A, situated behind the drum C (Plate IV. fig. 1), on
to the drum, B, by means of a train of clockwork driven
by a spring or a weight of sufficient power to keep the
ribbon taut.     The rate at which the paper is fed forward
is governed by a second train of clockwork, driven by a
separate weight and governed by means of two Thomson
spring-governors. In gear with this train of wheelwork
there is a third drum, C, round which the paper is taken as
it passes from the drum A to the drum B. This drum is
kept moving at a uniform rate, and serves to regulate the
motion of the paper. The object of the double set of clock
work mechanism is to render the rate at which the paper is
fed forward independent of the size of the coil on the drums
A and B.      The surface of the drum C is covered with several
thicknesses of blotting-paper for the purpose of giving a soft
surface for the siphons to write upon, and of preventing the
ribbon blotting or adhering to the £ in consequence of ink
passing through the paper. This blotting-pad is of some
importance, because a cheap kind of thin paper is found to
answer perfectly for the siphons to write upon. They move
with less friction on a moderately rough surface and on paper
which rapidly absoros the ink. £ ordinary circumstances
the paper is fed forward from a quarter of an inch to an inch

per minute, this '       kept up continuously for the purpose of
allowing the magnitude and the time of occurrence of any dis
turbance, which is of sufficient amplitude to leave a record, to be
accurately obtained. This obviates the unavoidable uncertainty
which exists as to the action of any automatic contrivance de
signed to come into action at the time of the disturbance. The
time of occurrence is obtained by causing the siphon, D (figs. 1
and 3), to mark equal intervals of time on the paper ribbon.
The siphon is fixed to a light index-lever which is pivoted on
the end of the lever, E, and the link, F. The lever E turns
round an axis at G, and rests with its end in contact with the
wheel, H, which is fixed to the end of the hour-spindle of the
clock, K (fig. 1). As each tooth of the wheel H passes the
end of the lever E a mark is made on the paper, and the end
of the hour is distinguished by putting a larger or a double
tooth at that part of the wheel. The time at which an earth
quake has occurred can thus be found by measuring the dis
tance of the record of the disturbance from the last time-mark,
then counting the number of intervals from the last hour
mark, and then the number of hours to a known point. It is
convenient to mark the hour once or twice a day on the paper,
so as to save trouble in the reckoning should an earthquake
OCCUlr.
    The ordinary rate of motion is much too slow for the record
 to show the motions of the earth in detail; and, as has been
already stated, this is obtained by automatically increasing
the speed at the commencement of the shock. The arrange
ment for doing this is shown at O (fig. 1), and is also illustrated
diagrammatically in fig. 2. Referring to the diagram, a and
b represent two levers, which are pivoted at c and d respec
£         On the right-hand end of the lever b a ball e is fixed,
and the weight of this is counterpoised by another ball f,
which rests on a rocking platform g, pivoted on the other end
of the lever. Opposite the end of the rocking platform g, and
fixed to the end of the lever a, there is another platform, h,
which receives the ball f when it rolls off the platform g. The
ball is prevented from rolling sideways by light springs, i i,
fixed to the sides of the platforms. On the end of the lever a,
or on another lever connected with it, the end of the spindle
of the wheel j is supported. This wheel is in gear with the
pinion k, which is on the shaft of the most distant of the two
governors from the driving-power. The ball f is so adjusted
over the pivot of the rocking platform g that an exceedingly
slight disturbance causes it to roll forward on to h, tilting g
over, and at the same time pushing down the end of a and
raising the wheel j out of gear with the pinion k, thus allowing

362               Mr. T. Gray on an Improved
the clockwork to run on without the governor which regulates
the slow speed. The rate of motion then rapidly increases
until the second governor acquires sufficient velocity to con
trol the speed, after which the paper moves forward at a rapid
but uniform rate. In order to again reduce the speed after a
sufficient interval has elapsed, the rolling forward of the ball
f allows the unbalanced weight of e to bring a wheel l, on the
spindle of which a “snail,” m, is fixed, into gear with the
pinion, n, which forms part of the clockwork mechanism.
The spindle of l rests on a spring, o, which is adjusted so as
to push the lower part of the “snail” just into contact with a
pin, p, fixed in the lever b. The weight of eacting through
the pin p on the “snail” deflects the spring o and brings the
wheel l into gear with the pinion n. The “snail” is then gra
dually moved round and raises the ball e and the end of the
lever b, at the same time lowering the rocking platform g.
After this has proceeded so far as to cause the platform g to
come below the lever of h the ball rolls back to its original
position; and, as the “snail” moves round, the platforms
are gradually raised to their original positions, the wheelj
again comes into gear with the pinion k, and the speed is re
duced. The ' l remains in gear with the pinion n for a
short time after the speed is reduced, so as to allow the final
adjustment in position of the platform g and the ball f to be
made gently. After this is accomplished a hollow in m allows
the spring o to push the wheel l out of gear, and everything
is left in readiness for the next disturbance.
   In order to obtain the rate at which the paper is moving at
any instant during the transition period between the slow and
the quick speed, the lever a is made to close an electric circuit
at q, which causes an electromagnetic vibrator, indicated at J
(fig. 3), to come into action and write equal short intervals of
time on the record-sheet.     The short intervals are sometimes
given by a vibrating reed, which is the most convenient
arrangement if the intervals are to be fractions of a second;
but, for marking seconds, a break-circuit arrangement worked
by the clock, k, is preferable. The way in which the siphon,
D, is made to record both the long and the short time-intervals
is sufficiently explained by the diagram, fig. 3.
   One of the “conical pendulums” used for actuating the
siphons which record the two horizontal components of the
motion is illustrated in plan in fig. 4, and in elevation in
fig. 5. It consists of a thin brass cylinder r, filled with lead,
and held deflected by a light tubular strut, s, furnished with
a knife-edge at t, which rests against the bottom of a vertical
V-groove £ to the support u. The weight of the pendu

lum-bob and strut is supported by a thin wire, v, attached at
the lower end to a stirrup, w, pivoted at a a little below and
in front of the centre of gravity of r, and taken at the upper
end over a small wheel, y, to a drum, z, round which the wire
may be wound, so as to adjust the level of the strut, s. The
position of the pivot, w, is so arranged that the knife-edge at
t has little or no tendency to rise or fall, no matter at what
part of the strut the cylinder r may be clamped. The wheel
y is provided with adjusting screws, a1, and b1, by means of
which the top of the wire can be placed vertically above the
knife-edge, or as much in front of or behind that point as may
be necessary to make the period of free vibration of the pen
dulum have any desired length. A light aluminium lever cy
is hinged to the struts at di, and is provided at its outer end
with a small hollow steel cone e1, which may be placed over
one or other of a series of sharp points fi, fixed to the vertical
arm of the cranked lever gi. The lever gi turns round a
horizontal axis at hi in bearings fixed to the ink-well il, and
the vertical arm is hinged at ji, so as to be free to turn in a
direction at right angles to the plane of the crank. A siphon,
ki, is fixed to the horizontal arm of the lever gi, and, drawing
ink from the well il, writes a continuous line on the paper
ribbon. The horizontal arm of the lever gi is made very
flexible in a horizontal direction, and besides can be turned
round a vertical axis to such an extent as allows the pressure
of the point of the siphon on the paper to be adjusted until it
is only sufficient to give a record.
   The horizontal-lever pendulum used for actuating the
siphon which writes the vertical motion is illustrated dia
grammatically in fig. 6. It consists of a horizontal lever, li,
carrying at one end a cylindrical weight m1, and free to turn
round knife-edges n1, fixed to the other end of the lever.
The lever is supported in a horizontal position by two flat
springs, clearly shown in fig. 1, and indicated at ol,      # 6.
 A light aluminium index, pi, pivoted at q1, and connected by
a thin wire or thread to the end of the lever l1, carries a fine
siphon, ri, which rests with one end in the ink-well, si, and
the other end touching the surface of the paper. The end of
 the index is weighted sufficiently to cause it to follow the
 motions of the lever. This arrangement gives a period of
 free vibration of about two seconds in the actual instrument;
 and in order to increase this period a second set of springs,
 indicated at ti, are made to act on knife-edges, u1, fixed ver
tically above ni, so as to add negative stability to the arrange
ment. When the lever is deflected downwards the pull on
 the supporting spring is increased, but at the same time the

364                 Mr. F. Y. Edgeworth on
knife-edge ui comes in front of the vertical plane through n1;
and, since the lower point of attachment of the compensating
spring ti is far below ni, a couple is introduced which com
pensates for the greater upward force. The same is the case
in the reverse order, when the lever is deflected upwards.
Hence if the pull exerted by t. and the other conditions
mentioned below be properly adjusted, the horizontal lever
may be made to have any desired period of free oscillation.
In actual practice some positive stability must be given to
the lever in order that its position of equilibrium may be
definite; but its period may be made so great that, even if
oscillations of considerable amplitude in its own period are
set up, they will be so slow compared with those of the earth
quake, that the undulating line so drawn will still be practi
cally straight, so far as the earthquake record is concerned.
In order to insure good compensation, the condition must be
fulfilled that the rate of variation of the compensating couple
is always the same as that of the supporting couple. If
this be not the case, the pendulum must either be left with
excessive positive stability for small deflections, or it will be
continually liable to become unstable by the compensating
couple becoming too great when the deflection exceeds a cer
tain limit. In the present instance, let the modulus of the
supporting spring be M, the arm at which it acts a ; let the
modulus of the compensating spring be M1, and the distance
between ni and u1 be a1.      Then for a deflection of the lever
equal to 6 we have, on the supposition that the length of the
supporting spring and link is great compared with al, for the
return couple Ma” cos 6 sin 6–Mial cos 6 sin 6–M18 sin 6,
where 8+a1 is the total elongation of the spring for the hori
zontal position of the lever. Now our condition necessitates
S being either zero or negative; and in order to keep within
this condition the length of the unstretched spring and link
are made to reach a little above n1, and the height of u is
made adjustable, so that Mial” can be adjusted to be as near
Ma” as may be desired.
 XLI. On Discordant Observations. By F. Y. EDGEwoRTH,
           M.A., Lecturer at King’s College, London".
Dis'                  observations may be defined as those which
        present the appearance of differing in respect of their
law of frequency from other observations with which they are
combined.     In the treatment of such observations there is
great diversity between authorities; but this discordance of
                    * Communicated by the Author.

                        Discordant Observations.                        365
methods may be reduced by the following reflection. Different
methods are adapted to different hypotheses about the cause of
a discordant observation; and different hypotheses are true, or
appropriate, according as the subject-matter, or the degree of
accuracy required, is different.
   To fix the ideas, I shall specify three hypotheses: not pre
tending to be exhaustive, and leaving it to the practical reader
to estimate the a priori probability of each hypothesis.
   (a) According to the first hypothesis there are only two
species of erroneous observations-errors of observation proper,
and mistakes. The frequency of the former is approximately
represented by the curve y=          $." ; where the constant h
                                     A/T
is the same for all the observations.            But the mathematical
law* only holds for a certain range of error. Beyond certain
limits we may be certain that an error of the first category
does not occur.          On the other hand, errors of the second
category do not occur within those limits. The smallest
mistake is greater than the largest error of observation proper.
The following example is a type of this hypothesis. Suppose
we have a group of numbers, formed each by the addition of
ten digits taken at random from Mathematical Tables. And
suppose that the only possible mistake is the addition or sub
traction of 100 from any one of these sums. Here the errors
proper approximately conform to a probability curve (whosef
modulus is V165), and the mistakest are quite distinct from
the errors proper.
    Here are seven such numbers: each of the first six was
 formed by the addition of ten random digits, and the seventh
by prefixing a one to a number similarly formed—
                45, 23, 31, 50, 42, 45, 136.
   * This follows from the supposition that an error of observation is the
joint result of a considerable, but finite, number of small sources of error.
 The law of facility is in such a case what Mr. Galton calls a Binomial, or
rather a Multinomial. (See his paper in Phil. Mag. Jan. 1875, and the
remarks of the present writer in £ Phil. Trans. 1886, p. 145, and
Phil. Mag. April 1886.)
   t I may remind the reader that I follow Laplace in taking as the
constant or parameter of probability-curves the reciprocal of the coefficient
of v: that is  }  according to the notation used above. It is w? times
the “Mean Error” in the sense in which that term is used by the
Germans, beginning with Gauss, and many recent English writers
(e.g. Chauvenet); and it is Wr times the Mean Error in the (surely more
natural) sense in which Airy, after Laplace, employs the term Mean Error
(Chauvenet's Mean of the Errors).
   1 In physical observations the limit of errors proper must, I suppose,
be more empirical than in this artificial example.

366                                     Mr. F. Y. Edgeworth on
The hypothesis entitles us to assert that 23 is an error-proper
—an accidental deviation from 45; though the odds against
such an event before its occurrence are considerable, about 100
to 1. On the other hand, we may know for certain that 136
is a mistake.
   (8) According to the second hypothesis, the type of error
is still the probability-curve with unvarying constant. But
the range of its applicability is not so accurately known before
hand. We cannot at sight distinguish errors proper from mis
takes. We only know that mistakes may be very large, and
that the large mistakes are so infrequent as not to be likely to
compensate each other in a not unusually numerous group of
observations. This hypothesis may thus be exemplified:–
As before, we have a series of numbers, each purporting to be
the sum of ten random digits. But occasionally, by mistake,
the sum (or difference) of two such numbers is recorded. The
mistake might be large, but it would not always exceed the
limits of accidental deviation (100 and 0); which need not be
supposed known beforehand. Here is a sequence of seven
such numbers, which was actually obtained by me (in the
course of 280 decades)–
                            50, 54, 41, 73, 46,              38,   49.
The hypothesis leaves it doubtful whether 73 may not be a
mistake; the odds against it being an ordinary accidental
deviation being, before the event, about 250 to 1.
    (y) According to the third hypothesis all errors are of the
type     v=#."                              But the h is not the same for different
observations. Mistakes may be regarded as emanating from
a source of error whose h is very small. This hypothesis may
be thus illustrated. Take at random any number n between
 certain limits, say 1 and 100. Then take at random (from
 Mathematical Tables) n digits, add them together and form
 their Mean (the sum + n), and multiply this Mean by ten.
 The series of Means so formed may be regarded as measure
 ments of varying precision; the real value of the object mea
 sured being 45. The weight, the h”, being proportionate to n,
 one weight is a priori as likely as another. In order that the
 different degrees of precision, the equicrescent values of h,
 should be à priori equiprobable, it would be proper, having
 formed our n as above, to take the mean of (and then mul
 tiply by 10), not n, but n” digits. Here is a series formed
 in this latter fashion :
    7t. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   5   7    6     1    10     8     1

      random digits

                       Discordant Observations.                   367
   In this table the first row is obtained by taking at random
ten digits from a page of Statistics, 0 counting for ten. The
second row consists of the squares of these numbers. The
third row was thus formed from the second :—I took 25
random digits, and divided their sum by 25; then multiplied
this mean by 10. I similarly proceeded with 49 (fresh) digits,
and so on. It will be noticed how the defective precision of
the fourth and seventh observations makes itself felt. It was,
however, a chance that they both erred as far as they could,
and in the same direction.
    In the light of these distinctions I propose now to examine
the different methods of treating discordant observations. For
this purpose the methods may be arranged in the following
groups:
   I. '.    first sort of method is based upon the principle that
the calculus of probabilities supplies no criterion for the cor
rection of discordance. All that we can do is to reject certain
huge errors by common sense or simple induction as distin
guished from the calculation of a posteriori probability.
   II. Or, secondly, we may reject observations upon the
ground that they are proved by the Calculus of Probability
to belong to a much worse category than the observations
retained.
    III. Or, thirdly, we may retain all the observations, affecting
them respectively with weights which are determined by
a posteriori probability.
    IV. In a separate category may be placed a method which,
as compared with the simple Arithmetical Mean, reduces the
effect (upon the Mean) of discordant observations—the method
which consists in taking the Mediant or “Centralwerth”; of
 the observations.
    I propose now to test these methods by applying them in
 turn to all the hypotheses above specified.
    I. (a) The first method—which is none other than Airy's,
 as I understand his contribution# to this controversy—is
 adapted to the first hypothesis. Upon the second hypothesis
 (8) the first method is liable to error, which, as will be shown
 under the next heading, is avoidable. ("y) Upon the third
 hypothesis the first method is not theoretically the most
 precise; but it may be practically very good.
    II. Under the second class '' am acquainted with three

species: the criteria of Prof. Stone", Prof. Chauvenett, and
Prof. Peircet.
    II. (1) Prof. Stone's method is to reject an observation
when it is more likely to have been a mistake than an error
of observation of the same type as the others. In deter
mining this probability he takes account of the a priori
probability of a mistake. He puts for that probability                   #
admitting that n cannot be determined precisely. The use of
undetermined constants like this is, I think, quite legitimates,
and, indeed, indispensable in the calculation of probabilities.
This being recognized, Prof. Stone's method may be justified
upon almost any hypothesis. Hypothesis (a) presents two
cases: where the discordant observation exceeds that limit of
errors proper which is known beforehand, and where that
limit is not exceeded. For example, in the instance given
above—where 45 is the Mean, and the Modulus" is about 13–
the discordant observation might be either above 100 (e.g. 110)
or below it (e.g. 84). Now let us suppose that the a priori
probability of a mistake is not infinitesimal, but say of the
order Ioloo. Since the deviation of 110 from the Mean is
about five times the Modulus, the probability of this deviation
occurring under the typical law of error is nearly a millionth.
This observation is therefore rejected by Method II. (1), which
so far agrees with Method I. Again, the probability of 84
being an accidental deviation is less than a forty-thousandth;
84–45 being about three times the Modulus. Therefore 84 also
is rejected by the criterion. And we thus lose an observation
which is by hypothesis (a) a good one. But this loss occurs
very rarely. And the observation thrown away is, to say the
least, not” a particularly good one, though doubtless it may
happen that it is particularly wanted—as in the case of Gen.
Colby, adducedff by Sir G. Airy.
   II. (1) (8) The second hypothesis is that to which Prof.
Stone’s criterion is specially adapted. Upon this hypothesis,
84 may be a mistake. In rejecting such discordant observa
tions, we may indeed lose some good observations, especially if

we have exaggerated the & priori probability of a mistake. But
it may be worth while paying this price for the sake of getting
rid of serious mistakes. Especially is this position tenable
according to the definition of the quaesitum in the Theory
of Errors”, which Laplace countenances. According to this
view, the desideratum in a method of reduction is not so
much that it should be most frequently right, as that it should
be most advantageous; account being taken, not only of the
frequency, but also of the seriousness, of the errors which it
incurs. Prof. Stone's method might diminish our chance of
being right (in the sense of being within a certain very small
distance from the true markt); and yet it might be better than
Method I., if it considerably reduced the frequency of large
and detrimental mistakes.
    II. (1) (y) Prof. Stone’s method is less applicable to the
third hypothesis. Though even in this case, if the smaller
weights are & priori comparatively rare, it may be safe enough
to regard (n-1) of the m observations as of one and the
same type; and to reject the mth if violently discordant with
that supposed type.                                                      -
   The only misgiving which I should venture to express
about this method relates, not to its essence and philosophy,
but to a technical detail. Prof. Stone says:—“If we find that
value which makes        ...!.
                          A/T    p
                                   e-y’dy = 1. [where p is the devia

tion of a discordant observation, and a is the modulus of the
probability-curve under which the other observations range,
and n is the a priori probability of a mistake], all larger
values of p are with greater probability to be attributed to
mistakes.” But ought we not rather to equate to not the        #
left-hand member of the equation just written, which may be
called   6(£), but 6m (#) where m is the number of observa
tions. ...I am aware that the point is delicate, and that high
authority could be cited on the other side. There is some

deviation from the Mean in the case of Departmental returns
of the proportion between male and female births is signifi
cant and indicative of a difference in kind, provided that we
select at random a single French Department; but that the
same deviation may be accidental if it is the maximum of the
 respective returns for several Departments. There is some
 thing plausible in De Morgan's" implied assertion that the
 deficiency of seven in the first 608 digits of the constant Tris
theoretically not accidental; because the deviation from the
 Mean 61 amounts to twicet the Modulus of that probability
 curve which represents the frequency of deviation for any
 assigned digit. I submit, however, that Cournot is right, and
 that De Morgan, if he is serious in the passage referred to, has
 committed a slight inadvertence. When we select out of the ten
 digits the one whose deviation from the Mean is greatest, we
 ought to estimate the improbability of this deviation occurring
 by accident, not with De Morgan as 1–6(1-63), corresponding
 to odds of about 45 to 1 against the observed event having
 occurred by accident; but as 1–6"(1.63), corresponding to
 odds of about 5 to 1 against an accidental origination.
    II. (2) Prof. Chauvenet's criterion differs from Prof.
 Stone's in that he makes the a priori probability of a mistake
 —instead of being small and undetermined—definite and con
 siderable. In effect he assumes that a mistake is as likely as not
 to occur in the course of m observations, where m is the number
 of the set which is under treatment. It is not within the scope
 of this paper to consider whether this assumption is justified
 in the case of astronomical or of any other observations. It
 suffices here to remark that this assumption coupled with
  hypothesis (a) commits us to the supposition that huge mis
  takes occur on an average once in the course of 2m observa
  tions. Upon this supposition no doubt Method II. (2), is a
  good one. Hypothesis (8) expressly; excludes this suppo
  sition; the mistakes which, according to II. (2), are as likely
  as not, must, according to this second hypothesis, be of
  moderate extent. Thus, in the case above put of sums of ten
  digits, suppose that the number of such sums under observa
  tion is ten. According to Prof. Chauvenet's criterion we
  must reject any sum which lies outside 45+ k, where

                        Discordant Observations.                     371
 This gives for the required limit about 15. According, then,
 to II. (1) (8), any observation greater than 60, or less than 30,
 is more likely than not to be a mistake in the sense of not
 belonging to the same law of frequency as the observations
 within those limits. But why on that ground should the
 discordant observation be rejected ? Suppose there were not
 merely a bare preponderance of probability, but an actual
 certainty, that the suspected observation belonged to a different
 category in respect of precision from its neighbours, the best
 course certainly would be if possible (as Mr. Glaisher in his
 paper “On the Rejection of Discordant Observations” sug
 £        to retain the observation affected with an inferior weight.
    ut if we have only the alternative of rejecting or retaining
 whole, it is a very delicate question whether retention or re
 jection would be in the long run better. There is not here
 the presumption against retention which arises when, as in
 II. (1), the discordant observation is large and rare; so that,
 if it is a mistake, it is likely to be a serious and an uncom
 pensated one. However, Prof. Chauvenet's method may
 quite possibly be better than the No-method of Sir G. Airy.
 Much would turn upon the purpose of the calculator—whether
 he aimed at being most frequently right" or least seriously
 wrong. The same may be said w: reference to hypo
 thesis (y).
     There is a further difficulty attaching particularly to this
 species of Method II. In its precise determination of a limit,
 it takes for granted that the probability-curve to which we
 refer the discordant observation is accurately determined.
 But, when the number of observations is small, this is far
 from being the case. Neither of the parameters of the curve,
 neither the Mean, nor the Modulus, can be safely regarded as
 accurate. The “probable error” of the Mean is 477                  3.  *
 where c is the Modulus. The probable error of the Modulus
 is conjectured to be not inconsiderable from the fact that, if
 we took m observations at random, squared each of them and
 formed the Mean-square-of-error, the “probable error” of that
 Mean-square-of-error would be 477 v. f.              This, however, is
 not the most accurate expression for the probable error of the
 Modulus-squared as inferred # from any given n observations.

 just referred to–that the limit must be pushed forward as
  much again; so that the suspected observation falls within
  the corrected limit. I have similarly treated the example
  £ by Prof. Merriman in his              Teactbook on The Method of
    east Squares (131). The limit found by him is 4:30, and
  he therefore rejects the observation 4:61.          But I find that
  this observation is well within the corrected limit".
     II. (3) Prof. Peirce's criterion is open to the same objec
 tions as that of Prof. Chauvenet. Indeed it presents additional
 difficulties. If by y the author designates that quantity which
 Prof. Stone calls    :  and which I have termed the “à priori”
 probability of a mistake, I am unable to follow the reasoning
 by which he obtains a definite value for this y. But I am
 aware how easy it is on such subjects to misunderstand an
 original writer.
     III. We come now to the third class of method, of which
 I am acquainted with three species. (1) There is the procedure
 indicated by De Morgan and developed f by Mr. Glaisher;
 which consists in approximating to the weights which are to be
 assigned to the observations respectively, after the analogy of
 the  £ of Series and similar processes. (2) Another
 method, due to Prof. Stone t, is to put
        P=hih, . . . e-****** . . . x dhidh, . . .
 as the a posteriori probability of the given observations having
 resulted from a particular system of weights hi”h,” &c., and a
 particular Mean v ; and to determine that system so that P
 should be a maximum. (3) Another variety is due to Prof.
Newcomb $.
     III. (1) &   £     Neither of the first two Methods are well
 adapted to the first two hypotheses. Both indeed may success
 fully treat mistakes by weighting them so lightly as virtually to
 reject them. But both, 1 venture to think, are liable to err in
 underweighting observations, which, upon the first two hypo
 theses, have the same law of frequency as the others. Both, in
 fact, are avowedly adapted to the case where the observations
    * These corrections may be compensated by another correction to which
 the method is open. In determining whether the suspected observation
 belongs to the same type as the others, would it not be more correct to
 deduce the characters of that type from those others, exclusive of the
suspected observation ? The effect both on the Mean and the Modulus
would be such as to contract the limit.

distribution of sources which is contemplated by the De
Morgan-Glaisher Method, has not perhaps been stated by
its distinguished advocates. The particular assumption made
by the other Method is that one value of each h is as likely as
another over a certain range of values—not necessarily between
infinite limits. I have elsewhere" discussed the validity of
this assumption. I have also attempted to reduce the in

    III. (3) Prof. Newcomb" soars high above the others, in
that he alone ascends to the philosophical, the utilitarian,
principles on which depends the whole art of reducing obser
vations. Here are whole pages devoted to estimating and
minimizing the Evil incident to malobservation. With Gauss,
Prof. Newcomb assumest “that the evil of an error is pro
£            to the square of its magnitude.” He would doubt
 ess admit, with Gauss, that there is something arbitrary in
this assumption. Another somewhat hypothetical datum is
what het describes as the “distribution of precisions.” In view
of this looseness in the data, it becomes a nice question
whether it is worth while expending much labour upon the
calculation. The answer to this question depends upon an
estimate of probability and utility, concerning which no one
is competent to express an opinion who has not, on the one
hand, a philosophical conception of the Theory of Errors, and,
on the other hand, a practical acquaintance with the art of
Astronomy. The double qualification is probably possessed
by none in a higher degree than by the distinguished astro
nomer to whom we owe this method.

perchlorate may be decomposed by heat in such a manner as
to lead in each case to various relations among the products
of decomposition.
    It has occurred to me that both of these chemical changes
are instances of Cumulative Resolution”, from which point
of view they admit of very simple, and at the same time
perfectly adequate, representation.

 the quotient of the percentage of chloride produced by that
 of the oxygen formed as the specific measure of the change;
 the percentage being calculated on the weight of chlorate
 taken for trial. If this quantity be called r, the equation
 alleges that

   There is a fair agreement in comparisons 5 and 6. The
discrepancy in 7 arises in great part from the fact that the
form of the function renders it difficult to deduce accurately
such high values of n as 15-970 from experiments of not
exceptional accuracy. If, for example, n=30, r=1:1275,
which differs very little indeed from r=1:1287, when n=
15-970 r. It is probable also that the chlorate (never actually
exceeding more than about 4 per cent. of the perchlorate)
was decidedly underestimated. Additional experiments on
this subject are much to be desired.

   It is usual in chemical change for a critical relation to be
established when certain of the reagents are present in equal
weights. Thus, in the chlorate reaction, if the ratio of
chloride to oxygen be that of equality in weight, r=1; and
the equation
                         42867 –":  n-2
then gives n="24970.
   Similarly, in the case of the perchlorate, where
                                    n-1
if r=1, n=4.0048—i.e. the reciprocal of the previous value
of n. It appears then that, subject to the condition indi
cated, the reaction whereby perchlorate is decomposed is the
exact inverse of the chlorate reaction.

 XLIII. Reply to Prof. Wilhelm Ostwald's criticism on my
       paper “On the Chemical Combination of Gases.”
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
     ROFESSOR WILHELM OSTWALD, in a work en
        titled Lehrbuch der Allgemeinen Chemie (Bd. ii.
p. 745), has criticised my paper on the Chemical Combina
tion of Gases published in the Philosophical Magazine, Octo
ber 1884, in which I applied the Williamson-Clausius theory
of dissociation to the solution of several problems in the theory
of the combination of gases. I wish in this letter to answer
this criticism, and, in order to make my meaning clear, I
must recapitulate one part of the paper. According to the
Williamson-Clausius hypothesis, the molecules of a gas are
continually splitting up into atoms, so that the atoms are
continually changing partners. I defined the “paired” time
 of an atom to be the average time an atom remained in part
 nership with another atom, and the “free time ’’ the average
 time which elapses between the termination of one partner
 ship and the beginning of the next. Now the free time will
 evidently depend upon the number of free atoms in the unit
 volume, for before an atom can be paired again, it must come
 into collision with another atom; and though it need not get
 paired at the first collision, yet it is evident that the time it
 remains “free” will be proportional to the time between two
 collisions, and, therefore, inversely proportional to the number
 of free atoms in unit volume. But after the atom has got
  paired with another, there is no reason why the time they
  remain together should depend upon the number of molecules,
 unless we assume that the atoms are knocked apart by colli
  sion with other molecules.
     As one of my reasons for undertaking the investigation
  was, that an eminent spectroscopist had mentioned to me that
  there was spectroscopic evidence to show that the molecules
  got split up independently of the collisions, and as I wished
  to see if I could get any evidence of this from the phenomena
  of dissociation, it would have been absurd on my part to beg
  the question by assuming that the paired time was inversely
  proportional to the number of atoms. I therefore made no
  supposition as to the dependence of the paired time on the
  number of atoms, except when the dissociation was produced
  by an external agency, such as the electric discharge, but left it
  to be determined from the experiments.
     The above reasoning seems to me to be clear enough, but
  as it is substantially the same as that in my paper, and Prof.
   Ostwald says it is difficult to conceive how it is that I have

380           On the Chemical Combination of Gases.
not noticed that the paired time is inversely proportional to
the number of atoms, I must endeavour to find some way of
explaining myself which shall not entail the necessity of form
ing any abstract conceptions.        Let us then illustrate the
pairing of a molecule by the act of getting into a cab, and a
gas by a number of men and cabs, the men riding about in the
cabs, getting out,and after walking about for a time getting into
a cab again. To fix our ideas, let us suppose that after leaving
a cab, each man gets into the sixth cab he meets. Then it is
evident that the time he spends on foot (his “free time”)
will depend upon the number of cabs, the more cabs the
shorter the time; and if the cabs are evenly distributed, his
“free time” will be inversely proportional to the number of
cabs. But after getting into a cab, unless he is upset by a
collision with another cab, there is no reason why the time
he stays in his cab should depend upon the number of cabs.
Prof. Ostwald’s remark, when applied to this case, is—it
is difficult to conceive how it is that I have not noticed that
the only way of getting out of a cab is to wait until one is
shot out by the collision of one's own cab with another. But
difficult as the conception is, Prof. Ostwald is equal to it, for
in a footnote he suggests that the reason is that I knew
 what the result ought to be, and so “cooked” my equations
 accordingly. Now I should not have thought it worth while
 to reply to criticism of this order had it not been that the
 subject of the application of mathematics to chemistry is only
 dealt with in a few text-books, so that it is important to point
 out any misrepresentations and misstatements in those which
   rofess to explain this subject. The amusing part of Prof.
 £ criticism is that when, after his tirade, he attempts
 to obtain one of my equations, he implicity assumes that the
 molecules are not split up by the collisions, for he assumes
 that the number of molecules split up in a given time is pro
 portional to the average number of molecules. Now, if we
 refer to the illustration of the cabs, it will be evident at once
 that this is equivalent to assuming that the collisions have
 nothing to do with the breaking-up of the molecules, for if
 the men were shot out of their cabs by collisions with cabs
 with men inside, the number leaving £ cabs in any time
 would be increased fourfold if the number of men in cabs
 were doubled, for the number of men in cabs would be
 doubled, and the average time they spend in the cabs would
be halved.
    It may illustrate the care with which the book has been
written, and the reliance to be placed on its contents, if I
 mention that within about half a page Prof. Ostwald makes
three misstatements. He says that an equation he obtains by

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.            381
a process of his own is the same as one of mine, though it is
not ; he says that I sometimes suppose the free time to be
constant, and sometimes to depend on the number of atoms,
when I do not; and, lastly, that I have not stated what
meaning I attach to T, when on page 238, line 44, I have
defined it to be the free time multiplied by the number of atoms.

     ON CERTAIN MODIFICATIONS OF A FoRM OF SPHERICAL
                            INTEGRATOR,
      To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
I   HAD occasion recently to read in the Philosophical Magazine
     (August 1886) the very interesting description of a “Spherical
Integrator,” designed by Mr. Frederick John Smith, and which
appears to be a modification of that of Prof. Hele Shaw. But the
first conception of these apparatus, and it is to this that I wish to
call your attention, belongs without doubt to me, as in No. 630 of
“Nature’ (Nov.24, 1881) I gave a description of an “Anemometer
Integrator” founded on the same principle, and which was after
wards mentioned in the Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteoro
logical Society, No. 43(1882), by Mr Laughton (“Historical Sketch
of Anemometry and Anemometers”).                         -  -
   The modification designed by Mr. F. J. Smith tending to do
away with or lessen, as much as possible, the moment of inertia of
the sphere, appears to me excellent, especially if it is to transmit
velocities of small magnitude. But when it is simply required to
register that of the wind upon a moderate scale, I believe that the
primitive form suffices; and after several trials which I have made,
an ivory ball rolling on bronze cylinders is that which gives the best
results.
   I beg, Gentlemen, that you will allow this claim of priority to
appear in your valuable Journal, and also that you will accept my
most sincere thanks and the assurance of my marked regard.

    ON THE STRENGTH OF THE TERRESTRIAL MAGNETIC FIELD
                 IN BUILDINGS.     BY M. AIME WITZ.
   In consequence of the removal of my laboratory to a new
building in which the joists and framework are of iron, I have
been led to determine exactly the values of the horizontal com
ponent in the various rooms used for Physics, with a view to
certain researches which I have undertaken.           I have observed

382            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
astonishing discrepancies; and I think it useful to draw the attention
of physicists to this subject, which has been but little studied.
   A simple method of measuring the horizontal intensity consists
in passing a constant current through a circuit containing a weight
voltameter, and a tangent-galvanometer. By determining the
absolute strength of the current on the one hand by the results of
electrolysis, and on the other by the deflection of a compass
needle, and equating these two values, we can get the value of T at
the spot where the galvanometer was placed. This method was
of sufficient exactitude for the work of comparison in which I was
engaged.
    A Poggendorff's battery may be used; this is a very constant
 source when the chromic liquid is strongly acid, and the external
 resistance is great. As an electrolyte I took a 10 per cent.
 solution of pure copper sulphate; the copper electrodes at a
 distance of about 30 mm. had 12 square centimetres immersed;
 from this resulted a favourable density of current, and therefore a
beautiful deposit of metal which was continuous and perfectly
 adherent. The loss of the soluble electrode was always equal to
within 5 mgr. to the gain of the negative electrode. The intensity
 of the current, which was about # of an ampere, was determined to
 within Twn of an ampere; it was assumed that 1190 mgr. was
 deposited per ampere-hour. Two good tangent-galvanometers
were used simultaneously; their constants are as follows:—
                            Length              Mean      Number
    Galva-          A-           --            radius.       of     -

    The needles are suspended to a cocoon-thread; the long pointers
 of aluminum enable us to read T', of a degree. The relative
 dimensions of the needles and of the frames are in these two
 instruments in such a ratio, that we may dispense with the use of
 the term of correction, which I have considered proportional to the
 tangent of the deflection 8.                                          -
    The manipulation was very simple; the element having been
 shortcircuited for a few minutes, the current was passed for an
 hour through the voltameter and the galvanometer. Two double
 readings were made after five and twenty-five minutes; the current
 being reversed in the galvanometer after thirty-five and fifty-five
 minutes. The mean of these eight readings gives the value of the
 mean deflection of the needle in the course of the operation. It
 remained to weigh the electrodes, and to take the mean p of the
 loss and gain of the plates in milligrammes. The formula
                           1   p           R. T= tan   8
                          10 1190        2wn
 leads to the value of T in C.G.S. units; and the same operations
 repeated in various places enable us to discover considerable

      It follows from these researches that T may be reduced by 40 or
   50 per cent. in a building made of iron; hence the same current

   ON METALLIC LAYERS WHICH RESULT FROM THE VOLATILIZA
           TION OF A KATHODE.       BY BERNHARD DESSAU.
    The results of the present investigation may be summed up as
 follows:–
    By appropriate electrical discharge in highly rarefied spaces, the
 metal which acts as kathode is volatilized and settles on a glass plate
 as a reflecting layer or mirror. If the oxygen has not been most
 carefully removed, all metals seem to undergo oxidation under these
 circumstances. There is perhaps in all cases a combination with
 the traces of residual gas (hydrogen or nitrogen), yet the mirrors
 obtained in hydrogen are not materially different from those of pure
 metals. With suitable arrangement of the electrodes the layer of
 metal is obtained as a flat cone; and when viewed in reflected light,
 under as acute an angle as possible, coloured interference-rings are
 obtained, which prove the presence of a dispersion in the metals. It
 may be concluded with some certainty that this dispersion is normal
 in platinum, iron, nickel, and silver, and abnormal with gold and
 copper. The layer directly produced by the discharge, whether it
 be metal or oxide, is always double refracting, probably in conse
 quence of an electrical repulsion between the particles expelled, and
 the regular stratification thereby produced; in the metals the ray
 which vibrates tangentially is accelerated in respect of the others.
 In the metals the cross of double refraction was also observed in
 reflected light, and in reflection from the metal side the action
 was the reverse, and from the glass side the same as in transmitted
 light. Double refraction disappears on oxidation of the double
 refracting metals, as well as by reduction of the layers of oxide,
 while heating without any chemical change has no effect.—Wiede
 mann's Annalen, No. 11, 1886.
    ON THE PASSAGE OF THE ELECTRIC CURRENT THROUGH AIR
      UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES.            BY J. BORGMANN.
    One end of the coil of a Wiedemann's galvanometer is connected
 with the earth, and the other with a platinum wire, which is placed
 in the flame of an insulated spirit-lamp. At a distance of 13 metre
 from this lamp is an ordinary Bunsen burner, which is connected
 with a conductor of the Holtz machine; the other conductor is put
 to earth.
    When the lamp is lighted the galvanometer indicates no current;
 but when the disk is rotated a distinct current at once appears in
 the galvanometer, and the deflection of the needle does not alter so
 long as the machine works at a uniform rate. If the Bunsen
 burner is connected with the other conductor of the machine, a
 current in the opposite direction is at once set up.—Beiblätter der
Physik, January 1887.

 XLV. On the Expansion of Salt-Solutions. By W. W. J.
    NICOL, M.A., D.Sc., F.R.S.E., Lecturer on Chemistry,
    Mason College, Birmingham”.
                             [Plates W. & VI.]
 TH' is a         subject which has at no time attracted much
        attention. With the exception of the experiments of
 Bischoff, Muncke, Despretzt, and Rosettit, which deal
 with special cases, such as the expansion of sea-water, we are
indebted to Gerlach $ and Kremers | for the whole of our
knowledge of the subject; and this may be summed up as
follows:–
   1. The rate of expansion of a salt-solution is the more
uniform the more concentrated the solution.            Thus, while the
line representing the volume of pure water at various tempe
ratures is very pronounced in curvature, the lines correspond
ing to the volumes of various solutions of a salt approximate
more and more to a straight line the stronger the solution
(Gerlach, loc. cit.).                *
   2. As a consequence of the above it follows that salt-solu
tions expand faster than water at low temperatures; but that
at high temperatures, on the other hand, the rate of expansion
is less than that of water.

   3. So markedly is this the case that at or below 100° C.
the difference between the volumes of water and of a salt
solution of the same volume at 0°C. actually changes its sign
in many cases.
   4. It is therefore possible in the case of every salt-solution
to find a temperature at which its coefficient of expansion is
the same as that of water at that temperature. According to
de Heen" this temperature is dependent only on the nature
of the salt, and is the same whatever be the strength of the
solution. Kremerst, on the contrary, holds that this last has
some slight influence.
   5. No connexion can be traced between the expansion of
a salt in the solid state and that of its solution (Gerlach, loc.
cit.).
   In the course of experiments on the nature of solution it
appeared to me probable that there exists a connexion be
tween the increase of solubility with rise of temperature and
the rate of expansion of solutions of the salts. With the
object of ascertaining whether or not such a connexion exists
I made a series of experiments on the subject; for I found
that the results obtained by previous experimenters either
were not numerous enough or required confirmation. While
in all cases they were not suited for my purpose, owing to
the solutions experimented with being of percentage com
position, and thus requiring recalculation into terms of mole
cules of salt per 100 H2O. Even when this was done the
differences in the strengths of the various solutions were so
irregular that any conclusions derivable from the results were
extremely unsatisfactory.                      -
   The present paper contains the results of experiments on
solutions of the four salts NaCl, KCl, NaNO3, and KNO3, at
temperatures between 20° C. and 80°C. The solutions were
as nearly as possible molecular, and differed from one another
in the case of each salt by two molecules of salt; for the
reasons given below, it will be seen that it is almost impossible
to use solutions of the precise composition aimed at. Still
the error thus introduced is practically eliminated by the
method of calculation employed.
   In the determination of the expansion of a liquid two
general methods are available, each presenting certain points
of advantage over the other. I finally decided to employ the
dilatometric in preference to the pycnometric method; and I
had the less hesitation in doing so, as I found it possible to

construct a constant-temperature bath, which removed all the
difficulties and inaccuracies attending the use of long tubes.
    As I wished, so far as possible, to experiment with solu
tions of definite molecular composition, and at the same time
to avoid the multiplication of calibration and other corrections,
it was not possible to employ dilatometérs with tubes suf
 ficiently large in internal diameter to permit of the introduc
tion of the solution through the graduated tube. I therefore
modified the form of dilatometer devised by Kremers (loc. cit.),
so that it presented the appearance shown in Pl. W. fig. 1. The
bulb A is furnished with a tube at either end. One of these,
B, is short and bent round parallel with the side of the
bulb; it is about 3 millim. external and 1 millim. internal dia
meter, but at the free end is thickened and narrowed to about
0.2 millim.    A shoulder is formed about 20 millim. from the
free end, by which the closing apparatus is attached. The
measuring-tube, C, is about 700 millim. long, and is divided
into millimetres from -10 millim. to 600 millim. The gra
duated tubes were obtained from Geissler, of Bonn, and after
calibration were sealed on to bulbs of suitable capacity.
The dilatometer is filled through the short tube, the end of
which is flat, and is closed by an indiarubber pad screwed
down by the clamp shown in fig. 2.
    The calibration of the tubes was performed as follows:—
   A short thread of mercury was passed through the tube
and measured at every 20 millim. It was found that the
bore was extremely uniform in all the tubes, no abrupt change
being perceptible. As the tubes were so long and so uniform, it
was considered unnecessary to do more than calibrate them
for more than every 100 millim. Thus, in the case of one
of the dilatometers Dv, a thread of mercury had the following
lengths at various parts of the tube:—
            At 0 millim. length was 110 millim.
                100    ,        35      111     27
                200    ,        99      111     ,
                300     ,       25      111     77
                400    ,        35      111.5    ,
               500     22       55      110     35
Mean value 110.7.
   The mean value in grammes of mercury of each millimetre
was obtained by weighing the mercury required to fill nearly
the whole of the graduated part of the tube. In the case
above 594 millim. contained 2.723 grm. mercury, or 1 millim.
contained 0.00459 grm.

    From the data thus obtained the bulbs were proportioned
 to each tube, so that the value of each millim. in terms of the
 total capacity of the bulb should lie between 0.00004 and
 0.00006.    When the bulbs had been sealed on, the dilato
 meters were filled with mercury at 20° C. up to the zero
  mark on the stem, and the weight of the mercury was deter
 mined.    In the case above this was 79.93 grm. Thus the
 mean value of 1 millim. of the stem was 5'74, that of the bulb
 and stem up to the zero being 100,000. This was then cor
 rected according to the calibration results for every 100 millim.,
 giving :
               0–100 = 5·778          300–400 = 5·713
            100–200 = 5.713           400–500 = 5'701
            200–300 = 5.718           500–600 = 5.778.
    The coefficient of expansion of the glass was determined in
 each case by both mercury and water. With the above dila
 tometer the apparent expansion of mercury between 20°C.
 and 78°.8 C. was found to be 100,914-6. Calculated from
 Landolt's tables the true volume is 101,069, difference 154'4.
 The volume of water was 102,483.8, calculated 102,637.8,
 difference 154'0, giving coefficient for glass=0.00002.62.
    Of the various dilatometers thus made only three were used
 in the following experiments. In these the mean value of
 1 millim. of the stem was D1=4'81, DIV =5:51, Dv =5.74.
    The thermometers employed were two by Geissler and two
 by Negretti and Zambra. These last were verified at Kew.
 Those by Geissler were from 20°-60°C., and from 40°-100°C.,
 and were divided into 10ths; one of the others was from
 -10°–40°C., also in Iloths, and the fourth from -10°-110°C.,
 divided into half degrees (a very open scale). These were
 carefully compared together and corrected at 20°, 45°–46°,
 50°-51°, 56–57°, 61°–62°, 67–68°, 72°–73°, and 78°–80°
 the temperatures at which determinations were to be made.
 The comparisons were made in two constant-temperature
baths, one at 20°C., the other being the one employed for
heating the dilatometers.
   The constancy of temperature was in this last case obtained
by means of the vapour of a liquid boiling under a constant
pressure variable at will. The liquid in this case was a mixture
of alcohol and water boiling at about 82° at 760 millim. The
apparatus consists of two parts, the dilatometer-bath with boiler
and condenser, and the pressure-regulator.
   The bath is shown in fig. 3. It consists of two glass tubes,
one within the other, diameters 65 and 45 millim., and re
spective lengths 900 and 700 millim. The longer and wider
of the tubes is drawn out at one end to about 15 millim.

                   Expansion of Salt-Solutions.               389
diameter; the shorter tube is closed and rounded at the lower
end. A brass cap, firmly cemented on to the wide end of the
outer tube, carries the side tube bent at right angles, by which
communication is made with the Y-shaped condenser. The
inner tube is secured air-tight in the cap by an indiarubber
cork, the lower end being kept in the centre of the outer tube
by a ring with three projecting arms. The free upper end
of the Y-condenser communicates with the pressure-regulator,
a Woulff's bottle being interposed to retain any liquid boil
ing over. The lower end of the Y passes to the bottom of the
boiler, which is a stout copper cylinder 150 millim. high and
120 millim. in diameter, and stands on a solid flame-burner.
   When the boiler has been one third filled with alcohol, the
whole apparatus is made as nearly air-tight as possible, and
connected with the pressure-regulator. The inner tube is
filled with water, the gas is lighted, and the pressure is re
duced the desired amount. The vapour of the boiling alcohol
passes up between the two tubes, entirely surrounding the
inner for its whole length. At first the condensed alcohol
flows back into the boiler; but as the temperature of the water
in the inner tube rises, the alcohol vapour passes into the
condenser and thus back to the boiler, complete condensation
being insured by the second limb of the Y-tube.
   The pressure-regulator is shown at fig. 4: it is based partly
on that proposed by Meyer, and partly on the modification
introduced by Stadel and Schummann". It consists of a
firm wooden stand some 900 millim. high by 200 millim.
wide. A gauge, standing side by side with a £ in a
trough of mercury in front of a mirror-millimetre scale, is
connected with a tube passing across the stand near the top,
and bent down as shown on one side, ending in a wide closed
cylinder. The tube is furnished with two stopcocks, the upper
to establish communication with the air when desired, the
other communicating with the bath. On the other side of the
gauge there is a T-piece, the vertical limb of which passes
through the stand, while the horizontal limb leads to the
“cut-off.” This arrangement is shown on a larger scale at
the side A.    It consists of a narrow tube some 300 millim.
long, opening at the top into the wide tube furnished with a
narrow side tube. Into the upper end of the wide tube is
 fastened air-tight another tube, only slightly narrower; it is
contracted at the lower end to a small orifice, and a small
hole is made at the shoulder. (The delicacy of the regulation
depends to a large extent upon the proper size and position
of this opening.) To the upper end of this tube, which is
           * Zeitschrift für Instrumentenkunde, 1882, p. 391.

 390                 Dr. W. W. J. Nicol on the
 about 400 millim. long, is attached a narrow tube which
  asses down behind the stand and leads to the pump, a small
 W' bottle being interposed to catch any mercury which
 may splash over. A reservoir of mercury, capable of being
 raised and lowered, attached to the lower end, makes the “cut
 off” complete.
    On the back of the stand is pivoted a wooden bar about
 800 millim. long, and capable of being fixed at any angle by
 the thumb-screw passing through the stand. This bar carries
 a tube about 10 millim. internal diameter, and closed at one
 end with a side tube about 20 millim. from the other.       The
 tube is filled to a depth of about 700 millim. with mercury,
 and a capillary passing through the cork which closes the
 end and reaching to the bottom establishes communication
 with the air when the pressure is sufficient to overcome that
 of the column of mercury in the tube (the height of this
 column being determined by the inclination of the tube).
 Connexion with the remainder of the apparatus is made by
 an indiarubber tube attached to the side tube and to the end
 of the T-piece which passes through the stand.
    The pressure-regulator is used as follows:—The water
 £ is set in action, and the mercury-reservoir being lowered
  oth stopcocks are closed. When the pressure as indicated
 by the gauge is about that which is required, the reservoir is
 raised till the mercury just reaches the end of the “cut-off,”
 and a screw-clip on the tube to the pump is closed till only a
 few bubbles of air pass the “cut-off.” Then the tube at back
 of stand is slowly inclined till air begins to bubble through
the mercury. The clip is slightly opened; and if the pressure
be too great, the reservoir is lowered, and the inclined tube
placed more upright. With a little care, and with at least
50 millim. of mercury above the side hole of the “cut-off,”
it is possible even with very variable water-pressure (provided
the pump have a Bunsen valve) to maintain the pressure in
the apparatus itself constant within 1 or 2 millim.; while if
an air-reservoir be interposed between the regulator and a
separate gauge, the pressure in this last can be kept absolutely
constant.
   With this regulator I succeeded in maintaining a constant
temperature in the dilatometer-bath for any required time;
while the temperature of the whole column of water, 700
millim. long, was so uniform, that, without stirring, the differ
ence between the top and bottom did not exceed 0°:2 C. The
dilatometers were used in pairs: two placed side by side in a
small wire cage along with the thermometers being lowered
into the bath to within 50 millim. of the bottom.

                   Expansion of Salt-Solutions.              391
    I have entered thus minutely into the details of the appa
ratus employed, as it seems to me that it supplies the means
of filling up the gap left by the paper of Ramsay and Young"
on the attainment of constant temperatures by the employ
ment of liquids boiling under constant pressures; for while it is
easy to make a small piece of apparatus air-tight, this becomes
well nigh impossible when the apparatus is complicated, and
then a simple and efficacious pressure-regulator is a deside
ratum.
    The solutions with which the experiments were carried out
were prepared by weighing definite quantities of water, and
adding the amount of salt necessary to make a solution con
taining n molecules salt per 100 molecules of water. The
solution thus prepared was placed in the vessel shown in fig. 5.
This was exhausted of air, placed in a water-bath, and boiled
for ten minutes. The vessel was then quickly cooled, and one
portion of its contents was transferred to the dilatometer,
another to a Sprengel tube, in which its density was deter
mined. The solutions were thus so far deprived of air that
no bubbles made their appearance during the experiments.
The composition of the solutions, as indicated by the density,
was very nearly that indicated by n salt 100H2O. A slight
error was unavoidable, owing to the necessity for expelling the
all".
    Before giving the results of the experiments it will be well
to indicate the degree of accuracy obtained. A solution of

stems were read roughly to tenths, i.e. to 0.000005, and the
temperature to 0°1. The degree of accuracy aimed at was
                    * Journ. Chem. Society, 1885.

392                     Dr. W. W. J. Nicol on the
 +0.00005; and the results show that this was always attained,
and in most cases greatly exceeded.
   It was found that a simple interpolation-formula W = 100,000
 + t'a + t”8, where t'= (t°–20°), satisfactorily expressed the
experimental results. The following Table gives the experi
mental and calculated results for the 18 solutions examined.
These comprise the four salts NaCl, KCl, NaNO3, and KNO3,
dissolved in water in molecular proportions. The initial tem
perature is 20° C., and seven other determinations were made
in each case. The constants for the formulae are given at the
foot of each section of the Table.             It will be seen that out of
 125 separate determinations between 45° and 80°, the calcu
lated volume differs from the found in five cases only by more
than 9 in the 100,000; while the sum of the + and – differ
ences is (+212–230)=–18. There is, therefore, little doubt
that the formulae accurately represent the experimental re
sults, and that the latter are correct as a rule to within +2 in
 100,000.
    The next point to be examined is the concentration of the
solutions. These were, as stated, made of definite molecular
composition, but the expulsion of the air caused a change
in the strength which is necessarily most marked in the strong
solutions.       Table     III. contains the observed densities               at
20°C., and the molecular volumes on the supposition that
the solutions were of the strength given in the formula.
While in the last column of the Table are given the true
molecular volumes, where these have been determined. In
other cases the volumes calculated from the formulae given in
my paper on saturation * are inserted, though these are
necessarily only approximate.

                    DISCUSSION OF THE RESULTs.
   Rate of Expansion.—In every case examined the expansion
is a constantly increasing value. This follows from the form
of the expression for the volume,
                        W=100,000+ta +t'8;
for were the expansion uniform it would have the form
                              W=100,000+t'a.
It is, however, to be noted that the more concentrated the
solution the more nearly does the curve of volume approach
a straight line, as will be seen from Table IV., which contains
the ratio of the two constants a and 8, and this increases
with the concentration.           In fig. 6 these ratios are plotted, and
it will be seen that the lines are practically straight, showing
the uniform effect of increase of concentration.              The volume
of water between 20° and 100° C. cannot be expressed by a
too constant formula, but if 20°, 60° and 100° be taken, then
the expression is
                    W=100,000+t'23.8+!”0:35,
and the ratio of is 680; that is, a value lower than any in
Table IV.       It thus follows that the volume-line of water is
more curved than that of any of the salt-solutions examined,
even the most dilute. In fig. 7 the volume-curves for water
and for the strongest and weakest solutions are given. Again,

 as the constant a for water is less than that for any of the
 solutions, it is evident that at low temperatures the amount
 of expansion of salt-solutions is greater than that of water,
 and that at some temperature the volume-difference between
a salt-solution and water reaches a maximum ; that is, at that
point the rate of expansion of both is the same. In order to
ascertain what temperature this is for the various salts, and
how far it is dependent on the strength of the solutions, I
calculated the volumes of the solutions at every 5° between
20° and 100° C., and compared them with those of water.
 How far I was justified in doing so is open to question; still
the close agreement of the experimental and calculated num
bers seem to warrant extrapolation to this extent without
there being much risk of introducing serious errors. In any
case this affects only NaNO3 and the most dilute solution of
KNO3.       The volumes for water are calculated from the
figures given by Volkmann" and Rosettif as the means of
the results obtained by previous experimenters. Plate VI.
contains the differences between the volumes of the various
salt-solutions at various temperatures. The result of this
comparison was that the maximum differences lay between
55°-60° for all solutions of NaCl; at or about 50° for all KCl
solutions; while 2NaNO3, 4NaNO3, and KNO, give no
              * Wied. Ann. xiv.    #'  (1881).

                  Expansion of Salt-Solutions.              397
maxima, but the other solutions have maxima lying lower on
the temperature-scale the stronger the solution; thus:—
            6NaNO3, 90°–95°; 8NaNO, at 90°.
           10NaNO3, 80°–85°; 12NaNO, at 80°.             *
            3KNO, 80°–85°; 5KNO, 75°–80°.
   Again, with 8 and 10NaCl and 3, 5, and 7KCl the volume
of the solution at 100° C. is less than that of water; but such
is not the case even with the strongest solutions of the other
two salts. Comparing the volumes of the various solutions of
the same salt at 100°C., we find that with NaCl and KCl the
stronger the solution the smaller the volume; but with KNO3
the reverse is the case; while NaNO3 forms a connecting
link, the weaker solutions 2, 4, and 6 behaving as those of
KNO3 ; the stronger, 8, 10, and 12, as those of NaCl or KCl.
   This is all that can be gathered from the results in the
above form, and it is clear that the conclusions arrived at by
former experimenters are in the main correct. The results of
Kremers with solutions of the same salts give figures which,
where the solutions are the same strength, completely agree
with mine at low temperatures, though the discrepancy is
marked at high temperatures; the cause of this being probably
in the use of too high a correction for the exposed dilatometer
column (see Thorpe, Chem. Soc. Journ. 1880).
   The questions now remain to be considered : Is it permis
sible to compare together equal volumes of solutions of
different strengths? Is it probable that such a comparison will
lead to any conclusion that can be in any sense considered
general? A little reflection will show that the answer must
be no. For equal volumes of various solutions of a salt con
tain more salt and less water the more concentrated the
solution; and when solutions of different salts are brought
into the comparison, the proportions of water and salt vary
according to the molecular volumes of the various dissolved
salts. The bearing of the expansion of salt-solutions on the
question of solution must necessarily be obscure until mole
cular, not unit, volumes are compared; then, and not till then,
can we reasonably expect to gain trustworthy information.
   In order to convert results for equal volumes into those for
molecular volumes, it is only necessary to multiply by the
molecular volume of the salt-solution at 20°C., which is
                   M.V. = 1800+8nM.W. .   p

398                  Dr. W. W. J. Nicol on the
                   molecular volume of salt-solution;
         1800 = 100 H.O.
       nM.W. = molecular weight of the salt multiplied by
                      the number (n) of salt molecules present
                      per 100 water molecules;
             8 = density of solution at 20° referred to water
                     at 20°.
When this is done we obtain the volume occupied at t°C. by
n molecules of salt and 100 molecules of water.
   In the following Table I have employed the values of M.V.
at 20° for the various solutions, as given by calculation
according to the method described in a previous paper*.
These values are sufficiently correct for the purposes of this
paper, and no error is introduced by employing them, or by
considering the salt-solutions as possessing the precise mole
cular composition aimed at.             In the table the molecular
volumes of water at intervals of 10° are given in the first
column, and in the others are the molecular volumes of the
salt-solutions at the corresponding temperatures. On com
paring the volumes of the salt-solutions with those of water,
it is found that the maxima are moved up the temperature
scale. Thus all the NaCl solutions and 3, 5, and 7 KCl have
                    TABLE V. (see also fig. 8).

400                 On the Expansion of Salt-Solutions.
     At low temperatures, 20°–30° and 30°–40, the behaviour
 of all the salts is the same ; they all expand more than is due
 to the 100 H2O contained in the solutions, and as the strength
 increases the amount of expansion increases. Ascending the
 temperature-scale, we come to points at which the expansion
  er 10° is the same as that of water in the case of NaCl and
    Cl, as pointed out above. Then at high temperatures NaCl and
 KCl solutions expand less the more concentrated the solution.
 With NaNO3 and KNO, this not the case; though even here
 there is a close agreement observable in the expansion of the
 stronger solutions between 90°-100°, as compared with the
 marked difference between 20° and 30°.
    The different behaviour of these four salts, which separates
 them into two classes, NaCl and KCl, as compared with
 NaNO3 and KNO3, lies entirely in the effect of temperature
 on their solubility. According to Mulder", the solubility at
 different temperatures is as follows:–
                               20°         600         100°.
          NaCl ............... 36-0        37.3        39.8
             Molecules ......  11-1        11-5        12.3
          KCl ...............  34.7        45.5        56-6
             Molecules ......   8.4        11-0         13.7
          NaNO3 ............   87.5       122.0       180.0
             Molecules ......  18.5        25.9    -   38-1
          KNO,...............  31.2       111-0       247.0
            Molecules   ......  5:0        19.8        44-0
    Thus, while NaCl increases in solubility between 20° and
100° in the ratio 1 : 1:11, KCl increases as 1: 1:16, NaNO3
1: 2:06, KNO, 1: 7.92. It thus follows that a solution of
NaCl or KCl is almost as nearly saturated at 100° as at 20°;
while NaNO3 solutions become on heating, so to speak, rapidl
more dilute; and this is even more markedly the case '.
KNO3 solutions.
    It is therefore not to be expected that these salts should all
behave in precisely the same way; but they do resemble one
another in this, that the volume-line is straighter than that of
water when merely equal volumes are considered. When mo
lecular volumes are compared this similarity disappears; and it
remains now to ascertain why in some cases the expansion of a
solution is actually less than that of the water it contains;

for in the case of 10NaCl, while the apparent volume of the salt
is at 20° r=2084, at 70° r=219.8, falling again to r=216.9
at 100°. Now, as pointed out by Ostwald”, this decrease in
the apparent volume of the salt does not necessarily imply a
contraction of the salt, but only that between 70° and 100°
the solution, as a whole, expands at a slower rate than that of
pure water; but below 70° it expands faster, for r increases
from 20° to 70°. This, however, is only apparent; for the
form of the interpolation-formula shows that the expansion
increases at a uniformly increasing rate; the cause of the
apparent irregularity lies in the expansion of the water, which
is not uniform.
XLVI. On Delicate Thermometers. By SPENCER UMFREVILLE
   PICKERING, M.A., Professor of Chemistry at Bedford
    Collegef.
So:         months ago I had the honour of bringing before the
       notice of this Society (Phil Mag, 1886, vol. xxi. p. 330)
the fact that with very delicate thermometers the temperature
registered was never exactly the same when the column had
risen to the point of rest as when it had fallen to it. The in
vestigation was made by placing the instrument in a large
calorimeter of water, removing the bulb at intervals, cooling
or heating it slightly, and then replacing it and observing
the reading. About eight separate observations were made
in order to determine the difference between the falling and
rising readings at any particular point on the stem; and
throughout the observations the instrument was tapped con
tinuously on the upper end # to overcome the inertia of the
mercury in the tube. The difference which was noticed was
explained at the time by the bulb not being of precisely the
same shape while the mercury was being forced upwards
through the fine tube as when it was being dragged downwards;
nevertheless there were several points which rendered such an
 explanation not altogether satisfactory. One out of the two
 instruments examined (No. 62839) gave differences propor
 tional to the height of the column in the tube; in the other
 (No. 63616) no such proportionality was noticed: moreover,
 the instrument which showed this defect to the greatest ex
 tent (63616) was the one which had the smallest and strongest
 bulb. I was subsequently indebted to Lord Rayleigh for a
suggestion that these differences should be attributed to the

  capillarity of the tubes acting on the expansibility of the
  bulbs, and not to the action of the bulbs only, and thus the
  differences observed between the behaviour of the two instru
  ments might easily be accounted for by slight differences in
   the shape or size of the bore at various points. In order to
   test the validity of such an explanation, which at first sight
   appeared highly probable, other experiments were performed
   with these instruments, taking care to make all the obser
   vations at exactly the same temperature, removing some of
   the mercury into the upper chamber, so as to make the
   different points on the scale correspond to the same Cen
   tigrade temperature. The somewhat bulky details of the

   communication, are marked by an asterisk; and any small
   discrepancies observed between them and the fresh experi
   ments may be attributed to differences in the actual tempera
   ture of the observations, the recent experiments only being
   strictly comparable with each other, having all been performed
   at 10°5 C. The readings and the differences are expressed here
   in mm. of the column, instead of cm. (or scale-degrees) as in
   the former communication.
       To whichever thermometer we confine our attention, it is
   perfectly obvious that the magnitude of the differences bears
   no relation to the size of the bore. Taking the original
   experiments with '39, the difference as judged # the size of
   the bore should be least at 457, and greatest at 270, and of
   intermediate value at 142 mm.; whereas they are found to
   be greatest at .457 and least at 142 mm.                          Again, with
   No. 616, the differences should be greatest at 289, and least
   at 562 mm.; whereas they are practically equal at these two
   points, and greater (taking the later experiments only) than

                        Delicate Thermometers.                 403
  at any other points. It may be objected, however, that the
   capacity of the tube at these points, as given by the length
  of a comparatively long - (2 cm.) thread of mercury in that
  position, affords but a very rough, and perhaps quite
   erroneous, measure of the diameter of the tube at the parti
  cular point in question. As a crucial test, therefore, it was
  determined to alter the bulb of one of the instruments.    This
  was done with Thermometer ’39. The capacity of the bulb
  was reduced to half its former value, so as to hold 18 instead
  of 36 grams of mercury; and a determination of the coefficients
  of expansion of the two bulbs under pressure (given in column
  6 of Table II.) shows that what may be termed the apparent
  expansion, or the effect of pressure on the height of the
  mercury in the tube, was thereby reduced to nearly half its
  former value, from .042 to 025 mm. per mm. of mercury
  pressure, so that the differences in the readings with falling
  and rising columns should have been diminished in that
  proportion, if it depended on the expansion of the bulb by
  pressure; but on examination it was found that this difference
  was even greater now than it had been previously—at 270
  mm. it amounted to 59 instead of 27 mm., and at 457 mm.
  it was 39 instead of 46 mm. (col. 7 of Table II.). Another
  thermometer (No. 283) was then examined in a similar
  manner. Originally it exhibited no difference whatever in
  the falling and rising readings; but when the bulb was altered,
  without increasing the coefficient of apparent expansion to
  any considerable extent (from 011 to 015), a small though un
 mistakable difference in the readings was observed (No. 283 B
  in the table). This second bulb was then removed, and a third
  and smaller one substituted for it (No. '83 C), by which the
  coefficient of apparent expansion was reduced by one half its
 former value; but, instead of the differences being diminished,
 they were actually increased, although no accurate measure
  could be made of them, for the column of mercury in the
 tube kept breaking off when the instrument was tapped. It
 WaS   '.       therefore, that the cause of these differences in
 the readings did not lie in the bulbs of the instruments, but
 in the stems, that each time the instrument was opened and
 air admitted into the stem, the defect was increased, till the
 tube eventually became entirely ruined. The moisture and
 gases present in the air, no doubt, affect the glass and adhere
 so strongly to it that the heating to which the stem is sub
jected is quite incapable of removing it, and the interior of
 the tube remains coated with an elastic covering which
destroys the working capabilities of the instrument. The

                       Delicate Thermometers.                      405
by glass, prove, in a striking manner, the extent to which such
absorption occurs, and the persistence with which the absorbed
gases are retained.
    Both the delicate instruments (39 and ’616), in which the
 difference of the readings was first observed, had had small
 temporary bulbs attached for the purpose of calibration; and
it therefore seemed probable that the second opening of the
 tube may have been the sole cause of the defects which they
exhibited. To settle this question, and to ascertain whether it
 was possible to make instruments of such delicacy entirely
 free from this defect, two other thermometers were manu
 factured, Nos’08 and ’61. The delicacy of these was some
 what less than in the former instruments, owing to the
 impossibility of procuring sufficiently fine tubes; the size of
 the bulbs, however, was increased, that of ’61 containing as
 much as 46 grams of mercury. An estimation-figure, '05
 mm., represented about 0.0005°C. On examining these instru
 ments, in the same manner as previously, it was found that
 they worked perfectly, the mercury registering exactly the
 same temperature whether the column had risen or fallen to
 the point of rest, equally satisfactory results being obtained
 whatever portion of the stem was examined. Instruments of
 this excessive delicacy are therefore perfectly workable; it is,
 however, only by observing the utmost precaution in making
them that success can be obtained. The tube must on no account
 be opened till the last minute, when the bulb is finished and
 ready to be attached without a moment’s delay; the bulb, as
 soon as it is attached, must be warmed so as to fill the tube with
mercury and prevent the access of air through the upper end.
 If any failure occurs in the attachment of the bulb at the first
trial, the stem must be rejected; a second attempt would be
attended with the same results as putting on a second bulb
after the instrument had been made up. When once the
 stem is filled with mercury, the tube may apparently be
 opened several times at the top without damage being done,
 and the bulb itself may be made 24 hours before it is attached
to the stem without being injured by exposure to air for that
time.
    It is a common practice of thermometer-makers to examine
the bore of a tube before it is made into a thermometer by
passing a thread of mercury       '#     it, and often, indeed, the
stems are divided and fully calibrated before the bulb is
attached and the tube closed.      From what has been ascertained
as to the effect of the air on the interior of the tube, it is obvious
that a tube which has been treated in such a manner will be
utterly useless for any really delicate instrument.

XLVII. On the Effect of Pressure on Thermometer-bulbs, and
   on some Sources of Error in Thermometers. By SPENCER
   UMFREVILLE PICKERING, M.A., Professor of Chemistry
   at Bedford College”.
Th: great difficulty which exists in obtaining exact con
       cordance between two thermometers throughout a con
siderable range of their scales must have been experienced by
all who have had occasion to require such concordance. In
the course of a series of experiments, in which the tempera
ture-disturbance in a calorimeter was measured simultaneously
with two instruments, I was much struck by the appearance
of a certain amount of regularity in the difference in the re
sults yielded by the two instruments, which, according to
direct comparisons with each other through longer ranges of
temperature, should have been absolutely concordant. The
instruments being open in the scale and having large bulbs,
I was led to seek for an explanation of these discrepancies in
irregularities in the expansion of the bulbs under the pressure
of the column of mercury in the tube.
   The effect of pressure on a thermometer-bulb has been in
vestigated by Egen (Pogg. Ann. xi. p. 283), and by Mills
(Roy. Soc. Edin. xxix. p. 285), with the general result of
showing that the expansion experienced is directly propor
tional to the pressure. But although the pressures employed
in Mills's experiments were considerable (ranging up to 134
atmospheres), the thermometers which he examined were not
of the most delicate character, and the coefficient of expansion
was but small in comparison with that possessed by most calo
rimetric instruments. In the present experiments the bulb
of the thermometer was enclosed in a small thin brass cylin
der, which was connected with a pump, by means of which a
vacuum, or pressure up to two atmospheres, might be pro
duced. The case enclosing the bulb was previously filled
with melting ice and placed in a large vessel of the same, the
Zer0   '     of the thermometer having been previously ad
justed so as to be slightly above the level of the ice.
   Three instruments were investigated in this manner,
Nos. 62839, 63616, and 65108, of which the details of con

408                  Prof. S. U. Pickering on the
the readings, calculated on the assumption that the alteration
in height of the column is directly proportional to the pres
sure; these calculated values being deduced from the average
points given at the foot of the table. With the last-mentioned
instrument (65108) the effect of pressure on the bulb would
appear to cause a very regular expansion; there are only
three observations which differ from the calculated values by
more than 0.1 millim., while the average difference amounts
to about 0.05 millim. only. With the other two instruments
the observations at the higher pressures cannot be much relied
on, since the pressures were ascertained by means of a Bour
don's gauge, instead of a column of mercury as in the other
 cases; and this gauge was afterwards found to be untrust
worthy. Omitting these observations, we find that, in case of
No. 63616, where the coefficient of apparent expansion of the
bulb was twice as great as that of 65108, the error in the
readings is considerably larger, amounting to as much as
 0.12 millim. on the average, while the grouping together of
 the positive and negative differences is well marked. It is
 only with No. 62839, however, which possessed a still greater
 coefficient of expansion, that the differences become so large
 as to render it quite impossible to attribute them to mere ex
perimental error. As the pressure is increased above 500
 millim., the bulb begins to contract far more than it should,
 causing a difference of as much as 1.2 millim. between the
 observed and calculated readings; it then contracts less, crosses
 the line representing the calculated values and for pressures
 from 1100 up to 1986 millim. (if these higher results may
 be trusted) does not contract as much as it         £ do *.         The
 action of the bulb under pressure is evidently not regular.
    As the differences in the calorimetric results above men
 tioned were observed with the thermometers ’616 and '08,
 which behaved normally, or nearly so, under pressure, as well
 as with other instruments with bulbs of considerably smaller
 expansibility, it is impossible to attribute these differences to
 the cause suggested; at the same time, however, the present
 investigation leads to results of considerable practical im
 portance. It is evident that where the coefficient of expan
 sion of the bulb is large, as with '39, irregularities in       expan
 sion sufficient to introduce considerable errors may occur;
 the bulb, when subjected to pressure, would appear to behave
    * Care was of course taken that the thermometer should not be read till
 the column had attained a    £       of equilibrium. The top of the in
 strument was  £       throughout the experiments by means of the tapping
 apparatus, and the column read at intervals of one minute till it was
 found to be perfectly stationary.

           Effect of Pressure on Thermometer-bulbs.          409
in a manner analogous to that often noticed with thin tin
plate vessels, where a small addition or removal of pressure
will cause a sudden and considerable alteration in the form of
the vessel. It would certainly be advisable, in the case of
any thermometer required for very delicate work, to examine
it under pressure to ascertain whether its action be uniform
or not. In order to reduce the chances of irregular action,
it is necessary to render the bulb as inexpansible as possible.
From the fact that the thermometer 63616 showed a slight
amount of irregularity in its action, we may place the limits
of expansibility desirable in a very fine instrument at a number
between that of this instrument and that of 65108; the co
efficient of expansion should not exceed 0.000,000,03, or the
apparent expansion 0.02 millim. of the mercurial column per
millim. of pressure.
   An examination of table ii. of the preceding communica
tion will show at once the increase of rigidity obtained by
having the bulb made out of a glass cylinder instead of being
blown before the lamp; the instruments '83 and ’39 B are the
only ones mentioned in this table which had blown bulbs,
and the coefficients of expansion in their cases are higher
than in any other case, although their bulbs were only ; and
# as big as those of most of the other instruments. Again, the
thermometers '83 and 16 were identical in all respects except
as regards their bulbs, and here the blown bulb ('83) possesses
only half the strength of that made out of cylinder.
   Although it seems probable, prima facie, that a blown bulb,
however well constructed, would not be so uniform as a
cylinder bulb, these facts of course do not prove that such is
necessarily the case, as the thickness of the walls of the bulbs
was not known; but it does prove that, by ordering a thermo
meter with a cylinder bulb, we should in all probability get an
instrument possessing nearly twice the strength of one with a
blown bulb. A further very considerable addition of strength
may be gained by having the bulb made double instead of
 single. The instruments Nos. ’616, ’08, and ’61 possessed
double bulbs made out of glass cylinder; and a comparison of
them with '83 B and ’39, which had single bulbs made out of
 cylinder also, will show the advantages of the double bulb.
 For thermometers to be used in a liquid which is stirred in a
thoroughly efficient manner, the thickness of the walls of the
 tube forming the bulb may be very considerable. The instru
ments Nos. '08 and '61, which contain between 40 and
50 grams of mercury, will take the temperature of the liquid
 in the calorimeter in about 5 seconds, although their bulbs
 are 0.75 millim. thick in the walls.

 410                Prof. S. U. Pickering on the
    Although the effect of different pressures on the bulb did
 not appear to produce irregularities such as would account
 for all the difficulties  £              in getting two instruments
 to correspond perfectly throughout their scales, it was thought
 possible that the expansibility of the bulbs under pressure
 might be influenced to a considerable extent by the tem
perature of the experiment, and that this might produce dis
cordance between two instruments which had been compared
with the same standard but at different temperatures. To
investigate this, the behaviour of No. 08 under pressure was
examined at 12°C. As it was impossible to keep the tem
perature of the bath absolutely constant throughout the series
of experiments, the reading at any pressure P1 was compared
with that at P by taking the mean of two observations at P,
made    £              before and immediately after the observa
tion at P1. In the following Table the value of the constant

mometers under certain circumstances still remains to be

   I may mention one source of error in thermometric work
which attains considerable dimensions when dealing with tubes
of very fine bore. These tubes, even when of the most perfect
description obtainable, generally possess a few points at which
the mercury column experiences a difficulty in passing: the
mercury, when it has reached such a point, sticks there an
appreciable time, and then passes it suddenly with a jerk;
sometimes, even, the mercury sticks so persistently that the
column will separate sooner than pass it. These points do not
indicate any contraction which is sufficient to affect the results
of calibration, and are probably due to some difference in the
nature of the glass, for they may be developed by heating
the thermometer-tube externally with a very small flame up
to about 400°. The error of taking a reading while the
mercury is sticking at such a point may, I estimate, amount
sometimes to as much as 0.5 millim.             All delicate thermo
meters should be carefully examined in order to ascertain the
position of such points, and they should be avoided, if possible,
 in any work with the instrument.
    In any thermochemical work in which the effect of tempe
rature on a given reaction is being studied, many of the
 sources of error inherent in the use of thermometers may be
avoided by using the same portion of the stem of the instru
 ment, whatever the actual temperature may be. To effect
 this, the zero-point is altered in each experiment by removing
 some of the mercury into the upper chamber of the thermo
 meter. Formerly I removed the requisite amount of mercury
 by the application of a very small flame to a point just below
 this chamber; but I now adopt a method which is much
 safer, more expeditious, and equally exact. A fine tube,
 somewhat wider than the stem of the thermometer, is affixed
 to the upper end of the stem, and in this tube there is a small
 contraction or “knife-edge,” sufficiently wide to permit of the
 mercury passing it either upwards or         £              but yet so
 narrow that a slight swing of the instrument will cause the
 column of mercury to break off at it, that portion of the
 mercury which is above the knife-edge passing up into the
 upper chamber. By this means any point on the stem may
 be adjusted with ease to within 0°.02 of any given tem
 perature.

 with different thermometers, and also with different portions of the stem
 of the same thermometer, see Chem. Soc. Trans. 1887, pp. 304,322.

  XLVIII. On the Determination of Coefficients of Mutual
    Induction by means of the Ballistic Galvanometer and
    Earth-Inductor. By R. H. M. BosANQUET*.
 MY attention          was drawn to this subject by the paper
 ––        recently read before the Society by Prof. Fosterf. I
 observed at once that the appliances which I am in the habit
 of using afford a very simple solution of the problem.
    The ballistic galvanometer has a resistance less than 2 B.A.
 units, and about 500 turns.         I have three earth induction
 coils, all having a mean diameter of about half a metre, and
the following constants. The resistances are approximate, as
they vary so much with temperature. The wires are all
cotton-covered copper.

    The circular channels are turned in wooden rings framed
together in many pieces. They were turned in the Royal
Society’s lathe in my laboratory. They are mounted so as to
turn on vertical axes through half a revolution, in doing which
they are reversed with respect to the horizontal component
of the earth's magnetism, and so experience an electrical
impulse equal to 2 NAH.
      f the resistance of the circuit be R, a transfer of electricity
then takes place, such that

 The 2 disappears from the numerator if the observation is
 made by reversal.
    In order that H may be the same for the tangent-galvano
 meter and the earth induction-coil, it is necessary to remove
 the tangent-galvanometer and put the earth induction-coil
 in its place before making the observation 8.
    There are two classes of cases which cannot be treated by
 this most simple form of the method:—
    (a) Where the quantity of electricity to be dealt with is too
 large for the #", even with the coil of highest
 resistance. An
    (b) where the resistance of one of the coils to be determined
 is so great that no earth induction-coil could throw a sufficient
 quantity of electricity through it.
    In both these cases we have to introduce a large resistance

 414       Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet on the Determination
 into the circuit S, after calibrating the galvanometer without
 it.   The value of the deflection is then altered in the ratio of
 the change of resistance.
     Let R be the total increased resistance,

The 2 disappears, as before, when reversal is employed.
     An example of case (a) is given later; where, in the second
determination of my Gramme machine, a resistance of 1000
B.A. units was introduced into the secondary circuit, to mo
derate the deflection. The determination of the resistances,
however, can hardly ever be accurate, as the copper earth
induction-coil is liable to great alterations through change of
temperature.
    An example of case (b) would be afforded by the determi
nation of such an induction-coil as the one by Apps, with high
resistance S, mentioned in Prof. Foster’s paper. In this case
the galvanometer would be calibrated by the earth induction
coil, the high resistance-coil then introduced, and the known
values of R, Ro employed in formula (7).
    The determinations I have made are mostly of the mutual
coefficients of the coils of my earth-inductors, placed close
together. I have also made a couple of determinations of the
coefficient of field-magnets and armature in my A Gramme
machine.
    The determination of February 21 was rather rough; the
coils were placed together in their frames, but they could not
be brought very near. The numbers are useful, as illustratin
the increase of the discrepancy of Maxwell's formula, wit
the increase of b, the distance of the central planes. In fact,
unless b is small compared with the diameters, the formula is
not properly applicable. Here it is about half either of the
radii, and calculated and observed values are nearly as 4: 5.
    On February 22 the coils were dismounted and brought as
close together as possible, b being now between a quarter and
a third of either of the radii.   The calculated and observed
values are nearly as 5:6. In order to see what part of the

               of Coefficients of Mutual Induction.            415
error was due to the dimensions of the section of the coils,
the coefficient was then calculated by the more accurate for
mula referred to below; but the improvement is very slight.
It appears that this formula does not in any way cure that
defect, which arises from the distance of the central planes.
So that in coils similar to mine we cannot expect to get nearer
by calculation than the number last referred to, which is to
the observed number nearly as 6: 7.
    On February 23 experiments were arranged with a view
to test the consistency of the method, the coils examined
being made primary and secondary alternately. Though the
 mode of observation does not admit of great accuracy, it
 appears that there is a systematic difference between the
 results of the two arrangements, amounting to about 1% per
 cent. This I have not been able to explain. The coefficients
 of self-induction of the coils should have no influence; but
 that of the 250 will be very much greater than that of the 42,
 and this is the only source of error that I can suggest. The
 number calculated by Maxwell’s original formula is to the
 mean of observation nearly as 6: 7.
    In all the experiments difficulty was experienced in con
 sequence of the continual fall of the battery-current. With
 out care in charging, and freshly      *:       cells, the experi
 ments could hardly be made, as the fall of the current affects
 the galvanometer in the intervals.
    Rowland’s method of control, with a magnet and coil, was
 employed.
    The determinations of the coefficient of the Gramme machine
 were very rough. In fact the fundamental equation (2) is
 not really applicable to the dynamo at all, except perhaps in
 the upper part of its range, where the current is, say, 10
 amperes or more. For small currents do not do more than
 shake the subpermanent magnetism, which is considerable
  compared with the magnetism due to small currents. And
  in motion the machine makes use of this subpermanent mag
  netism, although it does not enter into the electrical coefficient
  of mutual induction.
     The observations of Feb. 24 were very irregular; it ap
  peared as if the current sometimes shook the subpermanent
  magnetism and sometimes not. Still a mean was fairly
  deducible.
     On Feb. 25 a stronger current was employed, and the ob
  servations were fairly regular; but this current, though it
  moves the subpermanent magnetism, is quite insufficient to
  reverse it as the reversal of a large current does; so that
  even here we do not get a representation of the whole effect.

 416       Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet on the Determination
    In the higher part of the range of the machine, say for
unit-current (10 amperes), we can assume, without serious
 error, that the fundamental equation (2) holds. That being
 so, we can deduce the value of M from the resistance and
number of revolutions with which a stable current is pro
duced.
    It will be convenient to assume that all the coils of the
armature are gathered up into two coils at right angles.
Then, if one be parallel and the other perpendicular to the
axis of the magnetic field, the determination of the coefficient
of induction at rest affects only one of the coils, or half the
armature.
    Then, as to one of these coils, or half the armature:—In a
half revolution the same effect is produced as if the exciting
current were reversed, and a quantity of electricity passes,
                              _2MC
                              --R-.
In a whole revolution     £     passes.
    The same applies to the other half of the armature, so
that altogether     s:   passes in each revolution.
    If there be n revolutions per second, the quantity passing
in n revolutions=the current numerically, and this divides
out, so that
                                   R
                                 =8.
    In an old paper of mine on Practical Electricity (Phil.
Mag. xiv. p. 246) I find data from which, by interpolation,
I obtain the corresponding values for this machine:—
          n' per minute.         R.        C.
               840          10'x5'55       1=10 amperes.
Whence M=10’ x 4'95.
   The assumption made above is rough, but we cannot
specialize further unless the distribution of the field is known.
  he two coils may then be supposed to be in any required
proportion instead of being equal.
   Regarding the coefficient as the product of the number of
windings of armature and magnets, and of the magnetic induc
tion common to both, due to unit-current, we can find the com
mon magnetic induction in this case. There are 1700 turns in
the armature, half of which count, and 234 turns on each of the
four magnets, two of which receive each part of the common

                       of Coefficients of Mutual Induction.           417
    induction. Whence the common magnetic induction is
                                 107 x 4.95
                                 £550-125.
    This seems very small. But the dimensions of the armature
    are such that it can have hardly any core.
        But I must not now pursue the subject of the dynamo.
        The method of the earth induction-coil and ballistic galva
    nometer is susceptible of numerous applications. I have in
    my mind the direct determination of the capacity of a con
    denser, and a method following the lines of that used by
    Weber, for the determination of resistance. He employed
    earth induction-coils on this principle, though I do not know
    how they were arranged in detail. I cannot conceive how a
    tangent galvanometer could be employed for the ballistic
    work, as seems to be contemplated in Maxwell's account. I
    should determine the constant of the ballistic galvanometer
     for the purpose by a shunt comparison with a tangent galva
     nometer. I believe Mr. Glazebrook has done something of
     this kind in another case. In fact I have been through the
     work of such a method; but where there is a shunt to be
     verified, in this case 1 : 10,000, as well as other determina
     tions of resistances, the errors of temperature are so trouble
     some to deal with, that in the present state of the subject I
     doubt whether it is worth while to spend much labour on it.
        The numerical results of the experiments referred to are

 XLIX. The Effects of Percussion and Annealing on the
   Magnetic Moments of Steel Magnets. By WILLIAM BRowN,
   Thomson Experimental Scholar, Physical Laboratory, Uni
   versity of Glasgow".
                               PART II.
IN     Part I. of this paper, which appeared in the March
     number, certain preliminary results were given, showing
the effects of percussion on the magnetic moments of steel
magnets. In the present communication these effects are
considered in greater detail, with tables giving the results of
an extended series of experiments, and the question of an
nealing is treated with respect to exact measurements of the
annealing temperature.
   The steel experimented on in this case was furnished to Sir
William Thomson for experimental purposes by two different
steel-makers.
   The following Table gives approximately the relative per
centage proportions of all the substances found in the steel,
the quantities in specimen I, being taken as unity. They are
taken, not from analyses of the particular pieces experimented
on, but from a general analysis of the sample in each case.

The proportions are on this account probably only roughly
approximate, and until special analyses are obtained it seems
unnecessary to give the actual quantities.

   All the specimens contain, as a matter of course, nearly the
same amount of iron, but the other constituents differ con
siderably. The magnets were prepared in the same manner
as those referred to in Part I. of this paper. They were all
made glass-hard to begin with ; and this was done by bringing
them to a bright red heat, and then dropping them, with their
£         vertical, into a vessel 60 centim. deep, which was filled
with water at a temperature of 7°C.
   A greater number of magnets than were actually required
were prepared, but only those which were found to be straight
and of uniform glass-hardness throughout, chosen for the ex
periments. The hardness was tested by means of a file run
longitudinally along and around the magnet; in this way '
marked divergence from uniformity in hardness was detected.
   Also, to make sure that all the pieces of the same sample
should be as nearly as possible alike, they were one by one
let fall on to a block of hard wood, and those which gave the
same kind of metallic ring were taken for the experiments.
They were then thoroughly cleaned and polished, and their
lengths, diameters, and weights accurately determined; these
measurements being, for ease of reference, given below in
Table II.
   There were fifteen magnets in all, i. e. five samples of each
specimen, and each one was made exactly 10 centimetres in
length.

   The five pieces of each sample were then magnetized by
placing them between the poles of a powerful Ruhmkorff
electromagnet, which was excited by a current from twenty
four Thomson tray-cells joined in series. The magnetizing
current was approximately 5:3 amperes, producing a field of
900 C.G.S. units intensity. The field was measured by rota
ting a coil of known dimensions between the poles of the
magnet and observing the deflection produced on a ballistic
galvanometer; and this was reduced to absolute measure by
comparing with the deflection (on the same galvanometer)
obtained by rotating another coil of known dimensions in a
field the strength of which was known.
  When the field due to the electromagnet was being measured,
there was nothing between the poles except the measuring
coil. In the process of magnetizing, the magnets were reversed
three times between the poles of the electromagnet and then
finally magnetized. This was also done in every case when the
magnets were remagnetized between two sets of experiments.
   After being magnetized the magnets were laid aside for a
period of eighteen hours, and then the deflections were taken
for the purpose of calculating their magnetic moments. They
were put through the same series of operations as the magnets
used in the former experiments, described in Part I.; that is
to say, the deflection produced by each magnet on a magneto
meter-needle was observed; each was then allowed to fall
once perpendicularly through a height of 150 centimetres,
with the true north end downwards, on to a thick glass plate;
and the deflection on the magnetometer again taken with each
magnet in exactly the same position. Each was then allowed
to fall three times in succession through the same height, and

  The above table, as far as it goes, seems to show that the
percentage loss in the magnetic moment varies in the order
of the quantity of manganese which the specimen contains.
Thus specimen III. has a mean total loss of 5:25 per cent.,
and it has about three times as much manganese as either of
the other two; and specimen II. has about 20 per cent. more
manganese than I., and its loss is 3 per cent, nearly, whilst
that of I. is approximately 1.4 per cent.
   Specimen ' however, differs very much from the other
specimens in the quantity of silicon it contains, and it alone
contains sulphur.
  These same fifteen magnets were now all fastened to a

424       Mr. W. Brown on the Effects of Percussion and
piece of wood by means of soft copper wire, and annealed for
 one hour in a bath of linseed oil at a temperature of 100° C.
    They were then taken out and allowed to lie at the ordinary
 temperature of the room (8°C.) for a period of 6 hours,
 after which they were magnetized with the same battery
 £ and every precaution taken, as formerly. Then, after
  ying aside undisturbed for a period of 20 hours, they were
 put through a similar series of observations for the purpose
 of finding the effects of percussion in changing their magnetic
moments. The results are given in the following Table:

   From the above Table we see that annealing for one hour
in an oil-bath at temperature 100° C. has slightly raised the

  Annealing on the Magnetic Moments of Steel Magnets.                  425
magnetic moment of specimen I. and lowered it in III.,
whilst that of II. remains unaltered.               Also that the total
percentage loss in I. and II. is increased, whilst in III, it is
slightly diminished; indeed, we find it is doubled in speci
men I., and in II. it is increased 17 per cent., whilst it is
diminished 12 per cent. in specimen III.
   We must remember, however, that specimen I. alone con
tains sulphur, and has the least quantity of manganese, and by
far the most silicon of the three, while II. contains the least
amount of silicon.
   The same fifteen magnets were again annealed for a period
of two hours in the same oil-bath at a temperature of 100° C.
They were allowed to cool and lie for six hours, as formerly,
at the ordinary temperature of the room. They were also
magnetized and treated similarly in every way as in previous
experiments. Then, after lying aside undisturbed for a period
of twenty hours, they were put through the same series
of observations for determining the loss in their magnetic
moments. The results are given in the following Table:—

   From this Table we see that the second annealing for two
hours has had no effect on the magnetic moment per gramme
in the case of specimens I. and II., and has only slightly in
creased that of specimen III. We also see that the total
percentage loss is unaltered in I., and but slightly increased
in II., but in specimen III, there is an increase of about
33 per cent.
   All the magnets were now annealed for a period of thirty
minutes in an oil-bath at a temperature of 236°C.; they were
then taken out and allowed to cool, as usual, to the ordinary
temperature of the room (8° C.).              Then, after lying aside
for six hours, they were magnetized in the same manner and
with the same battery-power as in the previous operations.
   The temperature of the oil was at first determined approxi
mately by means of a mercury in glass thermometer; it was,
however, accurately determined by an air-thermometer con
structed on a method introduced by Mr. J. T. Bottomley, and
communicated by him to the Birmingham Meeting of the
British Association in 1886. This method will be explained
further on.
   After being magnetized, the magnets were laid aside for a
period of twenty hours and then put through another series
of observations, the results of which are given in the following

   Here we get a very interesting result: we find that, by
annealing for half an hour at approximately three times the
temperature, we get three times more percentage loss. It is
also interesting to note that in every case the total percentage
loss is almost exactly tripled ; but the three specimens still
preserve the same relative behaviour throughout.
   The same magnets were again immersed for half an hour in

428      Mr. W. Brown on the Effects of Percussion and
an oil-bath at temperature 236° C. and then allowed to cool
in the air as formerly. But this time they were allowed to
lie for three weeks, and then magnetized in a manner every
way similar to that formerly employed. After being mag
netized they lay undisturbed for a further period of twenty
hours, and were then put through the same series of observa
tions as on the previous occasions. The results are contained
in the following Table —

   We here find that the second annealing at a high tempera

    Annealing on the Magnetic Moments of Steel Magnets. 429
ture has diminished the magnetic moment per gramme by
13 per cent. in specimen II., and by about 12 per cent. in
III., whilst in specimen I. it is decreased by nearly 4 per cent.
We also find that the total percentage loss due to falling four
times through a height of 1.5 metre has increased above the
results of the last experiment as much as 100 per cent. in
specimen II., and 70 per cent. in I., and 40 per cent. in the
case of specimen III.
   The magnets were not again magnetized, but were allowed
to lie undisturbed in the varying temperature of the room for
a period of nine months, that is from May 15, 1886, till
February 12, 1887. This was done merely to see what would
be the effect of time upon them in their annealed condition.
They were put through a similar series of observations, with
the exception that they were not remagnetized. The follow
ing Table contains the results:—

   From the above Table we find that the relative losses of
magnetism in the different specimens due to lying undisturbed,
as indicated by the diminished magnetic moments, is in the
reverse order to what has taken place throughout the whole
series when the magnets were subjected to percussion.
   The total percentage loss all through these experiments due
to percussion has been in the order of the number of the spe
cimen. Thus specimen I. has always decreased the least and
specimen III. £ most; but, in the case of lying undisturbed
for nine months, the decrease in the magnetic moment of spe
cimen I. is 3.5 per cent., and of II. 3.7 per cent., while III.
has diminished only 1.6 per cent. Specimen III., however,
contains about three times as much manganese as either I.
or II.
    In Joule’s Scientific Papers, vol. i. page 591, some results
are given on the effects of time and temperature on hard mag
nets. The magnets used by him were either one inch long or
half an inch, and were made up of a number of thin bars
 placed side by side so as to form compound magnets of va
 riously shaped sections but with plane ends; the magnetic
 moments of these magnets diminished about 33 per cent. on
 lying aside for a     ''           eighteen years.
    The rate of diminution of magnetism in different kinds of
 steel, with annealing, time, and temperature, is at present
 under investigation in this laboratory. In connection with
 this investigation, further experiments are being made on the
 same kind of steel as is referred to in this paper, and it is
 hoped that further results will be ready for publication at an
 early date. I will now give a tabular view of the results
 obtained up to this point.

    The parts AB and DC are drawn out to
fine capillary tubes, very small in volume in
comparison with the bulb BD of the ther
mometer. When ready for use it is com
pletely filled with pure dry air and closed at
C, but open at A.
    The parts CDB and the greater portion of
AB are now inserted into the liquid, the
temperature of which we wish to measure;              B
and when it has been in long enough to be                     C
at the same temperature as the liquid, it is
sealed at A with a blowpipe flame, thus en
closing a sample of the air at the required
temperature. The height of the barometer               D
at the time of closing is also noted.
    It is then taken out and allowed to cool, and also thoroughly
cleaned, with alcohol if the bath has been of oil, as it was in
the case under consideration.
    It is now carefully weighed in a chemical balance; then
the end C is opened under water at a known temperature; the
height of the barometer being again noted.
    By this operation the water is allowed to rush into the bulb
BD and to compress the contained air to the volume consistent
with the barometric height and temperature at the given instant.
    The thermometer with the contained air and water is again
carefully weighed, at the same time taking care to add the
small piece of tube which was broken off in the act of open
 ing the end C. The remaining part of the tube AB is now
 filled with water by breaking off the end A, and the whole
 again carefully weighed.
    In the following calculation the weight of the air displaced
 during this last operation is assumed to be so very small that
 for our present purpose we may neglect it.

   L. The Assumptions required for the Proof of Avogadro's
                   Law. By Professor TAIT".
    WO months ago (in consequence of a chance hint in
       “Nature’) I managed to procure a copy of Prof. Boltz
mann’s paper (ante, p. 305), and inserted a reply to it in the
(forthcoming) Part II. of my         £              but, as there
may be some delay in the publication, I send a short abstract
to the Philosophical Magazine.
   Prof. Boltzmann says that I do not expressly state that my
work applies only to hard spheres. This is an absolutely
unwarrantable charge, as I have taken most especial care
throughout to make this very point clear.
   Prof. Boltzmann, while objecting to my remark about
“playing with symbols,” has unwittingly furnished a very
striking illustration of its aptness. His paper bristles through
out with formulae, not one of which has the slightest direct
bearing on the special question he has raised !
   He asserts that, in seeking a proof of Clerk-Maxwell's
Theorem, I have made more assumptions than are necessary.
To establish this, he proceeds to show that the Theorem can
                   * Communicated by the Author.

 434 Assumptions required for the Proof of Avogadro's Law.
 be proved by the help of a different and much more compre
 hensive set of assumptions! “‘Etépø ye Tübo, Avôyeves”! He
 allows that my proof is correct; and I am willing (without
 reading it) to allow as much for his. The point at issue, then,
 is:—Which of us has made the fewer, or the less sweeping,
 assumptions? Another question may even be :—Whose as
 sumptions are justifiable?
    My assumptions are (formally) three, but the first two are
 expressly regarded as consequences of the third, which is thus
 my only one, viz.:
    There is free access for collision between each pair of par
 ticles, whether of the same or of different systems; and the
 number of particles of one kind is not overwhelmingly greater
 that that of the other.
    From this I conclude (by general reasoning as to the be
 haviour of communities) that the particles will ultimately
 become thoroughly mixed, and that each system (in conse
 quence of its internal collisions) will assume the “special state.”
    Prof. Boltzmann denies the necessity for internal collisions
 in either system, and assumes that (merely by collisions of
 particles of different kinds) uniform mixing, and distribution
 of velocities symmetrically about every point, will follow !
 Surely this requires proof, if proof of it can be given. So
sweeping is the assumption that it makes no proviso as to
the relative numbers of the particles in the two systems! The
character of this absolutely tremendous assumption is so totally
different from that of mine that it is impossible to compare
the two. My assumption has, to say the least, some justifica
tion; but I fail to see even plausible grounds for admitting
that of Prof. Boltzmann. There is no need to inquire as to its
truth, at present; for I am not now discussing his extension
of Maxwell’s Theorem which, of course, is implied in it. The
question is:-Is Prof. Boltzmann's assumption, even if cor
rect, sufficiently elementary and obvious to be admitted as an
axiom ? It is so wide-reaching as, in effect, to beg the whole
question; and I venture to assert that, on grounds like these,
it cannot possibly be shown that any of my assumptions are
unnecessary.
   The objection raised in Prof Boltzmann’s “Second Ap
pendix" (which is not in my German copy) was made lon
ago to me by Prof. Newcomb and by Messrs. Watson 'i
Burbury. I have replied to this also in my Part II., and
I will not discuss it now. I need only say that Prof. Boltz
mann, while causelessly attributing to me a silly mathema
tical mistake, has evidently overlooked the special importance
which I attach to the assumed steadiness of the “average
behaviour of the various groups of a community.”

  LI. On Evaporation and Dissociation.—Part VI." On the
    Continuous Transition from the Liquid to the Gaseous State
    of Matter at all Temperatures. By WILLIAM RAMSAY,
    Ph.D., and SYDNEY YoUNG, D.Sc.f
                    [Plates VII, VIII, IX., & X.]
IT was proved by Boyle, in 1662, that the volume of a gas,
      provided temperature be kept constant, varies inversely
as the pressure to which it is subjected; this relation may be
expressed by the equation p= : , or pv = constant, where p
and v respectively stand for pressure and volume. But sub
sequent experiments by Van Marum, Oersted, Despretz, and
others showed that certain gases do not obey this law; and it
is now well known that Boyle's statement is only approximate;
for it has been proved by experiment by Regnault, Natterer,
and more recently by Amagat, that no gas, under high pres
sures, is diminished in volume in inverse ratio to the rise of
pressure. Indeed Boyle's law could hold only on the assump
 tion that the actual molecules of matter possess no extension
 in space and exert no attraction on each other. A gas, such
as hydrogen, at low pressures, and consequently at large
 volumes, fills a space very great when compared with the
 space occupied by the actual molecules; and these molecules
are comparatively so distant from one another, that the attrac
 tion which they mutually exercise is inappreciable. But, on
compression, the actual space occupied by the molecules bears
an increased ratio to the space which they inhabit; and, by
their approach, the attraction which they exert is also increased.
The gas, then, deviates appreciably from Boyle's law.
    Gay-Lussac, in 1808, enunciated the law that the volumes
of all gases increase by a constant fraction of their volume at
0° for each rise of 1° in temperature. It was subsequently
ascertained by Magnus, and confirmed by Regnault, that cer
tain gases deviate from this law, expanding more rapidly than
others. Such gases, as a rule, are at temperatures not far re
moved from those at which they condense to liquids; that is,
their volumes are comparatively small, and the actual size of
the molecules and their mutual cohesion begin to manifest
themselves within the range of experimental observation.
Again, it is evident that no gas can perfectly follow Gay
Lussac's law; but the larger the volume it occupies the
smaller is the influence of the disturbing factors. The usual

436                  Drs. Ramsay and Young on
expression for Gay-Lussac’s law is v =c(1+ at), or, if the
absolute temperature-scale be employed, v= cT.
    As a deduction from these laws, it follows that if the volume
of unit mass of a gas, supposed to follow them rigorously, be
kept constant, the pressure varies directly as the absolute
":              ; or p = cT.
      ow, so long as the volume of unit mass of a gas is kept
constant, the average distance of its molecules from one an
other will remain constant; and it is a fair assumption that
the attraction of the molecules for each other will not vary.
It may, of course, be the case that the effect of a rise of tem
perature on any individual molecule is to alter its actual
volume; but of this we know nothing; and, in default of
knowledge, it has been assumed by us that no such alteration
takes place. If these assumptions are correct, it follows
that the temperature and pressure of gases—and indeed the
same assumptions may be extended to liquids—should then
bear a simple relation to each other. We have obtained ex
perimental proof of a convincing nature that this is the case;
and in a preliminary note to the Royal Society, read on
January 6, we promised such a proof. This proof is the sub
ject of the present paper; and we must ask for indulgence
 in quoting a large array of figures, some of which have
 already been published, on the ground that such an important
 generalization requires as much experimental evidence as can
 be brought to bear on it.
    The relation between the pressures and temperatures of a
liquid or a gas at constant volume is expressed by the equation
                              p=bT—a ;
where p is the pressure in millimetres, T the absolute tempera
ture, and b and a constants.         The values of these constants
depend on the nature of the substance and on the volume. It
follows from this, that if a diagram be constructed to express
the relations of pressure, temperature, and volume of liquids
and gases, where pressure and temperature form the ordinates
and abscissae, the lines of equal volume are straight".
    We have proved this to be the case for ethyl oxide (ether)
between the temperatures 100° and 280°, and for volumes
varying from 1.85 cubic centim. per gram to 300 cubic centim.
per gram. This proof we now proceed to give.
    The data for the calculations are at present in the press, and
will shortly appear in the Philosophical Transactions for 1886,
p. 10. A diagram (which will accompany that memoir) was
constructed with the greatest care, showing isothermal lines,
   * Amagat (Comptes Rendus, xciv. p. 847) has stated a similar relation
for gases; his data are, however, imperfect, and he expressly states that
the law does not apply to liquids.

 the ordinates and abscissae being respectively pressures and
 volumes. It was possible to read pressure accurately to
 within 20 millim.; and volume, up to a volume of 3:1, to
 within 0.001 cubic centim. per gram; and, at volumes greater
 than 3:1 cubic centim. per gram, to 0.01 cubic centim. per
   ram. Pressures corresponding to each isothermal were then
 read off on the equal volume-lines, from curves constructed to
 fit the experimental points as accurately as could be drawn
 with the help of engineers’ curves. These pressures and
 temperatures were then mapped as ordinates and abscissae;
 and it was found that points corresponding to each volume
 lay in a straight line. Again, two points were chosen on
 these equal volume-lines, as far apart as the scale of the dia
 gram would permit, and the values of the change of pressure
                                      d
 per unit change of temperature, '', were ascertained for each

 separate volume chosen. To eliminate irregularities, these
 values were smoothed graphically; but it was difficult to find
 any very satisfactory method. The method employed for
 ether, which we found to give the best results, was to map as
 ordinates the ratios between these values, and similar values
 calculated on the supposition that the gas or liquid followed
 the usual gaseous laws, against the reciprocals of the volumes
as abscissae. A curve was then drawn, taking a mean course
among the actual points, and the values of        '   were calculated
 from readings at definite volumes. This expression,          '.   is the
b of our formula.      Having thus obtained the most probable
value of b for each volume, the value of a at each volume was
ascertained by calculation from each individual point read
from the original curves, and at each volume the mean of all
was chosen.
    Isothermals were then calculated by means of the equation
p=bT-a, T being kept constant; and those values of a and
b corresponding to the volumes required being selected. These
calculated isothermals are shown on Plate VII.; and the lines
of equal volume, or isochors", on Plate VIII. It is evident,
from inspection of the former, that the calculated lines corre
spond as closely as possible with the actual observations.
    It is necessary now to give the data on which these deduc
tions are based. The following Table gives those points
corresponding to lines of equal volume read from the diagram
constructed from experimental observations.                           -

   Lines of equal volume, or isochors, were then mapped from
these results, pressures and temperatures being ordinates and
abscissae.    The values of   #. or b, were then read for each
separate volume and smoothed, as before described. The fol
lowing Table shows the read values, and the values after
smoothing. The values of a are also given, calculated by
the equation a =bt–p, from the results shown on the previous
table; the means of all the individual results for each volume

444                Drs. Ramsay and Young on
   The lines of equal volume calculated from these values of
a and b are reproduced graphically in Plates VIII. and IX.
We propose to discuss the form of the diagram later.
   We have calculated the values of p for various isothermals,
at the above volumes.        These are shown in Plate VII.; the
actual experimental observations, of which a detailed account
is given in the ‘Philosophical Transactions, 1886, p. 10 et
seq., are represented by circles. It is evident that the curves
through the calculated points represent the actual measure
ments very closely, indeed as nearly as unavoidable error of
experiment allows. It is to be noticed that the greatest
divergence is at the temperatures 250° and 280°, but the de
viations are in opposite directions, and must therefore be
ascribed to experimental error.
   Table III. (pp. 442,443) gives the data from which the cal
culated isothermals were constructed.
   As volumes above 30 cubic centim. per gram are not given
in the diagram, we have thought it advisable to show the cor
respondence of calculated and observed results by a table;
the calculated numbers were read from curves specially con
structed from the formula p=bt—a, and the observed results
are those actually furnished by our experiments. It will be
seen that the correspondence is very close.

446                  Drs. Ramsay and Young on
   These complete the data for ether. It appeared necessary
to examine the relations between volume, temperature, and
pressure for carbon dioxide, because it is chemically entirely
different from ether, and also because the data are furnished
by Dr. Andrews, whose experimental skill was very great; and
we shall prove that his results entirely corroborate our views.
   It was first necessary to correct the pressures given by him
in atmospheres by means of Amagat’s results, so far as that is
possible. As Amagat’s experiments on the compressibility of
dry air do not extend beyond 65,000 millim., no correction was
possible above that pressure; and extrapolation is inadmissible,
inasmuch as the minimum value of pu for air is at 60,000 millim.
   Data for obtaining the actual volume of carbon dioxide used
are given by Andrews. The weight was calculated in the
following manner:—Andrews gives the volume of carbon di
oxide filling his tubes at 0°and 0.76 millim, and from Regnault's
data the weight was calculated. This refers to Andrews's first
paper (Phil. Trans. 1869, ii. p. 575). In his second paper
(Phil. Trans. 1876, p. 421) no direct data are given from
which the weight can be determined ; but we succeeded, by
combining the results given in his various tables, in arriving
at the weight without any serious error.
   His results are reproduced in an available form in the
following Tables —

 448                   Drs. Ramsay and Young on
 but approximate corrections were introduced. It was possible
 to read pressures to within 30 millim. on the scale employed, and
 volume to within 0.02 cub. centim. per gram. Pressures corre
 sponding to even volumes were read off, as with ether; and on
 mapping the isochors with temperatures as abscissae and pres
 sures as ordinates, the resulting points lay in straight lines. The
 values of b, i.e. of             #,        were then read off, and smoothed,
 by mapping them against the reciprocals of the volumes. After
 smoothing, the values of a were calculated at each volume,
  making use of the pressures previously read from the curve
  representing isothermals. The diagram (1) on Plate X. was
 then constructed from these smoothed values.                                 The crosses
 denote our readings of pressures at the temperatures chosen
 by Andrews for his isothermals. These values of a and b
 were then made use of in recalculating isothermals at the
 above temperatures, and the diagram (2) on Plate X, repre
 sents the curves complete so far as Andrews's data allow. The
 circles represent Andrews’s actual measurements; and it is
 evident that no better concordance could be expected. The
 tables which follow give the data afforded by Andrews's
 experiments.

    It will be seen that the highest calculated pressure is about
 73,500 millim. Andrews gives measurements at much higher
pressures; but these are few in number and uncertain, and
the correction for the compressibility of air is moreover
unknown. Hence it was impossible to make use of them in
determining the values of b.
    On reference to Andrews's paper (Phil. Trans. 1876, p. 435)

450                  Drs. Ramsay and Young on
it will be seen that he compared the relation of increase of
pressure to temperature-difference at constant volumes, and
came to a conclusion opposed to ours. This is owing to his
having made very few observations, and having accidentally
chosen those which support his statement. If the coefficients of
increase of pressure for unit rise of temperature be calculated
by means of Table W., it may be noticed that, although irre
gular, there is no tendency towards a rise or fall of the
coefficient.
   Regnault has measured the rise of pressure of gaseous car
bonic anhydride at constant volume. He gives the results of
four experiments, none of which are available for our purpose,
inasmuch as the volumes of a gram are too large.
   Reverting to the behaviour of ether, as shown on Plate VII.,
it will be seen that the curves have been drawn in the region
where measurements are impossible. These curves have all
the same general form. After rise of pressure and decrease of
volume have proceeded for some distance, the curves bend
downward, presenting the abnormal feature of decrease of
volume with fall of pressure. The pressure continues thus to
fall, and at 160° the isothermal touches zero-pressure. At
lower temperatures, with small volumes, the pressure becomes
negative, and may even represent an enormous tension. At
0° the isothermal at vol. 1:85 cub. centim. per gram reaches
the almost incredibly great tension of -271,700 millim.;
and it has at that volume (the smallest our results allow us
to calculate) by no means reached its limit. At still smaller
volumes the tension would doubtless still increase, until the
 curve turned, and further decrease of volume would be repre
 sented, as it is at higher temperatures, by increase of pressure.
    The existence of these unrealizable portions of such iso
 thermal curves was, we believe, first suggested by Prof. James
 Thomson, in a paper in the ‘Proceedings of the Belfast
 Natural History and Philosophical Society, Nov. 29, 1871.
 Since that time attempts have been made to express relations
 between the pressure, temperature, and volume of gases and
 liquids by Van der Waals and by Clausius; and the formulae
 which they propose, and which we hope to consider in a sub
 sequent paper, give isothermals of similar form. Portions of
 these curves have, indeed, been experimentally verified. In
 Professor Thomson's paper, above referred to, he points out
 that Donny, Dufour, and others have observed the phenomenon
 commonly alluded to as “boiling with bumping.” This is
 usually the effect of a rise of temperature at constant pressure.
 But it may equally well be produced, as we have frequently
 had occasion to remark, at constant temperature by lowering

                     Evaporation and Dissociation.                      451
pressure. If the diagram on plate iii. in our memoir on
alcohol (Phil. Trans. 1886, part i. p. 156) be referred to, it
will be seen that our actual measurement of such reduced
pressure was made on the isothermal 181°4. Mr. John Aitken,
in an extended series of experiments on this subject (Trans.
Royal Scott. Soc. of Arts, vol. ix.), has shown that such
“superheating” can take place only in absence of a free
surface, i.e. the existence of gaseous nuclei in the liquid, into
which evaporation may take place. And Mr. Aitken has also
shown that a gas may be compressed to a volume smaller
than that at which liquefaction usually occurs, at any given
temperature, without formation of liquid. The space, again,
if no nuclei be present on which condensation may take place,
remains “supersaturated with vapour.” It is evidently, there
fore, only the instability of such conditions which prevents
their complete realization*.
    The formulae of Clausius and Van der Waals are based on
the assumption that two causes are in operation—those
referred to in the beginning of this paper—viz. the actual
size of the molecules, and their mutual attraction.                   It is
possible, by help of these assumptions, to realize the nature of
the continuous change from the gaseous to the liquid state of
matter. When a gas at a given temperature is reduced in
volume its molecules necessarily approach each other, and
 their attraction for one another increases.             This attraction
 aids the increase of pressure in reducing volume. When a
 certain volume is reached, the attraction has become so marked
 that further reduction of volume is accompanied by fall of
 pressure. If a certain volume be chosen on the descending
 portion of an isothermal, a state of balance may be imagined
 where pressure and cohesion unite in maintaining the volume
 constant against the kinetic energy of the molecules, tending
 to cause expansion.
     The conception of negative pressure, or tension, is that at
 low temperatures and small volumes the cohesion is such that,
 in order to overcome it and increase volume, it would be
 necessary to apply tension to each molecule. But after the
 lowest pressure or greatest tension has been attained, the
 actual size of the molecules presents a bar to closer approach;
 and to cause further decrease of volume pressure must again
     * The reasoning of a recent paper by Wroblewski (Monatsheft der
  Chemie, Wien, July 1886, p.383) rests on the assumption that such con
  ditions are inconceivable. He supposes lines of equal density to be curves,
 and on their close approach to the vapour-pressure curve to run parallel
 with it. His conclusions are therefore not borne out by experimental
  facts,

452               Drs. Ramsay and Young on
be applied. It is not to be supposed that at any given volume
only one of these factors is operative; the actual size of the
molecules exerts its influence even at large volumes, and the
cohesion does not disappear, but no doubt immensely increases,
as the volume is reduced, even when that reduction requires
rise of pressure Still, a mental picture of the process may,
we think, best be attained by directing attention to cohesion,
when volume is being decreased with fall of pressure, and to
the influence of the actual size of the molecules when volume
is small.
   When a liquid is converted into gas, heat is absorbed, or
work is done on the liquid. We have previously (loc. cit.)
given tables showing the heats of vaporization of ether at
various temperatures. Our experiments have confirmed the
prediction that the heat of vaporization of stable liquids
decreases with rise of temperature, and in all probability
becomes zero at the critical temperature. Now the volume of
a fluid may be changed, either keeping the pressure constant
or allowing it to vary during the operation; but if the initial
pressure and final pressure are the same, the variation of
pressure during the operation does not affect the total work
done. A liquid may be changed into saturated vapour at any
given temperature in the usual manner, when the intermediate
states are represented by non-homogeneous mixtures of liquid
and saturated vapour. The area enclosed between the vapour
pressure line and lines drawn vertically from its terminal points,
cut by the line of zero pressure (or pressure x change of
volume), represents graphically the external work performed
in evaporating a liquid. If, however, the change of condition
be not abrupt, but continuous, the area enclosed by the iso
thermal below the vapour-pressure line must be equal to that
above the vapour-pressure line (see Plate VII.). If this were
not the case, the amount of work required to effect the con
tinuous change would differ from that required for the abrupt
change of state.
   Now it is evident that a slight alteration in the position of
the vapour-pressure line would have great influence on the
relative areas enclosed by the isothermal above and below the
vapour-pressure line; and it may also be seen that, when these
areas are rendered equal by a horizontal line, the position of
that horizontal line must represent the true vapour-pressure.
   We have determined the position of the horizontal line in
the following manner —
   Knowing approximately the position of the vapour-pressure
line at a given temperature, three pressures were chosen—the
highest above and the lowest below the experimentally deter

                   Evaporation and Dissociation.                 453
mined vapour-pressure; and by means of a planimeter (by
Stanley of Holborn) the areas enclosed between each hori
zontal line and the curves respectively below and above it,
formed by the isothermal lines, were measured. To ascertain
what position of the horizontal line would render these areas
equal, the values of each set of three areas were mapped on
sectional paper as abscissae, the pressures corresponding to the
position of the horizontal lines being ordinates. The curves
passing through the resulting points cut each other at a point
which represents the true pressure and the true area. This
method is rendered clearer by inspection of the following
figure —
   It is evident that these vapour-pressures depend entirely on
measurements represented in the diagram outside the area
bounded by the curve representing orthobasic volumes of gas
and liquid. It will be seen, on reference to the table on p. 444,
that the agreement between these calculated vapour-pressures
and those experimentally determined is a very close one, the
greatest difference being about 1 per cent. This agreement
between experimentally observed vapour-pressures and those
depending on the formula p=bt—a is very remarkable, and
it is difficult to believe that, if the isochoric lines were curves,
such an agreement could exist.
   What are usually termed vapour-pressures, then, are those
pressures at which horizontal lines drawn through them render
the areas enclosed by the isothermal lines below the horizontal
lines equal to those above them. But there are other two
conditions of matter, each of which has its characteristic
pressures. One of these is represented by the highest pressure
attainable on any isothermal, or the summit of the curve above
the vapour-pressure line; and the other the apex of the curve
below the vapour-pressure line. Each temperature chosen has

454                   Drs. Ramsay and Young on
its particular value for each of these conditions; and it is
evident that the relations between the temperatures and
pressures corresponding to the inferior or reversed apices, as
well as those corresponding to the superior apices, would each
form a special curve.
    The following Table gives the final results of the calculation
of vapour-pressures by the method of areas; and, for the
sake of comparison, the actually found vapour-pressures are
appended. The pressures at the superior and inferior apices
of the isothermal curves, and also the enclosed areas, are

    The three pressure-curves—which we shall name the “ordi
 nary” vapour-pressure curve, the “superior” vapour-pressure
 curve, formed by the superior apices of the isothermal lines,
 and the “inferior” vapour-pressure curve, produced by
 the lower apices of the isothermal lines—must, it is evident,
meet at the critical point; and on mapping them, it was
 found that this was the case.         Points were chosen on these
 curves at equal intervals of temperature, and the constants
 for formulae of the type log p=a+ba' were calculated for
 each. As the pressures on the inferior curve below a certain
 temperature were negative, it was found convenient to add
 30,000 millim. to
 from the result.

     With exception of the lowest temperature, the agree
  ment between the read and the calculated pressures is close.
  The extrapolation amounts to only 3°83. The agreement
  is close at 192°, and above that temperature the extrapolation
  is only 1°83. It will be seen that at that temperature
  (193°83) the pressures coincide. The apparent critical point
  was 193°8.
                                 Isochoric Lines.
      Plate IX. represents the whole of the isochors which we
  have calculated between the volumes of 1.85 and 300 cub.
  centim. per gram.
      If the gas followed Boyle's and Gay-Lussac's laws abso
  lutely, under all conditions, the isochoric lines would all radiate
  from zero pressure, and would become more and more vertical
  as the volumes decreased; and the tangents of the angles
  formed by these lines with the horizontal line of zero pressure

456                Drs. Ramsay and Young on
would be proportional to c in the equation p =ct, where c varies
inversely as the volume. But our equation, p=bt-a, intro
duces another term, a, which is negative. These values of a
are represented on the diagram by the extremities of the
isochoric lines, where they cut the vertical line representing
absolute zero of temperature. The tangents of the angles
made by these lines with a horizontal line are proportional to
the values of b in our equation.
   On referring to Plate IX. it will be noticed that, beginning
at the largest volume, two adjacent isochors cut each other at
a point, as regards pressure and temperature, not far above
zero. With decreasing volumes the points of intersection of
adjacent isochors occur at higher and rapidly increasing tem
peratures and slowly increasing pressures; and this proceeds
until the critical volume is reached. With still smaller volumes,
however, the points of intersection of adjacent isochors occur
at lower and decreasing temperatures and pressures; the
former decrease slowly, but the latter with great rapidity, and
soon extend into the region of negative pressures.
   It is evident from the diagram that each isochor between
the largest and the critical volume is the tangent of a curve,
representing the relations of pressure to temperature; while
the isochors below the critical volume are tangents to another
curve, also exhibiting the like relations. Neither of these
curves is identical with the vapour-pressure curve, which falls
in the area between them.
   It will be noticed that, in the area included between the
line of zero pressure and these two curves, each isochoric line
is cut by two others at every point along its whole length;
 but outside this surface, and above the line of zero pressure,
 no two lines cut each other, and below the line of zero pressure
 each isochor is cut at each point by one other. The physical
 meaning of the fact that within the first-mentioned region
 three isochors intersect each other at one point is, that a gram
 of the substance may occupy three different volumes at the
 same temperature and pressure. Now, on referring to the
 diagram on Plate VII, representing the experimentally un
 realizable portions of the isothermal curves, it is evident that
 on each isothermal line, at pressures limited by the superior
 or inferior apices of the isothermal, there are, corresponding
 to each pressure, three volumes. At any pressure above or
 below these pressures the isothermal line is cut only once, by a
 horizontal line of equal pressure; so that, for each pressure,
 there is only one corresponding volume. At each apex a
 horizontal line of equal pressure cuts the isothermal line

                  Evaporation and Dissociation.              457
at one point, and is also a tangent to the apex. There are,
therefore, two volumes corresponding to each of these pres
sures. Since no gas can be submitted to a negative pressure,
those portions of an isothermal line representing the truly
gaseous condition of matter never extend below the horizontal
line of zero pressure; only those portions of the isothermal
which proceed towards the inferior apex fall below this line.
An isothermal line below zero pressure is therefore cut only
twice by a line of equal pressure, and there are therefore two
volumes corresponding to each pressure. At each inferior
apex, however, the horizontal line is a tangent to the curve,
and there is therefore only one volume corresponding to a
given pressure.
    On referring back to Plate IX., it will be seen that the
pressures corresponding to the superior apices of each iso
thermal line, when mapped, produce the curve AC ; and
those corresponding to the inferior apices, the curve BC.
 The surface bounded by these curves and the line of zero
 pressure corresponds to portions of the isothermal lines,
 including pressures between the two apices, and each point in
the surface is the locus of intersection of three isochoric lines.
 Below the line of zero pressure the isochoric lines cor
 responding to the gaseous state are absent; and hence each
 point is the locus of intersection of only two isochors. The
isothermal lines above and below the limits of pressure given
 by the apices are cut only once by any line of equal pressure;
 hence the isochors outside the area ACD, and above the line
of zero pressure, do not intersect. The apex C of the curvi
 lateral triangle ACD is the point of highest temperature and
 pressure at which intersection can take place, and therefore
represents the critical point; it is also the common point of
 intersection of the three pressure-temperature curves.
    Referring now to Plate VIII., in which the isochoric lines
 in the neighbourhood of the critical point are shown on a
 larger scale, it will be seen that the isochoric lines above
 a volume not far removed from 4 cub. centim. per gram cut
 the ordinary vapour-pressure curve CE on one side, while
 those below the volume 3.75 evidently cut the vapour-pressure
 line on its other side.   There must therefore be an isochoric
 line which does not cut the curve at all, but forms a tangent
 to its end-point. That isochor gives the critical volume. It
may be determined by calculating the value of         #    at the
 critical temperature.    This value of   #    is identical with

458              On Evaporation and Dissociation.
the value of b in our equation p=bt—a at the critical volume.
Until a mathematical expression is discovered, representing b
as a function of volume, the only means at our disposal for
ascertaining the true volume corresponding to b is by inter
polation of the original curve by which the values of b were
smoothed. The common point of intersection of the three
pressure-temperature curves has been shown on p. 455 to lie
at the temperature 193°83. The value of       # on the vapour
pressure curve at this temperature, calculated by the formula
of which the constants have already been given, is 405 millim.,
which is also the value of b at that temperature. The volume
corresponding to this value is 4:06 cub. centim. per gram;
and the specific gravity of ether at its critical point is there
fore 0.2463.
   Unfortunately, Dr. Andrews's measurements of the constants
of carbon dioxide are not sufficiently numerous to warrant an
attempt to obtain the critical temperature, pressure, and volume
by this method. The critical volume of carbon dioxide is
evidently less than 3 cub. centim. per gram ; but the values
of b below that quantity are unascertainable. It may be
noticed that the curves below volume 3 are inserted in broken
lines, showing a probable course; but no reading from them
would be permissible.
   The two liquids, ether and carbon dioxide, have no chemical
analogy with one another; and we therefore feel justified in
concluding that the law which is the subject of this paper is
generally applicable to all stable substances. We have, how
ever, other less complete data for methyl and ethyl alcohols,
which, so far as they go, are confirmatory of the results
described. We have also data available for the examination
of acetic acid—a substance which differs from those men
tioned, inasmuch as it undergoes dissociation when heated;
and we hope shortly to be able to communicate an account of
its behaviour.
    Professor Fitzgerald, to whom we gave a short account of
this law, has recently communicated to the Royal Society a
paper in which its thermodynamical bearings are considered.

LII. On the Stability of Steady and of Periodic" Fluid Motion.
                     By Sir WILLIAM THOMsoNf.
1.   TH:        fluid will be taken as incompressible; but the
             results will generally be applicable to the motion of
natural liquids and of air or other gases when the velocity is
everywhere small in comparison with the velocity of sound in
the particular fluid considered. I shall first suppose the fluid
to be inviscid. The results obtained on this supposition will
help in an investigation of effects of viscosity which will follow.
    2. I shall suppose the fluid completely enclosed in a con
taining vessel, which may be either rigid, or plastic so that
we may at pleasure mould it to any shape, or of natural solid
material and therefore viscously elastic (that is to say, return
ing always to the same shape and size when time is allowed,
but resisting all deformations with a force depending on the
speed of the change, superimposed upon a force of quasi
perfect elasticity). The whole mass of containing-vessel and
   * By steady motion of a system (whether a set of material points, or a
rigid body, or a fluid mass, or a set of solids, or portions of fluid, or a
system composed of a set of solids or £ of fluid, or of portions of
solid and fluid), I mean motion which at any and every time is precisely
similar to what it is at one time. By periodic motion I mean motion
which is perfectly similar, at all instants of time differing by a certain
interval called the period.
   Example 1: Every possible adynamic motion of a free rigid body,
having two of its principal moments of inertia equal, is steady. So also
is that of a solid of revolution filled with irrotational inviscid incompres
sible fluid.
   Example 2. The adynamic motion of a solid of revolution filled with
homogeneously rotating inviscid incompressible fluid is essentially periodic,
and is steady only in particular cases.
   Example 3. The adynamic motion of a free rigid body with three un
equal principal moments of inertia is essentially periodic, and is onl
steady in the particular case of rotation round one or other of the three
principal axes; so also, and according to the same law, is the motion of a
rigid body having a hollow or hollows filled with irrotational inviscid
incompressible fluid, with the three virtual moments of inertia unequal.
   Erample 4. The adynamic motion of a hollow rigid body filled with
rotationally moving fluid is essentially unsteady and    £             except
in particular cases. Even in the case of an ellipsoidal hollow and homo
geneous molecular rotation, the motion is non-periodic. The motion,
whether rotational or irrotational, of fluid in an ellipsoidal hollow is fully
investigated in a paper under this title published in the Proceedings of
the Royal Society of Edinburgh for December 7, 1885. Among other
results it was proved that the rotation, if initially given homogeneous,
remains homogeneous, provided the figure of the hollow be never at any
time deformed from being exactly ellipsoidal.
   t. Communicated by the Author, having been read before the Royal
Society of Edinburgh on April 18, 1887.

 460         Sir William Thomson on the Stability of
 fluid will sometimes be considered as absolutely free in space
 undisturbed by gravity or other force; and sometimes we
 shall suppose it to be held absolutely fixed. But more fre
 quently we may suppose it to be held by solid supports of
 real, and therefore viscously elastic, material; so that it will
be fixed only in the same sense as a real three-legged table
 resting on the ground is fixed. The fundamental philoso
 phic question, What is fixity? is of paramount importance
 in our present subject. Directional fixedness is explained in
 Thomson and Tait's ‘Natural Philosophy, 2nd edition, Part I.
 § 249, and more fully discussed by Prof. James Thomson in
a paper “On the Law of Inertia, the Principle of Chrono
metry, and the     £           of Absolute Clinural Rest and of
Absolute Rotation.” For our present purpose we shall cut
the matter short by assuming our platform, the earth or the
floor of our room, to be absolutely fixed in space.
    3. The object of the present communication, so far as it
relates to inviscid fluid, is to prove and to illustrate the proof
of the three following propositions regarding a mass of fluid
given with any rotation in any part of it:—
    (I.) The energy of the whole motion may be infinitely in
creased by doing work in a certain systematic manner on the
containing-vessel and bringing it ultimately to rest.
    (II.) If the containing-vessel be  £      continuous and be
of natural viscously elastic material, the fluid given moving
within it will come of itself to rest.
   (III.) If the containing-vessel be complexly continuous and
be of natural viscously elastic material, the fluid will lose
energy; not to zero, however, but to a determinate condition
of irrotational circulation with a determinate cyclic constant
for each circuit through it.
   4. To prove 3 (I.) remark, first, that mere distortion of the
fluid, by changing the shape of the boundary, can increase
the kinetic energy indefinitely. For simplicity, suppose a
finite or an infinitely great change of shape of the containing
vessel to be made in an infinitely short time; this will distort
the internal fluid precisely as it would have done if the fluid
had been given at rest, and thus, by Helmholtz’s laws of vor
tex motion, we can calculate, from the initial state of motion
supposed known, the molecular rotation of every part of the
fluid, after the change. For example, let the shape of the
containing-vessel be altered by homogeneous strain; that is
to say, dilated uniformly in one, or in each of two, directions,
and contracted uniformly in the other direction or directions,
of three at right angles to one another. The liquid will be
homogeneously deformed throughout ; the axis of molecular

                Steady and of Periodic Fluid Motion.           461
rotation in each part will change in direction so as to keep
 along the changing direction of the same line of fluid par
 ticles; and its magnitude will change in inverse simple pro
portion to the distance between two particles in the line of the
axlS.
   5. But, now, to simplify subsequent operations to the utmost,
 suppose that anyhow, by quick motion or by slow motion, the
 containing-vessel be changed to a circular cylinder with per
 forated diaphragm and two pistons, as shown in fig. 1. In
 the present circumstances the motion of the liquid may be
 supposed to have any degree of complexity of molecular rota
tion throughout. It might chance to have no moment of
 momentum round the axis of the cylinder, but we shall sup
pose this not to be the case. If it did chance to be the case
 (which could be discovered by external tests), a motion of the
cylinder, round a diameter, to a fresh position of rest would
leave it with moment of momentum of the internal fluid round
the axis of the cylinder. Without further preface, however,
we shall suppose the cylinder to be given, with the pistons as
in fig. 1, containing fluid in an exceedingly irregular state of
motion, but with a given moment of momentum M round the
axis of the cylinder. The cylinder itself is to be held absolutely
fixed, and therefore whatever we do to the pistons we cannot
alter the whole moment of momentum of the fluid round the
axis of the cylinder.

its middle position C C, and the                 Fig. 1.

remain at rest, because the pressure
of the fluid on it is everywhere in
plane with the axis. But now, in
stead of being ideally rigid, let the
vessel be of natural viscous-elastic
solid material. The unsteadiness
of the internal fluid motion will cause deformations of the
containing-solid with loss of energy, and the result finally
approximated to more and more nearly as time advances is
necessarily the one determinate condition of minimum energ
with the given moment of momentum; which, as is well

462            Sir William Thomson on the Stability of
known and easily proved, is the condition of solid and fluid
rotating with equal angular velocity. If the stiffness of the
containing-vessel be small enough and its viscosity great
enough, it is easily seen that this final condition will be
closely approximated to in a very moderate number of times
the period of rotation in the final condition. Still we must
wait an infinite time before we can find a perfect approxima
tion to this condition reached from our highly complex or
irregular initial motion. We shall now, therefore, cut the
affair short by simply supposing the fluid to be given rotating
with uniform angular velocity, like a solid within the con
taining-vessel, a true figure of revolution, which we shall now
again consider as absolutely rigid, and consisting of cylinder
with perforated diaphragm and two movable pistons, as repre
sented in fig. 1.

ing it always in the direction of its motion. It will not
thus be brought into a state of increasing oscillation, but the
work done upon it will be spent in augmenting the energy of
the fluid motion: so that if, after a great number of to-and
fro motions of the piston with some work done on it during
each of them, the piston is once more brought to rest, the
energy of the fluid motion will be greater than in the begin
ning, when it was rotating homogeneously like a solid. It
has still exactly the same moment of momentum and the same
vorticity" in every part; and the motion is symmetrical
round the axis of the cylinder. Hence it is easily seen that
the greater energy implies the axial region of the fluid being
stretched axially, and so acquiring angular velocity greater
than the original angular velocity of the whole fluid mass.
    8. The accompanying diagram (fig. 3) represents an easily
performed     £                illustration, in which rotating water
is churned by quick up-and-down movement of a disk carried
on a vertical rod guided to move along the axis of the con
taining-vessel which is attached to a rotating vertical shaft.
The kind of churning motion thus produced is very different
from that produced by the perforated diaphragm; but the
ultimate result is so far similar, that the statement of § 7 is
equally applicable to the two cases. In the experiment, a
little air is left under the cork, in the neck of the containing
vessel, to allow something to be seen of the motions of the
water. When the vessel has been kept rotating steadily for
some time with the churn-disk resting on the bottom, the sur
face of the water is seen in the paraboloidal form indicated
 (ideally) by the upper dotted curve (but of course greatly
 distorted by the refraction of the glass). Now, by finger and
 thumb applied to the top of the rod, move smartly up and down
several times the churn-disk. A hollow vortex (or column of
Motion,” and now in the press for republication along with other lectures
and addresses in a volume of the “Nature Series.”        “A little wooden
 ball, which when thrust down under still water jumped up again in a
moment, remained down as ifimbedded in jelly when the water was caused
to rotate rapidly, and sprang back as if the water had elasticity like that
of jelly when it was struck by a stiff wire pushed down through the
# of the cork by which the glass vessel containing the water was
filled.”
    * The vorticity of an infinitesimal volume du of fluid is the value of
dv. w/e, where w is its molecular rotation, and e the ratio of the distance
between two of its particles in the axis of rotation at the time considered,
to the distance between the same two particles at a particular time of
reference. The amount of the vorticity thus defined for any part of a
moving fluid depends on the time of reference chosen. Helmholtz's fun
damental theorem of vortex motion proves it to be constant throughout
all time for every small portion of an inviscid fluid.

churn-disk is held at rest in any position, the ragged lower
end of the air-tube becomes rounded and drawn up, the free
surface of the water taking a succession of shapes, like that
indicated by the lower dotted curve, until after a few seconds
(or about a quarter of a minute) it becomes steady in the
paraboloidal shape indicated by the upper dotted curve.
   9. We have supposed the piston brought to rest after having
done work upon the fluid during a vast but finite number of
to-and-fro motions.    But if left to itself it will not remain at
rest; it will get into a state of irregular oscillation, due to
superposition of oscillations of the fluid according to an infi
nite number of fundamental modes, of the kind investigated
in my article “Vibrations of a Columnar Vortex,” Proc. Roy.
Soc. Edinb., March 1, 1880, but not, as there, limited to being
infinitesimal! If the motion of the piston be viscously resisted
these vibrations will be gradually calmed down; and if time
enough is allowed, the whole energy that has been imparted
to the liquid by the work done on the pistons will be lost, and
it will again be rotating uniformly like a solid, as it was in
the beginning.

   A Treatise on Algebra. By Profs. OLIVER, WAIT, and Jon Es.
       (Ithaca, N.Y.: Dudley Finch, 1887; pp. viii-H412.)
This is not an Elementary Textbook, and so is not a work for
      ordinary school-use. It is a work very much of the same
high character as that by Prof. Chrystal which we had occasion
lately to notice in these columns, and, like it, this also is only a first
volume. With points of similarity there are numerous points of
dissimilarity. The motto of both is “Thorough.” Our present
Authors—an unusual combination, a triple chord—“assume no
previous knowledge of Algebra, but lay down the primary definitions
and axioms, and, building on these, develop the elementary principles
in logical order; add such simple illustrations as shall make
familiar these principles and their uses.” Then as to form:
“Make clear and precise definition of every word and symbol used
in a technical sense; make formal statement of every general
principle, and, if not an axiom, prove it rigorously; make formal
statement of every general problem, and give a rule for its solution,
with reasons, examples, and checks; add such notes as shall
indicate motives, point out best arrangements, make clear special
cases, and suggest extensions and new uses.” It will be gathered
from this outline, and our Authors, we think, have kept close to
this chart, that here is about the same departure from ordinary
textbooks as in the case we have referred to above. Indeed, to
our mind we have almost too much logic and careful detail, but for
college students and mathematical teachers this elaboration is of
great service. Indeed the book has been written for the classes
which have been and are under the authors’ training. They them
selves admit that the Work has so grown under their hands as to
embrace many topics quite beyond the range of ordinary college
instruction.   The book fulfils their desire that it should be a
stepping-stone to the higher analysis. Having indicated the
nature of the work we give now some of the matters discussed in
the twelve chapters. The first is on primary definitions and signs;
the second is on primary operations (a valuable chapter); the third
on Measures, Multiples, and Factors; the fourth on Permutations
and Combinations; the fifth on Powers and Roots of Polynomials;

      1. “On the Correlation of the Upper Jurassic Rocks of the Jura
with those of England.” By Thomas Roberts, Esq., M.A., F.G.S.
   The author described at length his observations on the rocks of
the Jurassic system, from the Callovian to the Purbeckian inclusive,
first in the Canton of Berne and then in the more southerly Cantons
of Neuchâtel and Vaud.              The sections in the former differed ma
terially from those in the latter, and the following stages and sub

        2. “The Physical History of the Bagshot Beds of the London
     Basin.” By the Rev. A. Irving, B.Sc., B.A., F.G.S.
        The Author, in reviewing the position taken up by him, attempted
     to estimate the value of such palaeontological evidence as exists, and
     insisted on the importance of the physical evidence in the first place.
     He gave reasons for considering the evidence of pebbles, pipe-clay,
     derived materials, irony concretions, percentages of elementar
     carbon (ranging in the more carbonaceous strata up to nearly 23°/.)
     taken together with the evidence of carbon in combination, as ad
     duced in former papers, freshwater Diatoms (now, perhaps recorded
     for the first time in the Middle and Lower Bagshot), and the micro
     scopic structure of the sands and clays, as furnishing such a cumu
     lative proof of the fluviatile and delta origin of the majority of the
     Middle and Lower Bagshot Beds, as can hardly be gainsaid; while
     he regarded the wide distribution of the Sarsens, taken along with
     the absence of such evidence as is quoted above, as indicating, along
     with the fauna, a much greater areal range formerly of the Upper
     Bagshot than of the strata below them.

468          Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
   He referred to the evidence furnished by the Walton section (Q. J.
G. S. May, 1886), the Brookwood deep well (Geol. Mag. August,
1886), the contemporaneous denudation of the London Clay (Geol.
Mag. September, 1886) as affording further support to the view
which he has advocated; gave six new sections on the northern
side of the area, showing (1) the attenuation of the Lower Bag
shots beneath the Middle Bagshot clays, (2) the greater development
of clays towards the margin at the expense of the sands, (3) con
temporaneous transverse erosion of the London Clay, (4) cases of
 overlap, (5) the occurrence of massive pebble-beds at nearly the
same altitude along the northern flank underlying (as at East
hampstead and Bearwood) Upper Bagshot sands, and resting either
immediately upon, or in near proximity to, the London Clay; and
added an account of his observations on the flank of St. Anne's Hill,
Chertsey, which he takes to be nothing more than an ancient river
valley escarpment, subsequently eroded by rain-water, the hollows
thus formed having been subsequently filled up and covered over by
pebbles and other débris of the beds in the higher part of the hill,
these assuming the character of ordinary talus material. The con
sideration of the southern margin of the Bagshot district is reserved
for a future paper.
   The Author considered that his main position, resting as it does
upon physical evidence, remains untouched by the attempt of later
writers to disprove it; while the disproof breaks down even on
its own lines (the stratigraphical), the paper in which this dis
proof is insisted upon being characterized by (1) an incomplete
grasp of the problem on the part of its authors, (2) equivocal data,
(3) omission of important evidence, (4) inconsistencies, (5) erro
neous statements.
   The Author (while correcting some errors of stratigraphical detail,
which appeared in his former paper, from insufficiency of data)
maintained that (though occasional intercalated beds with marine
fossils may be met with, as is commonly the case in a series of
delta- and lagoon-deposits) the view he has put forward is, in the
main, established; and he proposed the following classification of
the Bagshot Beds of the London Basin:—

          ON THE INERT SPACE IN CHEMICAL REACTIONS.
                        BY OSCAR LIEBREICH.
  A  CCORDING to all previous observations, it has been assumed
       that a chemical reaction in liquids which are perfectly mixed
takes place uniformly and simultaneously in all parts unless cur

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                469
rents are produced in consequence of inequalities of temperature.
In the reduction of copper sulphate by grape-sugar, on heating, the
suboxide is first perceived in the upper part. We know also that
in reducing liquids which contain certain metallic salts, the products
of reduction are deposited on the surfaces opposed to them. It has
never, however, been observed that in liquids, perfect mixture
being presupposed, certain parts are withdrawn from the reaction,
or show some retardation in the change.
    I have succeeded in demonstrating the existence of a space in
mixtures in which a chemical reaction is not visible.        I have called
it the inert space (todter Raum). In introducing this idea as the
result of my experiments, I would define it as that space in a
uniformly mixed liquid in which the reaction occurs either not at
all, or is retarded, or takes place to a less extent than in the
principal liquid.
    Reaction-space and inert space can be most sharply separated
from each other in the experiments which I adduce. The occurrence
of such an inert space is best demonstrated with hydrate of chloral,
which, when treated with sodium carbonate, decomposes into
chloroform, according to the following equation:
          C,Cl,O.H.--Na,CO. =CHCl,+NaHCO,+NaHCO.
With a suitable concentration, and mixture in proper equivalents,
the chloroform separates not in thick oily drops, but as a fine mist
which gradually collects in drops at the bottom. The reaction
 does not start at once, but depends on concentration and tempera
 ture. The concentration proper for the observations can be so
arranged that the commencement of the reaction varies between 1
and 25 minutes. This time may even be considerably prolonged *.
    If the reaction is made in an ordinary test-tube, there is a space
 of 1 to 3 mm. below the meniscus, which is not affected by the
reaction; that is, it remains perfectly clear; and the reaction-space
 is bounded above with the sharpness of a hair, by a surface curved
 in the opposite direction to that of the meniscus.
    The upper space in the liquid which thus remains clear is the
 inert space in the hydrate-of-chloral reaction.
    Even after the tube has been left still for 24 hours this space is
 visible; for the boundary of the inert space can still be distinctly
 recognized by minute spherules of chloroform which have not sunk.
 If the test-tube is gently agitated, so that the chloroform-mist
 passes into the inert space, after a few minutes the chloroform
 settles to its former boundary, and the separation between the
 inert space and the reaction-space is again reproduced.
    Careful observation showed that the clear layer of liquid was
 diminished by the ascent of the chloroform-mist, and was not
 increased by sinking.
    I have observed the inert space in this reaction in differently
    * I used equal volumes of aqueous solutions of 331 gr. hydrate of
 chloral and 212 gr. sodium carbonate in the litre, which were diluted to
 a corresponding extent, so as to prolong the duration of the reaction.

 470            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
 shaped vessels. If we take a glass box with parallel sides which
 are at a distance of a centimetre apart, it is seen that the inert
 space presents itself as a surface curved in the opposite direction to
 the meniscus. It can moreover be observed that at the positions of
 greatest curvature, a gradual equalization or a fresh reaction-zone
 is formed. If a horizontal glass cylinder closed by parallel glass
 plates is taken, the curvature of the active space is seen in great
 sharpness and beauty.
    If the reaction takes place between two glass plates which are
 inclined to each other at an acute angle so that their line of contact
 is vertical, the height of the meniscus is represented by a deeper
 position of the inert space.
    In capillary tubes which, after being filled, are placed horizontally,
 the inert space is met with on each side. Even if the capillary
 tubes are taken so fine, that the lumen must be examined by a
 magnifying-power of 300 times, the active and the inert space can
 be separately observed. The reaction occurs with separation of
 small molecular drops of chloroform in the middle of the liquid
 cylinder, while it remains clear at each end. With very small
 drops in capillary tubes there is no reaction *.
    If tubes closed at the top are filled with the active mixture so
 that there is no air-bubble, the decomposition is uniform throughout
 the entire liquid. If, however, tubes open at the top are filled with
 the liquid, and are closed by a small transparent animal membrane
 stretched in a lead frame, it is possible by carefully raising it to
 show here also the inert space.
    If a glass tube open at both ends is placed on a fine membrane,
 and is closed at the top also by a membrane, it is seen that when
 the tube is held vertically an inactive space can be observed below,
 in which the chloroform gradually settles as a cloud. I have not
 been able to ascertain whether the reaction in this case is also
 limited at the sides of the tube.
    If a specimen of the liquid be taken from the inert space by
 means of a capillary tube, and it be warmed, decomposition at once
 sets in. This is a proof that the two substances contain unaltered
 hydrate of chloral and sodium carbonate. It is of course im
 portant to observe the phenomena of the inert space by other
 reactions which take place slowly. The reaction which takes
 place between iodic and sulphurous acids according to the following
 equations:
                       3SO,+HIO =3SO,+IH
                       5IH +HIO, =3H,0+6I
was found to be particularly suitable, since it has been found by
Landoltt that by suitable dilution, and variation of the quantities,
it can be delayed at pleasure and in accordance with a definite law.
   The occurrence of the iodine reaction is made manifest by the
   * For this experiment it is necessary to free the liquid from absorbed
air by boiling.

addition of soluble starch, which by the sudden blue coloration
indicates the liberation of iodine.
    Solutions were used containing 0.25 gr. of iodic acid in a litre
of water, or the same quantity in the litre of a mixture of equal
parts of glycerine and water.
    The sulphurous acid was used of such concentration that 5 cub.
cent. of its solution in water just decolorized 2 cub. cent. of a
one-per-cent. solution of potassium permanganate.
    On mixing 10 cub. cent. of solution of iodic acid with 3 cub.
cent. of sulphurous acid, the reaction sets in in about 5 minutes, and
in the various glass vessels shows an inert space above, which lasts
for a time depending on the temperature.
    The iodine reaction presents a phenomenon to which I shall
 afterwards recur; that is, the occurrence of this reaction in the
centre of the tube. If a vertical glass tube 4 millim. in the clear
is filled by aspiration, and subsequent closing by an indiarubber
tube and clamp, from the active liquid which is contained in a wide
 glass cylinder, a fine blue thread is seen to form in the tube, while
 the surrounding liquid remains clear and colourless. The blue
 coloration extends gradually from the thread throughout the entire
 liquid column.
     It could be observed in this phenomenon that the reaction in the
 wider vessel set in sooner than in the narrow tube.
     If either the hydrate-of-chloral or the iodic-acid mixture is placed
 in a vessel in which the liquids can be drawn through fine glass
 beads, no chemical reaction at all is produced.
     It follows thus from these experiments:—
     1. That in liquids the space of chemical action is bounded by an
 inactive zone (the inert space), where the liquid is in contact with
 the air, or is separated from it by a fine membrane.
     2. That the reactions take place more slowly in narrow than in
 wide tubes.
     3. That capillary spaces can entirely suspend chemical reactions.
     As I am engaged in continuing this investigation, I hope soon,

    APPARATUS FOR THE CONDENSATION OF SMOKE BY STATICAL
                     ELECTRICITY.     BY H. AMAURY.
      A glass cylinder is placed on a tripod perforated in the centre,
  and below it a tin-plate box with an opening in the side and at
  the top, in which touch-paper, tinder, or tobacco can be burned, and
  thus the cylinder be filled with smoke. To the top of the cylinder
  is fitted a small lid in which is a vertical tube. At half the height
  of the cylinder are two diametrically opposite tubuli, through which
  pass metal rods; these are connected with vertical rods parallel to
  the sides and provided with points. If these combs are connected
  - ith the conductors of an electrical machine, and the latter is
  worked, the smoke is condensed.—Beiblätter der Physik, No. 2, 1887.

THE HEATING OF THE GLASS OF CONDENSERS BY INTERMITTENT
                ELECTRIFICATION.       BY J. BORGMANN.
   The author takes two bundles of 30 cylindrical condensers, each
consisting of a glass tube 46 cm. in length and 5 mm. in diameter;
each tube was coated externally with tinfoil, and filled with copper
filings, and a copper wire inserted, the ends being closed with
paraffin or shellac. Each thirty tubes are formed into bundles, all
the outsides and insides being severally connected. One bundle was
also coated on the outside with tinfoil to improve the conductivity.
These two bundles of condensers were placed respectively in two
large air-thermometers. Each reservoir consisted of a glass tube
of about 50 cm. length and 4.5 cm. internal diameter, which was
surrounded by another tube of the same length and 7 cm. diameter.
Through the brass ends of the reservoirs passed on the one hand
the electrodes, and on the other the limb of the manometer.         The
manometer filled with naphtha consisted of three limbs, of which
two were connected with the two reservoirs of the air-thermometer.
   The charging was effected by means of a Ruhmkorff, and was
measured by a Siemens electrodynamometer. Notwithstanding its
better external conductivity, the bundle C was more heated than
the other, A.
   If e is the deflection of the electrodynamometer in divisions of
the scale, AA and Ac the displacement of the naphtha in the mano
meter in millimetres, which measure the quantities of heat, it was
found that

   It follows from this that the heatings of the condensers are
approximately proportional to the square of the difference of
potential of the coatings.—Beiblåtter der Physik, 1887, p. 55.

GENTLEMEN,                                          Riga, April 8, 1887.
   In the April Number of the Philosophical Magazine for this
year Prof. J. J. Thomson complains that I have misunderstood his
theory of the Chemical Combination of Gases. After a repeated
study of the paper, I must confess that Prof. Thomson is in the
main right. As in my criticism I have done Prof. Thomson an
injustice which I am not able entirely to repair, I will not dwell
upon the injustice which he in the heat of his defence has done me
in his answer, the more so as it has no scientific, but a mere per
sonal interest.

 LVI. The Laws of Motion. By RoBERT FRANKLIN MUIRHEAD,
           B.A., of St. Catharine’s College, Cambridge".
                               Preface.
  Th:      aim of this Essay is to state in the clearest manner
         possible the best evisting conception of dynamical
  science. The writer believes that the statement of dyna
  mical principles here given is to be found implicitly in
 the reasonings of the best modern masters of the science, but
 that it has never hitherto been stated explicitly. The general
 statement indeed has sometimes been made that the proof of
 a hypothesis or theory is its agreement with the facts, or that
 the whole Principia is the proof of the Laws of Motion.
 But I have pointed out in detail that the very conceptions
 and definitions of Dynamics are unintelligible when taken
 singly. I have endeavoured to free the science of Dynamics
 from survivals from its childhood, in the shape of extra
 kinetic definitions of dynamical concepts, and a priori
assumptions.
                       The Laws of Motion.
    In view of the enormous development to which the science
of Dynamics has attained in modern times, of the simplicity
of its fundamental conceptions, and of the unquestioned

474       Mr. R. F. Muirhead on the Laws of Motion.
validity of its processes and results, it may appear somewhat
strange that much difficulty has been found in stating its
principles in a satisfactory form.
   In the preface to the second edition of Tait and Steele's
‘Dynamics of a Particle' we read (referring to the chapter
on the Laws of Motion):—“These five pages, faulty and even
erroneous as I have since seen them to be, cost me almost as
much labour and thought as the utterly disproportionate
remainder of my contributions to the volume; and I cannot
but ascribe this result in part, at least, to the vicious system
of the present day, which ignores Newton's Third Law, &c.”
   And when we read Clerk Maxwell’s notice of the 2nd
edition of Thomson and Tait's treatise in “Nature, * we feel
that the reform introduced by Thomson and Tait, in “return
ing to Newton,” still leaves something to be desired. This
feeling is strengthened when we learn from the late Prof.
Clifford f, that “no mathematician can attach any meaning
to the language about force, mass, inertia, &c. used in current
text-books of Mechanics.”
   It will then be worth while to clear up the logic of the
science, and, if possible, to state the laws of motion in a form
that shall be free from all ambiguity and confusion.
   Let us cast a brief and partial glance over the history of
the development of dynamical first principles.
   Though one region of the science of Dynamics, namely
Statics, was cultivated by the ancients, it was left for Galileo
Galilei to become the pioneer of dynamical science in its full
extent.
   Before Galileo, the idea of force as something measurable
was attained to.     The causes tending to disturb rest were
perceived to have a common kind # effect, so that for the
 purposes of Statics they could be represented by the tension
 of cords produced by suspending from them weights of
 determinate magnitude. Galileo paved the way for the intro
 duction of the kinetic idea of force, i.e. that of the cause of
 the acceleration of the motion of bodies. It is noteworthy,
 however, that he approached the subject from a kinematical
 standpoint. In his “Dialogues, he treats of the science of
 “Local Motion,” not of the science of Force; and in his
 investigations on the motion of Projectiles in that work, his
 aim is to describe the properties of their motion, not to
 speculate on causes.
   Another stage was reached when Newton published the
                    * “Nature, vol. xx. p. 213, ff.
                    * It'i'i'i'

           Mr. R. F. Muirhead on the Laws of Motion.            475
Principia. The Definitions and Axioms therein propounded
include all the principles underlying the modern science of
Dynamics. Subsequent progress has been either in the
direction of mathematical development or application to special
problems, or in attempts to improve the form of statement.
   Let us now inquire whether Newton’s scheme of Definitions
and Axioms is satisfactory.
   We are struck at once by the fact (noticed by many
writers) that the First Law of Motion is previously stated or
implied in the Definition of Inertia. This, however, may be
passed over as a mere awkwardness of arrangement.
   Another defect which has been pointed out by several
writers, is the absence of any definition of equal times, which
renders the expression “uniformiter” in Law I. perfectly
indefinite.
   Of course the law implies that all bodies unacted on by
 force pass through spaces in any interval of time whatever,
which are in the same proportion, so that taking any one such
body as chronometer, the First Law of Newton may be
affirmed of all the rest. We may, however, object to a form
of statement which does not directly state, but implies the
physical fact.
   Again, “uniform rectilinear motion” has no meanin
 unless with reference to some base of measurement.           ''
the Law is not true except with reference to bases of a certain
type. For instance, the “fixed stars describe not straight
lines, but circles, taking the Earth as base of measurement.”
   Newton’s own statement is that the Laws of Motion are to
be understood with reference to absolute position and absolute
time.
   The only explanation given of absolute time, is that in
itself and of its own nature, without reference to anything
else, it flows uniformly.
   In explanation of the expressions “absolute motion” and
“absolute position,” we have the statement that “Absolute
and relative motion and rest are distinguished from one
another by their properties, causes, and effects. It is a property
of rest that bodies truly at rest are at rest among themselves,
but true rest cannot be defined by the relative positions of
bodies we observe. . . . . . . . he causes by which true
and relative motion are distinguished from one another are
the forces impressed on the bodies to produce motion. True
motion cannot change except by forces impressed.
   “The effects by which absolute motion is distinguished
from relative are the centrifugal forces of rotation.          For
                              2 K2

 476       Mr. R. F. Muirhead on the Laws of Motion.
 merely relative rotation these forces are zero; in true rotation
 they exist in greater or less degree.”*
    Thereafter comes the well-known experiment of the rotating
 vessel of water.
    Now the first criterion helps us only in a negative way, by
 enabling us to deny the attribution of true rest to both of
 two systems when they are moving relatively to each other.
    The second criterion involves reasoning in a circle. Force is
 defined as that which produces change of motion; hence to
 define unchanged or uniform motion as that which takes place
 when no force acts does not carry us beyond the previous
definition, and is nugatory.
    The third criterion, taken along with the first, implies a
 physical fact, viz. that when two bodies severally show no
centrifugal force, they have no rotation relative to one
another.
    Consider now Law II. It amounts merely to a definition
 of force, specifying how it is to be measured.
   This has been recognized by several writers. Some, how
 ever, have expanded it into the further assertion that when
two forces act simultaneously on a body, each produces its
own effect independently of the other, in accelerating the body's
motion. But such a statement is entirely nugatory if we
keep by the kinetic definition of force. It is then simply an
identical proposition like “A is A,” as will be seen by sub
stituting in the statement “acceleration of mass” for “force.”
   We now perceive that even the residuum of meaning which
remained after our criticism of Law I. and the statements
regarding Absolute Motion seems to disappear.                 For we
were supposed to recognize a body absolutely at rest by the
absence of centrifugal force. But force is recognizable only
by its accelerative effect, while the acceleration must be
reckoned relative to a body absolutely at rest, which rest,
again, we cannot recognize until we know absolute motions.
# are thus reasoning in a circle.
   Law III. This law at first sight undoubtedly seems to
express an experimental fact. We may therefore be sur
prised to find that Newton deduces one case of it (viz. that of
two mutually attracting bodies) from Law I. (see Scholium
to the Aviomata).
   This seeming paradox arises from the fact that in this
Scholium Newton makes Law I. apply to a body or system
of finite size, and not necessarily without rotation. This
assumes that there is some one point (centre of Inertia)
          * Newton's Principia, Scholium to the Definitiones.

          Mr. R. F. Muirhead on the Laws of Motion.         477
whose motion may be taken to represent that of the system,
which implies that the 3rd Law is true so far as the parts of
such a system are concerned. Now it seems difficult to draw
a valid distinction between such a system and any mass
system whatever; in fact it seems quite as legitimate to
assume that every mass-system has a centre of Inertia.
   But if this assumption were made, then clearly the first
Law could be deduced from the third in all its generality,
and vice versá.
   We see that in this respect again Newton’s arrangement
is defective. We find that the experimental fact is not
stated directly, but implied in the assumption of the existence
of a mass-centre. In fact, strictly read, Newton's Definitions
and Axioms abound in logical circles, nugatory statements,
and illusory definitions; and what real meaning they imply
is not at all explicit.
   The need for the removal of many obscurities which pertain
to the science of Dynamics as set forth in the Principia of
Newton, and in the writings of his successors, has been clearly
perceived by Professor James Thomson. In his paper on the
“Law of Inertia, &c.,” “he propounds the following Law of
Inertia:—
   “For any set of bodies acted on each by any force, a
Reference-Frame and a Reference Dial-traveller are kine
matically possible, such that relatively to them conjointly the
motion of the mass-centre of each body undergoes change
simultaneously with any infinitely short element of the dial
traveller progress, or with any element during which the
force on the body does not alter in direction nor in magnitude,
which change is proportional to the intensity of the force act
ing on that body, and to the simultaneous progress of the
dial-traveller, and is made in the direction of the force.”
   For explanations of the terms used I refer to the paper
itself. At the end of this paper we have the assertion : “The
Law of Inertia here enunciated sets forth all the truth which
is either explicitly stated, or is suggested by the First and
Second Laws in Sir Isaac Newton's arrangement.”
   Professor Thomson’s Law is doubtless, so far as order and
logic are concerned, an immense advance on the Newtonian
arrangement. Let us inquire whether it can be accepted as
absolutely satisfactory.
   How are we to measure the “forces” referred to ?          If
kinematically, then we are again involved in a logical circle,
as may be seen by substituting in the Law, for the words
                   * Proc. R. S. E. 1883–4, p. 568,

478        Mr. R. F. Muirhead on the Laws of Motion.
“force acting on that body” the words “rate of change of
motion of that body,” and for the words “direction of force”
the words “direction of change of motion.” And we cannot
entertain any other measure of force, for reasons which will
be adduced later on.
   Again, Prof. Thomson, by not restricting his statement
to infinitesimal particles, has to assume the existence of
mass-centres.     How is a mass-centre to be defined ?         We
shall give reasons later for rejecting any but a kinetic defini
tion of mass and mass-centre. But it is impossible to arrive
at a kinetic definition when we start by assuming a know
ledge of the measurement of mass in the Fundamental Law
of Motion, as is done by Professor Thomson.
    While noting therefore that Professor Thomson has adopted
the right method of defining chronometry and “true rest,”
we cannot accept his Law as a satisfactory statement of the
fundamental principle of Dynamical science.
    Let us endeavour to frame, after the manner of Professor
Thomson, a statement which shall be satisfactory. Taking
the definitions of dial-traveller and reference-frame, as given
in the paper referred to, let us proceed thus:—
    Let a material system be conceived divided into an infinite
number of particles whose greatest linear dimensions are all
infinitesimal. To each particle let us attribute a certain value
called its provisional-mass. Let us adopt a reference-frame
and dial-traveller. Let the acceleration of any particle multi
 plied into its provisional-mass be called the apparent-force on
the particle. Then it is possible so to choose the provisional
 masses, the dial-traveller, and the reference-frame, so that the
    ovisional-masses and the apparent-forces shall, within the
  imits of error of observation, have relations expressible by
 the laws of physical science, i.e. the law of the Indestructi
 bility of Matter, the law of Equality of Action and Reac
 tion the law of Universal Gravitation, the laws of electric,
 magnetic, elastic, and capillary action, &c., &c. Such a
 system being chosen, the provisional-masses in it are masses
 and the apparent-forces, forces. The dial-traveller indicates
 “absolute time,” and the reference-frame is absolutely without
 rotation or acceleration.
    We have thus kinetic definitions of force, mass, absolute
 time-measurement, and of absolute rest so far as that is possible.
     It is evident kinematically that any other reference-frame
 which has no rotation or acceleration relatively to one chosen
 as above would lead to exactly the same results; and that
 this would not be the case if any reference-frame not fulfilling
 this condition were chosen.

           Mr. R. F. Muirhead on the Laws of Motion.           479
   The above statement includes all in the First and Second
Laws of Newton that can conceivably be tested by experiment or
observation.
   We observe that Newton's Third Law appears classed
along with other laws of physics, and along with that of the
Indestructibility of Matter, which must be assumed as a
preliminary to the ordinary statement of Dynamical Laws
before the measurement of matter has received its definition.
   In our statement of the fundamental principle of Dynamics,
neither of these Laws is assumed, and it could be modified so
as to be equally definite and intelligible were they untrue.
    By dealing with infinitesimal particles, we have avoided
the necessity of assuming a priori the existence of mass
centres; for on the supposition that the angular motion of no
element is infinite (or, more generally, that there is no finite
relative acceleration or velocity between the parts of any
particle), the motion of any point of a particle might be taken
to represent the motion of that particle.
    To define the expression force acting on a body, used in
Dynamics, we would require simply to define the centre of
mass by the usual analytical equations of the type       *=#.
where the summation extends over all the particles of the body,
and then to define the mass of the body by Xm, and the force
 on the body as that acting on its whole mass supposed con
 centrated at its centre of mass.
    What would be the meaning of “a force acting on a body
at a certain point”? This expression is appropriate only to
rigid bodies, or at least to such as retain their shape unaltered
while under consideration. The meaning would be that this
 force, acting on the particle at the point referred to, together
 with the forces between particles determined by the kinema
 tical conditions of rigidity, are the actual forces on the body.
    One objection might be raised to the fundamental Law of
Dynamics, as above stated by us; it seems awkward to imply
3. '. of the           whole of physical science in stating that
fundamental principle.
    This objection leads us to cast aside Prof. James Thomson’s
type of statement, and to adopt another, which states exactly
the same thought in a different form. We shall propound as
preliminary a science of Abstract Dynamics, which ' be a
 pure science to the same extent as Kinematics is a pure science.
    It is as follows :
    In a dynamical system, each particle is credited with a certain
mass, and by coordinates with reference to a system of coordinate
axes its position and motion are determined. When a particle

480       Mr. R. F. Muirhead on the Laws of Motion.
is accelerated, it is said to have a force acting upon it in the
direction of the acceleration and of magnitude proportional to
the acceleration and mass conjointly.
    The system of chronometry is arbitrary, as well as the
system of coordinate axes.
    The expressions, mass of a body, centre of mass of a body,
force on a body, and force acting on a body at a point, are
defined in the same way as before.
    This forms the subject of “Abstract Dynamics,” which deals
only with mental conceptions, and which is a sort of Kine
matics, but Kinematics enriched by the conceptions of force
and mass.
   This being premised, then, in place of Newton’s Definitions
and his First and Second Laws of Motion, we have the
Physical Law or Theory that we can so choose the masses to be
assigned to our material particles, our coordinate awes, and our
system of chronometry, that the forces may be resolved by the
parallelogram of forces into such as are expressed by our
Physical Laws.
   Perhaps we should keep more faithfully to the historical
conception of Dynamics were we to state our Law of Experi
mental Dynamics as follows:–
   It is possible to choose the masses of the solar system, the
aris, and the chronometry, so that the masses shall correspond
with those of Astronomy, and the forces shall be resolvable into
such as will be expressed by the Law of Universal Gravitation,
and conformable to Newton's 3rd Law of Motion and to the
Law of the Indestructibility of Matter (Conservation of Mass).
    Then true time, absolute velocity, and mass-measurement
being defined from this system, there would be the further Law
of Physics, that the forces on the various particles composing
the different members of the solar system and others are expres
sible by our various Physical Laws or Theories.
    We have now arrived at the conclusion that the attempt to
 state the Laws of Motion by means of a set of detached defini
 tions and axioms is futile. We have found that Newton’s
 First Law of Motion cannot be stated until we have the con
 ception of a certain system of reference, whose definition
involves the knowledge of the First Law, as well as the defini
 tion of force, &c. We have therefore seen that the Experi
mental Principle of Dynamics should be stated as an organic
theory or hypothesis. We have found it convenient to
formulate a science of Abstract Dynamics, which is an ex
tended Kinematics, depending only on space and time-measure
ments, but including the ideas of force and mass (abstract).
   By means of this we can state in a succinct form the

           Mr. R. F. Muirhead on the Laws of Motion.                  481
experimental Law or Hypothesis of Dynamics (applied),
which enables us to give to time-measurement such a specifi
cation that durations of time, as well as other dynamical
magnitudes, are made to depend ultimately for their measure
ment solely on space-measurement and observations of coinci
dences in time.
    These conclusions we have arrived at by assuming that only
kinetic specifications for the measurement of force, mass, and
time, and only a kinetic definition of “true rest” are admissible.
    Before attempting to justify these assumptions, it may be
 expedient to devote a few paragraphs to a general considera
tion of the idea of our method. A theory is an attempt to
 dominate our experience; it is a conception which may enable
 us, with as little expenditure of thought as possible, to
 remember the past and forecast the future.
    The theory of Universal Gravitation is an example of a
 very successful attempt, perfectly successful so far as it has
 been tested. So with the Euclidean Geometry.
    On the other hand, we have theories which have been found
 useful to enable us to dominate one region of experience,
 while they break down in certain directions. The Newtonian
 Emission Theory of Light is an example. There are others
 which, if they do not break down absolutely, involve the mind
 in difficulties hitherto unsolved; e. g. the “elastic-solid.”
 Wave Theory of Light.
     Theories which are found to break down when applied to
 their full extent, as well as theories which have not been
 sufficiently tested, are often called “working hypotheses.”
     The only merits or demerits a theory can have arise from
  these two desiderata: (1) it must not be contradicted by any
  part of our experience; (2) it must be as simple as possible".
     Thus, for example, consider the two rival theories: (1)
  that the earth has a certain amount of rotation about its
  axis; (2) that it has no rotation. The latter will be found to
  agree perfectly with our experience, provided we assume as a
  new physical law that there is a repulsive force of magnitude
  o°r away from the Earth’s axis at every point of space, and
                                      #
 also at every point a force 20 d at right angles to the axis
 of the Earth, and to the shortest distance of the point from
    * Since physical theories form an organic whole, of course these quali
 ties must be considered with reference to the body of physical theory as
 a whole. Thus, of two theories, one may, taken by itself, be less simple
 than another, and yet be preferred to it, because, the whole body of
 physical theory becomes simpler when it is adopted. Sometimes, too, a
 theory may be preferred because it seems to promise better for the future.

482        Mr. R. F. Muirhead on the Laws of Motion.
the axis, where o is the angular velocity in the first theory,
and r is the distance of any point from the axis". But we
reject the latter theory on account of its greater complexity.
It is incorrect to say that the one is true and the other false.
   It follows that there is no essential difference between a
hypothesis and a theory, or what is called a law of nature.
One may be less exact than another, or less simple, or less
sufficiently tested, but the difference is one of degree.
   Now there are two opposite methods of stating dynamical
principles; the one employing independent definitions of the
various conceptions, the other that adopted in this Essay.
Both, so far as observation has tested them, correspond equally
to the facts. The question is, then, Which is the simpler?
Which comprehends the various relations with the least
expenditure of mental energy?
   According to the former method, force, mass, time measure
ment, and “true rest” would be defined as preliminaries to
the science of Dynamics, and independently of that science.
According to the latter, these conceptions are defined by
means of one Law or Hypothesis.
   Probably to learners unaccustomed to abstract reasoning,
who do not probe the processes of proof employed to the
bottom, the former method may be preferable because its
conceptions are more concrete; but to one who has mastered
the essential relations of the subject, the latter will be found
superior.
   Let us discuss the idea of force. What are the alternatives
to the kinetic definition of force and force-measurement?
We might take some arbitrary standard, such as a spring
balance having a graduated scale. This would obviously have
the disadvantage of want of permanence, or, to speak more
accurately, that of liability to invalidate all our other methods
of reckoning force, by reason of some physical change occur
ring in the standard balance. Further, such a method would
be incapable of accuracy sufficient for many of our physical
problems, where we deal with forces so small as to be insen
sible to our present observing powers on such a standard;
forces whose magnitude, therefore, we could not define, even
theoretically. And, besides, any such arbitrary definition of
force would be contrary to our whole tendency in modern
science. Suppose, for instance, experiment were to disclose
that Newton's Second Law was untrue, the forces being thus
  * We might either suppose these new forces not conformable to the
law of the equality of Action and Reaction, which would then have to be
modified; or we might suppose the reactions to observed actions to exist
in the fixed stars, and to be beyond our present means of observation.

          Mr. R. F. Muirhead on the Laws of Motion.                    483
measured, should we hesitate between rejecting the law or
rejecting the method of force-measurement? And it is certain
that we cannot find a spring-balance which would render this
event unlikely to happen.
   A more promising method would be the definition of unit
of force as the weight of a certain piece of matter at a certain
place on the Earth’s surface. The force F would then be de
fined as being equal to the weight of a body whose mass was
 F times the standard mass.           This would involve an inde
pendent method of mass-measurement, which we shall con
sider later. In treating questions of the secular changes of
the Earth such a definition would be useless, unless we were
also to specify the date as well as the place of the weighing
 supposed to be at the base of force-measurement; and this
 could not be brought into connexion with measurements at
 any other date without employing the whole science of Dyna
 mics, which would thus involve reasoning in a circle.
    A modification of this method would be one in which force
 measurement would be made to depend on the gravitational
 or astronomical unit of mass, as well as the theory of the
 force of gravitation. But this also would be a system of
 force-measurement, involving for its conception the whole
 science of Dynamics, of which it would not be independent.
     When Statics is treated as a science, independent of Kine
 tics, force is sometimes left undefined at first, while the mode
 of procedure is as follows:—We are supposed to have a
 certain idea of the nature of force, partly based on the sensa
 tions we experience when our body forms one of the two
 bodies which exert force on one another", and starting from
 this, by the aid of a priori reasoning the idea of the measure
 ment of force is evolved. Then, with the help of certain
 physical axioms and constructions (“transmissibility of force,”
  ‘superposition of forces in equilibrium,” &c.), the parallelo
 gram of forces is proved.
    All this has a very artificial character, and would lead us
 to prefer the simpler kinetic conception of force; but still
 further argument is required before we get to Kinetics. The
 “Second Law of Motion” is proved by means of experiments
 which could not be accurately performed, and whose inter
 pretation generally involves a knowledge of the science whose
 foundations we are laying. Then the proportionality of force
 to mass is thus proved:
     Suppose two equal masses acted on by equal and parallel
    * The so-called “sense of force” should be called “sense of stress.”
 Our bodies subjected to forces, however great, if the force on each part is
proportional to its mass and in a common direction, feel nothing.

484         Mr. R. F. Muirhead on the Laws of Motion.
forces; they have the same acceleration. Next, suppose they
form parts of a single body; the acceleration will “evidently”
be the same as before, &c. (Third Law of Motion assumed.)
Hence accelerations being equal, force varies as mass.
    This method has been discredited of late, chiefly through
the influence of Thomson and Tait's ‘Natural Philosophy, so
that we may omit further discussion upon it.
    It may be remarked, however, that those who have most
emphatically declared against the statical measure of force do
not seem to perceive what is logically implied in that course.
(Cf. Professor Tait's Lecture on Force.)
    Consider next the idea of mass.
    The definition based on the weight of bodies is open to the
same objections as the corresponding method in the case of
force.
    If we define mass by reference to chemical affinity", or to
volumetric observations, we in the first place lose the sim
plicity of the kinetic method, and secondly we adopt a con
ception of mass which is different from the actual conception
of modern science.        This is demonstrated if we ask ourselves:
Supposing experiment to show a discrepancy between the
mass as measured kinetically and as measured otherwise,
which method should we call inexact? If the former, Kine
tics could no longer be considered an exact science.
    Consider next the reference system, and the idea of true rest.
The most obvious arbitrary definition of the system to which
the motions of bodies in Dynamics are to be referred is to look
on the centre of gravity of the Solar system as the fixed
point, and the directions of certain fixed stars as fixed direc
tions. The objections are, first, this would be a very incon
venient system in discussing the cosmical Dynamics; second,
 it is not the actual conception of the science of the present day.
 If one of the stars chosen were found to have a motion com
 pared with the average position of neighbouring stars, we
 should certainly conclude that its direction was not “fixed”
 in the dynamical sense.
     It has been suggested to take as a fixed direction that of
 the perpendicular to the “invariable plane of the Solar system.”
 This really is not an independent definition, and is open to
 the objections we previously urged against such, when isolated
 from the fundamental law of Experimental Dynamics.
     The foregoing methods have been well criticised by
 Streintz f, who propounds in their stead a method of re
   * See Maxwell's ‘Matter and Motion, art. xlvi.
    t Die physikalischen Grundlagen der Mechanik. Leipzig, 1883.

ference to a “Fundamental Körper,” which is any body not
acted on by external forces and having no rotation. The
absence of rotation is to be £ by observations of
centrifugal force (as in Newton's experiment of the rotating
bucket of water). Now as Streintz takes the kinetic definition
of force, it involves reasoning in a circle to speak at this stage
of a body “not acted on by forces.” Further, if the observa
tions of centrifugal force are to be made with the whole re
sources of Dynamics, and our knowledge of the laws of nature,
this is virtually the kinetic definition of force, but stated
in a form which involves reasoning in a circle. If, on the
other hand, want of rotation is to be defined as existing when
the surface of a bucket of water does not appear to deviate
from planeness, then our stock objections to such definitions
of dynamical ideas reappear.
   A most instructive discussion relating to this subject is
given by Professor Mach in his book Die Mechanik in ihrer
Entwickelung, historisch-kritisch dargestellt, pp. 214–222. Let
us quote a sentence on p. 218:—
   “Instead of saying ‘the direction and velocity of a mass
p. in space remain constant, we can say “the mean accelera
tion of the mass u with reference to the masses m, m', m" . . .
                        f  //                d” Xmr. o.,
           -                      •
at the distances r, r', r". . . is=0, or dt”      £=0.         The
latter expression is equivalent to the former, so soon as
we take into consideration masses which are great enough,
numerous enough, and distant enough.”
   On the previous page, referring to Newton's bucket ex
periment, he remarks that no one can say how the experiment
would come out were we to increase the mass of the bucket
continually; and, further, that we should be guilty of dis
honesty were we to maintain that we know more of the motion
of bodies than that their motion relative to the very distant
stars appears to follow the same laws as Galileo formulated for
terrestrial bodies relative to the Earth.
   Of course this charge of dishonesty cannot be urged against
the method of this Essay, as explained in our paragraphs on
the nature of theories.    And our definition of “true rest”
being based entirely on experiment and observation, is not
affected by Prof. Mach's strictures on the use of the terms
absolute rest, absolute space, &c.
   Though on the principles of this Essay no exception in
principle can be taken to Prof. Mach's substitute for the
“First Law of Motion above quoted,” we reject it because it
is not the actual conception which has been historically evolved
in Dynamics.

 486       Mr. R. F. Muirhead on the Laws of Motion.
    Lastly, let us consider the conception of time-measurement.
    The only rival definition of equal times that need be con
 sidered is that adopted by Streintz, and ascribed by him to
 D'Alembert and Poisson, viz. “Times are equal in which
 identical processes take place.” The difficulty here would be
 to distinguish when we have identical processes going on.
 We find that practically this will reduce to assuming each
 rotation of the Earth with reference to the fixed stars a pro
 cess identical with all the others. For the “processes” must
 consist in movements of matter, of which the Earth's rotations
 are the most “identical” we have experience of.
    But even these we know are not absolutely identical, so
 that our definition is not practicable. With this definition,
 what should we mean by saying that the rotation period of
 the Earth is altering? W. should mean that if identical pro
 cesses happened at different dates, their durations measured by
 sidereal time would differ. But the only identical processes
 actually available are wrapped up in the general dynamical
 theory of the Solar system; so that this theoretically inde
 pendent definition of time turns out to involve all our Dynamics
 implicitly when we try to give it physical meaning.
     n seeking to justify our preference of kinetic definitions
over non-kinetic definitions of our fundamental dynamical
 conceptions, we have found that the latter, besides being
theoretically inconvenient, very often have only an illusory
independence of Dynamics.                      *
    In fact no one has ever built up a science of Dynamics
from independently formed conceptions; and to do so in a
strictly logical manner would require expositions whose length
would render them tedious in the extreme.
    We have hitherto made no reference to any scheme of
dynamical principles apart from that of Newton, and those
various modifications of it proposed by later writers. This
course has been adopted in order to concentrate attention upon
the principle at issue.
    Systems of Dynamics founded on such principles as Mau
  ertius's “Principle of Least Action,” or ' “Principle
of Least Coercion” (Kleinsten Zwanges), may be treated from
exactly the same point of view, and will not be further re
ferred to.
               NoTE A.—On Theories and Hypotheses.
   In the preceding Essay we have assumed as known the science of
Geometry; but of course the views put forward in this Essay con
cerning the nature of physical theories apply equally to geometri

            Mr. R. F. Muirhead on the Laws of Motion.              487
cal theories. This is the standpoint adopted by Riemann in his
epoch-making paper, “Ueber die Hypothesen welche der Geometrie
zu Grunde liegen.” That space is infinite and that one and only
one parallel to a straight line can be drawn through any point, are,
it is true, the simplest hypotheses which serve to express our ex
perience; but, as Helmholtz points out in his tract Ueber die
Erhaltung der Kraft, at page 7, the task of theoretical science is
only completed when we have proved that our theories are the
only ones by which the phenomena can be explained. “Dann
 wäre dieselbe als die nothwendige Begriffsform der Naturauffas
 sung erwiesen; es wiirde derselben alsdann also auch objective
 Wahrheit zuzuschreiben sein.”
    In his critique of the second edition of Thomson and Tait's
 treatise on Natural Philosophy (“Nature, vol. xx. p. 213), Clerk
 Maxwell clearly indicates the hypothetical nature of abstract Dy
 namics. On p. 214 we read:—“Why, then, should we have any
 change of £i when we pass on from Kinematics to abstract
 Dynamics? Why should we find it more difficult to endow moving
 figures with mass than to endow stationary figures with motion?
 The bodies we deal with in abstract Rynamics are just as completely
 known to us as the figures in Euclid. They have no properties
 whatever, except those which we explicitly assign to them . . . . . .
 We have thus vindicated for figures with mass, and, therefore, for
 force and stress, impulse and momentum, work and energy, their
 place in abstract science beside form and motion.”
     “The phenomena of real bodies are found to correspond so
 exactly with the necessary laws of dynamical systems that we can
 not help applying the language of Dynamics to real bodies,” &c.
     It will be seen that, so far as they go, the above extracts are in
  complete harmony with the views in this Essay. It is to be re
 gretted that these views are not consistently followed out in Clerk
  Maxwell’s book “Matter and Motion. In that book, while there are
  very many clear expositions of particular points, the arrangement is
  in many parts highly illogical. This has been pointed out to a
  certain extent by Streintz in his aforementioned book, and the
  reader of the foregoing Essay will have little difficulty in making
  further criticisms.
     One point in Maxwell's book (‘Matter and Motion’) calls for
  special notice, viz., his a priori proof of the first law of Motion.
  This proof rests on the assumption of the impossibility of defining
  absolute rest. “Hence,” he says, “the hypothetical law is with
  out meaning unless we admit the possibility of defining absolute
  rest and absolute velocity.” But it is obvious that if the “hypo
  thetical law” spoken of (velocity diminishing at a certain rate)
  corresponded with experience, we should then have, by that very
  fact, a conception of absolute rest and absolute velocity which
  would be perfectly intelligible, so that the assumption “absolute
  rest unintelligible” would not be justified. Thus, Maxwell's con
  clusion, “It may thus be shown that the denial of Newton's law is
  in contradiction to the only system of consistent doctrine about

 488        Mr. R. F. Muirhead on the Laws of Motion.
 space and time which the mind has been able to form” is unwar
 ranted.
    Kirchhoff in his Mechanik appears to adopt a view somewhat
 similar to that set forth in this Essay. In his preface we find him
 stating as the problem of Mechanik, “die in der Natur vor sich
 gehenden Bewegungen vollständig und zwar auf die einfachste
 Weise zu beschreiben.”
    This author uses the term force only as a convenient means of
 expressing equations shortly in words. Mass appears as a coeffi
 cient in the equations of motion, and thus receives a kinetic defi
 nition. But no explanations are given as to time-measurement, or
 as to the axes of reference.
             NoTE B.—Newton's Absolute Space and Time.
   My criticisms of the Newtonian scheme of Definitions and Axioms
 have been directed not so much against what I suppose to be
Newton's meaning, as against the form in which it is put, especially
as against that form on the supposition that force is to be measured
kinetically.
   Thus, instead of looking on the Second Law as a mere definition
of force-measurement, we might suppose that Newton had in his
mind some non-kinetic conception of force-measurement; in which
case the Second Law would be a real and not an illusory statement
of physical fact, though imperfect through the want of any speci
fication of how force was to be measured.
   Again, take the question of absolute space and time, with respect
to which Newton’s laws are stated.
   There are three ways of looking at it. Some characterize these
terms as mere metaphysical nonsense (Mach, p. 209). Streintz”
quotes the Hypothesis I. from the third Book of Newton's Prin
cipia to show that by absolute rest Newton means rest relative to
the centre of gravity of the universe. But Newton evidently places
this Hypothesis in a different category from his laws of motion.
   I think the meaning of the terms amounts simply to this, that
Newton looked on Dynamics as an abstract science. “In rebus
philosophicis abstrahendum est a sensibus”f, “loca primaria moveri
absurdum est” +.       And an abstract science is one which deals
with a certain body of conceptions, every relation in which holds
with absolute exactness. The point at which considerations as to
degree of exactitude may arise, is its application to experience.
   If this be the correct view of Newton's meaning, then the fore
going Essay has been simply the explicit and developed statement of
that meaning.
   Thomson and Tait, while in various ways improving the form in
which they state the Newtonian theory, entirely ignore his idea of
“absolute space and time,” which, as I have tried to show, is the
germ of the true theory.

   Production, Properties, and Uses of the Finest Threads. 489
     The late C. Neumann, in his pamphlet Ueber die Principien der
  Galilei-Newtonschen Theorie (Leipzig, 1870), like Newton, postu
  lates an “absolute rest.” He does so by assuming that there is a
  “Körper Alpha,” an ideally existing body which is absolutely at
 rest and absolutely rigid, with respect to which the First Law of
 Newton holds good.
     Streintz criticises this rather unintelligently, I think, for it is
 evident in reading Neumann's essay that this is merely an awk
 ward and metaphorical way of stating the theory of an “Abstract
 Dynamics.”
                 NOTE C.—The Parallelogram of Force.
     Force being defined kinetically, it is hardly necessary to demon
 strate this proposition. It follows as easily from the parallelogram
 of accelerations as that does from the parallelogram of velocities, or
 the parallelogram of velocities from the parallelogram of steps.
    This  '       primarily to forces acting on a particle, but it is easy
 to extend the theorem to “forces acting on a body,” as defined in
 the Essay.
 LVII. On the Production, Properties, and some suggested Uses
     of the Finest Threads. By C. W. Boys, Demonstrator of
     Physics at the Science Schools, South Kensington".
 I    HAVE lately required for a variety of reasons to have
        fibres of glass or other material far finer than ordinary
 spun glass; I have therefore been compelled to devise means
 for producing with certainty the finest possible threads. As
 these methods may have some interest, and as some results
 already obtained are certainly of great importance, I have
 thought it desirable to bring this subject under the notice of
 the Physical Society, even though at the present time any
 account must of necessity be very incomplete.
    The subject may be naturally divided, as in the title, into
 three parts.              -
                             1. Production.
    The results of the natural methods of producing fibres by
 living things, as spiders, caterpillars, and some other creatures,
are well known ; but it is useless to attempt to improve on
Nature in this direction by our own "'.
    Fibres are also produced naturally in volcanoes by the
rushing of steam or compressed gases past melted lava, which
is carried off and drawn out into the well-known Pelés hair.
The same procèss is employed in making wool from slag, for

490        Mr. C. W. Boys on the Production, Properties,
clothing boilers, &c.; but in each of these cases the fibres are
matted together, they are not adapted to the requirements of a
 Physical Laboratory. By drawing out glass softened by heat
 by a wheel we obtain the well-known spun glass.
    There is a process by which threads may # made which is
natural in that natural forces only are employed, and the thread
is not in any way touched during its production. This is the
 old, but now apparently little-known experiment of electrical
 spinning. If a small dish be insulated and connected with an
 electrical machine and filled with melted rosin, beeswax, pitch,
 shellac, sealing-wax, Canada balsam, guttapercha, burnt india
 rubber, collodion, or any other viscous material, the contents
 will, if they reach one edge of the dish, at once be shot out in
 the most extraordinary way in one, two, or it may be a dozen
 threads of extreme tenuity, travelling at a high speed alon
 “lines of force.” If the material is very              #      the  #
 cylinders shot out are unstable and break into beads, which
 rattle like hail on a sheet of paper a few feet off. As the
 material cools, the beads each begin to carry long slender
tails, and at last these tails unite the beads in twos and threes;
 but the distance between the beads is far greater than that
 due to the natural breaking of a cylinder into spheres, as
after the first deformation of the surface occurs which deter
 mines the ultimate spheres the repulsive force along the thread
 continues, and drags them apart many times their natural
 distance. As the temperature continues to fall and the
 material to become more viscid, the beads become less
 spherical, and the tails less slender, and at last a perfectly
uniform cylindrical thread is formed. If sealing-wax is
 employed, and a sheet of paper laid for it to fall on, the paper
 becomes suffused in time with a delicate rosy shade produced
 by innumerable fibres separately almost invisible. On placin
 the fingers on the paper, the web adheres and can be raise
in a sheet as delicate and intricate as any spider's-web.
    It is interesting to see how these fibres fly to any conduct
ing body placed in their path. If the hand is held there it is
 quickly surrounded by a halo of the finest threads.                If a
 lighted candle is placed in the way, the fibres are seen by the
light of the candle to be rushing with the greatest velocity
towards it, but when a few inches off they are discharged by
the flame, they stop, turn round, and rush back as fast into
the saucer whence they came. The conditions for the success
of this beautiful experiment are not very easily obtained".
    Fibes spun by the electrical method are so brittle that they

machine, the threads at one stage are sure to return to the saucer.

do not seem to be of any practical use. It is possible, how
ever, that this method might be available for reducing to a
fine state of division such of the rosins or other easily fusible
bodies as cannot readily be powdered mechanically.
   On returning to bodies which, like glass, require a high
temperature for their fusion, to which the electrical method is
inapplicable, we find that the only method practically available
is that of drawing mechanically. It would seem that if finer
threads than can be formed by the ordinary process of glass
spinning were required, it would be necessary to obtain a
higher speed, to have the glass hotter, and to have as small a
quantity as possible hot.     £    this idea to a test by mounting
at the back of a blowpipe-table a pair of sticks which could be
 suddenly moved apart by a violent pull applied to each near
their axes. By these means the upper ends were separated
about 6 feet, and the motion was so rapid that it was impos
sible to follow it. A piece of glass drawn out fine was
fastened to the end of each stick, and the ends of these heated
by a minute blowpipe-flame. They were immediately made to
touch and allowed to fly apart. In this way I obtained threads
of glass about 6 feet long, finer than any spun glass I have
 examined. By using the oxyhydrogen jet with the same
 apparatus, still finer threads were produced. It was evident
 then that the method was right; but some more convenient
 device which also would make long threads would be prefer
able.
    There are several ways of obtaining a high speed, the most
 usual depending on an explosive; but it would be difficult to
 arrange in a short time a gun which could be used to shoot
 a projectile carrying the thread which would not also destroy
 the thread by the flash. It is possible that an air-gun could be
 so arranged. Rockets when at the period of most rapid com
 bustion have an acceleration which is enormous.       Thus a well
 made 2-oz. rocket is at one part of its flight subject to a
 force of over 3 lb. in gravitative measure. This force, acting
 on such a body for 10 seconds only, would, neglecting atmo
 spheric resistance, starting from rest, carry it more than 6 miles.
 The acceleration is about 28 times that due to gravity on the
 earth, or about the same as that on the sun. Anyone who
 will stay in a room with a lighted two-ounce rocket, having
 no stick or head, will obtain a more vivid notion of the value
 of gravity on the sun than in any other way I know.
    # rocket is perhaps more available for thread-drawing than
 a gun, but it does not seem altogether convenient. One
 other method, however, is so good in every respect, that there
 seems no occasion to try a      £r.       The bow and arrow at
                               2 L2

492       Mr. C. W. Boys on the Production, Properties,
 once supply a ready means of instantly producing a very high
 velocity, which the arrow maintains over a considerable dis
tance. For the special purpose under consideration, the
lightest possible arrow is heavy enough. I have made arrows
 of pieces of straw, which may be obtained from wool-shops,
 a few inches long, having a needle fastened to one end for
a point. Arrows made in this way travelled the length of
the two rooms in which I made these experiments—about
90 feet—in what seemed to be under half a second.        The
completely pierced a sheet of card at that distance, which
  ut up thinking that a yielding target might damage them
£ than the wall, and were then firmly stuck unharmed in the
wall behind; in £ way they behaved so well that I do
not think a better make of arrow possible.
    The bow I used was a small cross-bow held in a vice
with a trigger that could be pulled with the foot. The first
bow was made of oak, the first wood that came to hand. I
then made some bows of what was called lance-wood (it was
unlike any lance-wood I have seen); but the trajectory was
at once more curved, the arrow took perceptibly longer to
travel, and the threads produced were thicker. As the arrow
is so light, the only work practically that the bow has to do
is to move itself; that wood then which has the highest
elasticity '# the fibres for its mass     is most suitable; in
other words, that wood which has the greatest velocity of
sound is best. I therefore made bows of pine, and obtained
still higher velocities and finer threads than I could obtain
with oak bows.
   With a pine bow and an arrow of straw I have obtained a
glass thread 90 feet long and Tocgo inch in diameter, so
uniform that the diameter at one end was only one sixth more
than that at the other. Pieces yards long seemed perfectly
uniform.
   A fragment of drawn-out     #: was attached to   the tail of
the arrow by sealing-wax, and heated to the highest possible
temperature in the middle, the end heing held in the fingers.
With every successful shot the thread was continuous from
the piece held in the hand to the arrow 90 feet off. The
manipulation is, however, difficult, but another plan equally
successful has the advantage of being quite easy. It is not
necessary to hold the tail of glass at all; if the end of the
tail only be heated with the oxyhydrogen jet until a bead
about the size of a pin's head is formed, and the arrow shot,
this bead will remain behind on account of its inertia, and
the arrow go on, and between them will be pulled out the
thread of glass.

          and some suggested Uses of the Finest Threads.          493
    Prof. Judd has kindly given me a variety of minerals
which I have treated in this manner. Some behave like glass
and draw readily into threads, some will not draw until below
a certain temperature, and others will not draw at all, being
# 3I'Ol.
         perfectly fluid like water, or when a little cooler perfectly
    Among those that will not draw at all may be mentioned
Sapphire, Ruby, Hornblende, Zircon, Rutile, Kyanite, and
Fluorspar.
    Emerald and Almandine will draw, but care is required to
obtain the proper temperature. In the case of the Garnet
Almandine, if the temperature is too high, the liquid cylinder,
if formed, breaks up, and a series of      £        fall on the table
in front of the bow. At a slightly lower temperature the
thread is formed, but it is beaded at nearly regular intervals
for part of its length.
     Several minerals, especially complex silicates as Orthoclase,
 draw very readily, but that which surpasses all that I have
 tried at present is Quartz, which, though troublesome in many
 ways at first, produces threads with certainty. It required
 far more force to draw quartz threads than had been previously
experienced. The arrow, instead of continuing its flight,
 hardly disturbed by the drag of the thread, invariably fell very
 low, and was not in general able to travel the whole distance.
 So great is the force required that I split many arrows before
 I succeeded at all. I have obtained threads of quartz which
 are so fine that I believe them to be beyond the power of any
 possible microscope. Mr. Howes has lent me a 's-in. Zeiss of
 excellent definition, and though, on looking at suitable objects,
 definite images appear to be formed on which are marks
 corresponding according to the eyepiece-micrometer to Too!ooo
 inch, yet these threads are hopelessly beyond the power of the
 instrument to define at all. On taking one that tapers rapidly
 from a size which is easily visible, the image may be traced
 until it occupies a small fraction of one division, of which 13.4
 correspond to Toloo inch on the stage; then the diffraction
 bands begin to overlap the image until it is impossible to say
 what is the edge of the image. Having reached this stage,
 the thread may be traced on and on round the most marvellous
 convolutions, the diffraction-fringe now alone appearing at all,
 but     £               and apparently narrower until the end is
 reached. That a real thing is being looked at is evident, for
 if the visible end is drawn away the convolutions of fringes
 travel away in the same direction. It is impossible to say
  what is the diameter of these threads; they seem to be certainly
  less than Toogoo inch for some distance from the end.

 494       Mr. C. W. Boys on the Production, Properties,
     It might be possible to calculate what would be the appear
  ance presented by a cylinder of given refractive power, and
  1, 2, 3, &c. tenths of a wave-length of any kind of light
  in diameter, when seen with a particular microscope. By no
  other means does it seem possible to find out what the true
 size of the ends of these threads really is.
                           2. Properties.
     I can at present say very little of the properties of these
 very fine fibres; I am now engaged with Mr. Gregory and
 Mr. Gilbert in investigating their elasticity. The        £
 goes on increasing as they become finer, that is, when due
 allowance is made for their reduced sectional area, and it
 seems to reach that of steel, about 50 tons to the inch in
 ordinary language; but on this point I have not yet made
any careful experiments.
    The most obvious property of these fibres is the production
 of all the colours of the spider-line when seen in a brilliant
 light. The most magnificent effect of this sort I have seen,
was produced by a thread of almandine. One of these the
length of the room, even though illuminated with gas-light
only, was glistening with every colour of the rainbow. In
attempting, however, to wind it up, it vanished before me.
It is of course only visible in certain directions.
    The chief value of threads to the physicist lies in their
torsion. Spun glass, as is now well known, cannot be used
for instruments of precision, because its elastic fatigue is so
great that, after deflection, it does not come back to the original
position of rest, but acquires a new position which perpetually
changes with every deflection. If left alone, this position
slowly works back towards a definite place more rapidly as it
is further from it.
    To compare threads made of different materials, I made a
flat cell in which a galvanometer-mirror, made by Elliot Bros.,
might hang, being attached to the lower end of the thread.
The upper end was secured to a fixed support, and a fixed tube
protected the length of the fibre from draught. The cell,
which could be moved independently of the rest, was protected
by a cover. By means of a lamp and scale, the exact position
of rest of the mirror could be determined with great accuracy.
On turning the cell round as many times as might be desired,
the mirror was turned with it, and could be left any time in any
position. On turning the cell back again, the mirror was
allowed to come to its new position of rest, air-resistance of
the cell bringing about this result in a few swings. By this
means I hoped quickly and accurately to determine the fatigue

          and some suggested Uses of the Finest Threads.        495
  in a variety of threads, but an unforeseen difficulty arose which
  I cannot yet explain. When the cell was moved round slightly
  so as not to touch the mirror, the mirror moved at first in the
  same direction as was to be expected, but it came to rest in a
  new position, to reach which it had to move in the opposite
  direction to the movement of the cell. Whichever way the
  cell was shifted, the mirror always went the other to find its
  ' of rest.          Thinking that it or the cell were electrified,
     damped both by breathing on them, but with no result, and
  the next day the same effect was observable. So great was this
  effect that I could set the cell with greater accuracy by
  watching the spot of light than by the pointer carried by the
  cell working over a 4-inch circle.
      Thinking that magnetism might have something to do with
  this effect, I brought a horseshoe-magnet near the mirror,
   when it was instantly deflected through a large angle. An
   examination of the cement used (Loudon’s bicycle cement)
   showed that it was magnetic. Of many cements examined,
   sealing-wax was more nearly neutral than any other. Bicycle
   cement and electrical cement were strongly magnetic; all
   others except sealing-wax strongly diamagnetic. The appa
   ratus was therefore taken to pieces and carefully cleaned. It
   was put   £         with as small a quantity of sealing-wax as
   possible, and the mirror was attached to a fragment of thin
   pure copper wire, which again was fastened by a speck of
   sealing-wax to the thread. Even then the same kind of
   effect as that already described occurred. Still a magnet
   deflected the mirror, but not so much, and the cell was
   practically neutral; yet, when the cell was turned a little,
   the mirror changed its position of rest.
      Without pursuing this question further, I put a window in
   the protecting tube and turned the mirror by means of a
   small instrument passed up from below. Thus neither window
   nor support were moved. A piece of spun glass nearly 9
   inches long gave a period of oscillation to the mirror of 2:3
*  seconds about. A lamp and millimetre-scale were placed 50
   inches from     the mirror.    As all the observations were
   expressed in tenths of a millim., to about which extent they
   can be trusted, it is convenient to employ one scale of numbers
   of which one tenth millim. is the unit. One complete turn of
   the mirror is very nearly 160,000 on this scale. If the mirror
   is moved through 160,000 in either direction and held for one
   minute, and then allowed to take its new position, the change
   in the position of rest is as soon as it can be read about 370.
   This is reduced in about three minutes to 110. If the mirror is
   moved through three turns, 480,000 of the scale, and held one

496        Mr. C. W. Boys on the Production, Properties,
 minute, the position of rest is at first moved about 1100, which
 falls in three minutes to about 400. I have given these figures,
 not because the effect is not perfectly well known, but to serve
 as comparison figures to those that are to follow. They can
 only be properly represented on a time-diagram.
    A piece of the same fibre that was used in the last experi
ment was laid in a box of charcoal and heated in a furnace
to a dull red heat and allowed to cool slowly. This was
examined in the same way as the last. The effect of a
 movement of 160,000 for one minute was now only about 60,
 which was reduced to about 45 in three minutes. The change
 for 480,000 lasting one minute was at first about 250, which
fell to about 180 in three minutes.
    Annealed spun glass then shows far less of this effect than
 spun glass not annealed, but it is slower in recovering. It is
 possible that if time were given, it would show as great an
effect as plain glass. The only mineral from w: at the
 present time I have obtained any valuable results in this
direction, is quartz. Here the effect of the usual minute at
 160,000 was only 7, in the place of 370 for glass, at 320,000
only 17, and 640,000 only 32, which in four minutes fell to
 22. This fibre was as usual fastened at each end by sealing
wax. When this experiment was made, the thread had only
just been fastened. The same fibre treated previously in the
same way, but some days after fastening, did not even show
this effect; but as this was before I had completed the
proper cell, the observations cannot so well be trusted. After
a complete turn, there was not a movement of one tenth of a
millim., nor had the position changed this much in 16 hours.
 It is as yet too soon to be sure, but this seems to point to the
possibility of the very slight effect observed being largely due
to the sealing-wax. Whether this is so or not does not much
matter, the behaviour of the quartz thread approaches suffi
ciently near to that of an ideal thread, to make it of the
utmost value as a torsion-thread. I hope shortly to be able to
bring results of carefully conducted experiments on the
elastic fatigue of quartz and other fibres before the notice of
this Society.
    A thread of annealed quartz behaves like a thread of quartz
not annealed. That it was affected by the process of annealin
is evident, because in the first place it was very rotten an
difficult to handle, and in the second a piece of quartz fibre,
which was wound up, retained its form. By this test, quartz
can only be partly annealed in a copper box, as any form is not
retained perfectly; at a temperature above that of melting
copper, quartz seems to perfectly retain any form given to it.

          and some suggested Uses of the Finest Threads.       497
    It is probable that a body hung by a fibre of quartz and
vibrating in a perfect vacuum would remain twisting back
wards and forwards for a far longer time than a similar body
hung by a glass thread, also that the most perfect balance
spring for a watch would be one of quartz. I' a piece of
quartz drawn out to a narrow neck which just cannot hold up
its head; this keeps on nodding in all directions for so long a
time, even in the air, as to make it evident that the material
has very unusual properties.
                              3. Uses.
    As torsion-threads these fibres of quartz would seem to be
more perfect in their elasticity than any known; they are as
strong as steel, and can be made of any reasonable length
 perfectly uniform in diameter, and, as already explained,
exceedingly fine. The tail ends of those that become invisible
 must have a moment of torsion 100 million times less than
 ordinary spun glass; and though it is impossible to manipulate
 with those, there is no difficulty with threads less than Toboo
inch in diameter.
     I have made a spiral spring of glass of about 30 turns
 which weighs about one milligram; this, examined by a
 microscope, would show a change in weight of a thing hung
 by it of one 10 millionth of a gram. Since this has been
 annealed its elastic fatigue is that of annealed glass, and
 therefore very small. I have succeeded in doing the same
 thing with a quartz fibre, but the difficulties of manipulation
 are very great in consequence of the rottenness of annealed
 quartz. The glass spring can be pulled out straight, and
 returns perfectly to its proper form.
     Since these fibres can be made finer than any cobweb, it is
 possible that they may be preferable to spider-lines in eye
 pieces of instruments; they would in any case be permanent,
 and not droop in certain kinds of weather.
     Those who have experienced the trouble which the shifting
 zero of a thermometer gives, might hope for a thermometer
 made of quartz. When made, it would probably be more
 perfect in this respect than a glass thermometer, but the
  operation of making would be difficult.
     These very fine fibres are convenient for supporting small
  things of which the specific gravity is required, for they weigh
  nothing, and the line of contact with the surface of the water
  is so small, that they interfere but little with the proper swing
  of the balance.
     It seemed possible that a diffraction-grating made of fibres
  side by side in contact with one another would produce

498 Production, Properties, and Uses of the Finest Threads.
spectra which would be brighter than those given by a
corresponding grating of ordinary construction, £ not
only is all the light which falls on the surface brought to a
series of linear foci forming the bright lines instead of being
half removed, as is usually the case, but the direction of the light
on reaching these lines is not normal to the grating as usual,
and therefore in the direction of the central image, but
spreading, and thus in the direction of all the spectra. I
picked out a quantity of glass fibre not varying in diameter
more than one per cent, and made a grating in this way
covering about one eighth of an inch in breadth. This not
only showed three     £       on each side, and a quantity of
scattered light, but all the spectra were closely intersected by
interference-bands, such as are seen when a Newton's ring of
a high order is seen in a spectroscope. This is probably due to
a cumulative error in the position of the fibres, for they
were spaced by being pushed up to one another with a
needle-point, or to light passing between the fibres in a few
places where dust particles keep them apart.
   A diffraction-grating made of these fibres, spaced with a
screw to secure uniformity, and of a thickness equal to the
spaces between them (and one of 1000 lines to the inch could
be easily made) would be far more perfect for the number of
lines than any scratched on a surface; that is, for investigation
on the heat of a spectrum, such a grating would be preferable
to a scratched one, as there is no uncertainty as to the grating
or to the substance of which it is made *. If the transparency
of the fibres interfered they could be rendered opaque by
metallic deposit without visibly increasing their diameter.
   There is one use to which the fibres of quartz tailing-off to
a mere nothing might be applied, namely as a test-object for
a microscope. Theory shows that no microscope can truly
show any structure much less than Tow'oon inch, or divide two
 lines much less than this distance apart. Natural bodies such
as Diatoms &c. have this advantage, that they can be ob
tained in any quantity alike, but no one knows what the real
structure of these may be. Nobert's bands are good in that
 we know the number of lines in any band, but as to the indi
vidual appearance of the lines and spaces it is impossible to
 say anything. These fibres have the advantage that we have
a single thing of known form, which tapers down from a
definite size to something too small even to be seen. Though
it may be possible to calculate the size from the appearance
of the fringes, yet whether the size is known or not, at each

point we have a definite thing of known form which can be
examined by a series of microscopes, and the point up to
which it can be clearly seen observed for each.
   I have thought it worth while to bring this subject forward
in this very incomplete form, because there are already
results of interest and there is so much prospect of more, that
it is likely that Members may be glad to investigate some of
the questions raised.
LVIII. On the Electrical Resistance of Verticall ::pended
         Wires. By SHELFORD BIDwELL, M.A., F.R.S.
     ROM the experiments to be described in this paper, it
        appears probable that the electrical resistance of verti
cally-suspended copper and iron wires alters to a small extent
 with the direction of the current traversing them. If the wire
is of copper, the resistance is slightly greater when the cur
rent goes upwards than when it goes downwards; while, on
the other hand, the resistance of an iron wire is apparently
greater for downward than for upward currentst.
                                         P
    The arrangement employed for exhibiting this effect is
 shown in the annexed diagram. A wire, A B, of the material
   * Communicated by the Physical Society: read March 12, 1887.
   t Venturing to imitate the fanciful analogy used by Sir William
 Thomson, who, in discussing the thermoelectric effect now universally
 associated with his name, speaks of the “specific heat” of electricity, we
 may perhaps also speak of the “specific gravity” of electricity, and say
 that (like its specific heat) it is positive in copper and negative in iron.

500         Mr. S. Bidwell on the Electrical Resistance
to be tested is suspended at its middle point, P, from a  ''
10.5 metres above a metre-bridge, to the terminals, TT", of
which the ends of the wire are connected. Another wire, C,
is soldered at one end to P, and connected through the gal
vanometer, G, with the slider, S. A resistance of 100 ohms
is inserted in each of the gaps, R R', and a commutator, K, is
interposed between the two-cell battery, D, and the bridge.
    With this arrangement, supposing that the two halves of
the wire A B are of uniform sectional area and in the same
physical condition, and that the various parts of the apparatus
are in fair order and adjustment, there will be a balance when
the slider is near the middle division of the scale.       And if
the resistances in the circuit are independent of the direction
of the current, it is clear that the balance will be maintained
notwithstanding that the commutator K be reversed. But
this is found not to be the case.
    A series of experiments was made with a copper wire
 .4 millim. in diameter (No. 28 B.W.G.), and having a total
 resistance of 2:11 ohms.       The commutator was first set so
 that the current through the wire passed up the portion B
 and down the portion A (i. e. in the direction B PA), and a
 balance was obtained by adjusting the slider. The commu
 tator was then reversed and the current made to pass up A
 and down B. This at once destroyed the balance, and in
 order to restore it, it was necessary to move the slider several
 divisions towards the right. Assuming that the total resist
 ance of the wire remains constant, this result may be explained
 by supposing that the reversal of the current is accompanied
 by increased resistance in the portion A, and diminished re
 sistance in the portion B. Owing to its vertical suspension,
 the resistance of that portion of the wire in which the current
 travels upwards is greater than it would be if the wire were
 placed in a horizontal position, while the resistance of the
 portion in which the current travels downwards is less.
     The experiment was repeated with an iron wire of larger.
  size, its diameter being 8 millim. (No. 22 B.W.G.).           ith
  this the effect of reversal was smaller; but it was well marked,
  and of the opposite nature to that observed in the former case.
     The readings obtained in the two series of experiments are
  given in the following Table —

   I believe these effects are associated with certain thermo
electric phenomena discovered by Sir William Thomson. In
his famous Bakerian lecture, published in the Philosophical
Transactions for 1856, he showed that if a stretched copper
wire is connected with an unstretched wire of the same metal
and the junction heated, a thermoelectric current will flow
from the stretched to the unstretched wire through the hot
junction; while, if the wires are of iron, the direction of the
current will be from unstretched to stretched. It follows,
therefore, from the laws of the Peltier effect, that if a battery
current is caused to flow from a stretched to an unstretched
wire, heat will be absorbed at the junction when the metal is
copper, and will be developed at the junction when the metal
is iron : and if the direction of the current is reversed the
thermal effects will also be reversed.
   Now a vertically suspended wire is unequally stretched by
its own weight, the stress gradually increasing from zero at
the lowest point to a maximum at the highest. Any small
element of the wire is more stretched than a similar element
immediately below it, and less stretched than a neighbouring

502         Mr. S. Bidwell on the Electrical Resistance
element just above it. Thus a current of           £             in pass
ing from the lowest to the highest point of such a wire,
is always flowing from relatively unstretched to relatively
stretched portions. If, then, the wire were of copper, heat
would be evolved throughout its whole length; the tempera
ture of the wire would rise, and its resistance would conse
quently be increased. With a current flowing from top to
bottom, the temperature of the wire would fall and its resist
ance diminish.       So also an iron wire would be cooled and
and have its resistance lowered by an upward current, while
a downward current would heat it and increase its resistance.
The changes of resistance are thus, as I believe, proximately
due to changes of temperature.
    The resistance of the bridge-wire used in my experiments
was 244 ohm, and, as already mentioned, an additional resist
ance of 100 ohms was placed in each of the gaps adjoining
the bridge-wire. Denoting the resistance of the half A of
the suspended wire by a, and that of B by b, we have, from
the first experiment with the copper wire (the result of which
agrees closely with the mean):—

                   1-0553372–1055.1792 ohm
                   = .000158 ohm.
This is equivalent to about 16 thousandths per cent.
  Assuming that a change of temperature of 1° C. produces
an alteration of 4 per cent. in the resistance, it follows that
the temperature of the copper wire was #5 degree C. higher
with an upward than with a downward current.
   The current traversing the wire was not measured, but it
was probably about 1 ampere.
   It will be seen from the figures in the Table that the
changes which occurred in the resistance of the iron wire
were considerably smaller than those observed in the case of
copper. This was unexpected, since the thermoelectric effects
are, I believe, somewhat greater with iron. But the apparent
anomaly is obviously to be accounted for, at least in part, by
the higher specific resistance of iron. With the same electro
motive force the current per unit of sectional area would be
six or seven times greater in copper than in iron, and the
Peltier effect is proportional to the current. To render the
results in the two cases strictly comparable, other less impor
tant differences, such as those of specific heat and radiating
power, would have to be taken into account.
   If a convenient opportunity offered it would be satisfactory
to repeat the experiments with much longer wires, such as
might be suspended in the shaft of a coal-pit or in a shot
tower. The effects hitherto observed are so small that they
might possibly be due to accidental causes, and I publish this
account of them with some diffidence.

         LIX. The Evolution of the Doctrine of Affinity.
           By Professor LoTHAR MEYER, of Tübingen".
 IT may not be amiss, on the issue          of a Journal f specially
       devoted to the theoretical and physical aspects of
 Chemistry, to take a rapid survey of the development of the
doctrine of chemical affinity, a correct knowledge of which is,
and must ever remain, the most important object of the theory
 of our science.
    The former doctrines of affinity, conceived without know
ledge of the laws of chemical combination, reached their acme
in Berthollet's teaching, which united all previous investiga
 tions and speculations into a compact theory.
    The basis of Berthollet's conception was his statement that
 the chemical action of every substance must be proportional
 to its active mass and to a constant depending on its nature,
and named by him Affinity, except in so far as external con
 ditions (e.g. temperature, state of aggregation, solubility,
 volatility, and so on) acted as retarding or accelerating causes.
 The doctrine of Berthollet is now       '     recognized, although
it was for long ignored or forgotten. # unfortunate
 neglect is explicable when it is remembered that, along with
 the most illustrious of his contemporaries, he committed the
 error of supposing that the capacity for saturation was a mea
sure of affinity. # Humphrey Davy had, indeed, shown that
 this assumption led to not a few difficulties; but it was first dis
 proved by the brilliant experimental development by Berzelius
 of Richter’s “Stoichiometry” and Dalton's Atomic Theory.
    That, in consequence of this disproof of an unimportant and
incidental addition to the experimentally correct doctrine of
 Berthollet, his doctrine should have almost been forgotten, and
have been completely neglected, would appear inconceivable,
if we did not consider the enormous influence exercised by
 Berzelius on the growth of Chemistry. He united to an acute
perception of the most minute peculiarities in the behaviour of
 chemical substances, and the most refined choice of analytical
and synthetical methods, a special talent for systematic
arrangement of facts discovered from day to day by himself
and by his students. All theoretical views were employed by
him in support of his system; indeed, he accepted none unless
it proved of assistance in his endeavour to perfect his mar
vellous arrangement of the chemical elements and their com
pounds. He was indifferent to theoretical speculations which

              Evolution of the Doctrine of Affinity.         505
did not seem to further his great work; while he offered a
most strenuous opposition to all those which he conceived
would bring £ into his classification. He even disputed
for half a generation Davy's discovery of the elementary cha
racter of chlorine, simply because he could not reconcile it
with his views.
   But the discovery in the earlier part of this century of the
relations between the electrical and the chemical behaviour of
elements and compounds appeared to him to afford great
assistance in the development of his system; and hence he
based his whole classification on positive and negative cha
racters of substances, manifested electrically; and for a time,
at least, he identified affinity with electrical attraction.
   Alongside of this electrochemical hypothesis, every other
doctrine of affinity appeared superfluous; and, as a con
sequence, Berthollet's teachings were forgotten, although they
were by no means contrary to the newer views. The electro
chemical theory of Berzelius, however, was never fully deve
loped in detail. Even though he laid great stress on it, though
he often referred to it, and insisted on its fundamental nature,
yet there is not to be found in any of his numerous memoirs
in which it is mentioned, nor in his Jahresbericht, in which
he criticised the electrochemical theories of other investi
gators, nor even in any one of the numerous editions of his
Textbook, an attempt at a complete exposition of his theory.
In actual fact, the electrochemical theory never rose above
the general conception that the chemical and electrical
behaviour of bodies are closely connected. The explanation
was only an apparent one: it consisted only in ascribing to
electrical causes observed chemical facts. An attempt to
measure affinities on such a basis failed, owing either to the
lack of experimental data or to its being contradicted by
them.
   Erroneous deductions from his theory misled Berzelius,
not only in causing him to disbelieve Davy's proof of
the elementary nature of chlorine, but also in leading him
vigorously and persistently to dispute Faraday's electrolytic
law. While he withdrew from his opposition to Davy after
a sixteen years’ struggle (1826), when the analogy between
hydrogen chloride and hydrogen sulphide had been fully
recognized, he continued to reject until his death that most
important of all electrochemical discoveries, Faraday's law.
These two facts serve sufficiently to show that Berzelius's
theory was unable to yield a thorough explanation of affinity.
That in spite of such weak points, sufficiently evident today,
a man of Berzelius's great power could hold fast to them

throughout his whole life, and, moreover, impress others with
their truth for many years, was a consequence of the enormous
benefit which his systematic arrangement conferred on che
mical science. Even his system died, as soon as its incom
petence to classify organic compounds became manifest; and
the chemical world looked on its departure with indifference.
   From this period, however, the speculations of chemists
ran in quite a new channel. It was not so necessary to
investigate the mode of action of the forces of affinity, as to
prepare and examine the wonderful forms of combination
which by its influence the atoms could be induced to assume
in organic compounds. This work for long absorbed the
attention of chemists. The obstinate battles fought over the
laws governing the linkage of atoms are still so fresh in the
minds of at least the older of the present generation of
chemists, that they need not here be more than mentioned.
   During this contest regarding the constitutional formulae
of organic compounds, a complete revolution of the doctrines
of affinity was in progress, which was prompted chiefly by
facts in inorganic Chemistry. Chemists had persistently clung
to the assumption, long before proved untenable, that heat
was a form of matter capable of entering into combination with
other forms of matter to produce chemical compounds. Al
though Rumford, at the end of last century, had proved that
heat is a mode of motion (a view held even in the 16th and
17th centuries"), and Davy had furnished a brilliant con
firmation of his proof, yet even up to the middle of this century
it was stated in the most widely-read textbooks of Chemistry
that heat, light, and electricity are to be regarded as impon
derable forms of matter. It must be noted that, though
rejected by all journals of Physics, Julius Robert Mayer's
treatise received compensation, oddly enough, by finding
a resting-place in Liebig’s “Annals of Chemistry’f. With
the recognition of the importance of the mechanical theory
of heat arose the hope that, by its help, our knowledge of the
doctrine of affinity might be materially advanced.
   The view was at once suggested that, just as a heavy body,
in consequence of the mutual attraction between it and the
earth, moves towards the earth with accelerated velocity,
thereby converting potential energy, due to its elevated
position, into kinetic energy, so the atoms, as a consequence
of their affinity, move towards each other, converting their
affinity into energy of motion, which, as a rule, is manifested
in the form of heat. According to this doctrine, the heat

              Evolution of the Doctrine of Affinity.             507
evolved by the sum of the impacts should be a measure of the
affinity. But, from the first, difficulties have to be surmounted
in accepting this view. One of the greatest is that it seldom
occurs that a compound is formed through the union of isolated
atoms; in almost all cases the atoms themselves have to be
liberated from compounds in which they have existed in a
state of combination. As this liberation must be accompanied
by gain of energy (i.e. by absorption of heat), while the
formation of the new compound gives rise to loss of energy
(i.e. a heat-evolution), it happens that, as a rule,         '.   the
difference between the absorption and emission is manifested
externally. Hence this doctrine of affinity can deduce from
observations, not the absolute value of either affinity, but only
the amount by which the one is greater than the other.
Many other difficulties present themselves; especially the
fact that, along with chemical changes, physical changes
(alteration of the state of aggregation, of the volume, and so
on) occur simultaneously, and are themselves accompanied by
an emission or by an absorption of heat. Moreover, thermo
chemical experiments are by no means easy of execution, and
are subject to many sources of error; hence it is not to be
wondered that slow progress was made in developing the
 thermochemical doctrine of affinity. The more numerous
the observations, and the greater their accuracy, the greater
the number of instances in which theory and experiment
failed to display coincidence. It has been frequently observed
 that a much larger evolution of heat occurs on neutralizing an
 evidently weak acid than a strong one capable of expelling
 the weak one more or less completely from its compounds
 with bases. The expulsion, in such cases, is attended by an
 absorption, not an evolution, of heat. Similar facts have also
 been noticed in not a few other chemical reactions, which must
 be, and have been, regarded as produced by the action of
 affinity; e.g., the formation of the ethereal salts of organic
 acids by their action on the alcohols". Many attempts have
 been made to explain reactions which are accompanied b
 negative heat-changes, and to bring them into unison wit
 the thermal doctrine of affinity. But as all such attempts
 have been unsuccessful, the fundamental hypothesis of the
 doctrine loses much of its probability. And consequently its
 most ardent supporter, M. Berthelot, has relinquished his
assertion that, by the action of the affinities of all the substances
partaking in a reaction, those compounds are always formed
 which are accompanied by the greatest evolution of heat. He
 has modified his statement to this: that there is present “a
             * J. Thomsen, Thermoch. Untersuch, iv. p. 383,
                              2 M2

508                   Prof. L. Meyer on the
tendency towards (tends vers la) the production of such states
of combination.”       But even in order to reconcile this state
ment with reactions distinctly accompanied by a negative
heat-change, far-fetched and artificial explanations of an
unsatisfactory nature are necessary. Nevertheless, the funda
mental hypothesis—that the heat of combination is, in reality,
affinity transformed into kinetic energy—might have passed
as true for a much longer time, had not the progress of
thermo-chemical research shown it to be               £          un
tenable.
   It will be remembered that Julius Thomsent made use of
the positive or negative heat-change accompanying a chemical
reaction to determine the extent to which the reaction had
£ ; and this was legitimate, owing to the fact that the
  eat-change is proportional to the quantity of matter which
has altered its form of combination.            W#. investigating
the expulsion of acids from their salts in dilute aqueous solution
by other acids, the very remarkable observation was made that
that acid is by no means always the stronger which evolves
the greatest heat on neutralization. For example, although
sulphuric acid when neutralized in dilute aqueous solution
gives rise to an evolution of heat surpassing by three thousand
units that furnished by an equivalent amount of nitric or
hydrochloric acid, yet it is only half as strong an acid as the
latter; that is, if equivalent amounts of nitric and sulphuric
acids be mixed with an amount of caustic soda equivalent to
one of them, the sulphuric acid enters into combination with
only half as much soda as the nitric acid; so that one third of
the nitric acid remains in the free state, while two thirds of
the sulphuric acid is free. There can be absolutely no doubt
that nitric acid is by far the stronger acid, although, judging
from the thermal theory of affinity, sulphuric acid should be
the stronger.
   While Thomsen was prosecuting his researches, it was
generally held that the evolution of heat was an absolute mea
sure of affinity; hence Thomsen devised the term “avidity”
to express the “tendency of an acid towards neutralization.”
But this is nothing else than the real affinity of the acid
towards the base,    £         with a special name to avoid con
fusion. Ostwald #, who       :              and extended Thomsen's
researches by wholly different methods, named this quantity
“relative affinity.”
   It appeared, from the investigation of a great number of

acids, that there was absolutely no connexion between avidity
or relative affinity and heat of neutralization. Even the order
of magnitude of the two, when a number of instances is com
pared, is entirely different. The strongest of all acids—nitric
acid-occupies only the nineteenth place among forty acids,
when they are arranged in the order of their heats of neu
tralization; while hydrofluoric acid evolves most heat on
neutralization, although its avidity is only one twentieth of
that of nitric acid; and so with other instances.       As it would
be absurd to ascribe the greatest affinity to a base to an acid
which is in great part expelled by another, it must be acknow
ledged that the fundamental hypothesis of the thermal doctrine
of affinity is not justified by £
   But a further conclusion follows from Thomsen's investi
£ namely, that, while the heat of formation of compounds
 epends on the nature of their constituents, it does not, at
least in many cases, depend on any special change, attraction,
or affinity in which both constituents are concerned. This is
most easily seen when the heat of formation of salts from strong
bases and acids is considered. If, as Thomsen has experimen
tally shown, the total amount of heat evolved during the process
of formation of a salt from the elements which it contains, and
its solution in a large quantity of water be measured, the
extremely remarkable fact is to be noticed that a definite dif
ference in composition involves a similarly definite difference
in heat of formation, varying only within very narrow limits+.
   The heat of formation of a salt of lithium is, for example, in
round numbers, always 11,400 calories greater than that of a
salt of sodium with the same acid, and about 2000 calories
greater than that of a salt of potassium; and so for other
metals. This has been proved for the chlorides, bromides,
iodides, hydrates, hydrosulphides, sulphates, dithionates, and
nitrates of nineteen metals. If, on the other hand, the metal
remain the same, but the acid radical be varied, a definite
difference in the heat of formation is again to be observed for
each acid radical. That of the bromides is always about
21,800 calories less than that of the chlorides, and that of the
iodides 52,300 less; while the chlorides invariably evolve
during their formation about 200,000 calories less than the
corresponding sulphates. The heat of formation of every salt
may therefore be represented as the sum of certain numbers,
'. of which numbers is peculiar to one constituent group or
element, and remains constant into whatever form           .# combi
nation that element or group enters. It is therefore possible,

so soon as these constants have been    £ determined for
each constituent group or element, to calculate the heat of
formation of the salt in a manner similar to that by which the
molecular weight of a compound may be deduced from the
atomic weights of its constituents.
   This simple relation could not hold were the heats of for
mation of salts affected by the affinity of the constituents for
each other; for in such a case each constituent would contri
bute so much the more to the heat of formation the greater
the affinity between it and the other constituent with which
it combined. We must therefore believe that the evolution of
heat, developed by the formation of a compound, results solely
from the change of condition of the constituent elements. Similar
laws, as Ostwald has shown, apply also to other changes of
condition, e. g. to expansion or contraction, or to change of
optical properties which accompany the formation of salts.
These also can be calculated by simple addition; for their
constituent numbers are constants belonging to each one of the

other.
          substances, and are independent of the nature of the
   The thermal theory of affinity has a changed complexion
owing to this discovery. What was formerly attributed to
the mutual action of several substances must now be regarded
as change of condition of each individual substance, each being
wholly independent of all others with which it may combine.
The heat-change accompanying a chemical change must no
longer be regarded as £ conversion of potential energy into
kinetic energy, owing to the mutual attraction of the atoms;
but it must be concluded that each substance, each atom, each
compound, possesses its own peculiar store of available energy,
capable of being increased or diminished by its entering into
reaction, or by any change of condition. But this store of
energy and its changes must in nowise be confounded with
affinity—that is, with the reason of chemical change. For
the amount of energy lost by a substance during reaction
depends solely on its own nature, and on the kind of change
which it undergoes; not on the nature of the substance
through whose influence this change is produced. To employ
an old simile, affinity acts like the spark to the powder; like
the trigger which releases the weight b         '       under the
action of gravity, the pile is driven in. '.ust as in these and
similar cases there is no proportionality between the effective
cause and the final result, so also with chemical changes.
   Such considerations lead naturally to the old question re
garding the necessity of imagining any special affinity or
attracting-power between atoms. And the more proofs are

                Evolution of the Doctrine of Affinity.                511
furnished that not only the supposed affinity, but even the
actually measured       £         is an inherent property of each
separate kind of matter, independent of any reaction with any
other kind of matter, the more doubtful is the necessity. The
more recent investigations of Ostwald" have shown that the
mostheterogeneous actions of acids, in influencing the chemical
changes of various substances,—as, for example, in decompo
sing the amides, informing the ethereal salts, in inverting the
sugars, and moreover in influencing the electrical conduc
tivity, -are all dependent on the same constant, the affinity or
avidity. If the ability of acids to act remain the same in rela
tion to so many different phenomena, the assumption appears
justified that it is caused, not by mutual action, by attraction
of one kind or another, but is in reality something peculiar to
the nature of the acids themselves.
   There might be a temptation to believe that, in relinquish
ing the hypothesis of an attractive force between the atoms,
we must also relinquish the possibility of any definite con
ception of the influences of the nature of reacting bodies in
determining chemical changes. But this is by no means
the case. For just as it was formerly supposed that the heat
liberated during an act of combination was the equivalent in
kinetic energy of so much potential energy due to the attrac
tion of the atoms, it is open to regard the atoms as particles
in rapid motion, but devoid of attracting-power, the whole of
whose store of energy consists in this motion, and is therefore
kinetic; and it may therefore be assumed that such atoms
may unite to form molecules, or that such molecules may
otherwise react, owing to some as yet undiscovered relation
between their modes of motion and velocities.              It is of course
unnecessary to picture to ourselves attractive forces. They
 may or may not be conceived, but            ''    are of no great im
portance to science. For my part I believe that a less
restricted and prejudiced view of the facts is to be attained
by abandoning the ' of mutual attraction between
atoms, and avoiding all reference to the unnecessary distinc
tion between the potential and the kinetic energy of the atoms.
    It may fall hard on many who have devoutly believed in
 the thermal theory of affinity, exalting it high above all facts,
 to see it dethroned; perhaps here ' there some will refuse
 to abandon it, like Berzelius with his electrochemical theory,
 chiefly prompted by the fear that when it is gone the kingdom
 of chaos, so painfully conquered, may again arise. Yet things

are not in so dangerous a plight as might at first appear.
The thermal doctrine of affinity has had no more real influence
on the steady experimental evolution of Chemistry than had
the electrochemical theory of Berzelius. Both long held
honourable places as great general truths; attempts have been
made with both to apply them to experimental details; but,
as frequently happens, theory and experiment did not agree,
the theory has been calmly ignored, and we must trust to the
future to make things plain. If, once again, a theory has
unexpectedly proved untenable, once again the old course of
events will be repeated; attempts at generalization have been
 too soon made: “gestit enim mens exsilire ad magis gene
 ralia ut acquiescat ” (Bacon). Theory has attempted to
 precede fact; it has pursued a false path, and must wait
until fact with quiet progress shows the way.
    Such is our present state of knowledge. But long before
 the thermochemical doctrine of affinity became untenable, the
 efforts of investigators had been directed to ascertaining the
 conditions on which chemical reactions depend, such as the
 influence of time, of temperature, of mass, and of solvents;
 and to the measurement of the resulting changes in volume,
 in evolution of heat, and similar phenomena. Now that ex
 periment has shown the fallacy of an attempt to deduce
 chemical change from the fundamental principles of thermo
 chemistry, we hail with joy the appearance of a new, really
 kinetic, doctrine of affinity, which, quietly and unostenta
 tiously making its way along the road of induction, holds out
 to us the prospect of a real knowledge of the essential nature
 of chemical change. By its help also those numerous thermo
 chemical observations, which were unable to lend support to a
 onesided theory, for which they furnished the sole basis,
 acquire for the first time their true meaning when viewed in
 connexion with all other phenomena accompanying chemical
 change. Thus, although one illusion more has been dissi
 pated by this new evolution of the doctrine of affinity, yet
 science is enriched by the acquisition of a less hypothetical
 and more far-reaching and inclusive conception of the nature
 of chemical combination."

LX. Contributions to the Theory of the Constitution of the
    Diazoamido-Compounds. By RAPHAEL MELDOLA, F.R.S.,
    F.I.C., F.C.S., Professor of Chemistry in the City and Guilds
    of London Institute, Finsbury Technical College".
IN a series of investigations upon the diazoamido-compounds
       which have been carried out by me in conjunction with
Mr. F. W. Streatfeildt, certain facts have been brought to
light which are quite inexplicable by any of the formulae at
present in use; and it has therefore become necessary to
reconsider the whole question of the chemical constitution of
these interesting derivatives, which have taxed to the utmost
 the ingenuity of all those chemists who have concerned them
 selves with their investigation.
     The formula which up to the present time has been generally
 adopted is due to Kekulé+, and is thus expressed in general
 terms :
                              X. N. NH. Y,
 X and Y being similar or dissimilar radicals. The chief
 objection to this formula has hitherto been its asymmetrical
 character, which renders it incapable of explaining the remark
 able observation of Griess $, which is now confirmed from
 many sides, viz. that the mixed diazoamido-compounds, in
 which X and Y are dissimilar, are always identical whichever
  radical is first diazotized. This difficulty has been to some
  extent met by the suggestion of Victor Meyer | ; and in a
  former paper by Mr. Streatfeild and myself" it was shown
  that the results of our investigations, as far as these had been
  carried, could be explained by means of this hypothesis of the
  formation of intermediate additive compounds with a consi
  derable show of reason.
      The extension of our work has, however, forced me to the
  conclusion that Kekulé's formula does not adequately express
  all the known facts concerning the diazoamido-compounds;
  and if this formula is, as I believe it must be, abandoned, the
  supplementary hypothesis is also rendered unnecessary.

metanitraniline upon paranitraniline an unsymmetrical diazo
amido-compound is obtained, which has a melting-point of
211°. The same compound is obtained by reversing the order
of combination, i. e., by acting upon metanitraniline with
diazotized paranitraniline. According to Kekulé's view, this
substance could have only one of the two formulae:—
                               I.
          (p) NO2. C.H. N. NH. C.H. NO, (m),
                               II.
           (m) NO. C.H. N. NH. C.H. NO, (p).
   By replacing the H-atom of the NH-group by ethyl an
ethyl-derivative (of m.p. 148°) is formed; and this, on the
same theory, could have only one of the two corresponding
formulae:—
                               III.
        (p) NO2. C.H. N. N(C2H5). C.H. NO, (m),
                              IV.
        (m) NO2. C.H. N2. N(C2H5). C.H. NO, (p).
   If the unsymmetrical compound had the formula I., its
ethyl-derivative (III.) might have been expected to be iden
tical with the compound produced by the action of diazotized
paranitraniline upon ethylmetanitraniline; if it had the for
mula II., its ethyl-derivative (IV.) might have been expected
to be identical with the compound produced by the action of
diazotized metanitraniline upon ethyl-paranitraniline. As
a matter of fact, it has been found that the ethyl-derivative of
the unsymmetrical compound is identical with neither of the
compounds prepared by the action of the diazotized nitranilines
upon the ethyl-nitranilines. We have therefore to allow the
existence of three isomeric ethyl-derivatives containing para
and metanitraniline residues, a fact which cannot be repre
sented by Kekulé's formula. The properties of these and all
the allied compounds prepared by us in the course of the
inquiry are summarized in the following Table:—

 516             Prof. R. Meldola on the Theory of the
    If the ethyl-derivatives Nos. 7 and 8 are formulated on
 Kekulé's type they would have the formulae IV. and III.
respectively, and thus no other expression is left for the ethyl
 derivative No. 4.
    The conditions to be fulfilled by any formula proposed for
 the diazoamido-compounds are, therefore, (1) that it should
 be symmetrical so as to represent the identity of mixed diazo
 amido-compounds, and (2) that it should be capable of repre
senting more than two isomeric alkyl-derivatives of mixed
compounds. These conditions are certainly not met by the
 formula now in use; and the objections which apply to this
apply also to the alternative formula proposed by Strecker":
                                X. N. NH. Y
    This formula fails to explain the existence of more than two
isomeric alkyl-derivatives of the unsymmetrical (mixed) com
pounds; and is even less able than Kekulé’s of representing
 the identity of mixed compounds, since it is incapable of the
 rearrangement suggested by Victor Meyer.
    The ' symmetrical formula proposed to explain the iden
tity of mixed diazoamido-compounds is due to Griesst, the
discoverer of these compounds, who suggested that diazoamido
benzene and its analogues should be written according to the
type :
                         Cs    -N=N=N=CH,
                                   H. H.    H.
    This formula certainly explains the identity of mixed com
pounds, but is otherwise open to certain objections; since in
the first place it represents diazoamidobenzene as a phenylene
derivative, and in the next place it shows the presence of
three NH-groups containing three replaceable hydrogen atoms.
All our experiments upon the salts and alkyl-derivatives of
the dinitrodiazoamido-compounds have shown, however, that
only one replaceable H-atom is presenti. This formula,
moreover, is not capable of explaining the easy resolution of

          Constitution of the Diazoamido-Compounds.              517
diazoamido-compounds by acids, nor the production of mixed
products from mixed compounds (see the foregoing Table).
   Another symmetrical formula has been proposed by Victor
Meyer", viz.:—
                         X—N—N–Y
                                -N-l
                                   H
but this was abandoned by him as having but little probability.
One of the greatest objections to this formula is that it fails to
represent the N-atom which is attached to the replaceable
H-atom as being also directly attached to one or the other of
the aromatic radicals. The decomposition of the ethyl
derivatives of the dinitrodiazoamido-compounds by acids
shows that this mode of attachment of the NH-group certainly
exists (see the foregoing Table).
   In the course of the present investigations another symme
trical formula has suggested itself, which may be here given:
                        H                     H
                  x_N_y or X-N-Y

                                             N
   This formula does not, however, appear to me to have any
probability, as it fails to explain the decomposition of the
diazoamido-compounds by acids, or the existence of isomeric
alkyl-derivatives. Moreover, the formula of diazoamidoben
zene written on this type:
                                    H

                                 N=
would indicate a close relationship between this substance and
the remarkably stable diphenylamine.                The latter is not
 found, however, among the reduction-products of diazoamido:
 benzene; and there is no experimental evidence of any kind
 in favour of such a relationship.
   Before proceeding to put forward my own views upon the
constitution of these compounds it will be desirable to take a

518           Prof. R. Meldola on the Theory of the
general view of their characters, so as to gain a clear notion
of all the conditions which have to be fulfilled by any proposed
formula. These characters are summarized below, those com
pounds containing similar radicals being spoken of as “normal”
compounds, and those containing dissimilar radicals as “mixed”
compounds:—
   (1) Normal compounds are prepared by diazotizing an
amine, X. NH2, and acting with the diazo-salt upon another
molecule of the same amine, X. NH2, or, what amounts to the
same thing, one molecule of nitrous acid may be made to act
upon two molecules of X. NH2.
   (2) Mixed compounds are obtained by diazotizing an amine,
X. NH2, and acting with the diazo-salt upon one molecule of
another amine, Y. NH2. The same compound results if the
order of combination is reversed.
   (3) The diazoamido-compounds, both mixed and normal,
contain one atom of hydrogen easily replaceable by metals
and alkyl radicals. If the aromatic radicals contain strongly
acid groups (such as NO2), the resulting diazoamido-com
pounds may be distinct monobasic acids.
   (4) Normal compounds are resolved by acids into their
constituents, the diazo-salt and amine.
   (5) Mixed compounds are resolved by acids into a mixture
of the two bases from which they are derived, and a mixture
of the two diazo-salts corresponding to these two bases.
   (6) Alkyl derivatives of normal compounds may be pre
pared in two ways:—
      a. By the action of a diazotized amine, X. NH2, upon
         the alkylamine of the same base, X. NHR.
      S. By the direct alkylization of the normal diazoamido
         compound.
   (7) The alkyl-derivatives of normal compounds are decom
posed by acids into their constituents, the diazo-salt and
alkylamine.
   (8) Alkyl-derivatives of mixed diazoamido-compounds are
formed by the direct alkylization of these compounds (see
group 2).
   (9) Another group of mixed alkyl-derivatives can be pre
pared by the action of a diazotized amine, X, NH2, upon the
alkyl-derivative of a dissimilar amine, Y. NHR. These com
pounds are isomeric with those of the preceding group.
   (10) Mixed alkyl-derivatives of group (8) are resolved by
the action of acids into a mixture of the two diazo-salts and
the two alkylamines.

           Constitution of the Diazoamido-Compounds.                      519
    (11) Mixed alkyl-derivatives of group (9) are resolved by
acids into their constituents, the diazo-salt and the alkylamine,
but not into a mixture of diazo-salts and alkylamines, as is
the case with the compounds of group 9".
    (12) Normal compounds, by the action of weak reducing
agents, are reduced to the original amine X. NH2, and the
hydrazine X. N2H3. Mixed compounds give, on reduction,
the base X. NH, and the hydrazine Y                   .#        or the base
Y. NH2 and the hydrazine X. N2H3f.
    (13) Alkyl-derivatives of normal compounds reduce to the
hydrazine X. N2H3 and the alkylamine X. NHRf. Alkyl
derivatives of mixed compounds give, on reduction, the
hydrazine X- or Y. N2H3, and the alkylamine Y- or X. NHRS.
This production of alkylamines indicates that the N-atom
which is in combination with the alkyl-radical is also attached
to the aromatic nucleus ||.
    From the foregoing summary it will be seen that the mixed
diazoamido-compounds and their alkyl-derivatives display the
 most striking characters, and are of special importance to the
present discussion, because it is in the attempt to formulate
these compounds on Kekulé's plan that the greatest difficulties
 are encountered. In view of the objections which apply to
 all the formulae hitherto proposed it has been no easy matter
 to suggest any alternative formula; but I believe that the true
 solution of the problem will be arrived at by regarding phenyl
 as a triatomic radical, C.H.", instead of monatomic, as has
 always been assumed in previous formulae. This suggestion
 is in accordance with Fittig's theory of the constitution of
    * To this class, in addition to the ethyl-derivatives of m.p. 174°–175° and
 187° (Nos. 7 and 8 in the Table), belong the two following compounds:—
 (1) produced by the action of diazotized p-toluidine upon ethylaniline,
 and (2) prepared by the action of diazotized aniline on ethyl-p-toluidine.
 These two compounds are isomeric; the first being decomposed by acids
 (hot) into p-cresol and ethylaniline, and the second into phenol and
 ethyl-p-toluidine (Nölting and Binder, Bull. Soc. Chim. vol. xlii. p. 341;
 Gastiger, ibid, p. 842). This pair of isomerides is completely analogous
 to our two ethyl-derivatives (Nos. 7 and 8), which they resemble in their
 mode of decomposition.
    t Thus the compound produced by the action of diazotized aniline
 upon p-toluidine or the reverse gives, on reduction, phenylhydrazine and
 p-toluidine (Nölting and Binder, loc. cit, p. 336).
    f Thus the compound obtained by the action of diazotized aniline on
 "'              reduces to phenylhydrazine and methylaniline (loc. cit.).
    §. Thus the compound prepared by Gastiger by the action of diazotized
 aniline on ethyl-p-toluidine reduces to phenylhydrazine and ethyl-p
 toluidine (loc. cit. p. 342).

 interfere with the formation of hydrazines; in such cases the correspond

   If this assumption be made, it then becomes possible to
construct formulae for the mixed diazoamido-compounds which
meet all the requirements of the case, and which must, there
fore, commend themselves to the notice of all chemists who,
like myself, have been puzzled to explain the behaviour of
these compounds in accordance with the existing theoretical
notions. The formula now proposed may be written in two
ways:—
                   N: N.               N. N.
             <> * >

                     I                  II
   Of these two formulae I am disposed to attach the greater
weight to the first because it £, the presence of the
very stable azo-group, —N : N-; and this is in accordance
with the general character of the compounds, which decom
pose under the influence of acids or of reducing agents in
such a manner that the N-atoms of the azo-group always
remain in combination, either in the form of a   £      Or a
hydrazine.   On the other hand, the second formula indicates
the presence of the group =C=N. N=C=; and this might

   It may now be pointed out how far these formulae are in
harmony with the known characters of the mixed diazoamido
compounds. In the first place it is obvious that the formula
is symmetrical, and thus explains the identity of the com
£        irrespective of the order of combination. Putting P
 or the p-nitraniline residue and M for the m-nitraniline residue,
this fact may be thus represented without assuming the for
mation of any intermediate additive compound:—
            "... - …",
              -,                     *,

the products would be m-nitrodiazobenzene-chloride and p
nitraniline. As a matter of fact all four products are obtained,
so that decomposition must take place in both directions. The
same explanation obviously applies to the mixed decompo
sition-products of the ethyl-derivative. Again, the formula
shows the presence of the one replaceable H-atom in combi
nation with the N-atom which is attached to the aromatic
radicals. The question of the existence of more than two
isomeric alkyl-derivatives will be considered subsequently.
    The formula which has now been suggested for the mixed
diazoamido-compounds derived from p- and m-nitraniline
can be applied with equal success to all other mixed com
pounds. Thus, to take examples of those compounds whose
products of decomposition have been studied:—
                                                   N:NS
                                         *~   ***

                                                      >*
    Both these compounds were discovered and their decompo
sition products studied by Griess: the first is obtained by the
action of diazotized aniline upon p-toluidine, or of diazotized
  -toluidine upon aniline; the second is similarly produced
£ aniline and amidobenzoic acid.             When heated with acids
the first compound gives a mixture of aniline, p-toluidine,
phenol, and p-cresol (Nölting and Binder)"; and the second
compound under similar circumstances gives aniline, phenol,
oxybenzoic, and amidobenzoic acid (Griess). The products
in these cases indicate separation along both planes of decom
position a b and cd.
    The explanation of the existence of more than two isomeric
alkyl-derivatives of mixed diazoamido-compounds is closely
connected with the question whether the new formula can be
applied to the normal diazoamido-compounds. The following
considerations will show that these compounds cannot be for
mulated on the new type :
   As a type of the normal compounds let us consider that
derived from p-nitraniline (No. 2 in the table). If this had
the new formula it (and its ethyl-derivative) would have to
be written:—
   * This compound reduces to phenyl-hydrazine, and p-toluidine, thus
indicating a preference of the N2-(and therefore the NH-NH2) group to
remain attached to the more positive radical. The separation is in this
case along ab only.

   Now the ethyl-derivative (No. 5 in the table) is prepared
by the direct ethylation of the compound itself, and also by
the action of diazotized p-nitraniline upon p-ethylnitraniline.
Analogy would therefore lead us to suppose that if the ethyl
derivative had the above constitution, the other ethyl-deriva
tives, prepared by the action of diazotized p-nitraniline upon
m-ethylnitraniline (m.p. 187°) and of diazotized m-nitraniline
upon p-ethylnitraniline (m.p. 174°-175), would have a similar
constitution:—

   But these two formulae are identical with one another and
with that of the ethyl-derivative of m.p. 148°, whereas their
melting-points and mode of decomposition show most con
clusively that the three compounds are isomeric and not
identical. It must, therefore, be concluded that the formula
now proposed does not apply to the normal compounds, and

true representatives of Kekulé's type. In answer to this I
may point out that, as far as the experimental evidence at
present goes, the normal compounds and the analogous ethyl
derivatives may be written on Kekulé's type:–
            (p) NO2. C.H. N2 | NH. C.H. . NO, (p),

   The modes of decomposition of these compounds are ex
plained by the above formulae by supposing the planes of
separation to be along the dotted lines; and it further appears
that the isomerism of the three ethyl-derivatives of m.p's 148°,
 174°–175°, and 187° (Nos. 4, 7 and 8 in the table) may be
explained by the different formulae ascribed to these com
pounds respectively.
    But although Kekulé's formula may pass muster for the
 normal compounds, we are not necessarily reduced to this as
 a final expression; and I am strongly inclined to the belief
 that it will have to be abandoned also in the case of these
 compounds. In the first place, as there is a great resemblance
 in character between the normal and the mixed compounds,
 analogy leads me to suppose that their constitutions are not
 SO #y       different, as appears from the two modes of formu
 lation :

            Constitution of the Diazoamido-Compounds.                 525
   In the next place the group —N=N-NH– assumed to
be present, according to the prevailing view, has always
seemed to me to be a most improbable arrangement of N
atoms, and without any analogy among chemical compounds.
Those compounds in which three combined N-atoms are pre
sent are only stable when the N-atoms form a closed chain,
as in Griess's benzeneimide:—
                                        N
or in the azimidobenzene of this same author":—
                             C.H.&N.
                                     H
   From these considerations I am led to conclude that an
open chain of three nitrogen atoms does not exist in any of
the diazoamido-compounds, and the remarkable stability of
the dinitrodiazoamido-compounds in the presence of alkalist
certainly supports this view.                                   -
    The formula which I now venture to suggest for the normal
compounds is, as far as I can see, at ' rate as equally
capable as Kekulé's of representing the characters of these
compounds, and at the same time indicates the analogy of
these to the normal compounds. It has moreover the advan
tage of doing away with the assumption of the open chain of
N-atoms:—
                                      N.N
                               <        NH. X
    According to this formula the preceding compounds would
be written:—
   * I have accepted this formula rather than the alternative one
     ZN

                because, according to Boessneck (Ber. xix. 1886, p. 1757),
       1.
acetorthotoluylene-diamine yields acetazimidotoluene by the action of
nitrous acid. The N. C.H.O-group must, therefore, be attached to the
aromatic nucleus, and this acetyl compound gives azimidotoluene by
hydrolysis, so that the NH-group must also be attached to the aromatic
nucleus.
   + These compounds can be boiled with strong potash solution for days
without undergoing any alteration (Journ, Chem: Soc., Trans. 1886,
p. 627). Even the simpler compounds like diazoamidobenzene are much
more stable in neutral or alkaline solutions than is generally supposed.

           Thus, taking the products of decomposition of the last pair of
           isomeric ethyl-derivatives, the 187° m.p. modification is re
            solved into p-nitrodiazobenzene-chloride and m-ethylnitrani

              The mixed compounds containing both aromatic and fatty
           radicals are in all respects analogous to the normal compounds,
           and, according to Wallach", behave like these on decompo

            Constitution of the Diazoamido-Compounds.                  527
    A few remarks may here be made in connexion with the
transformation of diazoamido- into amidoazo-compounds. It
has always been supposed hitherto that this transformation is
preceded by a resolution of the diazoamido-compound into its
constituents". This may be the case in the presence of excess
of acid ; but it is doubtful whether such a resolution occurs
when the diazoamido-compound (say diazoamidobenzene) is
allowed to stand in the presence of excess of aniline containing
only a small quantity of aniline hydrochloride. It is well known,
however, that such a mixture will effect the complete conver
sion of diazoamido- into amidoazobenzene in the course of a
few hours, especially if aided by heat. If the formula of
diazoamidobenzene is written according to the present view,
it will be seen that a slight rearrangement of the “bonds”
would convert it into a symmetrical compound of the type
already proposed for the mixed diazoamido-compounds;
thus:
                   N:N                             N:N.
                     NH. C.Hs
    It seems not improbable that such a symmetrical compound
may precede the formation of amidoazobenzene, the separation
(accompanied by the migration of the H-atom to the NH
group)f occurring along one of the dotted lines.
    Although the formulae now proposed for the normal diazo
amido-compounds appear capable of meeting all the require
ments of the case, it will be of interest to point out that other
molecular arrangements in which phenyl functions as a tri
atomic radical are possible :-

             I.                         II.                     III.
   * See the last contribution to this question by Wallach (Lieb. Ann.
vol. ccxxxv, p. 238). I am bound to express the opinion, however, that
the suggestion there thrown out does not materially add to the solution
of the problem (Proc. Chem. Soc. 1887, p. 27).
   t Such a transference of hydrogen is analogous to that which takes
place when hydrazobenzene, C.H. N.H. N.H. C.H., is converted into ben
zidine, NH2. C.H.C.H. NH2, by the action of acids. . . No previous
resolution into constituents has ever been supposed in this case. The
transformation  ' rather to be of the nature of a rotation of the ben
zene rings, and there is reason for believing that a similar rotation takes
  lace in the decomposition of mixed diazoamido-compounds by acids.
  his point cannot be discussed, however, until the evidence is more
complete.

528       Constitution of the Diazoamido-Compounds.
   All these formulae are, however, more or less open to objec
tion, and need not be further discussed at present. It will
suffice to mention that No. III., which at first sight might
appear the most probable of the three, is incapable of repre
senting such compounds as diazobenzenedimethylamide.
   The views now advanced concerning the constitution of this
interesting group of compounds open up suggestive lines of
investigation in the direction of isomerism as connected with
position. In the formula representing phenyl as a triad
radical previously given, the free bonds have been represented
in the para-position, because the ortho-quinone of the benzene
series £ not appear to be capable of existence. But the
formula obviously allows the possibility of such an ortho
arrangement:—
                                           H
                     C=                    C—

                     H                     H
   The para-position of the substituents is, however, in har
mony with the known behaviour of diazoamidobenzene, the
isomeric amidoazobenzene having its substituents in the para
position. It seems probable, therefore, if there is anything
in the previously expressed view concerning this isomeric
transformation, that at least in this diazoamido-compound
the substituents —N: N— and =NH= are in the para
position.
    Summing up the general results of the present discussion,
it appears to me that the formula now proposed for the mixed
diazoamido-compounds is the only one that has hitherto been
 in harmony with all the known characters of these compounds,
 and as such it is at any rate worthy of serious consideration
by chemists. Analogy leads to the belief that the normal
 compounds have a similar, or at least a partly similar con
 stitution; but the evidence is not so satisfactory in these
 cases, owing to the similarity of the two halves of the mole
 cule, which renders it impossible to follow the course of
 decomposition with the same certainty as in the mixed com
pounds. Before, however, the whole question of the consti
tution of the diazoamido-compounds can be completely worked
out on the lines here suggested, it will be necessary to have a

tigations in the required direction are now in progress in the
laboratory of the Finsbury Technical College.
    Postscript.—Since writing the foregoing paper, the detailed
evidence which has led to the conclusion that the ethyl
derivative of m.p. 187° is a diazo-compound has appeared in
a communication to the Chemical Society (Journ. Chem. Soc.,
Trans. 1887, p. 434). Additional evidence of the production of
mixed compounds on the decomposition of mixed diazoamido
derivatives is given in a recent paper by Heumann and Oeco
nomides (Ber. 1887, p. 904). These authors find that the
mixed compound           &#.   . N2H. C7H7, on being heated with
phenol, gives a mixture of aniline and p-toluidine together
with oxyazobenzene and p-tolueneazophenol.

10.     Th: condition for steady motion of an incompressible
                inviscid fluid filling a finite fixed portion of space
 (that is to say, motion in which the velocity and direction of
motion continue unchanged at every point of the space within
 which the fluid is placed) is that, with given vorticity, the
energy is a thorough maximum, or a thorough minimum, or
a minimax. The further condition of stability is secured, by
the consideration of energy alone, for any case of steady
 motion for which the energy is a thorough maximum or a
 thorough minimum ; because when the boundary is held fixed
the energy is of necessity constant. But the mere consi
 deration of energy does not decide the question of stability
 for any case of steady motion in which the energy is a

 the energy may be increased indefinitely by properly-designed
 operation on the boundary (understood that the primitive
 boundary is returned to). Hence, with given vorticity, but
 with no other condition, there is no thorough maximum
of energy in any case. There may also, except in the case
of irrotational circulation in a multiplexly continuous vessel

referred to in § 3 III. above, be complete annulment of the
energy by operation on the boundary (with return to the pri
mitive boundary), as we see by the following illustrations:—
   (a) Two equal, parallel, and oppositely rotating, vortex
columns £! perpendicularly by two fixed parallel
planes. By proper operation on the cylindric boundary, they
may, in purely two-dimensional motion, be thoroughly and
equably mixed in two infinitely thin sheets. In this condition
the energy is infinitely small.
   (b) A single Helmholtz ring, reduced by diminution of its
aperture to an infinitely long tube coiled within the enclosure.
In this condition the energy is infinitely small.
   (c) A single vortex column, with two ends on the boundary,
bent till its middle infinitely nearly meets the boundary; and
further bent and extended till it is broken into two equal and
opposite vortex columns, connected, one end of one to one end
of the other, by a vanishing vortex ligament infinitely near
the boundary; and then further dealt with till these two
columns are mixed together to virtual annihilation.
   12. To avoid, for the present, the extremely difficult general
question illustrated (or suggested) by the consideration of such
cases, confine ourselves now to two-dimensional motions in a
space bounded by two fixed parallel planes and a closed
cylindric, not generally circular cylindric, surface perpen
dicular to them, subjected to changes of figure (but always
truly cylindric and perpendicular to the planes). Also, for
simplicity, confine ourselves for the present to vorticity either
positive or zero, in every part of the fluid. It is obvious that,
with the limitation to two-dimensional motion, the energy
cannot be either infinitely small or infinitely great with any
£       vorticity and given cylindric figure. Hence, under
the given conditions, there certainly are at least two stable
steady motions—those of absolute maximum and absolute
minimum energy. The configuration of absolute maximum
energy clearly consists of least vorticity (or zero vorticity, if
there be fluid of zero vorticity) next the boundary and greater
and greater vorticity inwards. The configuration of absolute
minimum energy, clearly consists of greatest vorticity next
the boundary, and less and less vorticity inwards. If there
be any fluid of zero vorticity, all such fluid will be at rest
either in one continuous mass, or in isolated portions sur
rounded by rotationally moving fluid. For illustration, see
figs. 4 and 5, where it is seen how, even in so simple a case as
that of the containing vessel represented in the diagram, there
can be an infinite number of stable steady motions, each with
maximum (though not greatest maximum) energy; and also

               Minimum Energy in Vortex Motion.             531
an infinite number of stable steady motions of minimum
(though not least minimum) energy.
   13. That there can be an infinite number of configurations of
stable motions, each of them having the energy of a thorough
minimum (as said in § 12), we see, by considering the case
in which the cylindric boundary of the containing canister
consists of two wide portions communicating by a narrow
passage, as shown in the drawings. If such a canister be
completely filled with irrotationally moving fluid of uniform
vorticity, the stream-lines must be something like those indi
cated in fig. 4.
                               Fig. 4.
   Hence, if a not too great portion of the whole fluid is irro
tational, it is clear that there may be a minimum energy, and
therefore a stable configuration of motion, with the whole of
this in one of the wide parts of the canister; or the whole in
the other; or any proportion in one and the rest in the other.
                                Fig. 5.
   Single intersection of stream-lines in rotational motion
may be at any angle, as shown in fig. 4. It is essentially
at right angles in irrotational motion, as shown in fig. 5,
representing the stream-lines of the configuration of maxi
mum energy, for which the rotational part of the liquid is
in two equal parts, in the middles of two wide parts of the
enclosure. There is an infinite number of configurations of

532             Sir W. Thomson on Maximum and
maximum energy in which the rotational part of the fluid is
unequally distributed between the two wide parts of the
enclosure.                                                            **
   14. In every steady motion, when the boundary is cir
cular, the stream-lines are concentric circles and the fluid is
distributed in co-axial cylindric layers of equal vorticity. In
the stable motion of maximum energy, the vorticity is greatest
at the axis of the cylinder, and is less and less outwards to the
circumference. In the stable motion of minimum energy the
vorticity is smallest at the axis, and greater and greater out
wards to the circumference. To express the conditions sym
bolically, let T be the velocity of the fluid at distance r from
the axis (understood that the direction of the motion is per
pendicular to the direction of r), and let a be the radius of the
boundary. The vorticity at distance r is
                                 T      d.
                             # ('   +    dr/"
If the value of this expression diminishes from r=0 to r=a,
the motion is stable, and of maximum energy. If it increases
from r=0 to r=a, the motion is stable and of minimum
energy. If it increases and diminishes, or diminishes and
increases, as r increases continuously, the motion is unstable".
   15. As a simplest subcase, let the vorticity be uniform
through a given portion of the whole fluid, and zero through
the remainder. ' the stable motion of greatest energy, the
portion of fluid having vorticity will be in the shape of a cir
cular cylinder rotating like a solid round its own axis, coin
ciding with the axis of the enclosure; and the remainder of
the fluid will revolve irrotationally around it, so as to fulfil the
condition of no finite slip at the cylindric interface between
the rotational and irrotational portions of the fluid. The
expression for this motion in symbols is
                    T={r       from r=0 to r=b,
and                 T-'        from r=b to r ==a.
  * This conclusion I had nearly reached in the year 1875 by rigid mathe
matical investigation of the vibrations of approximately circular cylindric
vortices; but I was anticipated in the publication of it by Lord Rayleigh,
who concludes his paper “On the Stability, or Instability, of certain Fluid .
Motions” (“Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society, Feb.12,
1880) with the following statement:—“It may be proved that, if the fluid
move between two rigid concentric walls, the motion is stable, provided
that in the steady motion the rotation either continually increases or
continually decreases in passing outwards from the axis,"—which was
unknown to me at the time (August 28, 1880) when I made the com
munication to Section A of the British Association at Swansea.

               Minimum Energy in Vortex Motion.                   533
    16. In the stable motion of minimum energy the rotational
portion of the fluid is in the shape of a cylindric shell, en
closing the irrotational remainder, which in this case is at rest.
The symbolical expression for this motion is
               T=0, when r < V(a”—b”),
and            T-(-":"), when r > V(a”—b").

    17. Let now the liquid be given in the configuration (14)
of greatest energy, and let the cylindric boundary be a sheet
of a real elastic solid, such as sheet-metal with the kind of
dereliction from perfectness of elasticity which real elastic
solids present; that is to say, let its shape when at rest be a
function of the stress applied to it, but let there be a resist
ance to change of shape depending on the velocity of the
change. Let the unstressed shape be truly circular, and let
it be capable of slight deformations from the circular figure
in cross section, but let it always remain truly cylindrical.
Let now the cylindric boundary be slightly deformed and left
to itself, but held so as to prevent it from being carried round
by the fluid. The central vortex column is set into vibration
in such a manner that longer and shorter waves travel round
it with less and greater angular velocity". These waves cause
 corresponding waves of corrugation to travel round the cylin
 dric bounding sheet, by which energy is consumed, and
moment of momentum taken out of the fluid. Let this pro
 cess go on until a certain quantity M of moment of momentum
 has been stopped from the fluid, and now let the canister run
round freely in space, and, for simplicity, suppose its material
to be devoid of inertia.     The whole moment of momentum
was initially
                           T#b°(a’–3b*);
 it is now
                        Trg b”(a”—#b”)—M,
 and continues constantly of this amount as long as the
 boundary is left free in space. The consumption of energy
 still goes on, and the way in which it goes on is this: the
 waves of shorter length are indefinitely multiplied and exalted
 till their crests run out into fine laminae of liquid, and those
 of greater length are abated. Thus a certain portion of the
 irrotationally revolving water becomes mingled with the
 central vortex column. The process goes on until what may

  * Note added May 13, 1887.—I have had some difficulty in now proving
these assertions (§§ 17 and 18) of 1880. Here is proof. Denoting for
brevity 1/2" of the moment of momentum by u, and 1/27 of the energy
by e, we have

of an additional portion of irrotational liquid. Continue this
process until the sponge occupies the whole enclosure.
   After that continue the process further, and the result will
be that each time the containing canister is allowed to go
round freely in space, the fluid will tend to a condition in
which a certain portion of the original vortex core gets filtered
into a position next to the boundary, (within a distance from
the axis which we shall denote by c), and the fluid in this space
tends to a more and more nearly uniform mixture of vortex
with irrotational fluid. This central vortex sponge, on repe
tition of the process of preventing the canister from going
round, and again leaving it free to go round, becomes more
and more nearly irrotational fluid, and the outer belt of pure
vortex becomes thicker and thicker.       The resultant motion is

The final condition towards which the whole tends is a belt
constituted of the original vortex core now next the boundary;
and the fluid which originally revolved irrotationally round it
now placed at rest within it, being the condition (16 above)
of absolute minimum energy. Begin once more with the con
dition (15 above) of absolute maximum energy, and leave the
fluid to itself, whether with the canister free to go round some
times, or always held fixed, provided only it is ultimately held
from going round in space; the ultimate condition is always
the same, viz. the condition (16) of absolute minimum energy.
The enclosing rotational belt, being the actual substance of the
original vortex, is equal in its sectional area to "rb"; and
therefore c”=a”—b”.        The moment of momentum is now
#Trcb", being equal to the moment of momentum of the
portion of #. original configuration consisting of the then
central vortex.
   19. It is difficult to follow, even in imagination, the very
fine—infinitely fine—corrugation and drawing-out of the
rotational fluid; and its intermingling with the irrotational
fluid; and its ultimate re-separation from the irrotational
fluid, which the dynamics of §§ 17, 18 have forced on our
consideration. This difficulty is obviated, and we substitute

536              Sir W. Thomson on Maximum and
for the “vortex sponge” a much easier (and in some respects
more interesting) conception, vortex spindrift, if (quite arbi
trarily, and merely to help us to understand the minimum
energy-transformation of vortex column into vortex shell) we
attribute to the rotational portion of the fluid a Laplacian”
mutual attraction between its parts “insensible at sensible
distances” and between it and the plane ends of the con
taining vessel of such relative amounts as to cause the inter
face between rotational and irrotational fluid to meet the end
planes at right angles. Let the amount of this Laplacian
attraction be exceedingly small—so small, for example, that
 the work required to stretch the surface of the primitive
 vortex column to a million million times its area is small in
 comparison with the energy of the given fluid motion.
 Everything will go on as described in §§ 17, 18 if, instead of
 “run out into fine laminae of liquid” (§ 17, line 31) we sub
 stitute break off into millions of detached fine vortex columns;
 and instead of “sponge” (passim) we substitute “spin
 drift.”
    20. The solution of minimum energy for given vorticity
 and given moment of momentum (though clearly not unique,
 but infinitely multiplex, because magnitudes and orders of
 breaking-off of the millions of constituent columns of the
 spindrift may be infinitely varied) is fully determinate as to
 the exact position of each column relatively to the others; and
 the cloud of spindrift revolves as if its constituent columns
 were rigidly connected. The viscously elastic containing
 vessel, each time it is left to itself, as described in §§ 17, 18,
 flies round with the same angular velocity as the spindrift
 cloud within; and so the whole motion goes on stably, without
 loss of energy, until the containing vessel is again stopped or
 otherwise tampered with.
    21. It might be imagined that the Laplacian attraction
 would cause our slender vortex columns to break into detached
 drops (as it does in the well-known case of a fine circular jet
  of water shooting vertically downwards from a circular tube,
  and would do for a circular column of water given at rest in
  a region undisturbed by gravity), but it could not, because the
  energy of the irrotational circulation of the fluid round the
  vortex column must be infinite before the column could
  break in any place. The Laplacian attraction might, how
  ever, make the cylindric form unstable; but we are excluded

from all such considerations at present by our limitation (§ 12)
to two-dimensional motion.
    22. Annul now the Laplacian attraction and return to our
purely adynamic system of incompressible fluid acted on only
by pressure at its bounding surface, and by mutual pressure
between its parts, but by no “applied force” through its
interior. For any given momentum between the extreme
possible values r&b”(a”-3b*) and 37th b', there is clearly,
besides the §§ 17, 18 solution (minimum energy), another
determinate circular solution, viz. the configuration of circular
motion, of which the energy is greater than that of any other
circular motion of same vorticity and same moment of
momentum. This solution clearly is found by dividing the
vortex into two parts—one a circular central column, and the
other a circular cylindric shell lining the containing vessel;
the ratio of one part to the other being determined by the con
dition that the total moment of momentum have the prescribed
value. But this solution (as said above, § 14 and footnote)
" be proved to be unstable.
      hope to return to this case, among other illustrations of
instability of fluid motion—a subject demanding serious con
sideration and investigation, not only by purely scientific
 coercion, but because of its large practical importance.
    23. For the present I conclude with the complete solution,
 or practical realization of the solution (only found within the
 last few days, and after §§ 10–18 of the present article were
 already in type) of a problem on which I first commenced trials
 in 1868: to make the energy an absolute mavimum in two
 dimensional motion with given moment of momentum and given
 vorticity in a cylindric canister of given shape. The solution is,
 in its terms, essentially unique; “absolute maximum” mean
 ing the greatest of maximums. But the same investigation
 includes the more extensive problem: To find, of the sets of
 solutions indicated in § 12, different configurations of the
 motion having the same moment of momentum. For each
 of these the energy is a maximum, but not the greatest
 mavimum, for the given moment of momentum, The most
 interesting feature of the practical realization to which I have
 now attained is the continuous transition from any one steady
 or periodic solution, through a series of steady or periodic
 solutions, to any other steady or periodic solution, produced by
a simple mode of operation easily understood, and always under
 perfect control. The operating instrument is merely a stirrer,
 a thin round column, or rod, fitted perpendicularly between
 the two end plates, and movable at pleasure to any position

    24. Commence with the vortex lining uniformly the en
closing cylinder, and the stirrer in the centre of the still
water within the vortex. The velocity of the water in the
vortex increases from zero at the inside to £5"/a at the out
side, in contact with the boundary; according to the notation
of §§ 14 and 15. Now move the stirrer very slowly from its
central position and carry it round with any uniform angular
velocity <&b/a and > ##!/a. A dimple, as shown in fig. 6,
will be produced, running round a little in advance of the
stirrer, but ultimately falling back to be more and more nearly
abreast of it if the stirrer is carried uniformly. If now the
stirrer is gradually slowed till the dimple gets again in advance
of it as in fig. 6, and is then carried round in a similar relative
station, or always a little behind the radius through the middle
 of the dimple, the angular velocity of the dimple will decrease
 gradually and its depth and its concave curvature will increase;
till, when the angular velocity is ##!/a, the dimple reaches the

angle, as shown in fig. 7, and the angular velocity of propa
 gation becomes ##!/a.
    25. The primitively endless vortex belt now becomes divided
at the right angle, and the two acquired ends become rounded;
provided the stirrer be carried round always a little rearward,
or considerably rearward, of abreast the middle of the gap.
Figs. 8 and 9 show the result of continuing the process till
ultimately the vortex becomes central and circular (with only
the infinitesimal disturbance due to the presence of the stirrer,
with which we need not trouble ourselves at present).
    26. Suppose, now, at any stage of the process, after the for
mation of the gap, the stirrer to be carried forward to a station
somewhat in advance of abreast of the middle of the gap; or
somewhat rearward of the rear of the vortex (instead of some
what in advance of the front as shown in fig. 8). The velocity
of propagation will be augmented (by rearward pull!), the
moment of momentum will be diminished: the vortex train
will be elongated till its front reaches round to its rear, each
then sharpened to 45° and brought into absolute contact with
the enclosing wall: the front and rear unite in a dimple
gradually becoming less; and the process may be continued
till we end as we began, with the vortex lining the inside of
the wall uniformly, and the stirrer at rest in the middle of
the central still-water.

  LXII. On the Variations in the Electrical Resistance of Anti
      mony and Cobalt in a Magnetic Field.            By Dr. G. FAk,
      Assistant in the Physical Institute of the Royal University of
       Padua".
  IN ina series     of researches, still in progress, on the variations
              the electrical resistance of different bodies when
 brought into a magnetic field, I arrived at some results with
  antimony and cobalt which I believe to be new and interesting.
  Reserving for a future occasion a fuller account of my inves
 tigations and also of the methods and instruments employed,
 I think it may not be useless to publish a preliminary notice.
      It is well known, particularly from the experiments of Sir
 W. Thomson and M. A. Righi, that magnetism has a distinct
 influence on the electrical resistance of iron and nickel, and
 much more upon that of bismuthf. Looking at the coeffi
 cients of rotation found by Hall, Righi, and others, and at the
 explanations given, the : suggests itself that a connexion
 may exist between these coefficients and the variation of the
 electrical resistance in a magnetic field. On the other hand,
 the difference in the behaviour of iron and bismuth in a mag
 netic field seems to be connected with the fact that the first of
 these two metals is paramagnetic and the second diamagnetic.
 From these considerations and from others, which I shall not
 now enter upon, I have undertaken to examine various sub
 stances. The results of my experiments agree with my
previsions.
      First of all I thought that cobalt and antimony would in par
ticular be worthy of investigationi. Cobalt, as is well known,
 occupies the third place in the list of paramagnetic metals,
 whilst antimony is found immediately after bismuth in the
list of diamagnetic metals.
      I have examined antimony in the form of very small cylin
ders, which I prepared by melting the metal in a crucible
and drawing it into thin glass tubes. The glass was after
wards broken and taken away by alternately cooling and
heating. Two thick wires of copper were soldered in the
ends of the cylinders in order to connect them up in the elec
trical circuit.      As I shall describe on another occasion the
    * Communicated by the Author.
  ...t From experiments repeated by myself, I have obtained results agree
ing with those of Sir W. Thomson for nickel and with those of M. Righi
for bismuth.
    j And manganese also; but I have not yet been able to get it pure and
in a convenient form.

         Electrical Resistance of Antimony and Cobalt.        541
method of measurement employed by me, I will only observe
that it was like that of Matthiessen and Hockin, with the
exception of some modifications suggested by the special cir
cumstances and object of my investigation. The magnetic
field was formed by a large Ruhmkorff electromagnet, ex
cited by a number of Bunsen's elements or by a dynamo
machine.
   My experiments on antimony showed that, when brought
into a magnetic field, there was an increase in its electrical
resistance, both across and along the lines of force. It ap
peared to me moreover that, with the same intensity of '.
magnetic field, the increase across was greater than that along
the lines of force.
   Cobalt I investigated in the form of a small thin plate, pre
pared by electrolysis of the chloride, or by depositing the metal
on a plate consisting of a mixture of graphite and stearine, as
indicated by M. Righi". I soldered two thick copper wires
at the two ends of this small plate of cobalt, before detaching
it from the plate of graphite and stearine. These wires were
rigidly connected by means of a piece of ebonite, and served
to make the connexions in the circuit. By a movable support
I could very easily adjust the small plate in any position in
respect to the lines of force. By a long series of observations
I found that:—
   (a) When the plate of cobalt was arranged in the magnetic
field with its plane perpendicular to the lines of force, a dimi
nution of its electrical resistance was observed.
   (b) When the plate was arranged parallel to the lines of force,
and the current also had the same     £ an increase in its
electrical resistance was observed.
   Judging therefore from the intensity of the effects, the
behaviour of antimony is the same as that found by M.
Righi for bismuth; and the behaviour of cobalt the same as
that found by Sir W. Thomson for iron and nickel.
   I will not dwell on similar experiments on other substances,
because the results are not yet definitive.
   In the meantime I must express my obligations to Prof.
Righi for his encouragement in these experiments, and for
also giving me the means of making them in the Physical
Institute under his direction.

    CURIOUS CONSEQUENCES OF A WELL-KNOWN DYNAMICAL
    THEOREM. BY G. JOHNSTONE STONEY, M.A., D.S.C., F.R.S.*
TH: is a well-known theorem in the science of Dynamics, re
      lating to a system of bodies in motion, which may act on each
other, but are not acted on by any external force. The theorem
in question is, that if at any instant the velocities of the several
bodies of the system be reversed, without any other change being
made (i.e. without altering either their masses or the laws accord
ing to which they attract or otherwise act on one another), then
will all the bodies of the system retrace their steps, traversing in
the reverse direction the same paths which they had previously
described, and in such manner that any position through which
any one of these bodies had passed in its onward progress, at a
certain time before the reversal, will be repassed with the same
velocity, but in the opposite direction, at the same interval of time
after the reversal.
   Now, if we regard the universe as a dynamical system, it is
exactly such a dynamical system as this theorem presupposes.
Its several parts act on one another, but are not subjected to any
other forces. And it is of interest to study what would be the
result if such a reversal as the theorem supposes were to take place
throughout the whole universe. We must, of course, suppose that
the reversal affects all the motions of the universe, not only its
molar motions, but its molecular motions also; and not only the
motions of its ponderable matter, but also the motions of the aether.
   In order to be in a position to study the effects, let us first
suppose that we are spectators of this far-reaching change, without
being ourselves affected by it—that we are, from an intellectual
standpoint, as it were outside the great system whose future
history we want to trace, simply observing everything that takes
place, and not in any way interfering with it, nor ourselves in any
way transformed by the change.
   To such a spectator the past history of the universe would
repeat itself in reverse order, and many of the conditions under
which it would do so would appear to him very strange. The
bird which was shot to-day by the sportsman, and which is now
lying in his kitchen, will, if the reversal of the universe were to
take place at this instant, be restored by the keeper to the game
bag, will be carried by him, walking backwards, to the place
where the pointer had fetched it in, where he will take it out, and
lay it on the ground. Thence the dog will lift it in his mouth,
and, trotting backwards, will reach the spot where the bird fell,
 where, however, it will now rise to the height at which it was shot,
from which it will fly away backwards unharmed. Meanwhile,
the vapours into which the powder had been dissipated will stream
back into the barrel of the fowling-piece, and condense themselves

again into gunpowder, while the grains of shot will rush towards
the muzzle of the gun, and crowd into its breach.
   It is of importance to observe that, under the new conditions
of the universe, all true dynamical laws will remain the same as at
present, but many quasi-dynamical laws will be reversed. Thus,
the first law of thermodynamics—the law of the equivalence of
energy—will remain unaltered, but the second law will become its
converse. Instead of a warmer body tending to impart heat to a
cooler body, as at present, the new condition of things will tend to
make their temperatures more divergent. Heat will become
mechanical energy directly, and without requiring the accom
panying degradation of energy which now takes place. Friction,
instead of retarding the progress of bodies, will help them forward.
The air, instead of impeding a missile passing through it, will
urge it on. And, when reviewing a system so divergent from
what we find in the actual universe about us, it is very instructive
to bear in mind that the universe, under the new conditions that we
suppose, would be as perfect a dynamical system as the actual universe
is. This places before the mind in a very strong light the grave
error which is too often made when such laws as I have referred
to—the second law of thermodynamics, &c.—are supposed to be
true dynamical laws.
    This naturally leads up to the consideration whether the laws
 of causation would be affected. Those relating to true causes
 would not be affected: those relating to quasi-causes would all be
 inverted. True causes never precede their effects; they are always
 strictly simultaneous with them. The science of Dynamics recog
 nizes true causes only. All change of the motion of a body is in
 that science attributed to forces acting while the change is taking
 place; and the persistence of a body in motion while no forces are
 acting on it is due to the inertia of the body, i.e. the body itself is
 the cause of it. It is because the inertia of a body is a sufficient
cause for its continuing in motion that time can elapse between
events in nature. Whether the motion changes or does not
change, the effect and its true cause are accurately simultaneous.
 The dispute as to whether action takes place at a distance does not
disturb this statement. Every one who does not suppose that the
 sun attracts the earth from a distance and without lapse of time,
supposes that some medium pervading the intervening space com
municates the action; and it is not the distant body, but the sur
 face of this medium where it touches the body acted on, that upon
 this view can alone be recognized in the science of Dynamics as the
true immediate cause of the changes of motion of the second body.
 Thus, in all cases, dynamical effects arise along with, and not
 after, their causes. But in popular language, and indeed in all
 but very carefully strict language, many events are spoken of as
caused by events that have preceded them. Thus, in the usual
loose way of talking, we may speak of a ball's having been re
 acted on by the ground as the cause why it is now ascending,
although a moment's reflection would show that, in strict lan
guage, the reaction of the ground has caused only those changes

of motion that occurred while the ground was pressing against the
ball, and that the ball's afterwards continuing to ascend is due to
its inertia. Sometimes the two classes of causes are distinguished
as immediate and remote. Now the change which we have sup
posed the universe to undergo would in no way affect immediate,
that is true, causes; but all that we now recognise as an antecedent
or quasi-cause would, to the spectator looking on at the universe
from without, be changed into the effect, and that which is now
the effect would to his apprehension occur first and become the
CauSe.
   These seem the first lessons which the study we have entered
upon impresses upon us. But it is capable of giving further in
struction. Hitherto we have supposed the altered universe looked
at by a spectator who was himself unaffected by the change. But
 we are all ourselves parts of this universe, and the series of
thoughts that occur in our minds are quite as much events that
happen in the universe as the motions we see around us. Such a
reversal of all the velocities of the universe as I have supposed, if
it really took place, would affect us and the motions in our brains
as well as everything else in the universe; and we have now to
consider what the effect of this would be, and how it would modify
our observation of what is going on around us. From the instant
of the supposed reversal, the thoughts which had occupied our
minds previous to it will recur, repeating themselves backwards,
just like every other event in the universe. The memory of
 having eaten our breakfast will present itself first; the sensation
that we are eating it will come on afterwards: at least this is the
order in which we must as yet describe these thoughts in our mind
 as occurring; it is the order in which they would appear to that
outsider whom we before supposed to be surveying the universe.
But the relation of the one thought to the other in our own mind
—of the memory to the sensations remembered—will be after the re
 versal exactly the same* as it was when these same thoughts occurred
before in their right order. Now, TIME IS ONLY AN ABSTRACT TERM
 REFERRING TO ALL SUCH RELATIONS, just as mankind is an abstract
 term referring to the individuals that are men. And just as it is
individual men who have a real existence, and not mankind in the
abstract, so is it the individual time-relations occurring between
real thoughts or real events that have a real existence, and not
time itself, which is a mere word.       But as we have found that the
time-relations between our thoughts after the supposed reversal
are absolutely the same as the time-relations between these same
thoughts when they occurred before the reversal, then to us, if we
 share in the reversal, our thoughts and the events in the world
 about us will seem to occur in the same order of time as they did
before the reversal, and the moment of reversal will in both cases
appear to us to occur last in point of time. In other words, our sup
   * In fact, the time-relation between the two states of mind amounts to
this, that a      of the one state of mind is a memory of the whole, or of
a part, of the other state of mind; and this is equally the case after as
before the reversal.

position of the reversal of all the motions of the universe, when it
embraces the whole universe, ourselves included, does not really
involve a repetition of the events in reverse order, but only a
second way of reviewing the past history of the world.
    These considerations do not seem altogether unfruitful. They
emphasize the distinction between true and quasi-dynamical laws,
they clear our thoughts with reference to the relation of cause and
effect, and, above all, they help to dispel from our minds the
prevalent error that time has an existence in itself independently
of the particular time-relations that prevail between the thoughts
that really occupy our mind, or between events" that actually occur
in the universe about us, or between those events and our thoughts.
In reality the aggregate of these individual time-relations is the
whole of what exists in nature as a background for our conceptions
about time.
          ON THE GASEOUS AND LIQUID STATES OF MATTER.
       To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
    As a paper recently published by Wroblewski (Wiener Monatsheft
für Chemie, 1886, p. 383) is at present being abstracted into other
Journals, and as we dissent from every one of his conclusions on
the ground that they have no foundation on facts, we beg for per
 mission to point out the difference between our views and those
expressed in his paper.
    1. Wroblewski states that lines of equal density (isopyknics)
 ought never to cut one another. On the contrary, they have been
 frequently proved experimentally to cut one another during the
 phenomena of superheated liquid, or “boiling with bumping,” and
 “supersaturated vapour.”
    2. The data have been calculated by means of Sarrau's equation,
 which, although approximately expressing the results, is certainly
 not true; for the isopyknics should be straight, and not curved.
 This has been pointed out by Amagat and by ourselves for the
gaseous state, and by ourselves for the liquid state.
    3. The vapour-pressure curve is not continuous with the curve
 expressing the lowest values of p.v, and can hardly be said to be
 identical with it below the critical point, as the vapour-pressure
 curve is independent of volume. We have shown that the mini
 mum values of p.v lie on the nearly vertical portions of the serpen
 tine isothermal lines denoting continuous change from the liquid to
 the gaseous state.
    4. Sarrau's equation, rigorously applied, involves intersection of
 the isopyknic lines; and the author discards it on that account
 where it no longer bears out his conclusions. We accept Sarrau's
 equation as a close approximation to the truth, although not rigo
 rously true, and, as such, believe that it correctly represents at any
 rate the general form of the isothermal curves.
    * Thoughts in other people's minds are some of the events that occur
  in the universe about us; that is, in the rest of the universe, excluding
  ourselves.

548          Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
   5. Wroblewski states that the isopyknics, on approaching the
vapour-pressure curve, form a bundle of curves parallel to the
vapour-pressure curve. We have already pointed out that facts
contradict this view.
   6. Wroblewski restates a view, propounded by one of us in
the Proc. Roy. Soc. xxx. p. 323. This view must, in consequence
of our more accurate and recent researches, be abandoned.        The
distinction between liquid and gas above the critical point is wholly
illusory; and we believe that such distinction would also disappear
below the critical point, were it possible to follow experimentally
the continuous change from liquid to gas.
   7. Wroblewski also asserts that heat is required to convert liquid
into gas at the critical temperature. We have only to refer to our
published papers on the thermal properties of alcohol and ether
(Trans. Roy. Soc. 1886, part i. plate 5, and 1887, part i. plate 5)
to disprove this assertion. Moreover all our experimental obser
vations tend to show that no abrupt change of state occurs at any
point on the isothermal; in fact that heat of vaporization vanishes,
its place being taken by heat due to compression or expansion.
   8. Andrews does not make the statement attributed to him by
Wroblewski, but gives a qualified definition of the words “liquid”
and “gas.”
   It will thus be seen that our results contradict Wroblewski's
views in every particular; and that there is no reason to reject the
views of Dr. Andrews as regards the liquid and gaseous states.
                       We are, Gentlemen,
                                      Your obedient servants,

   LECTURE EXPERIMENTS ON THE CONDUCTIVITY OF SOUND.
                           BY M. HESEHUS.
   Rods of the size of an ordinary pencil are prepared of steel,
glass, wood, guttapercha, cork, and caoutchouc. They are con
nected in threes by means of a caoutchouc rod, tubes of the same
material being interposed between them. The rous are held in
one hand, with their lower ends on a sounding-box, and the free
ends are successively touched by the stem of a vibrating tuning
fork, which is held in the other hand. The sound is not perceptible
when the caoutchouc rod is touched, but it becomes more so as the
other rods are successively touched. It can thus be shown that the
intensity remains constant, if one rod is replaced by another of the
same material, but the dimensions of which vary in the same pro
£          By varying the length alone the intensity is changed; in
 ike manner it is changed also by varying the section while the
length is constant. The method is sufficiently sensitive to show
the difference between the conductivity of wood parallel and per
pendicular to the fibres, and even to determine the numerical ratio
of these conductivities.—Journal de Physique, April 1887.
