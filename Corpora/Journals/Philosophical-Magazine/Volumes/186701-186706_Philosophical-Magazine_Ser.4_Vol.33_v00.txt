    theory respecting  it.
                                               I.
    According to Berzeliusf, the first definite opinion on the sub
ject of isomerism was that of Stromeyer, who expressed              in                 it
 these terms — " The difference between ignited phosphoric acid
                 :
 and that which has been long in solution does not consist in                               a

     the dissimilar manner in which the elements are united with
    by
each other, and the unequal degree of condensation they thereby
undergo."     Before the enunciation of this view (which       will be        it
perceived     essentially mechanical) Berzelius himself had made

2                   Dr. E. J. Mills    on Isomerism.
but not as certainly offering true instances of isomerism.             The
illustrious writer, with his usual caution, was willing to classify,
but no doubt thought it too early to speculate.
    Dumas, however, in the course of the next year published a
formal essay*, having been led to do so on account of Robiquet's
opinion as to the identity of chlorine, bromine, and iodine, and
also from the discovery by Wohler of the artificial formation of
urea.     He states at the outset his inability to conceive the mo
lecules of matter assorted at random (disposSes au hasard) in a
 definite organic combination ; the harmony of their arrangement
 can, it appears to him, be foreseen from analogy and demon
 strated by experiment.     His previous study of the ethers, indeed,
 enables him to arrive at a conclusion which he thus states :—
 " Nearly all the combinations of organic nature contain carbon
 in two conditions. To take the simplest case, that of a compound
 analogous to an ordinary salt, we find an oxygenated carbon
 acid united to a carbide of hydrogen.          The carbon, then, is at
 once positive in the acid and negative in the base
                                                               " (p.
                                                                     329) .
 Shortly after he remarks,    "          organic isomers can easily be
 conceived to exist.    Those which have the same atomic weight
 are produced, I consider, by different binary combinations.             In
 those which have different atomic weights we see the same com
 binations more or less condensed " (p. 331). Isomerism, how
 ever, is a very general and also a gradual phenomenon.              " Iso
 merism    .... appears capable of affecting all bodies more or less
 profoundly" (p. 332).       And again,      "If  we conceive any sub
 stance possessed of a certain molecular arrangement which can
 be permanently modified, we shall thereby be able to impress
 upon it more or less profound isomeric modifications" (p. 332).
 The various degrees of intensity of these modifications are de
 tailed. Thus the commencement of isomerism consists in changes
 of hardness, cohesion, crystalline form, &c, the chemical proper
 ties remaining the same; as in the two kinds of sulphur.                 If
 this molecular movement continue, the chemical properties will
 alter, but the atomic weight remain unchanged.              At this stage
 the molecular groups have undergone an essential alteration.
 Lastly, the atomic weight is disturbed — either from the atom
 admitting a greater number of elementary atoms, or from an ob
 vious shifting in the arrangement of binary compounds.                 All
 combinations    are assumed to be of binary constitution — this
being supposed demonstrable in voltaic decompositions, as well
as in those brought about by other physical and chemical means.
The essay concludes with an attempt to prove, from certain rela
tions among their atomic weights, that the elements themselves
offer instances of isomerism.        It appears evident that Dumas
              * Ann. de Chim.  et de Phys. vol. xlvii. p. 324.

                          Dr. E.   J.   Mills   on Isomerism.                            3
considered   molecular movement, whereby one arrangement was
substituted for another (the German Umlagerung), to be the true
key to isomerism.    He supposed that difference of condensation
was sufficient to account for what Berzelius afterwards called
" polymers."
   The great Swedish chemist, again returning to the subject*,
defines isomers, with less restriction, as substances having the
same composition but different properties.   The second of a pair
of analogous isomers has the prefix irapa, as in the case of the
tartaric acids, the stannic oxides, the phosphoric acids, cyanic
and cyanuric acid. When a great difference in chemical proper
ties is observed, such as exists between urea and ammonic cya-
nate, the adjective metaphoric is to be used instead of the prefix
irapa.    The phenomena themselves are thus originated : — "                            If
we allow ourselves to form hypothetical speculations on such a
relation, it will appear that the simple atoms of which a sub
stance is composed are capable of union with each other after a
different fashion."    In the year following-)-, Berzelius reviewed
Dumas's essay       supra), and condemned speculations on the iso
                    (v.
merism of the elements, as being devoid of data       some addition
                                                                 ;
was also made to the existing nomenclature.         Isomerism now
refers, as at first, to the same absolute and relative                   number of
atoms.    Those bodies in which the absolute number                    is   different,
but the relative number the same, we, polymeric.                        Metameric
substances are those which can be transformed into                       each other
without loss of weight — as cyanic acid and cyanuric                     acid, stan
nous sulphate (Sn        and stannic sulphite (Sn S), supposing
                            S)
the last to exist.    [It will be seen that polymers might be
metamers in the Berzelian sense.     The use of formulae to show
metameric difference     also noteworthy.]
                             is
    The next important allusion to isomerism occurs in Dumas's
Lecons sur     Philosophic Chimique%.
               la                        There we first find the
differences in physical properties separated from the chemical
differences and classed under one name, polymorphism.     By this
term was meant, " on the one hand, the permanence of chemical
nature  ; and on the other, the modifications which form or phy
sical properties undergo" (p. 303).        And further, "the ulti
mate source of polymorphism          the variations in arrangement
                                            is

His definition of isomerism includes metamerism and polymerism

isomerism have become somewhat more precise : " . . . . modify
the effects of cohesion in a substance, and the variations will
belong to polymorphism.        Modify the effects of affinity, and
     will         a case of isomerism

you       produce                            317).
   Four years afterwards*, Berzelius, always unwilling to rank
elements with compounds, invented the word allotropy as apply
ing to the apparent isomerism &c. of the former. At the same
time he expresses his opinion that such phenomena arise from
differences in the situation {Lage) of atoms.
    Lowig seems to assign to atomic volume an important share
in the formation of isomers.     "         the difference between
the properties of radicals depends on the different grouping of
the atoms, and on their different atomic volumes                     "f.
    At a period considerably nearer to our own time Kekule gave
this subject a special treatment %.    He retained the strict and
primitive sense of the word isomerism ; restricted the application
of the term " metameric " to bodies of the same molecular weight,
and whose differences could be shown by means of rational for
mula?; and established a new class of "isomers in the inner
sense," that        is,
                substances whose chemical differences were as yet
unexplained.    A distinct place was assigned to physical isomers.
   Berthelot,      his Chimie Organique fondee sur
                     in                                  Synthese§,   la
defined isomers as bodies formed of " the same elements united
in  the same proportion as regards weight" (p. 658). Chemical
isomerism      is
               recognized           by
                              its permanence after      given sub     a
stance has entered and left    combination. Physical isomerism
                                        a
is only transitory. The former has     fourfold division, under the
                                                    a
following    titles (pp. 659, 660) — (1) equivalent composition,
                                                :
the same as the "metaphoricism" of Berzelius; (2) metamerism                      ;

posed new division.       The cause of all these various relations ap

                     Dr. E.      J.   Mills    on Isomerism.                     r,
plished.   The author does not think it likely that in alanine,
sarkosine, and lactamide there is any difference between the car
bon, hydrogen, or oxygen as individually considered.    He recog
nized, however, the insufficiency of rational formulae to meet
the case.
   This deficiency in existing formulae was observed by Butlerow,
who altered, or rather extended the current doctrine of atomici
ties, equivalencies, or affinities in a manner which was supposed
to satisfy every requirement.       He says*, "It is necessary to
distinguish the quantity of affinity from its intensity — that
is,  the smaller or greater energy with which              tends to be
                                                                 it
come active.      This intensity varies as various substances act on
the body, and depends on the conditions under which the action
occurs.     It appears also that       part of the affinity of polyato
                                          if
                                           a
mic elements, and especially of carbon, has been combined, all
the other conditions remaining the same, the residual free affi
nity exhibits another degree of intensity                 In this man
ner we are led to distinguish primary, secondary, Sec. affinity."
In the same journal Kekule* also advertsf to the inefficiency of
typical formulae.     He considers that the nature of the hydrogen
in certain organic bodies depends on the oxygen               combinedit   is
with. More generally             the other elements which constitute
                                it   is
the " chemical nature of the place " occupied                    by
                                                         the remaining
element.      This view appears to be the same, substantially, as
that of Butlerow.
    Similar notions were also entertained               by
                                                 Erlenmeyerf. Speak
ing   of such  compounds    as  ammonia   and  carbonic  oxide, he says,
" The possibility of their existence can be explained, according
to my view, only on the assumption that the different affinities of
polyatomic elements are not all endowed with an equal propen
sity to combine with        given element.
                            a                 On the contrary, many
facts seem to show that the atoms of one and the same element,
 when attached       bydifferent affinities of     polyatomic element,
                                                         a
may exercise different chemical functions" (p. 30). And again,
" Supported     byfacts now known to us,      believe   may venture

atoms of hydrogen are possessed of an absolutely equal capability

doctrine of primary, secondary, &c. affinities (p. 300) . Berthelot

has since published a special work on isomerism*.     The facts of
which he discourses are thus explained at the outset.     " There
are three predominating principles in chemistry  —  the nature of
the elements, their relative proportion, and their arrangement.
We are about to consider but one of these — to inquire what may
occur if we suppose the same elements combined in the same
proportions, their relative arrangement only being made to vary.
This is the problem of isomerism" (p. 5).              "I
                                              call isomeric bodies
those which are formed of the same elements united in the same
proportions, but presenting different properties, a proof of a dif
ferent arrangement" (p. 5).      Simple and compound substances
are included in his definition.      Physical isomerism has to do
 with purely physical causes; magnetized and unmagnetized iron
are instances of it.    " Generally the transformation of a body
into an isomer gives rise to a calorific phenomenon — that        to is,   a
disengagement or absorption of heat" (p. 15).         The classifica
tion given  is substantially the same as his previous one only   ;         a
fifth division    made (kenomerism)
                 is                     to include "bodies formed
by  the elimination of different or identical elements, at the ex
pense of distinct compounds" — as when glycol losing water, and
ethylic alcohol losing hydrogen, produce ethylenic oxide and alde
hyde respectively.    The allotropy of the elements         discussed
                                                            is
at considerable length    ;and the author expresses his belief in
the doctrine of the fundamental    unity of matter, — conclusion,

indeed, common to several writers on isomerism, and which may
be said to have descended to us from the earliest times of philo
sophical speculation.    Berthelot's treatise   not characterized
                                                    is                     by

                 f
in units of affinity, and finds that there   nothing absurd in the

theory itself, but that Butlerow's special mode of treatment leads
to contradictory results.    He gives the name " absolute " isomers
to those of which rational formulae furnish no account.         The
molecules of several isomers are graphically represented, this
special notation being fundamentally that of Dalton, to which

unanimous voice chemists have explained isomerism on the prin
ciples of the atomic theory.      At first, indeed, it was only natural
that the phenomenon should have been considered due to the
possibility of arranging a given number of atoms in many differ
ent ways ; for the well-known views of Higgins and Dalton con
 stituted at that time the creed of chemistry, and were referred
 to on every occasion of importance.          Nevertheless it was not
found necessary in most cases to appeal to ultimate atoms ; it
sufficed to group these into compound radicals, which should
equally admit of differences in arrangement, and which should
be numerous enough to cover the existing variations in a given
group. This doctrine, however, intimately connected as it was
with the employment of rational (and afterwards of typical) for
mulae, was inapplicable to all cases of isomerism,           even when
physical instances had been removed from the category.             Such
a defect was keenly felt on all sides ; and there can be no doubt
that the subsidiary theory of atomicities, modified as it has been
by Erlenmeyer, Butlerow, and others, has met with a very sin
cere and hearty welcome.
                                   II.
     If we assume the existence of atoms and the possibility of
 disposing them in many different ways, it nevertheless does not
 follow that isomeric bodies should exist.         For the action of a
 group of atoms would be a resultant effect, which no- change in
arrangement could vary.        Hence a group of atoms, however ar
ranged, ought to behave     in a constant manner on the application
of any force, such as heat, electricity, or chemical energy.
    The theory of atomicities is still less satisfactory.     One atom
of carbon combines with four of hydrogen and no more.               It is
then said to be saturated, and its four atomicities (or units of affi
nity) to be neutralized by the four which appertain to the four
atoms of hydrogen.       Each unit of atomicity, therefore, implies
a unit of force ; for saturation and neutralization involve the ex
ertion of force.    But how can such a view be maintained in pre
sence of the known facts relative to the heat of chemical action ?
Yet the consideration of force seems to enter into the doctrine of
atomicity, in an obscure and uncertain fashion, even where such
an idea has been disclaimed.        If, on the other hand, force be
excluded from the question, then we are told no more than for
mulae tell us already.     Now it is inexpedient to account for the
existence  of isomeric  substances   on the supposition of an altera
tion in the value of one of the atomicities of an atom, when we
are not even assured of the meaning of the term
                                                           " atomicity "
itself.
    There is no better evidence of the weakness of        a theory  than

the necessity of continual support from fresh subordinate theo
ries. The theory of atomicities, as usually accepted, failed to
account for such a pair of combinations as

                                                     was promulgated as sol
ving the difficulty.              On the other hand, the precisely analogous

has been explained on the principle of self- saturation (in the
carbon) .   Such methods of treatment, however admirable from
an sesthetical point of view, can hardly be said to present logical
 grounds for acceptance.
    The various phases of the theory of isomerism cannot be con
templated with satisfaction by those philosophers who do not
hold atomic views.         It has indeed been urged that there is no
 proof   of  the   existence    of atoms*, that the entire analogy of
nature    is against   a doctrine  of indivisibles, that an absolute limit
of any kind is inconceivable and beset with contradictions which
cannot be resolvedf.         Means, however, exist for the formation
of a theory which is not embarrassed by corpuscular notions ;
and early writers on isomerism would doubtless have availed
themselves of these means had not the popular scientific mate
rialism led them to mistake the true nature of the problem. For
the question relates to force %, not to matter ; and to that par
ticular aspect of force of which the theory of polarity takes cog
nizance.      The polar doctrine, enunciated in its most primitive
and philosophical form by Herakleitus§, has not been allowed
to fall into obscurity by modern authors.          It has been expounded
in the concrete chemical sense by Davy AvogadroU, Berzelius,     ||,

many instances.     Thus, for example, one-sixth of the hydrogen
in hydric lactate is easily replaced by positive, and another sixth
by negative radicals.     If, by an artifice, replacing radicals of an
opposite sign are introduced*, an isomeric series of compounds
is originated.   The same is true of hydric glycollate. Again,
the nitryl in a-nitraniline differs from that in /3-nitraniline ; and
dinitromethylenic chloride contains at once nitryle in two con-
ditionst.    Toluol, when acted on by chlorine in the cold, pro
duces ehlorotoluol   J; but when chlorine is passed through boil
ing toluol, benzylic chloride is the result§,      It can scarcely be
doubted that the function of chlorine is different in these two
compounds.      In addition to the difference indicated by the
names just assigned to them, they yield opposite products on
oxidation, — ehlorotoluol furnishing hydric chlorodracylate, while
benzylic chloride gives hydric benzoate arid hydric chloride J. The
chlorine in both bodies is combined with the same quantities of
carbon and hydrogen ; and though these latter elements doubt
less have an influence on the behaviour of the chlorine, there
seems to be no escape from the conclusion       that the different
relations which it exhibits in the two cases constitute a separate
and distinguishable phenomenon.        If it be alleged that this
oppositeness is not due to the chlorine, but solely to the radicals
with which it is respectively combined, then it follows that these
radicals are themselves endowed with permanently opposite
functions, thus equally establishing the doctrine of fixed induc
tive effect for which I contend.       Similar instances to those
already cited will readily present themselves to the mind of every
chemist.
   It will   be easily perceivedthat the possibility of inducing a
permanent difference in radicals affords us a means of account
ing for all the isomers at present existing, and of foreseeing the
formation of many more. The explanation applies obviously to
metamers ; for in them different quantities of a given element
or elements are counted under opposite functions.         It is appli
cable also to polymers; for they are only particular cases of che
mical combination      and therefore also liable to the manifesta
                      ||,
tion of permanent induced difference.      And so far as the various
allotropic forms of the elements shall prove analogous to ordi
nary isomers and polymers, so far,          may be presumed, the
                                                it
same explanation will apply to them.      Physical isomerism ought
not to be placed apart from chemical isomerism.       Differences of
solubility, fusion-point, action on polarized light, &c. are phases

         To   the    Editors   of   the   Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
          Gentlemen,

               of pursuing the question, which Captain Clarke and
I have been discussing, " elsewhere," — my meaning being that                              I
should not only demonstrate the formulae for calculating the axes of
the earth on my improved method, but should apply them           re                   by
ducing them to numbers; and as the paper completely worked out
would occupy too much of your space,      should endeavour to have

                 one of our scientific societies.   have, however,    I
in vain sought for the leisure to do as wished, and the desired
                                                        I
leisure appears to be further from me than ever.       must there     I
fore abandon my project of entering into numerical calculations,
and satisfy myself with demonstrating the formulas which                                   I
think should be used in applying geodetic data to the determi
nation of the earth's mean figure. This demonstration, which                               I
wrote out during     recent voyage, will not,

subject.
   2. It    clear that, as Bessel's method of applying the principle
               is
of least squares to the problem altogether ignores the effect of
local attraction at the reference-station of the arc, the method

must be defective, as the omission of local attraction may intro
duce an error of serious importance.   In a communication to the
                                            '
Royal Society, which was printed in the Proceedings,' No. 64,
I  proposed a means of rectifying this.       But in so doing I,
knowingly, left out of account another source of error, because                 I
did not then know how to take account of both, and that which
I omitted in my method appeared to be of much inferior im
portance to that overlooked by Bessel.      The method      am now     I
going to give and work out into formula, as it seems to me,
solves the problem entirely ; that        is,
                                          leads to formulae for the
                                                it
axes, taking into account the effect of local attraction, and over
looks no source of error.

fixed, there is only one variable quantity, viz. the distance of a
from /; on this the other distances depend.        The condition that
the sum of the squares should be a minimum leads to this other
condition, that the algebraical sum of the distances of a, b, c, d
from I, m, n, r should equal zero.      This will give the value of (a,

the measured arc A B C D.

the points on the mean ellipse at which the normals are parallel

alternative method, that of Bessel, leads to numerical results and
involves no unknown quantities in its results, but is not on
that account to be relied upon, as it neglects errors depending
upon local attraction which may rise to very great importance.

has been frequently used in the optical analysis of the processes
which occur in the rapidly successive vibrations of sounding
bodies.    On the other hand, the vibrograph discovered by Wil
liam Weber, and since then improved in the most varied manner,
presents a means suitable for the graphic representation and even
measurement of simple and compound vibrations.         The advan

   Dr. Paris's thaumatrope, Stampfer's stroboscopic disks, and

different ways, produce such optical impressions as depend on
the duration of the impression of light in the eye.   In regard to

 duration of the impression of light*.            Savart first used the
thaumatropic principle, though in a very imperfect manner, to
 determine     the disintegration of a liquid issuing from a jet.
 Rogers showed, further, the successive illumination and disap
pearance of the singing flame when viewed through a black disk.
 On rapid rotation, the bands disappeared in daylight; but on
illumination through the chemical harmonicon, the disk appeared
either at rest or slowly rotating in one direction or the other ac
cording to its velocity.      The first to use the stroboscopic prin
ciple for exact subjective observation was, as far as I know,
Professor Magnus           who,    t.,         in

18       Dr. Topler on      the   Application of the Principle of Stroboscopic
of the sounding body can be optically reproduced, made as much
slower as we like, and either in a negative or positive direction.
The eye will in each case observe just as many apparent vibra
tions as the ear would experience impulses if the disk were
sounded as a siren so that interference would take place be
tween the two tones produced.        It must be expressly remarked
that this conclusion is only valid for the case in which the ob
 server's eye is close behind the rotating disk.
    The principle is so simple and universally known that it might
be supposed to have been more frequently used for studying
 phenomena of vibration.     In fact, when freed from some optical
sources of error to be subsequently mentioned, it furnishes a very
suitable means of constructing a universal vibroscope which can
indicate the difference of phase both of space and of time.    The
advantages over the rotating mirror and the vibrograph are
obvious; for the former only furnishes drawn-out successive
pictures — while the vibrograph only gives the form of the curve
of vibration of a single vibrating point, but never allows an
investigation of the whole body as regards changes in form, op
tical properties, &c.                 I
                         As have not met with any application
of this principle in my reading in experimental optics, I will
attempt in the following communication to indicate the value of
the method for analytical purposes.
     Imade my first experiments with tuning-forks.       A tuning-
fork which gave the next lower octave of the sounding object
had on one limb a thin metal disk with a fine aperture, the other
limb being balanced by a small weight. With a brisk excitation
of the tuning-fork, the eye, placed directly behind the position
of equilibrium of the vibrating aperture, sees, indeed, the pheno
mena first mentioned, if a second very small aperture is brought
in front of the eye.    Experiments made in this way are, however,
very inconvenient, because the intensity of light is so materially
diminished, and, on the other hand, because a continuous strong
excitation of the tuning-fork cannot be obtained without compli
cated arrangements.       Hence I turned to rotating disks with
concentric series of holes, as used in every form of siren.     The
greatest difficulty here consists doubtless in imparting to the disk
any desired velocity, and retaining it constant during the entire
duration of the observation.     This might easily be effected by
means of clockwork, — perhaps best of all by a small magneto-
electrical machine, which in turn might be regulated by a rheo
stat.   But leaving to practice a more perfect arrangement of such
a mechanism,           I
                    limit myself to describing one which, with a
little practice, may be used with perfect success for vibroscopic
purposes.
     A, fig.   1,   Plate   I.,   represents   a   small clockwork,   as used   for

           Disks to the  Optical Analysis of Vibrating Bodies.      19
experiments      with the colour-circle and subjective colours ; it
has no regulator.       By winding up a strong spring by means of
the key a and the catch b, a blackened paper disk, B, of 5 to 8
inches diameter, with different series of concentric holes, is put
in rapid rotation. The velocity on starting has a maximum value,
and rapidly diminishes thence to zero.        For obtaining great ve
locity, disks of opake but not too stout paper should be taken,
such as was used by Magnus for observing the issuing jet ; for
by the action of the centrifugal force they set exactly in the plane
of rotation, and thereby find least resistance in the air ; while
thicker disks, or metal disks, be they ever so thin, always cast..
The apparatus should be clamped on a table.
     Viewing a vibrating body, a singing flame, for instance,
through one of the series of holes, the above-named phenomena
are observed, though but transiently.        In front of the disk is a
short piece of tube C on a stand Cs, which latter can be turned
about the joint s.      The mouth of the tube can thus be placed in
front of any series of holes.     By the vulcanized tube g, the disk
 can be sounded by a bellows regulated by the foot, so as to obtain
the desired velocity by a coincidence in the sounds.
     It is true that some practice in continually adjusting the key
 a is required in order to keep the velocity constant, in such a
 manner that the apparent vibrations can be observed for minutes
 together.     A good deal of patience is required, especially in the
 case of high notes.      The rougher tuning is effected by the ear :
 when unison is attained, the finer accord is effected, until the ap
 parent duration of a vibration is brought within from 2 to5 seconds.
     But with an assistant the adjustment can be successfully ob
 tained in the following manner.         The relation of the velocity
 of the axis of the key a to the axis of the disk B is discovered,
 once for all, by counting the teeth of the wheelwork.         Suppose
 now the key turned backwards to the stroke of a pendulum
 — for instance, at the rate of one tooth of the check-wheel ; the
 diskB will gradually acquire a constant velocity, at which just as
 much runs off in the unit of time as is wound up by each check-
 tooth. Now the interval of time for the winding up of each
  check-tooth may be easily calculated from the height of tone of
  the object investigated, the number of holes in the disk, and the
  rotation of the teeth of the wheels.     This interval of time may
 be marked by a metronome, or a thread pendulum, which the
  assistant can read.      At each stroke of the pendulum, he has
  to turn the key a tooth further, which is by no means difficult.
  If  the wheelwork is in good condition, by the increasing resist
  ance of the air and the inertia of the disk B, a condition of equili
  brium in the velocity of the disk is established which is adequate
 for all experiments with tones which are not too high.          At the

20    Dr. Topler on     the  Application of the Principle of Stroboscopic
commencement of the experiment the disk is indeed somewhat
behind, it then gets in advance, and sinks gradually to the nor
mal velocity — which is easily explained.           The observer can make
the observations without any hindrance.               If the apparent vibra
tions   follow  too  rapidly,   a slight  correction    of the pendulum or
the metronome is sufficient.          The vibrations succeeded so rapidly
that there was no occasion for seeking another mode of regula
ting the clockwork.         Unfortunately there must be a fresh regu
lation for each new object with a different tone.
    The observations are liable to errors, which fortunately are
avoidable.      Looking with the naked            eye   through the row of
holes, which seems        like  a transparent circle, the images of the
vibrating objects appear wanting in definition if the holes have
a diameter which is considerable as compared with the distance
between two adjacent holes ; for the flash of the image during the
passage of an aperture in front of the pupil is not instantaneous.
If the ratio of the diameter of a hole to its distance from the
next is 1 : p, and if the disk is rightly tuned for the sounding
body,    during the      passage of a hole       -  vibration of an object
elapses.     The image must be the more distorted, and run into
the succeeding phase, the smaller p is.              I  was surprised at ob
taining perfectly     distinct   images   of  a great number of vibrating
bodies, even when p did not exceed from 10 to 12.                 On a little
consideration this is explicable in the following manner : — Assu
ming that the rotating holes are circular and exactly of the same
diameter as the pupil, the intensity of the impression of light
during the passage of a hole is not constant ; for, while the hole
in question gradually slides in front of the pupil, the intensity
rapidly increases from 0 to a definite maximum value, and the
intensity of light will always depend on the area of the overlap
ping part of both circles (hole and pupil).                The maximum of
intensity    will in fact   only  last  for a  moment,     and  then rapidly
decrease.      The impression of light remaining            on the  eye must
obviously correspond to that position of the vibrating object
which coincides with the maximum brightness.                   The adjacent
positions    of the  object,   which    during   the   passage of a hole are
still visible,  will recede,   for  they correspond to a smaller bright
ness.     Hence it is that with holes of not more than the diameter
of the pupil, even very fine objects, such as vibrating strings, can
be very well observed whenp does not amount to more than from
20 to 25. From this may also be explained what at first sight
seems paradoxical, namely the fact that holes of double the dia
meter of the pupil give indistinct pictures if their mutual dis
tance is increased to double, or even more.                For observations
with the naked eye, holes of 3 to 4 millims. diameter are best

           Disks    to the   Optical Analysis of Vibrating Bodies.                        21
suited ; for with feebly lighted objects the pupil is enlarged to
something beyond the normal measure.
    It follows from this that holes of smaller diameter than that
of the pupil are of no use to the distinctness of the picture,
since they, staying with their full aperture in front of the
pupil, leave a constant quantity of light in the eye, which in this
case does not attain a momentary maximum.                  But           if,
                                                                    with very
high tones,        be desired to use smaller holes in the disk

    What has been said above respecting circular apertures ap
plies, of course, to radial slits in the disk B.         It      useless also

one another than in that of circular apertures, as                shown

diameter.     Smaller slits than those give distorted images, owing
to phenomena of diffraction.        The same series are, of course, all
represented    on the  observing-disk     G.
     As a   matter of course the total brightness of the moving
images   is far smaller than the brightness of ordinary vision             and     ;
it  can be readily seen that with equal magnitude of the holes                            it
increases with increasing number of holes.              For, supposing the
 series of holes formed an open circular band of the breadth of
 the diameter of the pupil, the brightness of the image would
 clearly be equal to        But

the total surface of the aperture bears to the area of the entire

the parallactic error.     From this error may be explained the sur
prising deception     that the limbs of a large tuning-fork do not
appear to vibrate simultaneously towards one another.           Again,
a vibrating steel wire fastened at one end, the length of which
coincides with the direction of motion of the holes when viewed
at some distance from the disk, does not appear simply bent, but
convoluted *.     The parallactic error can only be eliminated by
making a = 0. Unfortunately great proximity of the eye to the
disk is, for various reasons, impracticable.          By the disk G
(fig. 1)  with the  stationary apertures,  the  error is only in so far
diminished that the field of view is thereby diminished. With
the object-glass of a telescope, the centre of which in some sense
represents the cross-point of the eye, the approximation to the
disk can be as close as is desired.     Hence upon the stand E t in
front of the disk G a small astronomical telescope F of only              \\
to 2-fold magnifying-power may be screwed.            The above fault
is thereby almost completely removed.          On viewing the vibra
tions of a tuning-fork through the telescope, both limbs vibrated
simultaneously and in opposite directions.          Observed through
the telescope, the brightness is somewhat diminished; but in
this case, according to the degree of magnification, somewhat
larger holes may be used both in the disk B and in G. Of
 course the aperture in the disk must in observing be accurately
 centred in front of the objective.      Observation through a tele
 scope has the advantage of a large field of view ; for the latter
 only depends on the aperture of the object-glass.        The telescope
 is to be so arranged that it may be distinctly placed for aper
 tures of from 6 to 8 inches.
     The entire arrangement, as above described, I will briefly call
 " Vibroscope." As to the experiments which may be made
 with it,
       I     may remark for the present the following

 24      Dr. Topler   on the Application of the Principle of Stroboscopic
      (3) As a matter of course, the beautiful experiments of Mag
  nus on the dispersion of the emergent jet can be readily repeated
  with the above apparatus, using a small velocity of the disk, and
  a small number of holes*.
      (4) Vibrating strings are observed in front of an illuminated
  surface, or, if they are lustrous metallic wires, with a good light
  over a blackened surface.       If the entire wire is to be conveniently
  seen, the vibroscope is so placed, approximately           in the direction
  of the string, that this appears shortened. When strings are made
  to sound by striking, besides the vibration established which cor
  responds to the fundamental note, there are always bendings which
  run backwards and forwards on the curved string. This is best
  seen with long thin metal strings.        I have often been surprised at
  observing in these that the acceleration at the moment at which
  the string passes the position of equilibrium is by no means of
  the form to be expected from theory.
      (5) The phases of vibration of the singing harmonicon-flame
  are well seen if observed in a darkened room.             The object bears
  indeed some magnifying.          In a separate paper I shall describe
 the principal forms of vibration of the singing flame.             It may be
  anticipated that the experiments of Dr. Kundt on the double
  refraction of sounding glass rods might easily be repeated with
  the rotating disk, whereby the gradual change of the figure of
 polarization, as regards time and position, would doubtless be
  better seen than by the rotating mirror.
      (6) Experiments with Wheatstone's kaleidophone (Lissajou's
  luminous figures) assume a very instructive form with the vibro
 scope, inasmuch as some conclusions may be drawn not without
 interest as regards the theory of the apparatus.          Suppose, for sim
 plicity's  sake, a horizontal   bar clamped   at  one  end, whose free end
 executes an elliptic vibration when struck excentrically; this, as we
 know, is made visible by having a bright polished steel sphere
 at the vibrating end brightly illuminated.            The vibroscope must
 of course resolve the luminous curve into a single point of light,
 which, according to the direction of the apparatus, appears slowly
 to complete the vibration in a positive or negative direction, or
    *
       I may mention here that Dr. Kersting of Riga exhibits on a large scale
 the shape of the emergent jet by a very simple experiment.       From a tube
 half an inch in width, making an angle of 80° with the horizon, a dense
jet ascends to a height of about 8 feet. The long and wide vulcanized sup
 ply-tube is provided with a large tap which can be very rapidly closed.
The ascending jet from a certain height appears turbid.        If now the tap
 be rapidly turned, the mass of water suspended in the air falls down late
rally, and the upper part is seen to consist of clear water-bulbs 1 to 14 inch
in diameter, while the lower part still hangs together, but has regular con
tractions and expansions, increasing upwards ; these are not turbid, but clear
as glass. Tbe elasticity of the supply-tube is essential in these experiments.

         Disks   to the   Optical Analysis of Vibrating Bodies.       25
finally appears at rest,     if the disk of the vibroscope, regarded as
a siren, gives the tone      of the bar. It is easy to see that theore
tically the result must be the same if the rotating disk gives the
next deeper, or indeed any n times deeper octave of the tone of
the bar.     For in this case, at each passage of a hole in front of
the eye, the point of light would always be seen in one and the
same position of its path, even if in the time between the passage
of two holes n complete oscillations of the point have been ef
fected.    This is in fact the case; but, instead of a spot, a band
of light is seen, which is longer the deeper the octave of the vi
broscope below the tone of the bar.          The explanation is simple.
During the stay of a hole in front of the eye, the point describes
a greater portion of its entire path the slower the vibroscope-disk
rotates.     This of course is the case with all other vibrating
 bodies ; the lower octaves indeed resolve the vibrations, but the
more indistinctly the greater the interval of the note.         The case
 is quite different if the vibroscope is one or many octaves higher
than the vibrating body.          Let the elliptic curve, fig. 3, repre
sent the path of the vibrating point of light a, which for the
same height-of octave of the vibroscope slowly advances in the
 direction of the arrow; it is clear that if the vibroscope is an
octave higher, the point of light is seen twice during each vibra
 tion, and on opposite points of its path.          Hence two points of
light  are  then  seen   which    slowly advance  in the same direction.
 In short, if the vibroscope is n octaves higher, n points of light
 are seen as a rotating string of pearls.       If the velocity were the
 same in all points of the ellipse, the points of light 'would have
 the same distance.        Yet at the ends of the major axis the points
 of light appear closer packed, and, as is readily seen, the mutual
distance of two points of light gives a measurement of the abso
lute velocity on the curve.
   From the above explanation the following phenomenon is at once
explicable.    Using the disk with from twenty-four to thirty-six
holes, if the clockwork is wound up and allowed to run out without
adjustment, at first a great number of points of light are seen
rotating, which at certain moments stand still and change their
direction. From now the apparent movement is more rapid until
the image becomes confused. It then becomes clear again, but has
one point less; at length it stands still, changing finally the direc
tion of its motion.        This process is repeated, a point of light
 disappearing    each   time, until finally only a single one describes
the path.      It is moreover clear that the complicated luminous
figures of the kaleidophone present analogous phenomena.
    The multiplication of images may be observed under the above
circumstances also in other vibrating objects — for instance, vibra
ting strings.      There is the advantage in this case, if only one

26           On the Optical Analysis  of Vibrating Bodies.
double image is produced, of always simultaneously viewing
those conditions of phase which are just half a vibration from
each other, which is very essential for estimating the motion.
    Under other circumstances a partial resolution of the images
is obtained, which may sometimes be interesting.           Assuming
that the vibrating object executes n vibrations in a second, while
m holes simultaneously pass in front of the eye, periodic changes
are observed in the optical image, provided n and m almost ex
actly represent a simple ratio of numbers, so that the tones in
question form an harmonic interval.       The convulsive movements
of the flame are of a complicated kind, and must be specially in
vestigated in each case.       Without entering further into the
subject, it will be seen that the phenomena reproduce in an
optical sense what in acoustics are called combination tones.
    (7) By the following experiment the application of the vibro-
scope acquires an additional extension.        In one and the same
annular zone of the disk B, fig. 1, two different divisions of holes
may clearly be simultaneously introduced, so that they may si
multaneously come into operation in rotation. In this way two
objects, differing in their duration of vibration, may be simulta
neously analyzed ; for the different divisions of holes, strangely
enough, scarcely interfere with each other in their optical action.
    (8) The above-described experiments are vastly improved if
an intermittent illumination is established through the rotating
disk, and on the same principles as those developed for direct
vision.
    Let H, fig. 4, denote the mirror of an ordinary heliostat, as used
 for a solar microscope.   The lens L gives at 0 a small solar image,
the rays of which diverge into the darkened place of observation.
Let the vibroscope, of which in fig. 4 only the disk B with its
axis a is drawn, be so placed that the cone of solar rays can just
pass through one of the series of holes.      All side light is cut off
by having on the tube of the solar microscope a piece of tubing
which almost reaches to the disk B.          Setting this in rotation,
 the issuing cone of rays appears constant when a certain velocity
has been attained.      If now with this light any sounding body,
 for instance a string S, be observed which is almost in unison
with the disk, the vibrations may be studied with a distinctness
and degree of facility which leaves nothing to be desired.
 Not only have we the advantage that many persons can simulta
neously observe the object, but even microscopic objects can be
observed with the lens at any degree of closeness.        With strings
and tuning-forks the previously mentioned duplication of the
images can also be shown in the shade figures enlarged
on a screen.       The form of the apparently slowly vibrating
objects appears much more distinct on the screen than might

have been supposed, especially if the following precautions be
taken.      Let the distance of the disk B from the focus o be so
measured that the diverging cone of rays exactly fills up the pass
ing holes.      In this case there is in this mode of observation also a
maximum of brightness of momentary duration for each hole. The
explanations given above on the distinctness of the optical images
apply also in this case.        If instead of a cone of rays a fine cy
linder of rays be used which falls upon suitably combined tuning-
forks with steel mirrors, Lissajou's luminous figures may be ob
jectively represented, and resolved as above into one or more
moving points of light.        That, further, in these experiments sun
 light within certain limits may be replaced by artificial light is a
 matter of course.
 IV.    On the   Partition of the Cube, and some of the Combinations
    of its parts.     By Charles M. Willich, late Actuary and Se
     cretary to the University Life Assurance Society*.
   A CUBE may be divided into equal and uniform bodies in
          various ways.
     1st. By lines from the centre to the eight angles of the cube,
 which will give six four-sided pyramids (B).
     2nd. By lines from one of the upper angles of the cube drawn
 diagonally to the opposite angles, dividing the cube into three
                                   Each of these solids being halved,
 forms a left- and a right-handed solid. The six bodies thus
 produced, though equal in mass, differ in shape so far, that three
  may be termed left-handed and three right-handed, in the same
  way as the hands of the human body.
     3rd. By lines drawn from the centre to four angles of the cube,
  and continued on each face, will be produced four equal and similar
  bodies (G), each composed of two three-sided pyramids united at
  their base— the one having the same angle as the trihedral roof
  of the Bee's cell, viz. 109° 28' 16", the other 90°. These four
  bodies rearranged produce the half of a dodecahedron with rhom-
  boidal faces.
     4th. Another division of the cube may be made producing
  the tetrahedron and octahedron: viz., diagonal lines from two
  of the upper angles of the cube, continued on the other faces,
  will cut off four three-sided pyramids, leaving in the centre a
  tetrahedron.      The four three-sided pyramids cut off may be so
  arranged    as  to produce the half of the true octahedron.
     The four-sided pyramid obtained by the first mode of division

being cut into two portions by a diagonal line will produce a
body which I have assumed as a unit (A) for the construction
of many geometrical and crystalline bodies. The models laid
before the Association show some of the forms produced.                The
rhomboidal cube (J), and the rkomboidal dodecahedron (L) with
pyramidal faces (containing in mass one half of the cube from
which it is derived), may be considered interesting; but the
various crystalline figures which may be formed by a combina
tion of my unit (A) cannot even estimate — though probably all
                         I
geometrical solids and even many, if not all, crystalline bodies
may be included, if we use sections of bodies produced by a par
tition of the cube.
    It may be observed that the pyramid (B), or one-sixth of the
cube, which contains two units, may itself be divided into four
bodies by sections parallel to the sides, each of which is one-third
of a cube containing one-eighth of the mass of the cube from
which it was derived ; so that in fact we may go on dividing and
reproducing • bodies of a similar shape, and still retaining the
same angles as in the portion from the original cube.             How far
this subdivision may be carried in nature,         or  how  much   further
than our powers of vision will reach, I will not venture an opinion.
We can imagine that the commencing atoms may be infinitely
small when we remember the wonders revealed by the microscope.
    I  entertain a sanguine hope that, should the attention of phi-         -
lophers be drawn to this subject, the further development may
perhaps be the means of throwing some unexpected light as to
the shape of an atom.        I incline, however, to think that atoms
may differ in shape in the three kingdoms of nature — mineral,
vegetable, and animal.
   As to the practical use in education,       I am of opinion that the
study of geometry would be simplified by the use of models
showing the relative value as to the solidity of geometrical bodies,
and thus convey knowledge to the youthful mind by means of
the eye more readily than by any description, as when convinced
by the sight the mind would understand with greater facility.

      1. The resistance in the battery branch must be small, as
compared with the parallel resistance of the two double branches

 in proportion to that of the conductor ; or, to express this more
 generally, the proportion of the non-conducting to the conducting
 sectional area must be a constant value for wires of various dia
 meters.
      The first and second conditions are fulfilled in all cases of
 practical interest ; but not so the third, as the thickness of silk
 covering is always the same for thin as for thick wires.                Thus a

correction   appears necessary in the expression for g.       To find
this correction, and to inquire whether its influence be really so
great as to necessitate its application in practice, is the chief
purpose of the present paper.          This inquiry is not only of in
terest in the special case of Wheatstone's diagram ; it enters, as
insulating covering for coiled wires is always necessary, into
all cases where the resistance is to be found for any instrument
in any circuit, to produce the maximum magnetic effect. We
will consequently conduct the following investigation in such a
manner as to make the result of it generally applicable.

larger than Vk, and the other smaller than */ k ; but as only

be always smaller than the external resistance, and may be calcu

34       M. L. Schwendler      on the Galvanometer Resistance
thus
as may be calculated.
    If we express electrical  resistances in Siemens' s units, we have
to measure
                        B2 and  A in square millims.,
                        B in metres,
and                    X is the specific conductivity of the wire
when the conductivity of pure mercury at 0° is equal to unity.
   Now, the external resistance being given, and m known by
formula (4), we may calculate numerically
                               wi=ff < k
by equation (3) .     But as such a calculation, especially for prac
tical use, is inconvenient, it will be better to give an approximate
algebraical expression for g, which we may obtain in the follow
ing manner.      If we put in equation (3)
we have
                    (f—kmcj </g-2kg + k2=0,
or
                     (k-g)*=kmg Vg,
or
                     (Ic-g)*=k*my.
Substituting on the right hand
                             g=k-p,
where p is an unknown positive quantity, i. e. a certain function
of and increasing with k and m, we have
                        (k-g)4=k2mq(k-p)a;
and expanding     the right-hand term, we have
                (k-g)* = kV {k3    - M*p   + 3kp*-pa) ;
or neglecting all terms with powers of/? against      k3, we have ap

 supposing the area A divided into squares.
    The above Table shows that when m=0-0026, which it may
 sometimes exceed, the corrected value for g differs between
 14-44 per cent, and 23-8 per cent, from the corresponding external
 resistance k, a difference which is evidently too great to be neg
 lected where we have to deal with weak electrical currents, for
 instance in measuring resistances with Wheatstone's diagram.
    Now we will suppose we have to determine the best resistance
of the galvanometer in Wheatstone's diagram, then

    I  may mention here that, where the external resistance varies
between wide limits, it will be better to divide the given space
into two equal parts and fill each of them with wires of different
diameters, so as to use them either successively or in parallel
connexion.

  the rods/and^, it was found that    /  (answering to d) struck out ex
  actly 10 milliins., d, on the contrary, 8 millinis. After the termi
  nation of these preliminary trials, the first object was to determine
  the distance of the stroke of the two rods /and g.           With this
  view the disk 0 P, whose anterior surface was covered with white
  paper, was brought within 6 millims. of the blackened rods, and
  in such a manner that they must strike the periphery of a circle
  80 centims. in diameter drawn on the disk 0 P.                 As long
  as the disk was not rotated, after each discharge two black points
  were formed at the same distance on the same periphery, which
  was to be accepted as the normal difference of stroke.              But
  when the disk was rotated, the distance       was   greater or less, ac
  cording to the direction of the rotation. When the rotation had
  a definite velocity of one turn in a second, the difference between
  the distance of the marks in that case and in the normal case was
  constant and amounted to 16J millims.           It follows thence that
  with the given velocity of rotation of the disk a point of the
  periphery of the above circle of 30 centims. diameter passes
  through 16| millims. in the time which sound requires to tra
 verse 6 metres.      If we put the velocity of a point of the peri
 phery = a, and call b the length of the path of a point of the
 periphery in the time which sound requires for its path in the
 apparatus, the length of which shall be /, the velocity c of sound
 is obviously determined from the equation
                                      al
                                  c=r
     As al was previously known, it is only necessary in each expe
 riment to divide by b to find c at once.
     The above values substituted gave c= 346217 metres at
 22° C.
     Of course in such apparatus it is necessary that there be —
     (1) Perfect unalterability of the position of the plane PO
 during the rotation of the disk.
     (2) Perfectly uniform rotation.
    (3) An accurate determination of the path of the sound in the
tube.
    In the present apparatus the rotation of the disk is effected
by hand, the time being taken by a seconds-pendulum, which is
sufficient for instruction in schools.       But considering that this
rotation might be made more certain and more rapid by a good
clockwork, that the dimensions of the tube might then be consi
derably smaller, and the source of sound feebler, it will be seen
that this apparatus is capable of an amount of improvement
sufficient for obtaining the most accurate results.

40           Prof.   J.   Plateau     on the   Figures of Equilibrium
  in my Fifth Series, the best. Other kinds of glycerine, how
  ever, which are much less expensive, are now manufactured in
  France by the same processes, and might perhaps be used if
  needful in place of Price's glycerine ; but it would be necessary
  to employ them in different proportions.           I have always got the
  best results in summer; I shall therefore confine myself here to
  describing the new process as I practise it at that season.
     It is desirable to choose a period of warm weather, in order
 that the temperature of the room, at least during the day-time,
 may not fall below 20° C. during any part of the whole process.
 Marseilles soap which has been recently bought, and therefore
 still contains its full quantity of moisture, is the best ; this is to
 be cut up into very small pieces and dissolved at a moderate
 heat in forty times its weight of water.          When the solution has
 returned nearly to the temperature of the room, it must be fil
 tered, and 3 measures of this solution and 2*2 measures of
 Price's glycerine are to be poured into a bottle ; the bottle must
 be well shaken, long enough to ensure a thorough mixture of
 the liquids, and then left to itself for seven days.              On the
 morning of the eighth day, the bottle is to be put into water
 cooled by stirring pieces of ice in                it,
                                               so as to lower its tempe
 rature to about 3° C, and this temperature must be kept con
 stant for six hours        by
                            adding fresh ice as          may be required.
                                                          it
 The liquid next requires to be filtered through very permeable
 paper; but the liquid in the filter must be prevented from getting
 warm again, otherwise the precipitate which has been caused                 by
 the cooling might partially redissolve.         For this purpose, before
 pouring any of      iton the filter,     small wide-mouthed stoppered
                                             a
 bottle of an elongated shape         filled with bits of ice, the stopper
                                        is
 put in in order to make        heavier, and laid in the filter so that
                                 it
 one side of  it  rests upon the filter      the bottom of the bottle in
                                                 ;
 which the funnel         is
                          supported      should  likewise be surrounded
 with ice. The solution        now to be taken out of its cold bath
                                 is
 and immediately poured upon the filter; the first portions
 which pass are turbid        but
                               ;        it only necessary to pour them
                                               is
back into the filter two or three times in order that the liquid
subsequently collected may be perfectly limpid.               There     no
                                                                        is

                                   if
ice in the small bottle must be renewed every now and then.
The ice placed round the lower part of the bottle in which the
filtrateis  collected     simply for the purpose of preventing the

                  of a Liquid Mass    without Weight.                   41
   Under the best circumstances, films of the liquid prepared as
above possess an extraordinary degree of permanence : a bubble of
1 decimetre diameter, deposited on a ring of iron wire 4 centims. in
diameter which has been previously wetted with the same solution,
may last for eighteen hours when freely exposed to the air of the
room — that is to say, six times as long as a bubble made with
the solution prepared as described in my Fifth Series.     The sub
stances used in making the liquid being manufacturing products,
vary in quality more or less in different specimens, so that                I
have obtained a result like that just mentioned only exceptionally;
from what follows, however, an opinion may be formed of the
superiority of my new process, and of the degree of reliance which
may be placed upon it.
    Out of twenty-one successive preparations made during the
summers of the four years last past, and with different specimens
of Price's glycerine and of Marseilles soap, only two, in which
the soap and the glycerine employed were the same, were unsuc
cessful ; but I  have some reasons for suspecting an error in the
weighing    of the soap.  All these liquids were tested by means
of a bubble of 1 decimetre in diameter deposited on a ring, as              I
have already said.     Deducting the two cases of failure, nineteen
specimens remain : for three of these the longest time that a
bubble lasted was five hours ; for three others it was seven hours;
for two it was eight hours ; for four it was nine hours ; for four
others, ten hours ; for one, eleven hours ; for one, twelve hours ;
and for one, eighteen hours.
    A very remarkable thing     is,that, when      bubble lasts for
                                                   a                        a
tolerably long time, the film acquires after an hour or two sen
 sibly the same thickness over the whole extent of the bubble,
 excepting, of course, the small part at the bottom intercepted
 by  the metallic ring.  This uniformity of thickness        is
                                                             apparent
 from the disposition of the interference-tints.
    Another thing which    isnot of less interest      is,
                                                      that these tints
 advance at first towards those of the first order, but afterwards
 retrograde as far as the red or green of the last order, and
 sometimes even as far as white.      This degradation of the tints
 arises, as
         I     have shown  in  my   Fifth  Series, from the absorp
 tion of moisture from the surrounding air              by
                                                       the glycerine-
solution.
   The theory which     I  have formed of the glycerine- solution
leads to the further consequence that the substitution of pure
oleate of soda for Marseilles soap ought to yield,            bymuch
                                                                   a
simpler process,   liquid
                    a       far superior to even   the  best of those
prepared with soap.     This anticipation     fully borne out
                                              is                  ex   by
periment. In fact all that      Ifound necessary was to dissolve the
 oleate of soda in distilled water at     gentle heat, and then to
                                          a

42             Prof.   J.    Plateau on   the   Figures of Equilibrium
 mix glycerine with this solution in a proportion not much differ
 ent from that required when soap is employed.          The solutions
 thus prepared were ready for use by the next day, or the next
 but one, and they yielded bubbles of 1 decimetre diameter, whose
maximum persistence in the air exceeded twenty-four hours.
 Oleate of soda is therefore the substance with which the glycer
 rine solution ought properly to be prepared ; it is the substance
 indicated by theory ; and the preparation by means of it becomes
 a matter of the greatest ease.       Unfortunately, pure oleate of
 soda is not an article of commerce, and it can therefore be pro
 cured only by appealing to the kindness of a chemist.
    In a closed vessel, bubbles formed of the glycerine-solution
 show a degree of persistence which is very much greater still,
 especially if a substance like chloride of calcium, capable of ab
 sorbing moisture, is put at the bottom of the vessel. For ex
 ample, with a solution prepared with oleate of soda, but which
 was not particularly good, and gave bubbles which did not last
 more than twelve hours in the air,              I
                                         obtained without drying the
 air in the vessel a maximum persistence of forty-one hours, and,
when the air was dried, a persistence of more than fifty-four
 hours.    In the complete memoir I have pointed out some pre
 cautions that ought to be taken.
     Ireturn from this discussion of the glycerine-solution to the
 generation of films.    In my Second and Sixth Series I have ex
 amined the generation and all the peculiarities (1) of the films
 formed by filling up with oil a solid framework immersed in the
                                                                  (2) of
 alcoholic liquid, and then gradually removing oil from                  it,
the films raised       air-bubbles on the surface of
                            by                             liquid, and
                                                                     a
 (3) of those which start from the wires of      solid skeleton figure
                                                            a
which    isimmersed      the glycerine- solution and then lifted out.
                             in
In the present series extend this examination to other kinds of
                             I
liquid films.
I     begin with complete bubbles obtained                      by
                                                     blowing through
a  tube widened out at the further end.      When, for example, the
opening of the bowl of       tobacco-pipe
                                  a            dipped into soap and
                                                       is
water or into the glycerine-solution and then .withdrawn,                           a
small film extends at first from the liquid to the mouth of the
bowl; and show that on continuing to raise the latter, the
              I
equilibrium of the figure of the film soon becomes unstable         the        ;
film then contracts, closes up rapidly below, separates from the
liquid, and comes to fill the mouth of the pipe as          plane film.
                                                                     a
In this state of things, on blowing down the stem of the pipe,
this film being now subject to an excess of pressure upon one
surface, must either burst or bulge outwards; now, unless                      it   is
exceedingly thin, its cohesion will be more than sufficient to
prevent   it breaking; consequently        will begin to bulge and
                                                  it

                     of a Liquid Mass without Weight.                                   43
swell ; and since the viscosity of the liquid will at the same time
greatly retard the descent of the molecules towards the lowest
point of the curvature, the film will go on bulging and swelling;
and, lastly, inasmuch as it is supported by a circular periphery
and is continuous throughout its whole extent, starting from this
periphery, it must, in accordance with a principle established in
my Fourth Series, constitute a portion of a sphere.          As we
continue to blow into the bubble, the portion of a sphere thus
formed must evidently increase continually in diameter until the
film becomes at last so thin that it breaks.
   If we stop blowing before getting near the point at which the
bubble would burst, and give the pipe a rather rapid upward
movement, the bubble lags behind to a greater or less extent, on
account of its inertia and the resistance of the air ; but in con
sequence of its cohesion and its adherence to the solid edge, the
film in most cases does not break, and the bubble remains for an
instant united to the edge by a hollow stem formed by an up
ward extension of the film.    Now       for greater simplicity, we
                                               if,
suppose  the rapid   motion of the pipe to take place in       direc               a
tion exactly perpendicular to the plane of the opening, the form
of the film must still constitute figure of revolution
                                          a                     and                ;    I
have shown in my Fourth Series that the sphere              the only          is
equilibrated figure of revolution closed upon the axis; this
stemmed figure therefore cannot, since           closed below upon
                                                          it   is
the axis, constitute  figure of equilibrium
                          a                    consequently;     must              it
undergo     spontaneous modification
            a                             and   ;   evident  that
                                                            it    the
                                                                    is
hollow stem will contract so as to separate into two portions, of
which the upper one will go to fill the mouth of the pipe as                             a
plane film, while the lower one will close the bubble, which thus
becomes isolated in the air and forms                a    complete sphere.
   Everybody knows that         it possible to blow bubbles in this
                                     is
way   at  the end  of   narrow
                          a     tube that      not widened out.
                                                      is            In
this case, when the end of the tube      has  been  plunged   into the
liquid and withdrawn again, capillary action retains short column         a
of liquid in the tube, and on afterwards blowing in at the other
 end, this column comes to form          small liquid mass over the
                                           a
open end, and the air entering into        expands
                                                it     and converts  it                 it
into    abubble.
 I    next recall     well-known but curious process for the pro
                      a
duction of plane, or nearly plane, films of liquid.        bottle con     A
taining     asmall quantity of the glycerine- solution       taken in         is
both hands,          by
                    the neck and      the bottom, and, being held
                                          by
horizontally,    amovement      given to
                                is          which obliges the liquid
                                                     it
to sweep over the whole internal concave surface.          As soon as
the motion       stopped, one or more plane films are found to be
                is
arranged across the bottle, which can then be set upright on                             a

44          Prof. J. Plateau on the Figures of Equilibrium
table, when the films become horizontal.         In the detailed me
       I
 moir likewise explain the production of such films as these by
the cohesion and viscosity of the liquid.
    These films present some remarkable properties : they last
 for an astonishing length of time, and their interference-tints
even reach blackness; a film of this kind, formed in a bottle of
about 7 centims. diameter, lasted for eighteen days, and had
become black all over.
    There is a special class of liquid films upon which       I dwell
longer, namely those due to the spreading out into a sheet of
a liquid in motion.      Attention was called to these films by two
beautiful papers by Savart, published in the Annates de Chimie
 et de Physique for 1833.
    In the first paper this distinguished physicist investigates
more particularly the phenomena which arise when the continu
ous portion of a liquid vein, projected vertically downwards,
strikes perpendicularly against the centre of a small solid disk.
Under these circumstances the liquid spreads out into a sheet or
film, which, when everything else remains the same, takes dif
ferent forms, according to the velocity with which it flows : with
a moderate head of liquid, the vein on striking the disk spreads
out all round into   a perfectly  unbroken film, shaped like a large
inverted capsule, whose free slightly serrated edge throws out a
great number of small drops, which start from the salient angles
of the teeth ; with a smaller head, the film becomes more and
 more curved, and at last closes up completely below.
    In  his second paper Savart investigates    the effects produced
by the mutual impact of the continuous parts of two liquid veins
projected from circular openings, in directions which are exactly
opposite to each other at the point where the veins meet.       With
equal heads and openings of the same size, the liquid spreads out
into a disk whose plane is perpendicular to the common tangent
to the axes of the two veins.      Under a common head of mode
rate amount, the liquid disk is surrounded by a small thick
ened border, from which a multitude of little drops are thrown
out.
    Savart's observations led him, for moderate heads of liquid,
to the two following law3 :— with the same-sized openings, the
diameter of the sheet is sensibly proportional to the head simply ;
and with the same head, it is sensibly proportional to the area of
the openings.
    He further shows that, with openings of different sizes, and a
common head of considerable amount, the film is conical ; and
that if the head is sufficiently diminished, the base of the conical
film contracts, and at last closes completely.
    Savart attributes the closing up of these films, as well as of

                     of a Liquid Mass without Weight.                       45
those described in his first paper, to the attraction of the mole
cules j but he confines himself to this simple general view of the
matter.    I explain the facts more precisely by help of the fol
lowing consideration : when a liquid film is curved and its two
principal flexures are not in opposite directions, each element of
the film exerts, as I have shown in my Fifth Series, a pressure
perpendicular to the surface and directed from the concave side.
The pressure thus arising, when the velocity of projection of the
liquid is sufficiently diminished, increases the meridional cur
vature of the films in question so far as to close them com
pletely.
    In
     order to complete the theory of these phenomena, it still re
mained to account for the limitation of the films when not closed,
as well as for the formation of the drops which escape from their
margins.
    M. Hagen, who repeated and varied the principal experiments
contained in Savart's second paper, has proposed what appears
to be a correct theory of the limitation of the films, and one
which leads to the two laws pointed out above. As to the ge
neration of drops, M. Hagen avows that he has not been able to
find any satisfactory explanation : and this is just what might
have been expected ; for this phenomenon depends upon a prin
ciple propounded in my Second Series, with which it was impos
sible for M. Hagen at that time to have been acquainted.           The
following      is,
               Iam convinced, the exact explanation of the matter.
Let us call to mind what happens immediately after the two
orifices are opened, and while the disk of liquid       still increas
                                                               is
ing in diameter.    This disk evidently constitutes     figure of re
                                                               a
volution whose meridional section presents        very high curva
                                                           a
ture at the equator  —  that    to say, precisely at the margin of
                                     is
the sheet  ; now this high curvature necessarily gives rise to               a
 strong capillary pressure directed along the radius of the disk,
 but in the opposite direction to the motion of the liquid.     Hence
 at the edges of the disk the liquid      subject to two opposing
                                               is
 forces, one of which tends to move     away from the centre, and
                                              it
the other to make      approach the centre, and consequently
                           it                                                a
lateral motion of the liquid must ensue in other words, during
the growth of the disk, the liquid that             is ;
                                             thrown back must form
a  thickened border all round its circumference.         This border,
however, having   the   shape  of   sort of
                                          a cylinder   that  has been
bent round into     ring, forms, as
                       a                 have shown in my Second
                                              I
Series, an unstable figure, and must as an absolute necessity
break up during its development into isolated masses            on the  ;
other hand, the border,         by
                              virtue of the inertia of its total mass,
cannot completely lose its velocity at the same time as the por
tion of the film to which         immediately adheres
                                     it                     the small
                                                                    ;

  46           Prof. J.  Plateau on the figures  of Equilibrium
   masses into which it has been transformed will therefore sepa
   rate themselves from the circumference of the film, and will be
   projected with the slight excess of acquired velocity which they
   retain.    At the same moment the capillary pressure must ra
   pidly give rise to a new border, which soon resolves itself, like
   the first, into isolated masses ; and so the action will go on.
      I have shown in my memoir that this theory agrees with all
  the details observed by Savart and by MM. Hagen and Magnus ;
  and it applies equally to the drops projected from the margin
   of the open films described in Savart's first paper.
      To the class of films of which we have just been speaking,
  belong also those which M. Magnus obtained by the collision of
  two liquid veins whose axes form a certain angle with each other.
  These films exhibit some remarkable peculiarities that are easily
  accounted for.
      We have seen above that Savart's films, when they assume
  curved shapes and the velocity of the liquid is sufficiently dimin
  ished, close up in consequence of the capillary pressures exerted
  by all the points of their two surfaces by virtue of their curva
  ture.    The singular mode of formation of bubbles observed by
  my son belongs to the same class of phenomena.             The experi
  ment consists in projecting obliquely into the air soap-water
  contained in a capsule, so as to spread out the liquid into a thin
  sheet or film; this film generally breaks into several pieces, each
  of which immediately closes so as to form a complete hollow
  bubble, which descends more or less slowly.         The phenomenon
 is due to the margin of each partial film acquiring a thickened
  border or hem ; this falls more quickly than the central part,
 which is opposed by the resistance of the air, so that the film
 assumes a highly dome-shaped form with its convex side turned
 upwards ; the rest is done by capillary pressure.
     I  mention, in conclusion, a last species of films : they are like
 wise formed by a liquid in motion ; but cohesion and viscosity
 play only a secondary part in their production, since the mole
 cular veins of which they may be considered to be made up have
 no tendency to separate from one another.           A film of this kind
 is formed by a jet of liquid projected downwards from an orifice
 having the form of a rectilinear slit — a jet whose singular ap
pearance is well known.            I made known a long time ago an
experiment      which   seems   to me  curious, inasmuch as it exhibits
visibly    a large vertical film of liquid, one of the free edges of
which has a thickened border, and has the form of a straight
line inclined to the horizon. The experiment consists in making
water issue from a vertical and rectilinear slit extending up one
side of the vessel from near the bottom to above the surface of
the liquid.      It is the free upper surface of the film which exhi

                  of a Liquid Mass without Weight.                   47
bits the form just mentioned.                         I
                                     In my memoir have given the
theory of the phenomenon,        and have indicated the conditions
requisite for its successful realization.
    It may be seen from my preceding Series that, when an un
stable liquid figure breaks up spontaneously into two or more
masses or partial figures, these remain united together two and
two, before their complete separation, by a liquid vein more or
less cylindrical in shape, which afterwards resolves itself into
separate spherules.      I  show that the phenomenon of the gene
ration of these veins is analogous to the generation of films,
and that it also depends upon the cohesion and viscosity of the
liquid.
    I  conclude with announcing a general principle concerning
the production, in the form of films, of surfaces whose mean
curvature is zero. This principle, to which        I  attach great im
portance, is as follows : —
    A  surface whose mean curvature is zero being given, imagine
that there is traced out upon it any closed outline whatever, subject
only to these conditions — (1) that it circumscribes a finite portion
of the surface, and (2) that this portion does not exceed the limits of
stability if the given surface has such limits ; bend an iron wire so
that it has exactly the shape of the closed outline in question, oxi
dize it slightly with dilute nitric acid, plunge it completely into the
glycerine-solution    and take it out again ; it will be found occupied
 by a film representing the portion of a surface that has been sup
posed.     This outline must, of course, be provided with a projection
by   which  it can be held.
    For example, a plane is a surface whose mean curvature is zero,
 and any closed figure traced upon a plane encloses a finite por
 tion of it ; now a slightly oxidized iron wire bent into the shape
 of any arbitrary but closed plane figure, and immersed in the
 glycerine-solution and then withdrawn, always brings with it a
 plane film.     Similarly, if on a catenoid contained between two
 circular bases, we imagine an outline formed of two opposite meri
 dional arcs and of the halves of the circumferences of the two
 bases, these two halves being taken on the same side of the plane
 containing the meridional arcs, this outline, when constructed in
 iron wire, gives with the glycerine-solution a film representing
 the corresponding portion of the catenoid.
     Surfaces which for the most part are very curious, can be thus
 realized, as if by enchantment.       The only difficulty consists in
 choosing the closed outline and exactly determining its form ;
 but this can always be done when we know either the equation
 or the geometrical generation of the surface.          In a subsequent
 Series I will make known some new examples of such realizations.

     VIII.    On the Multiplication of Partial Differential Operators.
                        By Professor Sylvester*.
       the last Number of the Magazine               I
                                              explained the sense in
IN which I employ       the term operator as distinguished from an
operant, the distinction being somewhat analogous to the gram
matical one between a verb and a noun ; for as a combination
of the predicate and copula gives rise to a verb which has
independent laws of inflexion and regimen, so an operator is
a new species of quantity which, springing from the union of
an operant and the symbol of operation, becomes amenable to
its own proper laws of functional action and subjection f. Ifoun,d
it convenient also to refer to an operator as an energized operant%.
At the outset of the paper a proposition was stated inadvertently,
regarding any energized function of a set of variables and their
corresponding elementary operators, in too general terms.       Such
function remaining unrestricted in regard to the principal letters
x, y, z, . . . should have been limited to be a linear quantic in re
gard to the elementary operators Bx,       8Z>...              If

 t    Thus an operator forms  a  new part   of speech in algebra.   It may be
well to notice in this place, in order to prevent error arising hereafter, that
the process of energization must in general be indicated, not by the mere
apposition of an asterisk, but of brackets and asterisk.       Thus, although
P  turned into an operator may be correctly designated by P*, P*P similarly
energized will be represented by [P*P]», and not         P*P*.

   Conversely, denergization will consist in the abstraction of an asterisk
and brackets, and not of the former merely.            Thus P*P» denergized
is not P»P but P2+P*P, because P*P*         is[Pa    P*P>; whereas P*P* di

dead and living matter.     So denergization might be termed amortization,   a

Society, may be regarded as a transformation and generalization of the fun
damental law of development in Arbogast's theory, sometimes called by the
name of Arbogast's first or unreduced method.   The identification with the
method in question merely requires the supposition that F(a, b, c, i, . . . )
should become a function exclusively of a single one of the letters within
the parentheses ; but of course we must write the left-hand side of the
equation under the unreduced form e*'*F(a, b,c,d . .                      .).

  regarded as a master theorem, i. e. rather as a method than an
 ordinary formula. As already observed, it essentially consists in
  the union of two known theorems ; but these combined and, as
  it were, duly adjusted and focused, constitute together an instru
  ment of research as unlike either of its separate elements as a
  telescope differs in its powers and functions from the pair of
  lenses out of which it has been formed.                And truly the formula
 in question has a telescopic power in the sense of bringing the
 remote results of calculation close up to the mental vision.
     The very first application made of this instrument, directed to
 the algebraical firmament, has been rewarded by the discovery of
 the beautifully simple and general expansion given in the text
 above — a result in beauty and the feeling of wonder it awakens
 fairly to be paralleled with the spectacle which gladdened the eyes
 of Galileo when for the first time he pointed his telescope to the

then   I think there can be little doubt, or, at all events, there is a strong

    If we suppose all the P's inter se, all the Q's inter se, &c. to coincide,
the above expansion is certainly true, as may be inferred from the expan
sion proved in the text, conjoined with the known theorem in factorials,

    Even if on examination the above equation should turn out not to be
exact, the mere statement of it will be useful in indicating the kind of
expression that is applicable.         According to the conservative maxim that
my universally lamented friend the late Mr. Buckle used to be fond of ci
ting, in science even a wrong rule is preferable to anarchy and confusion.

PFAUNDLER
    the thermal  capacity of various kinds of soils* ; the ideas
which have guided him in this investigation may be stated as
follows : —
   Liebig showed that the substances entering into the structure
of the plant fall into two groups, one of which preferably comes
from the atmosphere and is always presented in the same and
sufficient quantity, while the second comes from the soil and
varies in composition.    Hence it was natural to ascribe the dif
ferences in the growth of plants to this different chemical com
position. Under similar climatic conditions, soils which furnish
the same nourishment must be able to produce the same vege
tation. A difference in vegetation must be considered due to
a difference in the composition   of the soil.
   These views received support partly from direct experiment,
partly from observations on the natural occurrence, for instance,
of special plants on a soil containing lime, or on one free from it.
   Liebig's view is now no longer tenable, at any rate in the ex
tension originally given to it.   It has been shown that the com
position of the soil, though of great, is not of exclusive influence.
Many plants have not the power of selection : they take, for in
stance, instead of a certain quantity of magnesia, a correspond
ing quantity of lime without any change; while, on the other
hand, a slight alteration in the physical condition of their sub
soil far more affects their growth.    These facts may be foreseen
if we consider that the circulation of matter is causally connected
with a circulation of forces to which these substances owe their
 motion.
    Not merely must there be mineral constituents ; force is also
needed to raise them.     And as the mineral constituents are not
very soluble, they must be presented to the plant in very dilute
solutions, for which purpose large quantities of water have to be
raised.   This requires a considerable expenditure of force, which
is obtained by the consumption of a corresponding amount of
heat.    Most of the water evaporates on the surface of the leaves.
Hence this water not merely takes from the plant the quantity
of work accumulated in         it,
                              but also    fresh quantity, the latent

detail, and shows how the change of heat into work is effected.
The conclusion           is,
                       that the introduction of mineral constituents
into the plant       only possible
                    is                         by

     It may be shown that the absorption of the other groups of
constituents must have the same result.         The formation of com

The same quantity of heat which becomes free when wood                              is

    The important part which heat plays among the conditions of
 vegetation has long been recognized, though not considered from
 the point of view of the mechanical theory of heat.
    In determining the influence of the composition of the soil
 alone,   ithas been attempted to eliminate that of heat         inves         by
 tigating the growth of plants on different soils, either natural or
 artificial, which were in an exactly identical condition as regards
 the amount of heat which they received. Yet experiments of this
 kind have not given definite results      and      may be shown that

soil the same,      it         by
                        no means follows that the plant receives
equal quantities of heat.
   It has been observed that the growth of certain species de
pends on the quantity of heat       while in the case of others the

     If
      the conditions of vegetation are to be properly investi
gated and reduced to an exact basis, this can only be done by
taking into account the physical properties. It only when we         is
know how much the thermal capacities of various soils differ, that

 58         M. Pfaundler    on the Influence  of the Physical
 we can pronounce any opinion as to the importance or unim
 portance of these investigations.
     The method adopted was the method of mixtures ; and an
 apparatus was used which had been originally devised by Re-
 gnault, and which Pfaundler recommends for its convenience and
 accuracy.    It consists essentially of a tin-plate canister shaped
 like a bottle and supported on uprights by means of two lateral
 axes, so that it can be tilted up ; in the neck of the canister a
 stout large-sized test-tube, or eprouvette, is fixed by means of
 a tightly fitting cork.    The canister contains water, which is
 kept boiling by means of a spirit-lamp, while the steam emerges
 through a lateral tube which at the same time serves as one of
 the axes. The substance under investigation, dried at a constant
 temperature, was placed in the eprouvette, and the whole weighed ;
 the mouth of the eprouvette was closed by cotton-wool, and the
 substance could thus be heated to the temperature of boiling
 water ; control experiments indicated what length of time was
 necessary for this purpose.       No thermometer was used; the
 temperature was obtained from the reduced barometric height
 by means of boiling-point tables.
    When a given weight of the substance had been raised to the
 proper temperature, the apparatus was tilted so that the sub
 stance fell into the water of a calorimeter.        It is needless to
 enter upon the mode in which this was effected, or the precau
 tions taken to avoid sources of error.     There was nothing essen
 tially new in the construction of the calorimeter ; suffice to say
 that great care was taken to have very delicate and accurate
 thermometers,    by means of which            of a degree could be
 read off, and that the calorimeter was provided with a stirrer,
 which could be moved with regularity by means of wheelwork.
 Those who are familiar with the construction of Regnault's ap
 paratus for specific heat will remember that the heating-apparatus
 is fixed and the calorimeter moveable, while in the present appa
 ratus the exact opposite is the case — an arrangement which
 Pfaundler considers to have several advantages.       The eprouvette
was weighed after the experiment ; and the difference between
the two weighings gave the weight of the substance taken.
    Several kinds of earths present peculiar difficulties.      Light
dusty soils remain for a long time floating on the surface of the
water before they are melted and sink down. Substances rich in
humus and turf do not sink at all, and therefore require special
arrangements : they are pressed in small cylinders of tinfoil the
size of a lead pencil, from six to nine of which can be brought
into the eprouvette, the water value of the tinfoil being of course
taken into account.      With very light soils this was inapplicable,
and they were stamped into small brass boxes of the thinnest

                        Properties of Soils on Vegetation.                        69
brass plate,     of the diameter of the eprouvette, and the same height,
provided with lids.          Five or six of these could       be   brought into
the eprouvette.
   By this arrangement two sources of error could be eliminated :
the first was the absorption of heat by the solution of the salts
contained in water ; and the other, and more important, the
heat produced when these porous substances are moistened.       By
using turpentine instead of water, the former could be avoided
but not determined ; and it was thought that the other could be
got rid of by the boxes. Both errors were eliminated by a coun-
terexperiment with an equal weight of the same substance at
the same temperature as the water.      With a weight of 20 grms.
the heating amounted to from 0°01 to 0O-16 C, which in all
cases was deducted from the maximum calculated.
    In order to introduce the correction for the heat which the
calorimeter loses by contact with the surrounding air when the
substance has been placed in          it,
                                   Pfaundler uses method devised
                                                          a
 by  Regnault, which he details at length.
    He finally discusses the influence of various sources of error.
These consist (1) in the uncertainty of the weighings, (2) in the
measurement of the quantity of water, (3) in obtaining equality
of temperature in the interior of the eprouvette and in the
 steam, (4) in reading off the barometric height (the sum of
these errors does not exceed 000083 of the total result) while          ;
the fifth and most important source consists in the uncertainty
in reading off the thermometer in the calorimeter (this may
 amount to 0'004 of the total result)    But in substance whose
                                            .             a
 specific heat    = 0'2, the sum of these errors amounts, in the

                                                a
place.
   There are still two other sources: these are, first those
arising from an inaccurate calibration of the thermometer, and
in the determination of the loss of heat            ip.
                                           the calorimeter to the
surrounding medium. These were ascertained                     by
                                                         compara    a
tive experiment with Iceland spar and water,              by
                                                  which numbers
were obtained quite agreeing with those of Regnault and of Kopp.
This agreement shows at the same time the accuracy                           of   the
method, and its delicacy and convenience.
   From the, results obtained, which are detailed      the paper,  in
Pfaundler draws the following conclusions •—
   The limits of the thermal capacity of soils lie between 019
end O'OO     and we may say that in round numbers
             ;                                             varies       it
between one-half and one-fifth  of  the specific  heat  of water.
Soils free from humus have the lowest specific heats and            ;         it   is
immaterial whether they consist chiefly of silicates or of lime.
This   is   intelligible,   considering that calcareous        spar and rock

60        Influence   of   the   Physical properties of Soils on Vegetation.
crystal have the very similar specific heats 0"20 and 0- 19, and that,
moreover, most of the other silicates have values very near 0'19,
according to Neumann and Kopp's determinations.               Magne-
sian spar also agrees completely with calcareous spar.
    We shall not be far out in ascribing to all dry soils free from
humus a common thermal capacity of about                     j.
                                                          The highest
thermal capacity           I
                       observed was that of turf (0 507).     Next to
it stands the soil which contains most humus of all which           in        I
vestigated (from    the  top  of the  Schneeberg),  with 0-4143;   and
next to this is the soil from the granite plateau, in Miihlviertel,
with 0'3489, which is likewise very rich in humus.
    The rest of the earths lie between these extremes, according to
their proportion of humus.         Most of them have a specific heat
of 0 25 to 0-28.
    Besides the greater proportion of organic remains, a high per
centage of water must materially raise the thermal capacity.
Hence clayey soils more especially, which absorb and retain
water, must come near the soils richest in humus.
    Hence we now know that the geognostic character of the sub
stratum is of inconsiderable importance as concerns the relation
to heat j and in its place we must put proportion of humus and
power of retaining water.        To these, therefore, most attention
must be paid     in future  investigations.
    It has been observed that plants which occur usually on schists
can grow also upon a lime substratum, if this is covered with a
strong cushion of humus.            This is explained by saying that
this layer of humus keeps the lime from the plant ; but may it
not also be that this humuseacts, in a certain sense, as a substitute
for those very moist loamy soils so frequently formed by the
 disintegration of the schist ? for both substrata belong to the same
 class as regards their capacity for heat.
     A complete solution of the question can only be obtained with

 while some indications may he given of the influence which a
 difference in the thermal capacity of earths exerts on the tempe

     If equal quantities of earth with equal surfaces, one with the
 specific heat =0*2 and the other =0*4, both at the same tem
 perature, be exposed to the heating action of the sun and warm
 air, the first warms sooner than the second.         Hence     for in- if,       .

     According to Riidorff*, the body which is obtained by de
 composing with water solid iodide of phosphorus (prepared from
 6 grms. phosphorus and 50 grms. iodine dissolved in 100 cub.
 centims. CS2) is not phosphorus, but is solid phosphoretted hy
 drogen, with all the properties which have been ascribed to it by
 Leverrier and P. Thenard. The analysis was effected partly by
 decomposing the compound (by heating it in an inactive gas)
 into phosphorus, phosphoretted hydrogen, and hydrogen, and
 removing the phosphoretted hydrogen by solution of copper,
 and partly by oxidizing the phosphorus in another specimen to
 phosphoric acid.     It led to the formula P2 H. The product is
 from 1'9 to 2 '6 per cent, of the iodide of phosphorus, and the
 decomposition is probably
    20PI4 + 48HO = 2P2H + 2PH3 + 3P05+11P08 + 40HI:
 this would require 2*2 per cent.
     In order to determine the nitrogen of ammoniacal salts, Wohler
 some time ago proposed a method which consisted in treating
 them with bleaching-powder, by which the salt was decomposed,
 so that the nitrogen was liberated as gas.        Knop modified this by
 proposing to substitute a solution of hypochlorite of soda contain
 ing bromine for the solution of bleaching-powder.          This method
 of Knop's is recommended by Dietrich *. The solution for decom
 position is prepared by precipitating good bleaching-powder with
 carbonate of soda, and adding 2 to 3 grms. of bromine to a litre
 of the solution after it has been made strongly alkaline. Its
  strength is then estimated by a standard solution of arsenite of
  soda.    50 cub. centims. of this solution had the power of libe
  rating 200 milligrammes of nitrogen. For the determination
  50 cub. centims. were always taken, and the substance either
  dissolved in 10 cub. centims. of water, or stirred up with it in
  case it was insoluble.     Making the usual correction for the vol
  ume read off, and allowing for the gas which remained in solu
  tion in the liquid, the author obtained very accurate results.
  As it only takes a short time, it may be used for determining
  the ammonia contained in the hydrochloric acid in Will and
  Varrentrapp's method of determining nitrogen. By this method
  the small quantities of phosphoric acid can be determined by
  measuring the nitrogen which is disengaged from the precipi-

 periments of the author, this precipitate contains three atoms of
 ammonia for one of phosphoric acid ; and therefore 42 parts by
 weight of nitrogen correspond to 71 parts by weight of phos
 phoric acid.
     Stahlschmidt obtained the following as the results of some
  experiments on the reducing-action of zinc*.                In the presence
  of a soluble alkali, finely divided zinc reduces nitrates almost
  immediately into nitrites ; so that this method may be conve
  niently used for the preparation of the latter.            Zinc-dust can be
  had at almost every zincworks               consists of zinc 39-99, lead
                                            (it
  2-47, cadmium 4-09, oxide of zinc 49 76, and carbonate of zinc
  3"29), and may be advantageously used for these experiments
  after having been washed with acids and water.
     If to saturated solution of nitrate of potash zinc-powder be
          a
  added, and the mixture allowed to stand several days, nitrite of
  potash and oxide of zinc are formed, with           asmall quantity of free
  potash.    If the temperature be raised to 60°, oxide of zinc, free
  ammonia, and potash are formed, along with               asmall quantity of
  nitrite of potash,     while nitrogen      isliberated.     On boiling the
  liquid, oxide of zinc, potash, and ammonia are formed, scarcely
  any nitrite of potash, and much nitrogen.               Nitrite of potash   is
  obtained in large quantities on mixing          a   solution of nitre satu
  rated at 30°-40° with one-tenth the volume of ammonia, and
  adding zinc-powder the violence of the reaction requires to be
                          ;
  moderated by cooling.        The decomposition of the nitre can be
  recognized    by the  fact that  the solution freed from ammonia and
  oxide of zinc gives no crystalline precipitate on the addition of
  four times the volume of alcohol.         The solution freed from am-

   1     "On the     means of increasing the Quantity of Electricity
given by Induction-Machines."            By the Rev. T. Romney Robinson,
 D.D.
    Among the remarkable results obtained by studying the spectra of
 electric discharges, is the change exhibited by certain substances when
 the nature of the discharge is varied.         In general the mere spark
 shows fewer and fainter lines than when a Leydenjaris in connexion,
 though the amount of electricity supplied by the machine is the
same.      In the latter case, however, the discharge passes almost
instantaneously, and therefore its concentrated action will be more
 powerful.                      I
               But, as far as know, much has not been attempted to
 wards increasing the power of the jar : this cannot be done by in
creasing its surface (unless indeed that be too small to condense all
the electricity supplied) ; the supply itself must be increased.
    This may be done in three ways : —
    First, the power of the exciting battery may be increased. This,
 however, is limited by the risk of destroying the acting surfaces of
 the rheotome ; and by the decreasing rate at which the magnetism
of the iron core increases with the primary current.           In some in
vestigations on the electromagnet (Trans. Irish Academy, vol. xxiii.
p. 529) I have shown that its lifting power L is approximately given
 by the equation
                                    T-   A*
in which     ¥  is the product      of the current and number of spires,
A the maximum lift of the         magnet,  and B the ¥ which would excite
it to half A.       The    rate  of change   %—   is therefore inversely as
 (B + ¥)\ The results obtained with two of the magnets which I used
will illustrate this.     Their A's are 781 lbs. and 278 lbs. The first
 1000 of ¥ make their lifts 576 and 235 ; the second 1000 adds to
these 87 and 19 ; the third 35 and 8; and the fourth only 19 and
3. With a primary of 180 spires, ¥=4000 implies a current which
can evolve in a voltameter 34 ¦7 cubic inches of gases per minute, and
of course has great deflagrating power. There is therefore not much
to be gained in this direction.
    Secondly, the secondary helix may be made of longer or thicker
wire.    It will be shown immediately that the length does not increase
the quantity of the current at all, and that the effect of the thickness
is limited.

64       Royal Society : — Rev. T. R. Robinson on increasing
   Thirdly, the analogy of the voltaic battery suggests the plan of
combining several helices collaterally, as is done when cells are ar
ranged for quantity ; and this I think may avail to a very great
extent.
    In spectral work, as in most other applications of the inductorium
(as the Germans have named it), the breaking current alone is of im
portance : the other, though equal in quantity, is so much inferior
in tension that it is stopped by a thin film of highly rarefied air*.
This current proceeds from two causes.       When the circuit is broken,
the current in the primary ceases, — not instantaneously f, but in a
time which is very small — according to Edlund, less than -^wu °^ a
second.     During its decline it induces a current iu the secondary.
But while it was passing it had magnetized the iron core of the
apparatus : this magnetism now passes away, and in doing so it also
induces a current in the secondary, which lasts longer and is more
powerful than the other.          I
                                 compared the two by measuring those
given   when   the core was  removed   from a primary, and when it was
in its place : they were as 1 : 8-62 when the rbeotome made 17 dis
charges in a second ; so that in round numbers the electric induc
tion was only a tenth of the whole effect.      I shall therefore in what
follows   confine  myself to the magnetic  induction.
    If y be the magnetism at any time t, M its maximum, P the poten
tial of the magnet on the secondary helix, n the potential of that
helix on itself, r the resistance of the secondary circuit, <p the secon
dary current at the time t, we have, as is well known,
                              r        dt    r   dt
the last term being the counter-current produced by the reaction of
<j>
  on the helix.   If the inductive coefficient of electric action be dif
ferent from that of magnetic, II should be multiplied                by
                                                                 factor   a      e,
which in (5) will multiply     in the exponent and denominator.
                                  fi                                           I
see no reason why they should differ, unless some work be lost by
molecular changes in the core when excited. The great difference
between the two currents which        have just mentioned arises most
                                            I
probably from the different values of in the exponentials.
                                                 t
   To integrate (a) we must assume some relation between dy and dt.
The most probable       that the loss of magnetism
                         is                                 as the mag
                                                                is
netism, which gives      ^=—/xdt, whence y=Me~>lt.
  *   This not quite correct. Mr. Gassiot showed, from the reversed curvature
          is
of the strata in an exhausted tube, that some of the closing current does pass
when the action      powerful. The same conclusion follows from a fact which
                    is                                                         I
observed last year with Mr. Atkinson's magnificent EuhnikorlT.     In general when
a discharge     made between platinum points, the negative one only
               is                                                          ignited

in this case the positive one was so also, though to a far less degree and for half
the length.

     From this it follows that          r may  be neglected        :  that         is
                                       o               ¦

 nearly unity ; and that the difference between F and * increases as
 b diminishes.
     "When equal helices are consecutive, b as well as F are unchanged ;
 therefore so is 4>.
     When they are collateral, each separate d remains unchanged
 (unless they be so close that they react on each other) ; and there
 fore, as with F, the resultant $ is the sum of its components.
      If the resistance of the wire be diminished by increasing its section
 without making much change in the dimensions of the helix, b is
  diminished, and therefore the coefficient of F.          It is evident from the
 form of equation (c) that * has a maximum for r, and that beyond
 this there is actual loss of power in increasing the thickness of the
 wire.
      It remained to test these views by experiment, but the task has
 some difficulties.      A single discharge of inductive electricity is usually
  determined by the swing which it causes in a galvanometer needle ;
 but it is scarcely possible to get two discharges exactly equal. The
  slightest variation in the manner of breaking the circuit, the least
  oxidation or roughening of the surfaces where the break is made,
  change the result ; and therefore it seemed best to take the actual
  working of the inductorium, in hopes that the average of some thou
  sand discharges must be near the real value of the current.
      The rheometer which I used is Weber's (for the use of which                    I
  am indebted to the kindness of Mr. Gassiot), and it showed an
  amount of fluctuation even greater than            I  expected.        With every
  precaution as to the action of the rheotome, the mirror of the Weber
  never becomes stationary, and the oscillations are irregular ; twelve
  of them were taken for each set, of course read at each end and
  reduced by the usual formula ; yet the sets differ so much, that                    I
   only offer their results as tolerable approximations.             Two facts illus
  trating this uncertainty may be mentioned. With a mechanical
  rheotome driven at a uniform speed, and its acting surfaces platinum,
  the ratios of the current were —
            When    set so that the point rises  \                    1-0000
               but little from the anvil   ....  J

            Rise still greater, tension of spring greater      . .    1*9685
            Rise still greater, tension further increased      . .    1*8371
       Here a slight change of the adjustment nearly doubles the action
   of the inductorium.
       Another cause of uncertainty is the variable speed of the rheotome.
   In general it is worked by the primary current, and therefore is
   affected by fluctuation of the battery and the extra current of the pri
   mary.     The mechanical rheotome which         I  have mentioned is driven
   by clockwork, and its speed can be exactly regulated.                   With it    I

     No.    10 was    taken with a mercurial rheotome; and the remaining
three with       a spring one, such as Mr. Ladd applies to his inductoria*.
      This decrease of power is due to the core requiring time to he
magnetized.          Suppose the current =A + B£, A being that caused by
the electric induction, B by the magnetic, I get from the above by
minimum squares            A=0    0802   ; B=4-1713     ;           ; which values
                                                          ^-=508
represent theobservations pretty fairly, the probable error being
  + 0'0491.        Three cells were used here: on another trial with five
 I had      ^=129, confirming         a previous remark that the electric induc
 tion increases faster than the magnetic.            Hence much power is lost
 by working at too high a speed.
      The inductorium which I use consists of a strong oak table, on
 which are fixed vertically four primary helices, their axes being 1 2
 and 18 inches apart ; at which distance the mutual action of the
 secondary helices is scarcely sensible in the Weber.                I denote these
 primaries by        P',  P", &c.     Their  wire is No.  12 ;  P' and  P" are 12-5
  inches long ; they have, in four layers, the first 383 spires, the
  second 343f.           Their cores of iron wire, No. 18, are 1-12 diameter.
  P'" and PiT are 13-5 inches long ; they have each 181 spires in two
  layers, and their cores are 1-60 diameter. They are all insulated by
  strong glass jars, and their connectors are so arranged that the current
  can be sent through any one separately, or through all at once.
   The normal arrangement is that the battery-current passes through
   P'", then through P' and P" collateral, and lastly through P".
   Thus the *P or exciting power of each primary is nearly the same.
   On a shelf below stands a Fizeau's condenser, each of whose coatings
   is 120 feet divided into five sections.            This, though so potent in
   respect of sparks, does not affect the quantity, which with it I found
   as 1-0000, without it 0-9948, a difference not worth noting.                 The
   case, however, would be different if there were a gaseous interval in
       * For the first nine of these the time was given by the clockwork of the
    rheotome ; for the rest by dropping sparks on a slip of prepared paper, which
    was made to travel at the rate of 12 inches per second.
       t  The difference arose from the cotton lapping being thicker in P".

         The first six were made by Mr. Ladd, who also determined for me
    the length and number of layers.             The thickness of the wires was
    measured by me with a fuhlhebel which read to 0-0001 : each is a
    mean of ten measures at different places, for no wire that                 I  have ever
    tried is quite uniform.       The two last are experimental, their wire not
    being lapped, but merely insulated by a varnish of wax and rosin, as
   proposed by the late Dr. Callan : this plan does well for quantity,
    but cannot be trusted for any high tension.
        The potentials were computed, supposing the helices at the middle
    of the primary P'" (where they are a maximum).                        For G     I  com
   puted them in four other positions, and had the curiosity also to

      F is computed with a correction for the place of the helix on the
  primary, and with a resistance which includes that of the Weber
  = 0-00779. The Weber must have a considerable n of its own ; but
  as I did not know its constants, and as this II must vary with the
  deflection, I did not compute it.                 Possibly some of the discrepancies
  may       be  owing     to   this.   The    sparks show the difference of tension ;
  they       were     taken    with   platinum points, and when the machine was
  excited by four Groves. The column, sum of components, gives for
  the collateral combinations the values which arise from adding the *
  of each helix, taking into account the Weber's resistance.
      1. It will be observed that G + H with twice as many spires, and
  V+V with thrice as many as G, give the same current ; so also that
      I
  of + K is near that of I.
     2. On the other hand, G . H is twice G, and V .                        V  twice V+V.
     3. It      is   also  manifest      that  the   effect    of  I is  not  proportional to
 its diminished resistance : its F is               4*4   times    greater   than    that of G,
 but its actual current is only 2-5.                 This    is at  once  explained by its b
 being so much less.                So also the ratio of the theoretic to the effec
 tive current is nearly unity in G + H, while it is only 0"73in V+V,
 and for the same reason.                In G . H . (I + K) the ratio is still smaller ;
 but    I   shall recur to this.

 on the others.              I had some doubt whether the difference of the

 cores might not influence the results, and tried this with P', P"', and
 one P", whose core = 1-90 inch in diameter and 15'5 inches long. It
 has 349 spires of No. 15 in two layers.                  G was put on each of them,
  and currents transmitted, which made their                          nearly equal.

      1.  As    before, two helices in series give no increase of quantity ;
  M+N       is the same as N, G +         L   nearly the mean of G and L.
      2. The quantity of collateral helices is seen in column 6 (as in Table
  II.)   to be the sum of the separate actions of each.                     The discrepan
  cies are not greater than what can be explained by the uncertainties
  inherent in these measures, which I have already described.                          One

  second was close, and gave 1 0207.
     f                     I
        At the same time tried two helices similar to A and B, except that their
 wire is varnished iron, which were given to me by Dr. Callan. Their 4> is
 0-6887, and their spark only 0 524 in. The              *    of A + B is 2 9138 times as
 great, a difference caused solely by the greater resistance of the iron.

               the Electricity given by Induction-Machines.                     71
 apparent exception is a strong confirmation of this rule — the case of
 G . H (I + K). Its observed 0=3-0552, while the sum =4-6220.
 G and I being on the same primary are excited together ; but in
 measuring either, as there is no current in the other (but merely a
 state of tension), their II is not changed.            When, however, they
 are connected collaterally, the currents react on each other, their ITs
 are increased : the $'s are thus diminished, and therefore their re
 sultant is the sum of quantities less than those used in the computa
 tion.    The b's in this case become— for G 0'94289, for H 0-79885,
 and for I + K 0-34588, which are quite sufficient to account for the
difference.
    3. As with     I in Table II., so here it will be observed that N has
less relative power than either I or K ; its actual power is even less,
 though its theoretical force exceeds theirs in the proportion of 5 : 4.
 This is explained by its b being so much smaller ; but it gives this
 important information, that, at least in helices of these dimensions,
nothing is gained by using wire thicker than that of I, or -jU inch*.
    4. The effect of L is far less than that of I + K.           In the first the
helices are on the same primary, in the other on separate ones.                 In
the former case the II is larger, for it is the sum of the II of each on
itself, and those of each on the other ; b therefore is less.             Besides,
the potential of the core on the helices is less than when each of them
is central on it.
    The difference is even more remarkable in O as compared to its
elements M + N, its effect being only0-7 of the other, and 0-3 of
the theoretic power.        The same disparity of course prevails in their
combinations ; 0 . L giving only 3-46, while the same four helices
arranged on separate primaries give 8- 1 9.                The combinations
G . H (I + K) and G . L . H have the same helices ; but in the first
two were on the same primaries.           As, however, they were 1'5 inch
instead of 0-5 apart, the II was not so much increased as in the other
cases, and therefore there is not quite so great a decrease of power.
    The following practical maxims may be deduced from the expe
riments and reasoning which I have related.
    The attention of instrument-makers has been chiefly directed
towards increasing the length of spark given by these machines, and
in this they have succeeded to a surprising degree ; but in doing
so they have not added to the quantity of electricity which is pro
duced by them.        This, however, is by far the most important object ;
for in most applications of the inductorium all tension above what is
necessary to force the necessary quantity of current through the cir
cuit is useless, nay sometimes injuriousf.           I am inclined to think
that a tension which gives sparks of 4 inches will be found quite
sufficient in ordinary cases, and this will be given by about 20,000
spires ; all beyond only adding to the weight of the instrument,
its cost, and the difficulty of insuring its insulation.             It must be
kept   in mind    that  the mere    quantity  is  independent     of  the length
   * This is between 27 and 28 of the Birmingham wire-gauge.      I believe Buhm-
korff uses 28.
   t It has often been remarked that intense discharges  will not show strata well

 of wire :     I  actually found it the same for a flat spiral of 21 spires
 and for a helix of 13,655.
     It is not,     I believe, ascertained   what is the best proportion of
 height and diameter for a secondary helix of a given number of
 spires.      It is generally made as long as its primary, though perhaps
 not on any definite principle.         The magnetic potential P is in this
 form a little greater than in that which         I  used, but so also is II : the
 length     of  wire  is less, which  increases   F,  but also decreases b ; and
 it priori it is not easy to decide which way the balance inclines.
 The II is something less if the spires be in separate sections than if
 they be in one continuous coil.
     The dimensions of the core do not seem to be of importance as to
 quantity within the limits which          I  tried ; their length seems to in
 crease the tension.
     The quantity is greatly diminished when the rheotome works
 rapidly ; and in spectral work the probable limit of its slowness is
 that the impression on the eye shall be continuous.
     The quantity increases with the diameter of the wire up to a maxi
 mum, which is attained when this is about the sixty-fifth of an inch.
     Helices may be combined either for tension or quantity without
 much loss of these respective powers*.
     If for the first, they are combined in series ; the general tension
 is the sum of the individual ones, and in this way we can obtain
 sparks of a length limited only by the strength of the insulator
 which is interposed between the primary and secondary helices.
 If  the latter be all of the same wire, the quantity remains unchanged ;
 if they differ in this respect, it will be intermediate between the weakest
 and strongest.
     If  they are combined for quantity, they must be set collaterally,
 i. e. all their positive terminals connected, and all their negative. The
 resulting current will be the sum of all the separate ones, but the
 tension is not increased ; the sparks seem even a few hundredths of
 an inch shorter, but are much denser, and in the higher combi
 nations approach to the character of a jar discharge.              Hence there
 is no risk to the apparatus by extending this mode of combination to
 any extent.
     It deserves notice that the helices need not be equal in tension
or resistance ; thus the arraugement G . K gives little less than the
 sum of its components, though K has only half as many spires as G
 and but a tenth of its resistance.
    In combining these instruments, the primaries should not be con
 secutive if of large numbers, for so the action of their extra-current
would be very destructive to the rheotome ; with P' + P" containing
 726 spires in series the spark in the mercurial one is almost explo
sive, but when they are collateral it works quietly.            Were, however,
ten or twelve to be so combined, it would require a battery of very
large cells to maintain the current, and it is better to have a separate
battery for each pair of primaries.                    I
                                             In this find no difficulty ; the
negative    f   poles of all the batteries are connected with the mer-

cury   of the rheotome ; from its platinum point, separate wires go
to  the entering bind-screw of each primary, other wires go from their
exit bind-screws to the positive poles of their respective batteries, and
thus their action is perfectly simultaneous.              Of course, if many bat
teries were used, the current in the rheotome might be too power
ful, but then there would be no difficulty in having separate rheo-
tomes worked by one electromagnet, and (at least with the mercurial
form) adjusting them by a revolving mirror to perfect synchronism.
                    I
   In this way feel sure that we can attain an amount of electric
power which has not yet been approached by the inductorium, and
which may be expected to be a most powerful means of research in
those inquiries to which         I  referred at the commencement of this
paper.    At    the  head   of  these   stands the palmary discovery of Mr.
Huggins,     that  there  are  nebulse    and comets whose matter possesses
spectral   attributes   not  corresponding       to that of the sun, the stars,
or  our  own earthly      elements.       Is  that   difference an indication of
some body      sui generis,  or   a mere     result  of peculiar temperature or
other molecular conditions ?           Is, for instance, the bright line, cor
responding to one of nitrogen, which occurs, we may say, normally,
produced by nitrogen as such ?              If  so, what has blotted out the
other bright lines of      that    magnificent spectrum ?           Is it due to an
element of nitrogen,     dissociated     by  some   enormous      temperature from
other elements, perhaps         from    hydrogen,     one   line   of which is also
present ?     And the third      line,  elsewhere    unknown      —  is it the herald
of a new body, or merely a derivative           from    another spectrum?          We
cannot even hope for an answer to these questions till the spectra
of at least those elements which seem cosmical have been examined
through a range of temperature extending from the lowest that
developes in them luminous lines, to the highest that is excited by
the most potent electric discharges which we can produce aud control.
Now, to obtain such a graduated range, the plan of combination
which     I
          have been describing seems well fitted.              It, of course, cannot
be expected to equal, under any extension, the wonderful voltaic bat
tery of Mr. Gassiot (at least its arc-discharge); but how few can avail
themselves of such an instrument as that!              But  if,  as seems probable,
we can without much difficulty increase the heating-power of the
induction-discharge an hundredfold, we shall have made                 a    very great
step,   and   by   means   which     are   everywhere     accessible.      Inductoria
are common;         there are few situations where           a     physicist cannot
obtain access to several, and combine them as Despretz did the voltaic
batteries of Paris to make the experiments which have thrown such
splendour on his name.

      "A Description of some Echinodermata from the Cretaceous
     1.
rocks of Sinai."  By P. Martin Duncan, M.B., Sec. G.S.
   The existence of Cretaceous rocks in the district of Sinai has been

  74                        Geological Society.
  surmised for several years ; but, owing to the scarcity of fossils, they
  have   not been correlated with any of the Asiatic formations.        An
  examination of the Echinodermata collected by the Rev. F. W. Hol
  land from the limestones of Wady Mokatteb and Wady Badera has
  enabled Dr. Duncan to show their parallelism with the red lime
  stones in South-eastern Arabia, the fossils from which he described
 in a former paper. All the species now determined are well-known
 forms, characteristic of the typical Upper Greensand of Europe ;
 but those formerly described from Sinai by MM. Desor and D'Or-
 bigny seem to be peculiar to that region. The author observed that
  by adding the Echinodermata from Sinai to those from South-east
 Arabia, we obtain a fauna eminently characteristic of the Middle
  Cretaceous period ; and in conclusion he drew attention to the
 interesting fact that the majority of the wide- wandering Echinoderms
 had a tendency to vary from their types both in Europe and in
 Arabia, while the rest remained persistent in form.
     2.  " Geological Description of the First Cataract, Upper
                                                                 Egypt."
 By J. C. Hawkshaw, Esq., F.G.S.
     At the First Cataract the Nile flows over crystalline rocks consist
 ing principally     of quartz, felspar, and hornblende, combined in
 various proportions, and there appearing under the forms of syenite,
 greenstone, hornblende, and mica-schists, or else occurring in sepa
 rate masses.      In the bed of the river the surface of the harder por
 tions of these rocks is beautifully polished.      The whole district is
  traversed by dykes of greenstone, of which the prevailing direction
 is E. and W.
     The crystalline rocks forming the bed of the river are overlain by
 a sandstone, sometimes coarse and gritty, and at other times fine
 grained and compact. The prevailing colour is light yellow ; but in
 places it is dark purple, and even black, owing to the presence of
 iron.    As yet no organic remains have been discovered in it. This
 sandstone rests on the uneven surface of the syenite in slightly
 inclined strata, dipping N.N.E. It is nowhere altered at its junction
 with the syenite, nor is it anywhere penetrated by dykes.
     To the eastward.of the First Cataract is a wide valley, commencing
 opposite the Island of Philse, and joining the Nile valley again about
three miles below Assouan.          Through this valley the Nile may
have formerly flowed, as freshwater shells and deposits of Nile-mud
are found at a considerable height above the present level of the
river.
     To the westward of the First Cataract the crystalline rocks dis
appear below the sandstone, and the country is almost entirely
covered with sand of a rich yellow colour, composed of fine rounded
grains of quartz.
     3. « On the Drift of the North of England." By J. Curry, Esq.
     Having first given a general sketch of the district under considera
tion, and noticed the various rock-formations occurring therein, the
author described in detail the distribution of the drift, showing that
the prevailing direction in which it had been carried was from north
west to south-east, with certain variations, dependent upon the con

                Intelligence   and Miscellaneous Articles.              75
figuration of the land.       He then described the wide distribution of
Shap-Fell granite, especially referring to its occurrence in radial
lines from the granitic mass, and called attention to the fact that
detritus of various rocks in the vicinity of the lakes has been carried
over the Stainmore ridge into the valley of the Tees.           Mr. Curry
then described the occurrence of drift along the western slope of the
Pennine chain, and from Castle Carrock across the northern end of
that chain, as well as in the valleys of the Tyne and the Tees,
pointing out also the absence of drift from Alston Moor and Upper
Teeldale, and down the valley of the Wear to the city of Durham.
In conclusion the author discussed the manner in which the drift-
materials had been transported, referring it chiefly to marine opera
tions on ancient shore-lines at various altitudes ; and in explanation
of the fact that the upper limit of the drift is not at a uniform ele
vation, he suggested that it may in great measure be due to a varia
tion in the volume of the ocean, instead of to elevations and depres
 sions of the earth's crust.

              OBSERVATIONS BY A NEW OPTICAL METHOD.
                                BY A. TOPLER.
            want in practical optics of some method of detecting before- .
 THE     hand the existence in glass intended for lenses of places of vary
 ing densities, so-called tears (Schliere), led the author to construct an
 apparatus, which not only achieves the object in question, but has also
 been found applicable to determining differences of density in all
possible transparent media.
      The light proceeding from a bright lamp through the aperture of
 a small shade falls upon a system of lenses of large aperture as apla-
 natic and achromatic as possible (the head of a photographic appa
 ratus). The transmitted light concentrates in a focus at a distance of
 from 10 to 25 feet on the other side.       A simple Keplerian telescope
 consisting of two lenses is so set up that its optical axis coincides
 with the axis of the system of lenses in question, and that the focus
 of the rays issuing from the system of lenses lies in front of the
 object-glass of the telescope. The telescope, moreover, is so drawn
  out that the rays issuing from the eyepiece have their point of junc
  tion in the pupil of the eye, and hence project on the retina the
  image of a uniformly illuminated field of view.           If a screen be
  laterally pushed in front of the object-glass of the telescope, as soon
   as its edge passes by the place of the focus the field of view will
   at once become dark.      If either in the glass of the system of lenses
   in question, or in media which are interposed before or behind it,
   there are places of different densities, some rays will thereby be de
   flected from their path, not pass through the focus, and hence not
   disappear when the screen is pushed across ; these rays give then
   in the dark field of view an image of the tear, by which name the
   author designates in general places of different densities in a trans
   parent medium.
      The apparatus constructed by this method served, at first, only

 76                Intelligence and Miscellaneous     Articles.
 to detect tears in glass in the proper sense of the word ; and the
 result was, that in thick plates of glass, such as are used for making
 ordinary spectacle-glasses,       a square inch of perfectly homogeneous
 glass was sought in vain.          Those tears were found most injurious
 which in the apparatus presented the appearance of a surface covered
 with fine pencil-marks.
     Irregularities in density in the air which were produced by ascend
 ing warm air could be recognized even if the difference in tempera
 ture of the warm body and of the surrounding air only amounted to
 0°"6.     Unequally warmed or pressed glass also exhibited distinct
 tears.     For a study of the issue of different gases into the air the
 apparatus was also used ; and it was observed that a jet of coal-gas
 ascending vertically preserved a coherent cylinder for a longer time
 than carbonic acid which descended vertically.          The evaporation of
 alcohol, even at the temperature of 0° C, could be detected by means
 of the apparatus. The investigation of flame showed that, besides
 the different envelopes which are visible to the naked eye, there is
 an external one which surrounds the entire flame and obviously arises
 from the heated air.
    To the observation of the electric spark the author devoted espe
cial attention, and the view was confirmed that the spark in jumping
 across rarefies the air.     It is of especial interest to observe how the
 sound-waves become visible in the apparatus when the sound is
 produced by the jumping spark ; the author by the naked eye could
 even observe the diffraction, refraction, and reflection of sound. Un
 fortunately he did not succeed in contriving an objective representa
 tion of these phenomena. — From a Review in the Fortschritte der

    OBSERVATIONS ON CERTAIN LINES OF THE SOLAR SPECTRUM.
                               BY M. ANGSTROM.
    I   have  read   with great interest    a note by M. Janssen on the
 telluric rays of the solar spectrum, in which the author points out a
 mode of experimentally obtaining these.          Having been occupied for
more than three years with the determination of the wave-lengths
 of a great number of Fraunhofer's lines, I have frequently had occa
sion to observe the telluric rays, and that under circumstances
rarely offered to observers who are placed in a lower latitude than
that of Upsala.
    M. Janssen says, in his note, that aqueous vapour produces in the
solar spectrum five groups of obscure lines, extending from D to A,
and among which would be found the group A and a great part of
B. I also think that A and B are telluric lines ; but they are not
due to aqueous vapour.           The following are the facts on which I
rely.     During    the great  colds  of January 1864, I several times ob
served the solar spectrum at Upsala, and once at a temperature of
— 27° C. The telluric lines near D, C, and a, as well as those from a
to B, had almost entirely disappeared ; while the groups A and B,
and a third, situated near the middle between B and C, and which
Sir B. Brewster designates by the letter C, were very intense, more
so even than they were in summer for the same height of the sun.

                     Intelligence   and Miscellaneous   Articles.         77
These three groups all present the same aspect : they consist of a
very marked line, and of a series of very fine ones, almost equally
distant ; the intensity alone increases in going from C towards A.
The constant appearance of these three groups, and their similarity
of aspect, lead us to attribute them to a common origin ; but, as           I
have said, this is not to be sought in the action of aqueous vapour,
but rather in that of a permanent gas, carbonic acid for instance.
    The spectra of the compound gases, and more especially those of
metallic oxides, present great similarity to the groups in question ;
and this leads me to suppose that they are due to the absorption
exerted by a compound gas.           That they belong to our atmosphere,
and not to that of the       sun, follows from the change of intensity of
B, and especially of C, with the height of the sun, and also from
their general appearance ; for they have not, like all others which
possess a certain intensity, a direct relation with the spectrum of a
simple body.
    The hypothesis of the solar origin of Fraunhofer's lines has this
consequence, that the spectrum formed by rays emanating from the
edge of the star ought to show these lines more strongly than does
the spectrum of the rays from the centre. Yet this prevision of the
theory is not confirmed ; at all events the result has not corre
 sponded to the expectation of physicists.              The experiments of
 Mr. Forbes and myself have given a negative result. Yet a differ
 ence has been established ; the light in the centre has only furnished
in the middle of the spectrum the strongest of Fraunhofer's lines,
but with a very pronounced intensity : the contrary would have been
 expected.
    In the course of last year, in common with M. Thalen, I under
 took a comparison of the solar spectrum with that given by the iron
 electrodes of a battery of 50 elements.         We discovered more than
 460 lines corresponding to the iron lines.          These experiments led
 me to view the phenomena of absorption under a new point of view,
 which ought, I think, to dispel the contradiction which I have indi
 cated between theory and observation.
     If,for instance, we observe the iron lines by the aid of powerful
                                                                    a
 Ruhmkorff      'scoil, three very brilliant and some other feebler lines
 are observed between            and the strongest calcium lines.
                                   G                                      But
if  the inductorium        replaced by battery
                          is                  a   of fifty elements, not only
 does the number of lines very materially increase, but their relative
 intensity undergoes great changes.          Among the fifty lines which
 we then counted in this limited region of the spectrum, we could
 only with difficulty identify the three intense lines observed with
 the inductorium.
     Applying this result to the sun, we may suppose that the rays on
 the edge will not give       spectrum in which the most intense rays will
                               a
 have      relatively greater intensity, hut
           a                                     spectrum in which, on the
                                                    a
 contrary, the feeblest will be the most pronounced           ;the result will
 be  a   feebler spectrum — that        is,
                                        one without very pronounced rays.
 This      exactly what
           is              I have observed, although the difference of the
  two spectra be not considerable.            Iteasy to produce in the solar
                                                   is
 spectrum changes which have been ascertained in the iron spectrum.

78              Intelligence  and Miscellaneous  Articles.
It   is enough to pass the solar image in front of the aperture of the
collimator, so that at length the telescope only receives diffused light.
Most of Fraunhofer's lines appear then in a certain sense to become
effaced, while the others are strengthened ; these lines, which then
gain in intensity, are in general the intense lines of iron obtained
with the aid of the inductorium.
     Among the results arrived at in the research already cited, there
are two which appear worthy of attention.        The first is, the certain
presence of manganese        in the sun ; we have observed the coin
cidence of at least thirty lines.     The other is, the discovery of a
new hydrogen-line.         The spectrum of hydrogen presents, as is
well known, three lines — two of which coincide with C and F, and
the third with a line near G. The fourth line which we have ob
 served is near the middle of the interval between G and H ; it coin
 cides with a very intense solar line which we have designated by
 h.     With Geissler's tube this line is very distinctly seen, although
 it is much less feeble than the three others. This result is the more
 satisfactory, as the line h was the only one among those of a cer
 tain intensity whose origin still appeared mysterious. The explana
tion of it which we have found in the spectrum of hydrogen acquires
an additional interest from the fact that the line h occurs several times
 in the stellar spectra drawn by Mr. Huggins. As the relative in
 tensity of the spectral lines of hydrogen greatly depends on the den
 sity and elastic force of the gas, we may probably draw some con
 clusions in this respect from the intensity of the corresponding
 absorption-lines which exist in the solar spectrum.       This is a sub
 ject to which I shall recur. — Comptes Rendus, Oct. 15, 1866.
    REMARKS    ON THE ABOVE COMMUNICATION.             BY M. JANSSEN.'
                                     o
      The above observations of M. Angstrom refer to points of science
  with which I have closely occupied myself, and I propose shortly to
  discuss the 'results with the author.     But among M. Angstrom's
  results is one which, according to him, disaccords with the results
 I have recently published on the spectrum of aqueous vapour. On
  this point I shall reply at once.
      M. Angstrom, in measuring the wave-lengths of the solar spec
  trum, had occasion to observe telluric rays ; and having observed
  that some of them continued even during very cold weather (when
  the air, therefore, was extremely dry), he concludes that all the tel
  luric rays should not be attributed to the vapour of water. M. Ang
  strom especially cites A, B and a group between B and C.
      I will venture to remark that M. Angstrom is here combating
  me with my own ideas.       I have never thought or enounced that the
  spectrum of aqueous vapour would represent the totality of the
  telluric spectrum.     My investigations on the terrestrial atmosphere
  have had for their object to show that gases and vapours have at all
  temperatures the power of elective absorption, and that spectrum
  analysis might be applied to the study of the atmosphere of the
  planets as well as to that of the sun.
      Thus, having observed that Sir David Brewster's bands were re

                  Intelligence  and Miscellaneous     Articles.            79
solved into fine lines, I found analogous results for hyponitrous acid,
the vapour of iodine, bromine, &c.
    These facts were announced to the Philomathic Society of Paris
in December 1864; they are contained in the Comptes Rendus and
in various scientific journals.
     Since then my communications have always been to the same effect.
Thus in 1864 I said, summing up my observations in the Alps, "All
these observations have shown me that aqueous vapour in the shape
cf cloud or of atmospheric vapour did not appear to act, but that it
is aqueous vapour as elastic fluid which plays an important part in
the production of the telluric rays of the solar spectrum." {Comptes
 Rendus, Jan. 30, 1865.)
     It is thus seen that I am far from attributing to aqueous vapour
all the telluric rays of the solar spectrum ; I have, on the contrary,
 always thought that all the gases of the atmosphere had their part
 in the phenomenon — a part which for some would be very difficult
 to ascertain, but which must in principle exist.
     In the course of my investigations I have frequently been able to
 observe in very cold weather differences between the relative in
 tensities of the telluric rays, those of aqueous origin becoming feebler
 than the others*. These distinctions are met with on my maps;
 but I think it would be premature, before publishing the spectrum of
  aqueous vapour, which I am now obtaining by a sure experiment, to
  discuss the origin of any special line. — Comptes Rendus, Oct. 29, 1866.
  NOTE, BY MESSES. DE LA RUE, STEWART, AND LOEWY, ON THE
        DISTRIBUTION OF SOLAR SPOTTED AREAS IN HELIOGRAPHIC
        LATITUDE.
      In  a  paper which is now being printed, and which forms the
  second series of our Researches on Solar        Physics, we have investi
  gated the relation between solar activity and the ecliptical longitude
  of the planets ; and as a result we believe that we have discovered
  a connexion between the behaviour of sun-spots and the longitudes
  of Venus and Jupiter.
      We have under consideration another branch of this research,
  which, however, cannot be completed for some time ; but as the
  results already obtained seem to be of interest at the present
  moment, we venture to lay them before the Royal Astronomical
  Society.
      Mr. Carrington, it is well known, has given in his most interest
  ing volume on the sun a diagram exhibiting the distribution in helio-
  graphic latitude of sun-spots from time to time.             Now, if Venus
  and Jupiter have an influence on        solar activity, it might reasonably
   be conjectured that when these planets crossed the solar equator
      *
              I
         But have never found any spectral line more pronounced in winter
  than in summer, which would be opposed to the general principle that the
   elective absorption of gases diminishes with the temperature.     It is pro
  bable that M. Angstrom has committed an error of estimation, which is very
   difficult to avoid (as I have convinced myself) when the spectra compared
   cannot be made to have the same luminous intensity.

the solar activity would be more confined to the equatorial regions
of the sun, and that when they were furthest removed from the
solar equator this      activity   would   extend   outwards    towards the
solar poles.
   It appears to us that in Carrington's diagram there is probably
evidence of an action of this kind, due to both of these planets ; and
in the Table which accompanies this note, and which has been de
rived in a general manner from Carrington's diagram, it will be seen
how closely the minor epochs of solar activity in their approach to
the equator agree with the epochs at which Venus crosses the solar
equator, and how the solar activity spreads out towards the poles
at those times when Venus is furthest removed from the solar
equator*.
   The influence of Jupiter and a more searching investigation into
that of Venus will occupy our earliest attention.
   It will be seen from a late circular of M. Chacornac, that he has
drawn attention to Carrington's curve of latitude and to the minor
sinuosities, without, however, giving the above explanation.
   Lastly, we may state that we are led by our investigations to the
conclusion that solar activity, as shown in the phenomena of sun-
spots, would not exist but for planetary motion, any more than cer
tain physical phenomena of the planets would be produced without
solar influence.

         attempting to investigate the causes of any phenomenon
IN      in nature, the first object to be aimed at is the accumula
tion of facts. This is more especially the case in a science, such as
Meteoric Astronomy, which is still in its infancy. Hence' it is that
observations like those to be detailed in this paper, of however
slight importance they may be when considered by themselves,
yet when placed side by side with observations of a like nature,
by other observers in other places, may help in arriving at the
true theory of the nature and motions of those interesting ob
jects called meteors or shooting-stars.
     It may be mentioned that the night on which the late meteoric
 shower took place was much clearer and less stormy in St. An
drews than in many other places in Great Britain.          It may also
be well to state that the whole of my observations were noted
 down before I read any account of the meteors in the newspapers
or elsewhere.-

 observations made by me at St. Andrews on the numbers, direc

 proceed to compare my observations with those which have been

82             Mr. G. Forbes  on the  Meteoric Shower
published by other observers within the last month, and finally
make a few remarks on the conclusions to be derived from all
these observations.
    As there was some doubt whether the November shower, if it
 should take place at all, would do so on the morning of the 13th
or 14th,  I  looked out for a few minutes at about 12 o'clock on
 the night common to the 12th and 13th, but not seeing any
 meteors  I did not watch any more.
    On the evening of the 13th    I  kept a constant look-out from
 my window, and saw several fall between llh and llh45m.         At
 llh 45m they began to be more numerous, and then went  I
 outside, where there was a good point of view from which the
whole heavens could be very well seen.             I  stood looking
eastwards in the direction of the constellation Leo, and began
to count at 12 o'clock.      This was done by pricking holes in
rows on a card, which were afterwards counted at leisure.
I  stopped counting at 1 o'clock, by which time       I  had marked
 down 883 meteors, which is on an average about fifteen per
minute. The greater number of these fell in the last 20 mi
nutes ; and at about 1 o'clock    I  could not mark them all ; for
they were then falling at the rate of five or six in the second,
sometimes even faster.     The maximum seemed to take place at
about lh 15m.
    On the following night I looked out for about three-quarters
of an hour, beginning at lh 30m, but did not see any me
teors.
    At the first glance it was obvious that the meteors were
coming all from one direction, in the east ; and on attentive
observation the point from which they all appeared to radiate
could be seen to lie within the sickle in Leo.           During the
whole night I only saw three or four going in the opposite di
rection, or any that did not seem to be directed to the general
radiant-point.         ,
    The appearances presented by these bodies will now occupy
our attention. Each meteor had a distinctly defined head or
nucleus, whose course was marked by a train left by it.         The
nucleus was generally red or orange-coloured.           It appeared
suddenly, and as suddenly disappeared.        The prevailing colour
of the trains was greenish white, those nearest the horizon
being usually most coloured.      The colour of the train seemed
in general to be complementary to that of the nucleus. The
train consisted of a bright line, formed with enormous rapidity
when near the zenith.      The line was not uniform in breadth,
but was broadest in the middle and pointed at the ends. The
widening in the middle seemed to be caused by a falling down
wards of the matter composing the train.       After lasting usually

                   of the 14M of November, 1866.                   83
 Only for a few seconds, the train then faded away.           I  fre
quently noticed that the head of the meteor was visible for a
short distance beyond the extremity of the train.
    The nearer a meteor was to the radiant-point, the shorter was
 the apparent distance traversed.      This was the case to a re
markable extent.      Likewise the luminosity of a meteor and that
of its train was much less the nearer it was to the radiant-point.
The time, however, during which a meteor was visible seemed
to remain pretty constant in whatever part of the heavens it was
seen.    So much fore- shortened did their paths become, that in
the constellation Leo one frequently saw merely a point of light
bursting forth, and then fading away. The longest trains ex- -
tended over nearly 40°; but the general distance traversed by
those near the zenith was about 20°.       The next observations to
be noticed are those on particular meteors.
                                 I
    At about half-past twelve saw a meteor larger than Venus
at her brightest, which burst in all directions : it was blue in
colour. It was first visible in the head of Hydra, and then shot
down nearly to the horizon in an inclined direction, which
pointed towards the general radiant-point.       I only saw two or
three bursting meteors during the whole night.
    At 12h 41m the most brilliant and remarkable meteor that        I
saw during the whole night appeared.         This was a triple me
teor, in which each of the three components was fully as bright
as Venus.     They shot through the zenith with enormous ra
pidity, following one another in quick succession almost ex
actly in the same line, and leaving a train extending over a
distance rather exceeding that between the bright stars Alde-
baran and Betelgeux.       This train lasted till 12h 49m. It was
at first lance-shaped, like those of the other meteors.     It then
gradually shortened, thickened, and at the same time became
of a serpent-like form.     It continued to get thicker and shorter
till it was of an oval shape, having a spiral appearance. After
continuing to contract for a short time longer, it remained for
some time with a diameter of 15 minutes, when, after growing
fainter, it slowly disappeared 8 minutes after its appearance.
During the whole time that these changes were proceeding, the
impression given was that they were produced by the action
of currents in the air. Its position, shortly before its disap
pearance, was in the Milky Way, close to the star 9 Persei.
I  noticed that stars were visible through this nebulous mass.
    At lh 20m    I was standing close to the house with my face
turned towards it.      I suddenly saw the wall of the house close
to me illuminated by a crimson flash.         At the same time I
heard a shout from a friend, but on turning round was too
late to see anything.      He, however, told me afterwards that at

84             Mr. G. Forbes    on the  Meteoric Shower
that moment he had seen a very large fireball, of a green colour,
passing through the zenith, and had seen it bursting.
                I
    At 2h 13m saw a large meteor which left a distinct train,
which, after passing through the serpentine and oval forms
already described with relation to another meteor, disappeared
after having been visible for two minutes.         Its position was a
little north of the bright star Menkar in the constellation
Cetus.
    The next thing to be done is to compare the observations
which have now been mentioned with those which have been
 published in the newspapers and elsewhere.
    First, as to the numbers of the meteors. The numbers counted
 have varied very much under different circumstances.           This is
owing in some instances to a greater or less number of ob
 servers having been employed, in others apparently to differences
in the skill of the observers, and in many cases, doubtless, to the
 state of the atmosphere.        Thus while, by myself,     I  counted
 between the hours of 12 and 1 only 883, Mr. Hind, along with
 three friends, counted 1 1 20. The trained staff of observers, again,
 under Mr. Glaisher at the Greenwich Observatory, counted be
 tween the same hours 2032.         At Malta the meteors were sup
 posed to be falling at the rate of 500 or 600 per minute.           It
 was there impossible to count them, and the scene was com
pared to a shower of hail.           Some observers at the time of
 maximum display counted only about 40 per minute, while
 others counted three times that number in the same time.
    I have heard from only one observer an account of meteors
 being seen on the morning of the 13th.         Between the hours of
1 1 and 3 he had counted 50.           This was in Fife.   No one in
Britain seems to have seen any on the night following that of
 the great display.    An account from Saragossa, in the ' Times,'
states that the great shower took place on the morning of the
 15th.    This, however, is most probably a misprint.         Accounts
also from Penzance say vaguely that they were visible on that
night.
    Every one seems to agree in fixing the time of maximum dis
play at between 12 minutes and 15 minutes past 1 on the
morning of the 14th.      The curves (Plate III.) show the gradual
increase in numbers up to about lh 12m, and the decrease in
numbers after that time.
    The first is deduced from the observations of Mr. Alexander
Herschel at Glasgow.         Here the ordinates measure propor
tionally the number of meteors seen in periods of one minute,
each counted at unequal     intervals.
   In  the second, the ordinates also measure proportionally the
numbers seen in periods of one minute, counted at intervals of

                 of the 14M of November, 1866.
10 minutes.     This curve is drawn from the observations of Mr.
Glaisher's observers at Greenwich.
    In the third and fourth curves the numbers were counted
during periods of 5 minutes each. The third one is from the ob
servations of Mr. G. J. Symons in London, which were counted
every quarter of an hour; the fourth from those of Mr. C. G.
Talmage in Essex, by whom the numbers were counted every
successive five minutes, from 12h 52m to 2h 7m.     This last curve
shows most minutely the changes at the time of the maximum
display.
    On looking at these curves, the first thing that strikes us is
the suddenness of the rise and fall in the numbers.       Thus be
tween 12h 45m and 12h 50m eighty- seven were visible, and
between lh 0m and lh 5m, that is in the same length of time,
and but one quarter of an hour later, the number seen was 264.
    The next thing to strike us is the similarity in the curves on
each side of the maximum ordinate.
    Next, as to the direction of the flights of the meteors.
Every one noticed that they all came from an easterly direction.
The point was accurately fixed from careful observations, and
was found to lie a little south by east from 7 Leonis.       Mr. J.
P. H. Boileau, however, writing from Malta, states that the
radiant-point lay at nearly equal distances from Regulns in
Leo, Alpharet in Hydra, and Procyon in Canis Major ; which
is in a point considerably to the south-east of that mentioned
above.
    The colours of the heads or nuclei of the meteors were gene
rally stated to be red or orange-coloured.       The Rev. Robert
Main describes them as being "in general whitish or yel
lowish, while some were red or orange-coloured, and one was
bluish."
    The greatest difference of opinion exists as to the colours of
the trains of the meteors.       Some say that they were blue;
others bluish white or pale bluish ; others greenish or greenish
white ; while in Malta they are reported to have been white,
 sometimes tinted with red and blue.
    As to the time of duratipn of the trains, most observers agree
 in assigning two or three seconds as the usual time.        An ob
 server in Penzance, however, states, as a remarkable fact, that one
 meteor left a train which was visible for several seconds.
     Short as this time appears, it was yet sufficient for two ob
 servers to use spectroscopes ; but they did not succeed in ob
 taining any results either with regard to the meteors or their
 trains. They did not even find the sodium line noticed by Mr.
 Alexander Herschel in some of the August meteors.
     Of the observations of particular meteors, those described by

86            Mr. G. Forbes     on the Meteoric Shower
Mr. Alexander Herschel, in       a letter to the '   Times,' as made by
him at Glasgow, are the only ones I have read of anywhere that
seem to agree with those noted by me.                   He says, "Large
meteors appeared at 12h 33m, 12h 41m, 2h 14m, 2h42m.                  These
meteors left streaks which endured from five to fourteen mi
nutes."     The first of these agrees in time with a large bursting
meteor observed by me, which, however, I did not notice to
leave any long-lasting train.        The second is undoubtedly the
remarkable triple meteor which I saw, and whose position I
noted carefully shortly before its disappearance.           Mr. Herschel
 does not give, in the letter referred to, any particulars of the
position of this object from which its height might be calcu
lated.    The third one he mentions must be the same meteor as
that described above, which        I  saw at the same time.         In this
case, however, as in the last, he gives no particulars.
    Many observers noticed long-lasting trains like those already
 described.    The serpentine form was also remarked by several
observers.    Mr. J. M. Heath noticed one train, after assuming
the serpentine form, to contract into the form of the section of
a lens, and at the same time to revolve about an axis.             Messrs.
Thompson, who observed at Cardiff on behalf of the British
Association, saw similar changes going on in the train of a me
teor which remained visible for 12 minutes.             They also noticed
that this train was transported some distance in a westerly
direction. The Rev. Robert Main noticed the same phenomenon
in a different meteor*.
    Very few fireballs seem to have been observed anywhere.
Besides the one already mentioned, a large one was seen at Edin
burgh at 3h 51m, of a deep blue colour, leaving behind it a
golden-coloured train, not pointed as in the case of the ordinary
meteors.     This fireball shot from east to west not far from the
zenith.               • •
    Very few meteors were seen by any observer to burst.
    The great fact proved by this extraordinary shower is the
periodicity of the returns of these displays of meteors.          This be
lief is grounded on the observations of similar showers since
the year 902, and was first suspected by Humboldt.
    The general direction of flight from a radiant-point shows
that these bodies come in parallel directions.              That the ra
diating appearancei s merely the result of perspective is clearly
shown by the arc traversed being greater, and also by the speed
and brilliancy being greater, the further the meteors were from
the radiant-point.
   * M. Schmidt, in
                    writing to the Astronomische Nachrichten, states that
at Athens he observed a train which lasted for an hour.    He also fixed the
time of maximum display at about 2h 15™ Athens time.

                of the 14M of November, 1866.                            87
   The increase in numbers, and the subsequent decrease, as we
passed through the group, show that the meteoric bodies are
more abundant in the middle than near the outside ; yet the
very sudden increase and as sudden decrease in numbers seem
very inexplicable.
    It is supposed that the meteors, on coming in contact with
our atmosphere, become luminous by the arresting of their mo
tion. The height of meteors has been found to average ninety-
five miles at first appearance, and sixty miles at extinction.
Now it seems wonderful that our atmosphere at a height of
ninety-five miles can have such an effect.
    Another curious fact   is,
                            that we have not yet heard of any me
teoric matter having been found on the earth's surface since the
late shower.    Now, where do they go to          ?        It   is
                                                       exceedingly
improbable that they get free from our atmosphere         and that   ;
they should be dissolved into meteoric dust seems unlikely,
since they did not appear to be diminished in size during their
progress;   and, as has been already stated, the nucleus was seen
in many cases after  it had ceased leaving    train.
                                                  a
   These and other questions must be settled by the accumula
tion of observations; and all who are. interested in this depart
ment of astronomy must look forward with expectation to the
Report of the Committee on this subject to the British Asso
ciation at their next Meeting.      These reports have for some
years past   contained the  fullest accounts  of meteors and me
teoric showers.     The progress which has been made from the
observations of the last thirty years fully warrants the expecta
tion that much information will now be gained in this branch
of science from the observations which have been made, in many
different parts of the world, of the late remarkable shower.
                 Note     on the Curves.   (PI.   III.)
    In each of the curves the time marked        the mean of the
                                                      is
 period during which the observations were made.
   In the curve deduced from Mr.Talmage's observations, the num
 bers visible in five minutes were first counted at 12h 52m, from
 which time, till 12h 57m, he counted 127.       In the preceding
four   minutes   (from 12h  48m to 12h 52m)  he  had  counted 107,
 and between 12h 47m and 12h 47m 30s          he  had  counted 39.
 Hence, whatever number was visible between 12h 47m 30s and
 12h 48m, the number in the five minutes preceding 12h 52m
 must have considerably exceeded that in the five minutes fol*
 lowing.    Thisis    mentioned merely to show the remarkable
 coincidence in the three lowest curves in marking this increase
in the numbers at 12h 40m. And             should be noticed that
                                           it

88        Dr. Rankine on       the  Phrase  " Potential    Energy,"
the first curve is no exception, since the times at which the
numbers were counted could not show this increase.
    Other slight differences in the details of the different curves
are doubtless due to the differences in the intervals, and in the
periods during which the numbers were counted.
XIII.    On    the  Phrase " Potential Energy," and on the Defini
    tions of Physical Quantities.       ByW. J. Macquorn Rankine,
    C.E., LL.D., F.R.SS. Lond. $ Edinb.,
1.    TN    the course of an essay by Sir John Herschel
                                                                    " On the
      A    Origin of Force," which appeared some time ago in the
Fortnightly Review, and has lately been republished in a volume
entitled " Familiar Lectures on Scientific Subjects," the opinion
is expressed that the phrase
                                   " potential energy" is " unfortunate,
inasmuch as it goes to substitute a truism for the announce
ment of a great dynamical fact" (Familiar Lectures, p. 469).
    2. There is here no question as to the reality of the class of
relations amongst bodies to which that phrase is applied, nor as
to any matter of fact concerning those relations, but as to the
convenient and appropriate use of language.                 This is a sort of
 question   in  the  decision   of  which   authority    has  much weight ;
 and when     an   objection  to  the appropriateness of a term is made
by an author who is not less eminent as a philosopher than as a
 man of science, and whose skill in the art of expressing scientific
truth in clear language is almost unparalleled, it becomes the
 duty of those who use that term to examine carefully their
grounds for doing so.
    3. .As the phrase " potential energy," now so generally used
by writers on physical subjects, was first proposed by myself, in
 a paper "On theGeneralLaw of the Transformation of Energy"f,
read to the Philosophical Society of Glasgow on the 5th of Janu
 ary, 1853, 1 feel that the remark of Sir John Herschel makes it
 incumbent upon me to explain the reasons which led me, after
much consideration, to adopt that phrase for the purpose of de
 noting all those relations amongst bodies, or the parts of bodies,
which consist in a power of doing work dependent on mutual
 configurations.
    4. The kind of quantity now in question forms part of the
subject of the thirty-ninth proposition of Newton's Principia ;
   * Communicated by the Author,
                                       having been read to the Philosophical
Society of Glasgow.
   t Viz. that the effect of the presence of a quantity of actual energy, in
causing transformation of energy between the actual and the potential
forms, is the sum of the effects of all the parts of that quantity.

             and on the Definitions  of Physical Quantities.            89
but it is there represented by the area of a figure or by symbols
only, and not designated by a name ; and such is also the case
in many subsequent mathematical writings.
    5. The application of the word
                                        " force " to that kind of quan
tity is open to the objection, that when "force" is taken in the
sense in which Newton defines
                                     " vis matrix" the power of per
forming work is not simply force, but force multiplied by space.
To make such an application of the word " force," therefore,
would have been to designate a product by the name properly
belonging to one of its factors, and would have added to the con
fusion which has already arisen from the ambiguous employment
of that word.
     6. The word " power," though at first sight it might seem very
 appropriate, was already used in mechanics in at least three differ
 ent senses, viz.: first, the power of an engine — meaning the rate at
 which it performs work, and being the product of force and space
 divided by time ; secondly, the power, in the sense of effort or
 pressure, which drives a machine; and thirdly, "mechanical
 powers," meaning certain elementary machines.            Thus " power "
 was open to the same sort of objection with        " force."
     7. About the beginning of the present century, the word
 "energy" had been substituted by Dr. Thomas Young for "vis
 viva," to denote the capacity for performing work due to velocity ;
 and the application of the same word had at a more recent time
 been extended by Sir William Thomson to capacity of any sort
 for performing work. There can be no doubt that the word
 " energy " is specially suited for that purpose ; for not only does
 the meaning to be expressed harmonize perfectly with the ety
 mology of ivepyeia, but the word energy
                                        "         " has never been used
 in precise scientific writings in a different sense j and thus the
 risk of ambiguity is avoided.
     8. It appeared to me, therefore, that what remained to be
  done was to qualify the noun
                                     "         "
                                       energy     by appropriate adjec
  tives,  so as  to distinguish between   energy of activity and energy
  of configuration. The well-known pair of antithetical adjectives
  " actual " and " potential " seemed exactly suited for that pur
  pose ; and    I  accordingly proposed the phrases
                                                         " actual energy "
  and   " potential energy," in the paper to which I have referred*.
      9. I was encouraged to persevere in the use of those phrases
  by the fact of their being immediately approved of and adopted
  by Sir William Thomson — a fact to which I am disposed to as
  cribe in a great measure the rapid extension of ktheir use in the
  course of a period so short in the history of science as fourteen
     * Green's "Potential," or "Potential Function," is a quantity homoge
  neous with one form of potential energy, but of opposite algebraical sign.

  90       Dr. Rankine on      the Phrase  " Potential  Energy,"
  years*.     I had also the satisfaction of receiving a very strong
 expression of approval from the late Professor Baden Powell.
     10. Until some years afterwards I was not aware of the fact
 that the idea of a phrase equivalent to "potential energy" in its
 purely mechanical sense had been anticipated by Carnot, who, in
 an essay on machines in general, employed the term " force vive
 virtuelle," of which " potential energy " might be supposed to
 be almost a literal translation.      That coincidence shows how na
 turally the phrase "potential energy," or something equivalent,
 occurs to one in search of words appropriate to denote that power
 of performing work which is due to configuration and not to
 activity.
     11. Having explained       the reasons which led me to propose
 the use of the phrase " potential energy,"        I have next to make
 some observations on the objection made by Sir John Herschel
 to that phrase, that " it goes to substitute a truism for a great
 dynamical fact."
    12. It must be admitted that the use of the term
                                                              " potential
 energy" tends to make the statement of the law of the conser
 vation of energy wear to a certain extent the appearance of a
 truism.     It seems to me, however, that such must always be the
 effect of denoting physical relations by words that are specially
 adapted to express the properties of those relations, or, what
 amounts virtually to the same thing, of drawing up precise and
 complete definitions of physical terms.          Let A and B denote
 certain conceivable relations, and let them be precisely and com
 pletely defined; then from the definitions follows the proposition
that A and B are related to each other in a certain way ; and
that proposition wears the appearance of a truism, and is virtu
ally comprehended in the definitions. But it is not a bare truism ;
for when with the definitions are conjoined the two facts ascer
tained by experiment and observation — that there are relations
amongst real bodies corresponding to the definition of A, and
that there are also relations amongst real bodies corresponding
to the definition of B — the proposition as to relation between A
and B becomes not a bare truism, but a physical fact.             In the
present case, for example,
                                   " actual energy
                                                     "   and " potential
energy
         "  are  defined in  such  a way  that  from   the definitions  it
follows that what a body or a system of bodies gains in one form
of energy through mutual actions it loses in the other form — in
other words, that the sum of actual and potential energies is
"conserved;" and this sounds like a truism; but when it is
proved by experiment and observation that there are relations
amongst real bodies agreeing with the definitions of "actual
   * Sir William Thomson and Professor Tait have lately substituted the
word  " kinetic " for " actual."

              and on the Definitions   of Physical Quantities.       91
energy
         "  and " potential energy," that which otherwise would be
a truism becomes a fact.
   13. A definition can neither be true nor false ; for it makes no
assertion, but says,
                        " let such a word or phrase be used in such a
sense;
        "   but it may be real or fantastic, according as the descrip
tion contained in it corresponds or not to real objects and phe
nomena ; and when by the aid of experiment and observation a
set of definitions have been framed which possess reality, preci
sion, and completeness, the investing of a physical fact with the
appearance of a trumm is often an unavoidable consequence of
the use of the terms so defined.
   14. In the case of physical quantities in particular, the defini
tion involves a rule for measuring the quantity ; and the proof
of the reality of the definition is the fact that the application of
the rule to the same quantity under different circumstances gives
consistent results, which it would not do if the definition were
fantastic ; and hence the definitions of a set of physical quantities
necessarily involve mathematical relations amongst those quanti
ties, which, when expressed as propositions         and compared with
the definitions, wear the appearance of truisms and are at the
same time statements of fact.
    15. In illustration of the foregoing principles, it may be
pointed out that there is a certain set of definitions of the mea
surement of time, force, and mass which reduces the laws of mo
tion to the form of truisms : thus —
    I. Let " equal times " mean the times in which a moving body
under the influence of no force describes equal spaces. This defi
nition is proved to be real by the fact that times which are equal
when compared by means of the free motion of one body, are
equal when compared by means of the free motion of any other
body.      If  the definition were fantastic, times might be equal as
measured by the free motion of one body, and unequal as mea
sured by that of another.
    II. Let "force " mean a relation between a pair of bodies
such that their relative velocity changes or tends to change in
                                                  " equal        " mean
magnitude or direction, or both ; and let                 forces
those which act when equal changes of the relative velocity of a
given pair of bodies occur in equal times.            This definition is
proved to be real by the fact that the comparative measurements
of forces made in different intervals of time are consistent with
each other, which would not be the case if the definition were
fantastic.
   III.   Let the "mass" of         a body mean a quantity inversely
proportional      to the change  of  velocity impressed on that body in
a given time by a. given force.         This definition is proved to be
real by the fact that the ratio of the masses of two given bodies

92           Prof. Tyndall on Sounding and Sensitive Flames.
is found experimentally to be always the same when those
masses are compared by means of the velocities impressed on
them by different forces and in different times, and is also the
same whether each of the masses is measured as a whole or as
the sum of a set of parts.
    Assuming those definitions as merely verbal, without refer
ence to their reality, the laws of motion take the form of verbal
truisms ; but when experiment and observation inform us that
permanent relations exist among real bodies and real events
corresponding to the definitions, those apparent truisms become
statements of fact.
     16. One of the chief objects of mathematical physics is Jo
ascertain, by the help of experiment and observation, what phy
sical quantities or functions are " conserved."               Such quantities
or functions are, for example,
     I. The mass of every particle of matter — conserved at all
times and under all circumstances.
     II. The resultant momentum of a body or system of bodies
—conserved so long as internal forces act alone.
   .III. The resultant angular momentum of a body or system of
 bodies — conserved so long as internal forces act alone.
     IV. The total energy of a body or system of bodies — con
 served so long as internal forces act alone.
     V. The thermodynamic function — conserved in a body while
 it neither receives nor gives out heat.
     In defining such physical quantities as those, it is almost, if
not quite, impossible to avoid making the definition imply the
property of conservation ; so that when the fact of conservation
 is stated, it has the form of a truism.
     17. In conclusion, it appears to me that the making of a phy
 sical law wear the appearance of a truism, so far from being a
 ground of objection to the definition of a physical term, is rather
a proof that such definition has been framed in strict accordance
with reality.

1777.       The subject has been since investigated by Chladni, De

action of unisonant sounds on flames enclosed in tubes has been

          Prof. Tyndall on Sounding and Sensitive Flames.                  93
investigated by Count Schaffgotsch and myself.                 The jumping
of a naked fish-tail flame, in response to musical sounds, was first
noticed by Professor Leconte at a musical party in the United
States.     He made the important observation that the flame did
not jump until it was max flaring.           That his discovery was not
further followed up by this learned investigator was probably due
to too great a stretch of courtesy on his part towards myself *.
Last year, while preparing the experiments for one of my              "J uve-
nile Lectures," my late assistant, Mr. Barrett, observed the
effect independently; and he afterwards succeeded in illustrating
it by some very striking experiments. With a view to the present
discourse, and also to the requirements of a forthcoming work on
sound, the subject of sounding and sensitive flames has been re
cently submitted to examination in the laboratory of the Royal
Institution.      The principal results of the inquiry are embodied
in the following abstract.
   Pass a steadily-burning candle rapidly through the air, you
obtain an indented band of light, while an almost musical sound
heard at the same time announces the rhythmic character of the
motion. If, on the other hand, you blow against a candle-flame,
the fluttering noise produced indicates a rhythmic action.
    When a fluttering of the air is produced at the embouchure
of an prgan-pipe, the resonance of the pipe reinforces that par
ticular pulse of the flutter whose period of vibration coincides
with its own, and raises it to a musical sound.
    When a gas-flame is introduced into an open tube of suitable
   * The observation of Professor Leconte is thus graphically described : —
" Soon after the music commenced, I observed that the flame of the burner
exhibited pulsations in height which were exactly synchronous with the
audible beats. This phenomenon was very striking to every one in the
room, and especially so when the strong notes of the violoncello came in.
It was exceedingly interesting to observe how perfectly even the trills of
this instrument were reflected on the sheet of flame.       A deaf man might
have seen the harmony. As the evening advanced, and the diminished con
sumption of gas in the city increased the pressure, the phenomenon became
more conspicuous.     The jumping of the flame gradually increased, became
somewhat irregular, and finally it began to flare continuously, emitting
the characteristic sound indicating the escape of a greater amount of gas
than could be properly consumed. I then ascertained, by experiment, that
the phenomenon did not take place unless the discharge of gas was so re
gulated that the flame approximated to flaring.    I likewise determined that
the effects were not produced by jarring or shaking the floor and walls of
the room by means of repeated concussions.        Hence it is obvious that
the pulsations of the flame were not owing to indirect vibrations propagated
through the medium of the walls of the room to the burning apparatus,
but must have been produced by the direct influence of aerial sonorous
pulses on the burning jet." — Silliman's American Journal for January
1858 ; Phil. Mag. for March 1858.

length and width, the current of air passing over the flame pro
duces such a flutter, which the resonance of the tube exalts to a
musical sound.
   Introducing a gas-flame into this tin tube three feet long, we
obtain  a rich musical note ; introducing it into a tube six feet
long, we obtain a note an octave deeper — the pitch of the note
depending on the length of the tube.       Introducing the flame
into this third tube, which is fifteen feet long, the sound as
sumes extraordinary intensity.     The vibrations which produce
it are sufficiently powerful to shake the pillars, floor, seats, gal
lery, and the five or six hundred people who occupy the seats
and gallery.      The flame is sometimes extinguished by its own
violence, and ends its peal by an explosion as loud as a pistol-
shot.
    The roar of a flame in a chimney is of this character : it is a
 rude attempt at music.
    By varying the size of the flame, these tubes may be caused
 to emit their harmonic sounds.
    Passing from large pipes to small ones, we obtain a series of
 musical notes, which rise in pitch as the tube diminishes in
length. This flame, surrounded by a tube 17£ inches long,
 vibrates 459 times in a second, while that contained in this
 tube, lOf inches long, vibrates 717 times in a second.        Owing
 to the intense heat of the sounding column, these numbers are
 greater than those corresponding to organ-pipes of the same
lengths sounding in air.
    The vibrations of the flame consist of a series of partial ex
 tinctions and revivals of the flame.
    The singing flame appears continuous; but if the head be
 moved to and fro, or if an opera-glass, directed to the flame, be
caused to move to and fro, or            after the method of Wheat-

such a silent flame by a pitch-pipe, by the siren, or by the human
voice.   It is also possible to cause one flame to effect the mu
sical ignition of another.
   The sound which starts the flame must be nearly in unison
with its own. Both flames must be so near unison as to pro-
duce distinct beats.
   A flame may be employed to detect sonorous vibrations in
air.
   Thus, in front of this resonant case, which supports a large
and powerful tuning-fork, I move this bright gas-flame to and
fro. A continuous band of light is produced, slightly indented
through the friction of the air.  The fork is now sounded, and
instantly this band breaks up into a series of distinct images of
the flame.
  Approaching the same flame towards either end of one of our tin
tubes with the sounding flame within        and causing
                                                 it,          to move       it
to and fro, the sonorous vibrations also effect the breaking up
of the band of light into    chain of images.

   In this glass tube, 14 inches long,       flame

                                                                is                   :   I
bring the flat flame of       fish-tail burner over the tube, the
                                   a
broad side of the flame being at right angles to the axis of the
tube.   The fish-tail flame instantly emits     musical note of the
                                                       a
same pitch as that of the singing flame,    but .of different quality.
Its sound     is,
               in fact, that of    membrane, the part of which
                                       a                                                 it

   Against    a      bat's-wing flame
                       broad              allow  I   sheet of air,  a
issuing from    thin slit, to impinge.
                    a                       musical note
                                                       A       the                  is

consequence.   The note can be produced                   carbonic
acid but
     ;        produced with greater force and purity
             it   is                                       oxygen.
The pitch of the note depends on the distance of the slit from
the flame.

norous waves pass in each case through the air, the candle                                is
absolutely insensible to the sound     there ;   no motion of the

 I    now urge from this small blowpipe            narrow stream of air
                                                       a

flutter, and reducing the brightness       of  the  flame.      now sound

ranged    that when    the  whistle  sounds   the   flame shall be either
almost   restored  to its pristine brightness,    or  the amount of light
it still possesses shall disappear.
   Before you now burns          bright flame from
                                   a                      fish-tail burner.

 strike an anvil   ;  the flame remains steady and without response.
 I  urge against the broad face of the flame a stream of air from
 the blowpipe just employed.            The flame is cut in two by the
 stream of air ; it flutters slightly ; and now when the whistle
 is sounded the flame instantly starts.           A knock on the table
 causes the two half-flames to unite and form for an instant a
 flame of the ordinary shape.           By a slight variation of the ex
 periment,     the   two   side  flames  disappear when the whistle is
 sounded, and a central tongue of flame is thrust forth in their
 stead.
     Passing from a fish-tail to a bat's-wing burner,        I obtain this
 broad steady flame.         It is quite insensible to the loudest sound
 which would be tolerable here.           The flame is fed from this gas
 holder, which places a power of pressure at my disposal unattain
 able from the gas-pipes of the Institution.         I turn on more gas ;
 the flame enlarges, but it is still insensible to sound.      I enlarge it
 still more, and now a slight flutter of its edge answers to the
 sound of the whistle.         Turning on a little more gas, and sound
 ing again, the jumping of the flame is still more distinct.
           I
 Finally turn on gas until the flame is on the point of roaring,
 as flames do when the pressure is too great.            I now sound my
 whistle; the flame roars and thrusts suddenly upwards eight
 long quivering tongues.
     1 strike this distant anvil with a hammer, the flame instantly
-responds by thrusting forth its tongues.
     Another flame is now before you. It issues from a burner
 formed of ordinary gas-tubing by my assistant.              The flame is
  18 inches long, and smokes copiously.            I sound the whistle;
 the flame falls to a height of 9 inches, the smoke disappears,
  and the brilliancy of the flame is augmented *.
      Here are two other flames, also issuing from burners formed
  by my assistant.        The one of them is long, straight, and
  smoky;     the other   is  short, forked, and brilliant.    I sound the
 whistle ; the long flame becomes short, forked, and brilliant ;
 the forked flame becomes long and smoky.               As regards, there
 fore, their response to the sonorous waves, the one of these flames
 is the exact complement of the other.
     Here are various flat flames, 10 inches high, and. about
  3 inches across at their widest part.         They are purposely made
 forked flames.        When the whistle sounds, the plane of each
 flame turns ninety degrees round, and continues in its new po
  sition as long as the whistle continues to sound.
     Here, again, is a flame of admirable steadiness and brilliancy,
    * Mr. Barrett also observed the increase of light on the shortening
 of  a flame by a musical sound; nor did the superior effect of high notes
 escape the attention of this acute and skilful young experimenter.

 issuing from a single circular orifice in a common iron nipple.
I   whistle, clap my hand, strike the anvil, and produce other
 sounds ; the flame is perfectly steady.         Observe the gradual
 change from this apathy to sensitiveness.          The flame i3 now
4 inches high.          I
                      make its height 6 inches ; it is still indifferent.
I  make it 10 inches ; a barely perceptible quiver responds to the
whistle.        I
                make it 14 inches high, and now it jumps briskly
the moment the anvil is tapped or the whistle sounded.            I aug
ment the pressure; the flame is now 16 inches long, and you
observe a quivering which announces that the flame is near
roaring.     I increase the pressure ; it now roars, and shortens at
the same time to a height of 8 inches.               I
                                                diminish the pressure
a little ; the flame is again 16 inches long, but it is on the
point of roaring. It stands, as it were, on the brink of a pre
cipice.     The whistle pushes it over.    Observe it shortens when
the whistle sounds, exactly as it did when the pressure was in
excess.     The sonorous pulses, in fact, furnish the supplement
of energy necessary to produce the roar and shorten the flame.
This is the simple philosophy of all these sensitive flames.
    The pitch of the note chosen to push the flame over the
brink is not a matter of indifference.         I have here a tuning-
fork which vibrates 256 times in a second, emitting a clear and
forcible note.     It has no effect upon this flame. Here are three
other forks, vibrating respectively 320, 384, and 512 times in
a second.      Not one of them produces the slightest impression
upon    the  flame.    But, besides their fundamental notes, these
forks can be caused to sound a series of overnotes of very high
pitch.     I sound this series of notes: the vibrations are now
1600, 2000, 2400, and 3200 per second respectively.                  The
flame jumps in response      to each  of these notes,  the   response to
the highest note of the series being the most prompt and ener
getic of all.
    To the tap of a hammer upon a board the flame responds ;
but to the tap of the same hammer upon an anvil the response
is much more brisk and animated.             The reason          is,
                                                                that the
clang of the anvil      rich in the higher tones to which the flame
                            is
is   most sensitive.

98        Prof. Tyndall on Sounding and Sensitive Flames.
I  sound the highest string : the jet instantly squats down to a
tumultuous bushy flame, 8 inches long.                 I have here a small
bell, the hammer of which is caused to descend by clock-work.
I hold it at a distance of 20 yards from the flame. The strokes
follow each other in rhythmic succession, and at every stroke
the flame falls from a height of 20 to a height of 8 inches.
    The rapidity with which sound is propagated through air is
well illustrated by these experiments.           There is no sensible inter
val between the stroke of the bell and the shortening of the flame.
    Some of these flames are of marvellous sensibility ; one such
is at present burning before you.            It is nearly 20 inches long;
but the slightest tap       on  a  distant  anvil knocks it down to 8.      I
 shake this bunch of keys or these few copper coins in my hand:
the flame responds to every tinkle.             I may stand at a distance
of 20 yards from this flame : the dropping of a sixpence from a
height of a couple of inches into a hand already containing coin
knocks the flame down.            I  cannot walk across the floor without
affecting    the    flame.   The    creaking  of my boots sets it in vio
lent commotion.            The crumpling of a bit of paper, or the
rustle of a silk dress, does the same.               It is startled by the
plashing of a raindrop.            I  speak to the flame, repeating a few
lines of poetry; the flame jumps at intervals, apparently picking
certain sounds from my utterance to which it can respond, while
it is unaffected by others.
    In our experiments downstairs we have called this the vowel
flame, because the different vowel sounds affect it differently.
Vowel sounds of the same pitch are known to be readily distin
guishable.        Their qualities or clang-tints are different, though
they   have   a   common    fundamental tone.        They differ from each
other through the admixture of higher tones with the funda
mental.      It is the presence of these higher tones in different
proportions that characterizes the vowel sounds ; and it is to these
same tones, and not to the fundamental one, that our flame is
sensitive.      I  utter a loud and sonorous U, the flame remains
steady ;   I  change the sound to 0, the flame quivers ;         I sound E,
and now the flame is affected strongly.            I  utter the words boot,
boat, and beat in succession.           To the first there is no response;
to the second, the flame starts ; but by the third it is thrown
into violent commotion; the sound Ah ! is still more powerful.
When the vowel sounds are analyzed, their constituents are
found to vary in accordance with the foregoing experiments,
those characterized by the sharpest overtones being the most
powerful excitants of the flame.               (See Helmholtz in Pogg.
Annalen, vol. cviii. p. 286.)
   The flame is peculiarly sensitive to the utterance of the letter

with a

mult.       The utterance of the word "hush," or "puss," pro
duces the same effect.           This hissing sound contains the precise
elements that most forcibly affect the flame.                 The gas issues
from its burner with a hiss, and an external sound of this cha
racter added to that of a gas-jet already on the point of roaring
is equivalent to an augmentation of pressure on the issuing
stream of gas.         I  hold in my hand a metal box containing com
pressed air.       I  turn the cock for a moment, so as to allow a puff
to escape — the flame instantly ducks down, not by any transfer

of air from the box to the flame, for stand at a distance which
utterly excludes this idea; it is the sound of the issuing air that
affects the flame.         The hiss produced in one orifice precipitates
the tumult at the other.
    Note. — Those who wish to repeat these experiments would do
well to bear in mind, as an essential condition of complete
success, that a free way should be open for the transmission of
the vibrations from the flame, backwards, through the gas-pipe
which feeds it. The orifices of the stopcocks near the flame
ought to be as wide as possible.

100             Mr. G. E. Rodwell on        some   Effects
 1.   Effects produced by a stream of liquid, (a) entering, and (/3)
       issuing from a liquid mass at right angles to its surface.
    A stream of water flowing at the rate of 12 cubic centimetres
per minute, was allowed to run down the side of a beaker con
taining water, upon the surface of which lycopodium had been
sprinkled ; the adhesion of the glass flattened the stream into
a thin ribbon of water 6 millims.        broad by 1 millim. thick.
At the point where the stream entered (A, fig. 1, Plate II.) the
particles of lycopodium were driven forward in a straight line to
the opposite side of the beaker ; they then returned in the direc
tion of the arrows, and entered the central current immediately
beneath the descending stream.         At the junctures of the re
turning currents with the central current the lycopodium re
volved with great rapidity in circles moving in opposite direc
tions, as shown in the figure, which represents the water-sur
face.     Particles of lycopodium were found to collect together on
each side of the descending stream ; when these were dislodged
from their position, the circular currents disappeared, and lyco
podium was observed to rise a short distance into the descend
ing stream, and to revolve in ellipses moving in opposite direc
tions.     One ellipse was apparent on each side of the descending
stream ; and the major axis of each was four or five times as great
as the minor.       By colouring the descending stream, the main
body of liquid entering the beaker was seen to pass between the
ellipses, although the space was not more than one tenth of the
breadth of the whole stream.        In fig. 2 (in which the eye is
supposed to be on a level with the water- surface) A represents
the descending stream, B the water-surface, and C the stream
as it enters the water after passing between the ellipses.
    In the first experiment a central current is produced by the
entering stream, which flows across the beaker until it reaches
the opposite side, when it divides into two currents, returning
by the sides of the vessel.     Immediately before the coalescence
it is obvious that the side currents move at right angles to the
central current; circular currents at the points of juncture are
the result.     The motions which produce these circular currents
are, (a) the motion possessed by the returning currents, directly
derived from the motion of the central current, but of less mag
nitude on account of the friction of the sides of the vessel, plus (/3)
the motion caused by the lateral action of the central current
when the side currents approach       it, acting together in one    di
rection;    and (7) the motion of the central current acting in      a
direction at right angles to this.
    In the second experiment the particles of water of the return
ing currents, when they are compelled          by
                                               the central current to

                    produced by a  Fluid in Motion.             101
discontinue to move in their original direction, are influenced by
the adhesion of the glass, which tends to draw them upwards ;
they are no longer prevented from rising by the accumulation of
lycopodium on each side of the descending stream, and they
meet with less resistance than if they moved forward at once with
the central current, they consequently ascend.       To the motions
producing the circular currents in the first experiment, we have
to add that produced by the adhesion of the glass, acting in a
different direction ; as a consequence, the circular motion of the
water- particles is changed into an elliptic motion, the major
axis of the ellipse being in the direction of the newly added force,
as we should expect.
    A jet of water issuing from an orifice 1*5 millira. in diameter
with sufficient force to rise to the height of a metre, was caused
to enter water at right angles to its surface.        A cylindrical
copper vessel, "3 metre in diameter by -17 metre deep, was used
for the purpose ; and the water-surface (upon which lycopodium
was sprinkled) stood at a height of 75 millims. from the bottom
of the vessel. The orifice of the delivery-tube was placed 3 mil
lims. above the water-surface, and the jet was allowed to enter
near the side of the vessel.   The particles of lycopodium beneath
the influent jet immediately began to revolve around it in con
centric circles, having the jet for their centre, and currents were
produced similar to those shown in fig. 1, but moving in a re
verse direction ; that is to say, the side currents moved from the
jet, and the central current into which they united moved towards
the jet.
    When the influent jet was placed in the centre of the vessel
instead of near its side, the lycopodium moved radially to the
sides of the vessel, and returned ; after which the course of the
currents could not be traced, because they met each other in
various positions, producing spiral and circular eddies.      If in
stead of allowing the jet to enter the water by its clear portion,
that is to say, above the vena contractu, it was caused to enter by
its opake and agitated portion, the particles of lycopodium, in
stead of revolving around the jet, were drawn towards it by a
spiral current and carried beneath the water-surface.
    A jet of water, similar in all respects to that employed in the
last experiment, was allowed to escape 1 millim. beneath the
surface of water ; it issued from the water at right angles to its
surface, and in contact with the side of the containing vessel.
After ascending to the height of about 100 millims. the jet
divided and returned in two parabolas, one on each side of the
ascending jet.      Lycopodium entered the ascending jet with
great velocity,  followed  the path of the parabolas, and reentered
the jet by currents moving in a parabola, which started from

102              Mr. G. F. Rodwell on    some Effects
the returning streams, and ended at the ascending jet ; within
these parabolic currents the particles of lycopodium were ob
served to revolve in ellipses moving in contrary directions.    Par
ticles of lycopodium rose into that portion of the two descending
streams most remote from the ascending jet, and revolved in
ellipses moving in opposite directions, the major axis of each
 ellipse being parallel to the descending stream.      The particles
 in each elliptic current revolved in a direction opposite to that of
 those which revolved in the ellipse (within the parabolic current)
 nearest to it.   In fig. 3, A represents the ascending jet, B B the
 returning streams, C C the parabolic currents on the water-
 surface immediately beneath them, and D the central surface-
 current induced by the lateral action of the ascending jet.
     The jet A ascends until it is stopped by the adhesion of the
 substance of the vessel, it then returns by the two parabolic
 streams B B.     Now these returning streams tend, on entering
 the liquid mass beneath them, to produce the same currents
 which we have seen (from the first experiment) to be produced
 when a stream of liquid enters' a liquid mass at right angles to
 its surface.   But particles of water are hurrying towards D to
 supply the place of those which are perpetually dragged from
 the vessel by the lateral action of A ; hence the currents which
 would otherwise proceed in straight lines from the points at
 which B B enter the fluid are caused to curve round to the point
from which A issues.
     Many very beautiful effects may be produced by allowing a
jet of water, capable of rising to the height of about a metre, to
impinge upon the edge of a vessel. The jet, more or less re
 strained by adhesion, breaks up into numberless globules of
 water following a great variety of curved paths.
     When a jet of water is allowed to escape just beneath the
 surface of water upon which lycopodium has been scattered,
 the currents produced at right angles to the axis of the jet are
 rendered very apparent by the rapid rush of lycopodium into
 the ascending jet.     The particles are carried away by the jet,
and in this manner a large surface of water may be entirely freed
from lycopodium in the course of a few minutes.
     One of Venturis first experiments on lateral action was that
in which he caused a stream of water to flow through a vessel
containing water, and to escape above its level, by which means
the water speedily sank to the level of the stream.         A jet of
water delivering, say, 100 cub. centims. per minute may be caused
 (by allowing it to escape nearly vertically several millimetres be
neath a water- surface) to remove far more than its own volume
of water from the vessel. The quantity removed obviously de
pends entirely upon the velocity of the issuing jet : currents are

                                  produced by a        Fluid in Motion.                           103
established which convey particles of water to it ; and the latter
are removed from the vessel, in virtue of their cohesion to the
water of the jet, from which they receive a direct communica
tion of motion.      The jet escaping in air rises to a height of, say,
a metre ; but when it escapes beneath a water-surface it rises
only to one-third or one-fourth of that height, because it has
given up a great deal of its motion to the particles of water
which leave the vessel in company with it.
    The action of the so-called " hydraulic belt " is perfectly ana
logous to that of a jet escaping upwards from beneath a water-
surface ; indeed the revolving band may be viewed as such an
ascending jet.      The hydraulic belt is employed to raise water
from deep wells, and consists of an endless band of felt passing
over two rollers, one placed at the top and the other at the bot
tom of the well ; rapid motion is communicated to the band by
the revolution of the upper roller, and water adheres to               and                  it,
rises with       until in passing over the upper roller
                   it                                              thrown         it   is
off at    tangent.
          a            Now water       forcibly dragged from the well
                                                       is
in virtue of its adhesion to the band currents are thus established
                                                            ;
in the mass of liquid in the well at right angles to the direction
of the issuing water, and         these water     by

to the band.      The adhering particles of water share the motion
of the band and they do not descend, because, although gravity
                       ;
could readily overcome their adhesion,            has in this instance to
                                                                 it

another term for expressing the amount of cohesion possessed
    by
     its particles).     Thus, the rate of revolution of the band
being constant,      we take ether, water, and treacle as the liquids,

with the greatest velocity for ether, less for water, and least for                                 •
treacle. But, on the other hand, the denser the liquid, the greater
would be the amount of force necessary to produce              given rate         a
of revolution.

104              Mr. G. F. Rodwell     on some   Effects
when the water in A was level with the orifice of C, it dipped
•4 metre beneath the water-surface in A.          The tube B was filled
with water before introducing it into A (the orifice C being
closed by the finger); on opening C, water flowed from A and
came to rest about 20 millims. above the orifice of C ; but when
a substance capable of being wetted by water was placed at C,
the water in A immediately sank to the level of C.             The cause
of this is obvious : when the water in A had fallen nearly to the
level of C, the adhesion of the glass of B for the water within it
 was sufficient to counterbalance the weight of a small column of
 water in A ; but so soon as the water in B was allowed to come
in contact with another body outside B, the adhesion within
the tube was counterbalanced        by adhesion outside, and water
 consequently   flowed  from  C  until a perfect level had been estab
lished.
    The tube D, 4-5 millims. in diameter, was placed above the
orifice C in such a manner that its centre was 6 millims. from the
centre of C, and it was caused to deliver a stream of water (flow
ing from a cistern with a water-head of "66 metre) exactly at
a right angle to a line passing through the centre of G.              The
apparatus being     thus  arranged,  and  the   water   in A standing  on
a level with the orifice C, it is obvious that any force tending to
remove water from A has to overcome the downward pressure
of a column of water in the longer limb of B, and also that, the
greater the amount of water removed from A, the greater is the
pressure to be overcome.
    When water was allowed to flow from D at the rate of 1575
cub. centims. per minute, the following quantities of water were
                               ...
removed from A by the lateral action of the stream

   The flow from D was now diminished one-half (viz. to 787'5
cub. centims. per minute), the level of the water in A with C
                         The flow from A was as follows : —

                                          No water removed.
   When the flow of water from D was diminished to one-fourth
its original quantity (viz. to 393-75 cub. centims. per minute),
no water was removed from A.
   When water flowing froniD at the rate of 1575 cub. centims.
per minute was allowed to flow for half a minute (so that 21
cub. centims. were removed from A), and was then diminished

                         produced by a   Fluid in Motion.                         105
to a flow of 300 cub. centims. per minute, water passed from
the descending stream through B to the tube A, and quickly
restored the level which the more rapid current had rendered
unequal.
  At   the commencement of the experiment the particles of water
in B are at rest   ; as soon as water flows from    D, the par
ticles exposed at C pass into the descending stream, and par
ticles immediately behind these rush forward to fill the vacated
places; but the greater the number of particles removed, the
greater is the force tending to draw them back into A ; for the
pressures become more and more unequal, and more and more
force is stored up in each of the particles of water in B above
the water-level in A.   Thus there is a strain upon the particles
which acts against the lateral force of the stream from D, and
the amount of water removed from A gradually becomes less,
until a point is reached at which the pressure of the column of
water in the longer limb of B exactly balances the force exercised
by the descending stream; water then ceases to be removed
from       A.
    In  the last experiment, as long as the water flowed with a
certain velocity, the weight of the column of water in B, tend
ing to equalize the levels, was incompetent to draw water from
the current, because it would have to stop a certain amount of
motion before it could do so ; but when the velocity of the cur
rent was diminished, the weight of the column of water in B
became competent to stop the motion of the particles of water,
and therefore to equalize the pressures by drawing water from
 the descending stream.

                                                          a

 effect     by
            changing the angle at which the jet impinged upon
 the orifice of     discharge tube; and the effect was measured in
                     a
 the same manner as that employed to measure the lateral effect
 of jet of water.
    a                   The steam was allowed to attain pressure ofa
 304   millims.  of mercury*, and to escape through an orifice 4-5
 millinis. diameter placed     millims. from the orifice
                                 6                         of the tube
                                                                   C

6. When the tube delivering the jet of steam was placed at
    angles of 135° and 157°'5 (F and G, fig. 5), air was forced
    violently through the tube B (fig. 4), and escaped by its lower
    orifice into the graduated tube.
   The above experiments do not represent the lateral-action effect
of a jet of steam sustained at an unvarying pressure, because (from
the fact of the boiler being small), the maximum pressure could
only be sustained for ten seconds when the steam was escaping
from a tube 4-5 millims. in diameter : these experiments are thus
capable of being strictly compared among themselves, but they
must be considered to show the effect of varying the impinging
angle rather than the absolute effect of steam of the pressure
employed.       The following experiments were made in order to
determine the absolute lateral-action effect of a jet of steam sus
tained at an unvarying pressure.
   A stopcock having an internal diameter of 4*5 millims. was
connected with a tube proceeding direct from a large steam-
boiler the pressure of steam in which varied from 1013 to 1520

                          produced by a       Fluid in Motion.                            107
millims. of mercury*.     A glass tube, A, fig. 6, '3 metre long by
4 millims. internal diameter, was drawn out at one end to an
orifice 1*5 millim. in diameter, and was placed in the position
shown in the figure, the lower end dipping into a vessel of mer
cury, B ; C represents the end of the stopcock.        A scale was
attached to A to indicate the amount of diminution of pressure
 (and consequent ascent of mercury in A) caused by the lateral
action of the jet of steam proceeding from C.      The upper orifice
of A was placed exactly in the axis of the effluent jet.
   By looking through a jet of effluent steam of high pressure a
small inner cone (shown in the figure) is observed, to the apex
of which the greater number of particles of steam converge ;
around and beyond thisc one there is steam of less density ; and
it will be seen below that, beyond the apex of the cone, the
amount of lateral action diminishes considerably.
    The following results were obtained with a pressure of steam
equal to 1216 millims. of mercury      —            f:

height   of 105 millims.   Finally, when the centre of the orifice

108                Mr. G. F. Rodwell       on some  Effects
of 52 millims., the distance of the orifice of A from that of C
being the same throughout.
   It is thus seen that the lateral action is nearly four times
as great in the axis of the jet as at its circumference; and we
should naturally expect the particles in the axis to move with
far greater velocity than those at the circumference, for the same
reason that the water in the centre of a river moves faster than
that near the banks.         The same effect must obviously also ob
tain with solid particles such as sand, and even with large masses
of matter. Who has not observed the passage of a crowd through
a narrow channel (the corridor of a theatre for instance), and
the rapid movement of the centre stream compared with that of
the side streams ? The individuals composing the centre stream
make use of those at the sides as friction rollers; moreover the
latter are impeded by friction against the walls of the corridor.
The passage of water or steam through a resisting medium is
perfectly analogous ; hence the results mentioned above.
   A tube A, fig. 7, was fitted with a brass cap B, capable of
being screwed steam-tight upon the stopcock.                A was 450 mil
lims. longand 5 millims. in internal diameter ; the length of the
crosspiece C was 150 millims. Within C a brass tube 325 mil
lims. in diameter was introduced, so that the steam issuing from
the stopcock passed through it instead of entering C.              The lower
end of A dipped into a vessel of mercury D, and a scale was
attached to A to show the height to which mercury ascended in
virtue of the lateral action of the steam-jet issuing from the brass
tube within C.        The greatest effect was found to be produced
when the orifice of the brass tube was about 45 millims. from
the orifice of C.

    It  is usual to employ a gaseous body (air or steam) in motion
for lecture illustrations of lateral action.  As examples take, (a)
the suspension of a thin glass bulb in a vertically effluent jet of
steam ; (/8) the approach of two disks facing each other by direct
ing a jet of air through the centre of one of them so that it
strikes the other ; and (7) the collapse of a partially open sheet
of paper by blowing a current of air between the opposite leaves.
Eut the lateral action of a liquid may be quite as readily shown
as a lecture experiment.     Thus, if a tube A, fig. 8, 3 millims. in
internal diameter, be caused to deliver a stream of water (flow
ing from a cistern with a waterhead of at least a metre), parallel
 to, and immediately beneath the surface of water, air will force
 itself through the water, as shown at B, and will be carried along
by the jet until it finally escapes from the water some distance
from the point at which it entered.      Or construct a small mer
 cury gauge of the form shown in fig. 9, and let the extremity A,
 drawn out to a line point, be introduced into a liquid mass, while
 a magnified    image of the limb B is thrown upon a screen by
 means of the electric lamp : on now causing a jet of water to

    It well known that descending liquid jet presents per

and   the  previously transparent jet becomes opake.

rotating strap furnished with alternate light and dark bands,
Savart* found that its opake portion was composed of detached
masses of liquid      moreover he observed that the swellings of the

 jet were produced         by
                          drops extended horizontally, and the con
tractions      drops extended vertically — each drop passing through
                 by
a  series of oscillations, being alternately extended vertically and
horizontally, and (of necessity) midway between the two posi
tions assuming the form of perfect sphere. He further detected

110                Mr. G. F. Rodwell on       some Effects
great accuracy the transformation of a liquid cylinder into iso
lated spheres, and clearly explained the cause of the phenomena
observed by Savart.          One of the modes of examination adopted
by   Plateau   was   to lessen  the velocity of a descending liquid jet,
so that its resolution into spheres could be watched with greater
ease and without the employment             of Savart's strap or a revol
ving mirror.       He effected this by causing a stream of oil to flow
from a small funnel, through a column of liquid of slightly less
density than the oil ; it was then observed that when nearly all
the oil had flowed from the funnel (that is to say, when the ve
locity of the effluent stream was least), the stream did not pre
serve its cylindrical form, but was resolved into spheres.        Imme
diately before the separation of a sphere, a fine thread of liquid
was seen to be extended between the sphere and the liquid from
which it separated; and on the separation of the sphere this thread
suddenly contracted into one or two minute spheres.             The cause
of the small intermediate drops observed by Savart was thus ex
plained.     Their formation was afterwards observed by Magnus*
in the case of a descending stream of water, his observations
being made with a revolving mirror, and also by means of a
rapidly rotating disk furnished with a narrow slit through which
the stream was viewed.
    Professor Guthrie, in a recent paper " On Drops"f, seems
to ignore the existence of the fact that these drops were
observed by Savart, Magnus, and Plateau, and accurately
investigated      by the last-named physicist.
                                                        " When water,"
he writes,   "  falls from glass through air, immediately after the
drop separates, a very minute drop is frequently projected up
wards from the upper surface of the drop.              1 have not traced
the conditions under which this supplementary drop is formed,"
&c.     From the above mode of expression one is led to infer that
he was unaware of the previous detection of these supplementary
drops.
    The particles of liquid of a descending stream must obviously
acquire a very high velocity by the acceleration of gravity ; and
it consequently follows that the struggle between cohesion and
gravity which takes place below the vena contractu, of a descend
ing stream cannot, from the shortness of its duration, be ob
served except by means of a rotating mirror, or by some other
appliance for causing a body in motion to appear to the eye to
be at rest.      Plateau's column of oil can be readily observed to
transform itself into isolated spheres ; but the production of the
thread and its subsequent contraction into a small sphere' can

only be observed by very close watching with the eye a short
distance from the column.         Experiments of this nature are there
fore unsuited for the lecture table.         1 have, by modifying Pla
teau's experiment, reduced the velocity of a descending fluid to
a minimum, so that the separation of a sphere, together with
the intermediate thread and the sphere which it produces, can
be readily shown as a lecture experiment.
     The mode of effecting this        is,
                                      to cause the cohesion acting upon
the particles of a    fluid mass floating in      medium of nearly its
                                                         a
own density to slightly preponderate over the gravitating force
of the mass, and then,            slowly reducing the density of the
                                  by
medium,     to allow  gravity  to  act upon one portion of the mass.
     A tall beaker was filled with mixture of alcohol and water of
                                             a
the same density as oil   :   aquantity of oil was then introduced suf
ficient to form sphere about 35 millimetres in diameter. When
                 a
the sphere floated perfectly at rest in the centre of the medium,
a   small quantity   of water was added so as to render the medium
slightly   denser  than  the oil   ;the sphere now rose slowly to the
surface,   and  assumed    the  form   of    hemisphere with its plane
                                                 a
surface in contact with the surface of the liquid.           On gently
 warming the alcohol-and- water mixture, the hemisphere length
ened itself until    itbecame      thick cylinder, hemispherical below,
                                   a
and with its upper end in contact with the liquid surface.
 Then   it  began to narrow at           point nearly midway between
                                             a
 its opposite ends; and this continued until the cylinder was
 resolved into two masses of oil, separated                  by
                                                         narrow thread.
                                                                  a
A  moment later the two masses suddenly contracted, — the upper
one to  a very convex plano-convex lens with its plane surface in
contact with the liquid surface, the lower one to    nearly perfect
                                                                  a
sphere, which during its descent   to the bottom of the beaker be
came slightly extended, alternately, at right angles to and parallel
with the water-surface.   The thread of oil which had been drawn
out   by the weight of the lower mass, being no longer thus re
strained, contracted into   small sphere floating midway between

   Perhaps more effective mode of showing the experiment
             a                                                                  is
the following.     Prepare, as before,    mixture of alcohol and

water introduce quantity of oil sufficient to form
      ;              a                                 sphere from    a
40 to 50 millims. in diameter, and let the density         the mix        of
ture be such that the sphere floats 20 or 30 millims. below the
surface, the entire depth of the liquid being from 175 to 200
millims.    On heating the mixture the sphere extends itself into
an ellipsoid with its major axis at right angles to the liquid sur
face;    then gradually contracts at
        it                              point midway between the
                                                  a
ends, until, as in the previous experiment, only        fine thread   a
separates the two larger masses of oil rupture then ensues, and
                                                     ;

 112             Mr. G. F. Rodwell     on some    Effects
 the thread gathers itself into a sphere.        The lower mass com
 mences its descent as an ellipsoid having its major axis at right
 angles to the liquid surface, next becoming a sphere, then an
ellipsoid with its major axis parallel with the liquid surface, once
 more a sphere, and so on until it reaches the bottom of the
 vessel, while the upper mass of oil ascends to the surface, and
 comes to rest as a hemisphere with its plane surface in contact
 with the surface of the liquid.
    Let us consider the rationale of this experiment.
    It is universally stated that when a mass of liquid is heated
from beneath, the heat is conveyed to different parts by cur
rents (a central ascending current of warm liquid, and descend
ing side currents of cold liquid), by which means the whole mass
of liquid soon becomes of a uniform temperature.             Now, if the
liquid in the     above  experiment     rapidly acquired      a   uniform
temperature, it is obvious that the lengthening of the oil-sphere
into an ellipsoid and the transformation of the ellipsoid into
isolated masses could not take place.        For if the density of the
liquid    were uniformly   lessened,  the   oil-sphere    would descend
en masse, and rupture could "not ensue between          its particles, be
cause before the occurrence of rupture gravity must act unequally
upon the sphere; that is to say, the upper part must be com
petent, while the lower part is incompetent, to resist the action
of the force.    I was hence led to examine whether, under the
conditions of the above experiment, the liquid does rapidly
acquire a uniform temperature.
   In the case of a homogeneous liquid, or of a uniform mix
ture,   I found that the same temperature was rapidly acquired
by all parts during heating from beneath.                 An oil-sphere
placed in a perfectly uniform mixture, did not lengthen itself
into an ellipsoid, but descended without change of form to the
bottom of the beaker.      The manner of trying the experiment
described above was, to mix alcohol and water until the mixture
possessed nearly the specific gravity of oil, then to introduce
the oil, and to bring the oil-sphere to its desired position by
pouring in alcohol.     Now alcohol and water do not very readily
mix, hence the upper layers of the liquid contained more alcohol
than the lower layers ; and this accounts at once for the different
temperatures observed, because the capacities for heat of alco
hol and water differ considerably.        It will be seen by the fol
lowing results that, under the conditions of the above experi
ment, the alcohol-and-water mixture does not rapidly acquire a
uniform temperature.
   The mixture was placed in a beaker, and it occupied a depth
of 175 millims. therein ; the beaker was placed upon a flat piece of
copper heated by hot water.     In order to measure the temperature

                              produced     bij   a   Fluid in Motion.                                     113
two thermometers,       reading accurately together, were employed,
and they were read         means ofby  lens.     was unable to detect
                                                      a                  I
any  difference   of temperature  between    the liquid near the sides
of the vessel and that (in the same horizontal plane) in the cen
tre neither did find that the liquid soon acquired
     ;                        I                               uniform                            a
temperature.      Thus, after heating for some time, the liquid near
the top had      temperature of 19° C, that midway between the
                     a
top and bottom of 23° C, and the liquid at the bottom of 40O-5 C.
In another experiment, in which the heating had been continued
for a longer time, the temperature was taken in successive in
tervals     space — the entire depth of the liquid (175 millims.)

 rapidly acquired throughout the liquid mass.
     Now, at the commencement of the experiment described above
 (p. 11 1), the oil-sphere floats in static equilibrium     that to say,            ;            is
it  displaces     quantity of liquid precisely equal to its own weight,
                     a
in   a medium of uniform temperature.          On heating the liquid,                                      it
soon happens that the layer in contact with the under surface of
the oil-sphere becomes hotter, and consequently less dense, than
the layer in which the upper part of the sphere floats              part                         ;    a
of the sphere         now surrounded
                         is                 medium of its own density,

own density.        The densities, of the alcohol-and-water mixture
and of the oil, do not decrease pari passu for equal increments
of heat; and the oil does not receive heat so readily as the
mixture, for          was sometimes found to be as much as 6° C.

114              Mr. G. F. Rodwell on    some Effects
as  gravity continues to predominate, rupture becomes more and
more imminent.       When this occurs, the lower mass, no longer
restrained by the cohesion of the upper mass, and being now in
a medium of less than its own density, sinks to the bottom ;
while the upper mass, having suffered a slight decrease of den
sity by being dragged into a warmer layer by the lower mass,
and being now liberated from that weight, is in a medium of
greater density than its own, and consequently ascends to the
surface.
    It is obvious that the portion of this explanation which relates
to the separation of the lower oil-mass applies equally to the
experiment first described, in which the oil-mass, instead of
floating in the medium, had its upper (plane) surface in contact
with the liquid surface.    I  may remark, in conclusion, that while
the former experiment takes about four minutes (from the com
mencement of heating), the experiment last described does not
require more than one or two minutes. The latter experiment
is most effective, and best suited for the lecture-table.

                              Addendum.
    The following experiments (which were not finished in time
for insertion in the body of the text) would seem to prove the
correctness of the explanation given above as to the cause of the
lengthening of the oil-sphere into an ellipsoid, and its subsequent
resolution into detached masses, under the conditions of the de
scribed experiment.
    In order to ascertain the comparative rate at which the liquids
employed in that experiment acquire a uniform temperature, a
litre of each was heated for an hour, under precisely the same
conditions, and the temperatures were observed at intervals of
ten minutes.      The beaker containing the liquid was placed upon
 a surface of sand (so that all parts of the bottom of the beaker
might    be uniformly heated) spread in a thin layer upon a copper
plate heated by hot water.       The temperatures were taken by
means of two thermometers reading accurately together, one
placed with the lower part of its bulb 3 millims. from the bottom
of the beaker, and the other with the upper part of its bulb 3
millims. from the water-surface.     The depth of the liquid column
was 130 millims.
    Distilled water and methylated alcohol were first tried sepa
rately.     The temperature of the water was 6° C, and of the
alcohol 6°'5 C, the specific gravity of the latter at that tempe
rature being O830.       The following results were obtained : —

    It   is seen from the above that a uniform temperature was very
rapidly acquired by both liquids, the greatest difference in tem
perature between the uppermost and lowermost layers of water
amounting to only lo,50 C, and in the case of the alcohol to
only 0°-75 C.
   In making the experiment with the sphere of oil, it will be
borne in mind that a mixture of alcohol and water was employed,
and that the oil-sphere floating therein was brought to its de
sired position by pouring a small quantity of alcohol into the
mixture as soon as the sphere had come to rest.                   It was there
fore thought to be advisable to ascertain the rapidity with which
the mixture acquires a uniform temperature, and to what extent
this result is retarded by the addition of a known quantity of
alcohol.
   In order to determine this, a mixture was made of 500 cub.
centims. of water at 40,5 C. with 500 cub. centims. of methyl
ated alcohol at 6° C.         The resulting mixture (care being taken to
make it perfectly uniform) was found to occupy a volume of
980 cub. centims., and to possess a temperature of 140,25 C.
It was allowed to cool down to 7° C, and then heated for an
hour, under the same conditions which obtained when each
liquid was heated separately, the temperatures being noted at
similar intervals. At the end of the hour it was cooled to
7° C, and 50 cub. centims. of alcohol at 8° C. were poured
in, and the heating recommenced.                    The added alcohol was
coloured by means of a minute quantity of roseine, in order that
the depth to which it penetrated might be observed.                   (It is need
less to remark that the tinctorial power of roseine is so great
that the amount added could not affect the accuracy of the ex
periment.)         Although the alcohol was poured into the mixture
(already containing half its bulk of that fluid) from a height of
40 or 50 millims., it showed no tendency to mix readily : the
great bulk of it (as shown by the amount of colour) remained

  to gradually shade off till at a depth of 55 millims. it disap
  peared; so that the 50 cub. centims. of added alcohol were entirely
  in the uppermost 55 millims. of liquid.             The entire quantity of
  liquid now exceeded 1000 cub. centims., and its depth was 140
  millims.        The following results were obtained : —

      It will be observed that the alcohol-and-water mixture acquired
 a   uniform temperature as rapidly as either of its components
 heated alone, the greatest difference between the uppermost and
 lowermost layers of liquid amounting to only 1°C.                     But after
the addition of the alcohol (although its quantity was less than
one-twentieth of the total amount of liquid heated) a very dif
ferent result is observed; for we find no less than 140,75 C. dif
ference of temperature between the uppermost and lowermost
layers of liquid.        The amount of heat, however, associated with
the entire mass of each liquid at any given time during the heat
ing is nearly the same, but it is differently distributed.                   If we
take mean temperatures, we find that the greatest difference
amounts to l0,o C. ; but the approach is often much nearer, and
in one case we have coincidence.               Thus at the end of forty mi
nutes' heating, the temperatures of the uppermost and lowermost
layers of the alcohol-and-water mixture were respectively 30° C.
and 31° C. : and of the same mixture after the addition of the
alcohol, 26 C. and 35° C. : we thus obtain the following means .

   On continuing to heat the mixture containing the added

coalesced with the liquid beneath                  it,
                                     and the entire mass of

  XVI.      On the Wave-Lengths of the Transmission of Muscular and
      Nervous Action.        By the Rev. Samuel Haughton, M.D.,
      Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin.
       To    the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
          Gentlemen,
               following result may prove of some interest to those
  THEphysiologists who are capable               of applying it so as to draw
  from    it  the consequences   it   seems  capable of affording.
      (1) The rate of the muscular susurrus, first observed by Wol-
  laston, and estimated by him at
                                            " from 20 to 30 in a second,"
  has been fixed by Dr. Collongues of Paris, by means of tuning-
  forks, at 35 in a second, and by myself, by means of organ-
  pipes, at 32 in a second.
      (2) The rate of the tinnitus aurium, which is caused by the
  action of the nerves, has been fixed by me at 1024 in a second.
     From these data, it follows that the rate of nerve action is from
  29 to 32 times as fast as the rate of muscular action.
     (3) The experiments of Dr. Schelske have shown that the
 velocity of wave-transmission          of sensation in the living body of
  man is 97 feet per second.           And, lastly,
      (4)   The   experiments  of  Professor     Aebe, of Berne, prove that
 the velocity of wave-transmission of muscular contraction in frogs
 is 3 feet per second.
     The wave-transmission         in the nerves is therefore 32 times
  as fast as the wave-transmission         in the muscles — or 29 times as
 great if we adopt Helmholtz's determination of the rate of trans
 mission in the motor nerves of the legs of a frog, viz. 88 feet
 per second.
     Now in any kind of wave-propagation, whether due to mecha
 nical or chemical changes, we have
                                \=vt;
 where
           A, is the wave-length,
           v is the wave-velocity,
           t is the rate of vibration,    or period of the change.
     It appears from the preceding physiological experiments, taken
 together, that v varies inversely as t when muscles and nerves
are compared ; and consequently that X is constant : or
     The wave-length of the transmission of muscular and nervous
action is constant, and lies between 1-125 and l-225 inch.
    If  this conclusion be correct, important consequences ought to
follow from it ; for the nerves and muscles are so connected in

their wave-lengths the same, and consequently the positions of the
nodes identical, notwithstanding the very different velocities with
which wave-pulses are propagated along them.

 XVII.     On the Excentricity of the Earth's Orbit, and its Physi
      cal Relations to the Glacial Epoch. By James Croll*.
            Philosophical     Magazine for January 1866 contains
THE Table of the
         a                  values of the excentricity of the earth's
orbit for one million of years before and after the epoch a.d.
1800. From that Table it is seen that between 1,000,000 and
700,000 years ago there were three periods when the excen
tricity reached a very high value.          It appears highly probable
that if the glacial epoch resulted from an extreme condition of
excentricity, these three periods might be those of the boulder-
clay, when the country was completely covered with ice, an
                      I
opinion in which am happy to find Sir Charles Lyell concurs t-
As the Table referred to gives the values only at epochs 50,000
years apart, in order to arrive at a more accurate knowledge of
the condition of the earth's orbit during those periods,            I have
calculated the excentricity at epochs 10,000 years apart from
1,000,000 to 700,000 years ago. Mr. Stone found that about
210,000 years ago there was a period when the excentricity
reached the value of 0'0575 J.          In order to include this period,
I  have also given the excentricities from the present time back
for 250,000 years at periods 10,000 years apart.
    Column IV. gives the number of days that the length of
the winter exceeds that of the summer when the winter occurs
in aphelion.      At present our winter is about eight days shorter
than our summer, but 850,000 years ago, when it occurred in
aphelion, it would be actually about thirty-five days longer than
the summer.
   Column V. gives the number of degrees Fahrenheit that the
midwinter temperature of our island would be lower than at
present.     This column has been calculated by a method de
scribed in the 'Reader' for December 9th, 1865, and which

colder than the opposite hemisphere which has its winter in
perihelion and enjoying an equable climate; and the conse
quence     is,
             the aerial currents from the pole to the equator
must be much stronger on the colder hemisphere than on the
warmer because the difference between the temperature of the
pole and the equator      greater on the former hemisphere than
                                   is
on the latter.   When the northern hemisphere, for example,                         is
under glaciation, the north-east trade-winds will be much
stronger than the south-east.       The medial line between the
trades will consequently lie    considerable distance to the south
                                            a
of the equator.   The effect of the northern trades blowing across
the equator to      great distance will be to impel the warm
                           a
water of the tropics over into the Southern Ocean.     And this, to
an enormous extent, will tend to exaggerate the difference be
tween the temperature of the two hemispheres.
    Butit
       is       worthy of notice that strong undercurrent of air
                                                   a
flowing from the north pole to the equator implies an equally
strong upper current flowing from the equator to the pole.
Now,  if  the effect of the undercurrent be to impel the warm
water of the tropics into the Southern Ocean, and thus raise
the temperature and melt the ice in the southern hemisphere,
the effect of the upper current will be to carry moisture raised
 by  evaporation in tropical regions away to the north, there to
be deposited in the form of snow on reaching the great ice-
sheet covering the arctic and temperate regions.          The general
effect of the whole will be to produce an accumulation of snow
and ice in the northern hemisphere, and           diminution of these
                                                             a
in the southern.
    The effect of the aerial currents on the Gulf- stream during
 the glacial epoch must have been peculiarly marked. It has been
 shown*    that     the equatorial current of the Atlantic, the feeder
                      if
of the Gulf-stream, were removed merely            few degrees to the
                                                             a
south of   its  present position, the entire current would be turned
 into the Brazilian branch and flow into the Southern Ocean,
and thus probably stop the Gulf-stream altogether.                 But
 during  the   glacial epoch, on  the northern  hemisphere,  when  the
 medial line lay at       considerable distance to the south of the
                               a
equator, the greater portion of the equatorial current,            not         if
the entire current, must have flown into the Southern Ocean.
 But let us assume, what will certainly be admitted to be          mo           a
derate estimate, that 850,000 years ago, when the excentricity
was near its superior limit, that the Gulf-stream was reduced
to one-half its present volume, when the northern hemisphere
was under glaciation.          The midwinter temperature in the
centre of Scotland, as        well known,
                                     is        about 28° higher than

it would otherwise be were it not for the influence of the Gulf-
stream *.    A reduction of the Gulf-stream to one-half its pre
sent volume would lower the temperature of the centre of Scot
land about 14°.
    According to column V. the temperature of this country
850,000 years ago, owing to the greater distance of the sun at
midwinter, would be lowered 450,3.       Now add 14° for the di
minution of the Gulf-stream, and we have 590,3 below the pre
 sent midwinter temperature, or— 20O-3 as the midwinter tem
perature of the centre of Scotland at that period.     Assuming,
then, that the diminution of the Gulf-stream was propor
tionate to the extent of the excentricity, column VII. gives the
actual midwinter temperature of the centre of Scotland at the
corresponding periods.
    The difference between the midwinter temperature of Scot
 land at some of those periods and its present is certainly great.
 But there is,  however, nothing extravagant or unlikely in sup
 posing the existence of so low  atemperature during the glacial
epoch when we reflect that at the present day there are places
on the same parallel of latitude as Scotland which have      amid
winter temperature nearly as low as any indicated in the Table     :
for example, at the Cumberland House in North America,
situated in  a  lower latitude than the south of Scotland, the
present midwinter temperature     isupwards of 13° below zero.

                                I   think,    by
                                              the fact pointed out
 by the Rev. Mr. Crosskey from       comparison of the fossils of
                                     a
the glacial beds of Canada with those of the Clyde, that the
change of climate in Canada since the glacial epoch has been
far less complete than in Scotland        The American continent
                                         t-
was no doubt, during the glacial epoch, as cold as,     not colder
                                                        if
than the continent of Europe; but then,           the Gulf-stream
                                                   if
was stopped during the glacial epoch, the rise of temperature
which would follow on the return of the stream at the close of
that epoch would be greater in Scotland and all over the
western shores of Europe than in America.
   It might be thought that    if the winters had been so much
colder at the periods in question than at present, owing to the
sun's greater distance during that season, the summers, on the
other hand, ought to have been so much warmer, owing to the
sun's greater proximity.    About 850,000 years ago the winters,
according to the Table, were 45° colder than at present       ;and

124    Mr.. J. Croll on   the   Excentricity of   the   Earth's Orbit,
were the sun's distance the only element that determined the
temperature, the summers would have been at least 45° warmer
than at present.       But had such been the cas6, there could
have been no glacial epoch.       For a summer so warm, notwith
standing    its shortness,  would  have been sufficient to melt the
snows of winter.      In this case, the theory which attributes the
glacial epoch to an extreme condition of excentricity must be
abandoned.      It was, no doubt, this which had led to the gene
ral, if not universal, belief that the glacial epoch could not have
resulted from an augmentation in the excentricity of the earth's
orbit. And it is perfectly true that were it not for physical
agencies which are brought into operation by the change of ex
centricity, and thus to a great extent alter the condition of
things, the astronomical causes would wholly fail in producing
a glacial epoch ; for the purely astronomical effects of excentri
city, as has been clearly shown by Sir John Herschel*, Aragof,
 Humboldt %, and others, are compensated by others of an oppo
site character; so that excentricity, viewed from an astronomical
stand-point, does not appear capable of accounting for the gla
cial epoch.    In short, without having taken into consideration
the physical causes to which we refer, it was impossible that any
relation could ever have been perceived between a high condi
tion of excentricity and the glacial epoch.
   There is one astronomical effect however, which          not comis,
pensated     by an astronomical    effect of an opposite character.
The total quantity of heat received from the sun per annum                  is
inversely proportional to the minor axis of the earth's orbit.
And this has been stated by Sir John Herschel to be an astro
nomical vera causa of change of climate during geological epochs§.
But as the excentricity increases, the total quantity of heat re
ceived from the sun increases also.        Hence astronomy would
lead us to conclude with Prof. Haughton||, that         glacial epoch
                                                              a
ought to occur, not when the excentricity       at the superior, but
                                                  is
at the inferior limit.   In former paper
                                a              endeavoured to show
                                               I

than neutralized    by
                     causes of physical nature, and that, instead of
                                    a
an increase of excentricity producing an increase of temperature,

snow and ice.       While the ground remains covered with snow
and ice,  as  was  shown  at considerable length on a former occa
sion *, dense fogs prevail, which cut off a great portion of the
sun's rays and thus lower the summer temperature.             But even
supposing    the sun's rays  were to  reach  the  earth with  their full
intensity, they would,     no  doubt,   melt   the  snow  accumulated
during the long winter, but they would fail to raise the summer
temperature so long as the snow remained unmelted.           In Green
land, country
       a          covered with snow   and ice, the pitch has  been seen
to melt on the side of a ship exposed to the direct rays of the sun,
while at the same time the surrounding air was far below the
freezing-point ; a thermometer exposed to the direct radiation
of the sun has been observed to stand above 100°, while the air
surrounding the instrument was actually 12° below the freezing-
point f. A similar experience has been recorded by travellers
on the snow-fields of the Alps .         J
    These results, surprising as they no doubt appear, are what
 we ought to expect under the circumstances.        The diathermancy
 of air has been well established by the researches of Professor
 Tyndall on radiant heat.      Perfectly dry air seems to be nearly
 incapable of absorbing radiant heat. The entire radiation passes
through it almost without any sensible absorption. Consequently
the pitch on the side of the ship may be melted, or the bulb of the
thermometer raised to a high temperature by the direct rays of
the sun, while the surrounding air remains intensely cold.        "A
joint of meat," says Professor Tyndall, " might be roasted before
a fire, the air around the joint being cold as ice" §.     The air is
cooled by contact with the snow-covered ground, but is not
 heated by the radiation from the sun. .
     When the air is humid and charged with aqueous vapour, a
similar cooling effect also takes place, but in a slightly different
way.     Air charged with aqueous vapour is a good absorber of
radiant heat, but it can only absorb those rays which agree with
it in period.   It so happens that rays from snow and ice are, of
 all others, those which it absorbs best. The humid air will ab
 sorb the total radiation from the snow and ice, but it will allow
the greater part of, if not nearly all, the sun's rays to pass unab-
 sorbed.    But during the day, when the sun is shining, the ra
 diation from the snow and ice to the air is negative; that                        is,

126      Mr.   J.   Croll on   the   Eccentricity of   the   Earth's Orbit,
the sun ; and, as a consequence, in a country like Greenland,
covered with an icy mantle, the temperature of the air, even
during summer, seldom rises above the freezing-point.
   Were it not for the ice, the summers of North Greenland,
owing to the continuance of the sun above the horizon, would be
as warm as those of England ; but, instead of this, the Greenland
summers are colder than our winters.       Cover India with an ice-
sheet, and its summers would be colder than those of England.
    Ifat the glacial epoch the heat of the sun during the short
Bummer in perihelion, for reasons already stated, would fail to
melt the total quantity of snow accumulated during the long
and intensely cold winter — which no doubt it would— then the
snow and ice would accumulate year by year till the surface of
the entire country would be covered.         After this the mean
temperature of the summers, no matter what the intensity of
the sun's rays might be, could not rise far above the freezing-
point.    The rays which fell upon the ice-covered ground would
have no tendency whatever to raise the temperature ; they would
simply melt the ice ; and as the ice-covered surface would cool
the air more rapidly than the sun would heat                    it,
                                                       the summers
could not possibly be warm.
   At those periods of extreme excentricity when the winter oc
curred in perihelion, there would be    short and warm winter and
                                              a                                   ,
a long and moderately cold summer.         The winters would pro
bably be about as warm as the summers, and an equable and
uniform condition of climate would prevail over the whole year.
The midsummer temperature 850,000 years ago, did the winter
occur in perihelion, would be about 75°, according to the mode
of calculation adopted. At the periods 950,000 and 750,000
years ago the temperature would be 60° and 63° respectively.
But there are certain modifying circumstances which might pro
bably prevent the temperature of the winters from rising much
above perhaps 50° or 60°.
   In the arctic regions there would be an absence of the sun for
several months during winter, and the cold from stellar space
would no doubt be intense.      This would tend to lower the tem
perature of the winters in temperate and subarctic regions to                 a
certain extent.    But, on the other hand, there       one powerful
                                                                is
agent which would now come into play, that would prevent the
possibility of    low temperature in arctic regions even in the
                    a
absence of the sun.      refer to the enormous quantity of warm
                         I
water which at this period would be flowing into those regions.
   The midsummer temperature determined according to the
sun's distance at the periods 950,000, 850,000, and 750,000
years ago, were the winter then in perihelion, would be 39°,
270,4, and 36° respectively.    But, again, there are here also mo

            and its Physical Relations to the Glacial Epoch.           127
difying causes which would prevent the possibility of the sum
mer temperature ever falling so low as 27° or even 36°; for sur
rounded by a warm sea our summers could at this time no more
have been cold than during the glacial epoch they could have
been warm when the land was covered with cold ice.
     I feel satisfied that it will yet turn out, when the subject has
been better investigated, that the influence of ocean-currents in
modifying the climate of the polar regions of the globe has not
been duly estimated.          Were there no ocean-currents, and the
polar regions      to  depend alone upon the direct heat of the sun,
the temperature of those regions would be enormously below
¦what it actually is.       The difference of temperature between the
equatorial    and   polar regions of the globe is far less than it would
 otherwise be, did the temperature of each zone depend alone
 upon the quantity of heat received directly from the sun.               A
 very   considerable     amount  of the temperature    of polar  regions is
 due to the heat absorbed by the ocean in equatorial regions, and
 conveyed there by ocean- currents.        This process tends to lower
 the temperature of the equatorial regions and raise the tempera
 ture of the polar, and thus reduce the difference between the two.
      The truth of what has just been stated will be obvious if we
 simply reflect on the quantity of heat transferred from the equa
 torial to the northern regions by one stream alone, namely the
 Gulf-stream.         I  have not been able to find any trustworthy
 estimate of the actual- quantity of water conveyed by the Gulf-
  stream. From a rough estimate made after an examination of the
  Charts of the United States Coast Survey,        I believe that the total
  quantity of water transferred is at least equal to a stream fifty
  miles broad and 1000 feet deep, flowing at the rate of four miles
  an hour ; and the mean temperature of the entire mass of
  moving water is not under 65° at the moment of leaving the
  Gulf.     Captain Maury considers the Gulf-stream equal to a
  stream 32 miles broad and 1200 feet deep, flowing at the rate of
  five knots an hour*.           This is a somewhat higher estimate.
  Now the density of air to that of water is as 1 to 770, and its
  specific heat to that of water is as 1 to 4'2.             Consequently
  the same amount of heat that would raise 1 cubic foot of water
  1°, would raise 770 cubic feet of air 40,2, or 3234 cubic feet
  1°.    The quantity of heat conveyed by the Gulf-stream is there
  fore equal to that which would be conveyed by a current of air
  3234 times the volume of the Gulf-stream and at the same
  temperature and moving with the same velocity.                In order to
  convey an equal amount of heat from the tropics by means of
   an aerial current, it would be necessary to have a current about
   1 \ mile deep and at the temperature of 65° blowing at the rate of

  four miles an hour from every part of. the equator over the
  northern hemisphere towards the pole.         If its velocity were equal
  to that of a good sailing-breeze, which Sir John Herschel states
  to be about twenty-one miles an hour, the current would require
  to be above 1200 feet deep.       The Gulf-stream, before it returns
  from its northern journey, is cooled down to about 40°. Each
  cubic foot of water therefore carries from the tropics upwards
  of 1500 units of heat. A greater quantity of heat is probably
  conveyed by the Gulf-stream alone from the tropical to the tem
  perate and arctic regions than by all the aerial currents which
  flow from the equator.
     During the warm periods of the glacial epoch (that              when           is,
  the glaciation prevailed in the southern hemisphere), the quan
  tity of warm water flowing from the tropical to the arctic re
  gions would, as we have already seen, far exceed that which                             is
  being transferred at present.      The effect that this would have
  along with the short and warm winter in melting the polar ice
  would be enormous.      At that period Greenland, in all probability,
  would be free of ice.
     We are apt, on the other hand, to overestimate the amount
 of heat conveyed from tropical regions to us             means of aerialby
 currents.     The only currents which flow from the equatorial
 regions are the upper currents or anti-trades, as they are called.
 But   it   isnot possible that much heat can be conveyed to us
 directly by them.      The upper currents of- the trade-winds, even
 at the equator, are nowhere below the snow-line.              They must
 therefore lie in     region actually below the freezing-point.
                           a                                            In
 fact, if those currents were warm, they would elevate the snow
 line above themselves.       The heated air rising off the hot burn
ing ground       at the  equator, after ascending for          few miles,      a
becomes exposed to the intense cold of the upper regions of the
atmosphere.       It then very soon loses all its heat, and returns
from the equator much colder than              came.     it    impossible It   is
that we can receive any heat directly from the equatorial re
gions      by
            means of aerial currents.      It perfectly true that the
                                                          is
south-west wind, to which we owe so much of our warmth                                    in
this country,        continuation of the anti-trade. But the heat
                      is   a
which this wind brings to us             not derived from the equa
                                                is
torial regions.     This will appear evident,         we but reflect that,
                                                                   if
before the upper current descends to the snow-line after leaving
the equator,      itmust traverse      space of at least 2000 miles;

and to perform this long journey several days will be required.
During all this time the air          in    region below the freezing-
                                           is        a
point  ;  and    it   is
                    perfectly  obvious  that      the time    bybegins to      it

which  it  has been travelling.

  If such   be the case,           it is evident that
                                           a wind whose tempera
ture is below 32° could never warm a country such as ours,
whose temperature does not fall below 38° or 39°.       The heat of
our south-west winds is derived, not from the equator but from
the warm water of the Atlantic — in fact, from the Gulf-stream.
The upper current derives its heat after it descends to the earth.
There is one way, however, whereby heat is indirectly conveyed
from the equator by that current ; that                    is,
                                              in the form of aque
ous vapour.    In the formation of one pound of water from
aqueous vapour, as Professor Tyndall strikingly remarks,                         a
quantity of heat given out sufficient to melt five pounds of cast
                       is
iron*.   It  must, however, be borne in mind that the greater
part of the moisture of the south-west and west winds           de         is
rived from the ocean in temperate regions.       The upper current
receives the greater part of its moisture after     descends to the   it
earth.    The greater part of the moisture received at the equa
toris  condensed and falls as rain in those regions.
   These, as well as many other considerations which might be
stated, seem to lead to the conclusion that, in order to raise the
mean temperature of the whole earth, water should be placed
along the equator — and not land, as            generally believed.
                                                           is
For if  land    is
               placed at  the  equator, we prevent the possibility
of conveying the sun's heat from the equatorial regions                          by
means of ocean-currents.      The transference of heat could only
then be effected         by
                     means of the upper currents of the trades                   ;
for the heat conveyed by conduction along the solid coast,     any,        if
can have no sensible effect on climate.    But these currents, as
we have just seen, are ill adapted for conveying heat.
   The surface of the ground at the equator becomes intensely
heated   by  the sun's rays.   This causes      to radiate off its
                                                                 it

                                                     a
under the same conditions. Again, the air in contact with the
hot ground becomes also more rapidly heated than in contact
with water and consequently the ascending current of air carries
            ;
off greater amount of heat.

                                                   if
were transferred    means of the upper currents to high latitudes
                         by
and there employed to warm the earth, then the heat thus con
veyed might to considerable extent compensate for the absence
                     a
of ocean-currents, and land at the equator might in this case be
nearly as well adapted as water for raising the temperature of the
whole earth. But such      not the case
                                   is     for the heat carried up by

130     Mr.  J. Croll on   the  Excentricity of  the  Earth's Orbit.
earth has of getting quit of the heat received from the sun, and of
thus retaining itself at a much lower temperature than it would
otherwise be.     It is in the equatorial regions that the earth loses
as well as gains the greater part of its heat.        So of all places it is
here that we ought to place the substance best adapted for pre
 venting the dissipation of the earth's heat into space, if we wish to
 raise the general temperature of the earth.           Water, of all sub
 stances in nature, seems to possess this quality to the greatest
 extent ; and, besides, it is a fluid, and therefore adapted by means
of currents to . carry the heat which it receives from the sun to
 every corner of the globe.
    In assuming those three periods of great excentricity between
 1,000,000 and 700,000 years ago to be those of the true unstra-
tified boulder-clay (Lower Till) , there is one slight difficulty that
meets us. It seems to place the glacial epoch too far back. Can
it be really 700,000 years since the close of the period of the
boulder-clay ?
    When we look at a gorge several thousand feet in depth that
has been cut out of the solid rock since the period of the boulder-
clay by a small streamlet, and reflect that this streamlet will run
for centuries without producing any perceptible effect on its
rocky bed, our first impression would be that 700,000 years is but
 a short period for such a feeble agent to perform such an enor
mous amount of work.           But we are deceived. Time, as repre
sented by geological phenomena, is deeply impressive ; and when
we attempt to express it in figures we are apt to be misled ; for
we can form but a very inadequate conception of immense dura
tion represented in numbers.           If a stream were to deepen its
channel only one-tenth of an inch in a year, it would in 700,000
years cut a gorge nearly 6000 feet deep.             It would deepen its
channel nearly 600 feet were it to scoop out only an inch in a
century.
    The quantity of sediment discharged into the sea annually by
the Mississippi river is 28,188,083,892 cubic feet.            The area of
drainage is 39,029,760,000,000 square feet*.             Consequently 1
foot is being removed off the face of the country every 1388 years
and carried into the sea.        If the rate of denudation be as great
in this country as in America, then 500 feet must have beeD
removed off the face of the country and carried by our rivers
into the sea since the period of the boulder-clay, if we place that
period 700,000 years back.           Humboldt thinks that the mean
elevation of all the land is less than 1000 feet.           According to
the rate at which the rivers are carrying the land into the sea,
if there be no more elevations of the land, our continents will

not remain over one million and a half years above the sea-
level.
    It may therefore yet turn out that between 240,000 and
80,000 years ago might be the period of the glacial epoch, and
that those glacial epochs between 1,000,000 and 700,000 years
ago may belong to the Miocene period.
   With the view of ascertaining if the superior limit of excentri-
city was reached about 850,000 years ago,           I  determined the
values for one or two' periods closely before and after this period,
but cannot find a higher value than that which has been assigned
to it.

   There is another phenomenon necessarily connected with the
changes of the excentricity, viz. the submergence and emergence
of the land resulting from the displacement of the earth's centre
of gravity occasioned by the transference of the ice-cap from the
one hemisphere to the other, to which       I shall at present simply
allude.                       I
           About a year ago stated, as an objection to this theory,
that the lowering of the ocean by the removal of the water to
form the cap would exceed the rise occasioned by the displace
ment of the centre.       Since then this objection has been re
peatedly urged. There are, however, several considerations which
appear to have been overlooked by those who have discussed the
submergence question.        When these are taken into account, it
will  be found  that  the objection referred to is rather premature,
and that, even assuming the earth to be a rigid mass throughout,
a submergence to the extent of 100 or 200 feet is not only a
possible but a necessary effect.     But the discussion of this point
must be deferred till another occasion.

four years in traversing that country in all directions, from con-

132                Mr. D. Forbes' s Researches       on the
siderably south of Santiago northwards up to the frontiers of
Bolivia in the desert of Atacama, and in inspecting all the prin
cipal, and a great number of the lesser, mining districts scattered
along the range of the Cordilleras.
    These explorations enabled me not only to visit, with but
very few exceptions, all the mineral, localities mentioned in Do-
           f
meyko's      Mineralogy'*, then the only work upon the subject,
but also to more than double the number of species therein de
scribed as occurring in Chile.
    Such an investigation, as might be expected, gave me not
only the opportunity of forming an extensive and valuable col
lection of minerals, but also of specially studying the occurrence
of the minerals themselves, with reference to the geological
position of the rock-matrix in which they were imbedded ; and
it was soon evident, upon comparing the data obtained, that, so
far from the appearance of minerals (using the word mineral
more especially to designate such compounds as differ from the
bulk of the rock -matrix) being, as is generally considered, acci
dental, on the contrary, if we except only a small number
of more usually occurring compounds which are common to
a variety of circumstances,           the others invariably presented
themselves     under   similar conditions, had the same associated
 minerals along with them, and, when the geological age of
the eruptions in which they occurred could be satisfactorily as
 certained, frequently, if not always, corresponded in geological
age.
    In Chile, as elsewhere, the intrusive rocks, with their accom
panying metallic lodes, furnish the greater number of mineral
species, and it was everywhere found that similar minerals, or
classes of minerals, accompanied the eruption of similar rocks.
    In the present communication, therefore, it is intended to
bring forward a statement of the mineral species met with in
Chile, and then to attempt a classification or grouping of the same
in accordance with the mode of what might be termed their
geological occurrence.
    The following enumeration represents probably as correct a
list of the Chilian mineral species, together with their chemical
formulaef, as can at present be attempted.
   * Domeyko has since published a second edition of his work, with con
siderable additions; but the list of Chilian mineral species here brought for
ward will be found still more extensive.
   t The formula? are all arranged according to the old notation, as the
pew has as yet not been generally adopted by mineralogists.

    In  the classification    of these minerals the following arrange
ment    will be employed as fulfilling all necessary conditions : —
    1.  Minerals of meteoric origin.
    2.  Minerals the products of active volcanoes.
    3.  Minerals of the recent or unconsolidated surface-deposits.
    4.  Minerals of the tertiary formations.
    5.  Minerals of the post-cretaceous basaltic dykes.
    6.  Minerals of the post-oolitic diorite eruptions, and their
accompanying         metallic veins.
       (a) Minerals resulting from the mutual reactions and alte
           ration of the above under the influence of air, fresh and
           sea- water.
    7. Minerals of the great oolitic porphyrite eruptions with their
interstratified tuffs, and other contemporaneous beds.
       (a) Mineral products of the decomposition               and alteration
           of do.
       (b) Minerals specially developed in these rocks at the points
           of contact with the intrusion of the before-mentioned
           Diorite and basalt.
    8. Minerals of the post-Silurian auriferous granite eruptions
and accompanying metallic veins.
       (a) Mineral products of the alteration of above.
    9. Minerals of the metamorphic rocks of pre-Devonian age.
       (a) Minerals specially developed in these rocks at the point
           of contact with the granite intrusions.
    It may here be remarked that the greater part of Chile seems
to have been above water from the Silurian to the Liassic period*,
and again from the Neocomian to the period of the deposition
of the older tertiary formations on that coast.
                      (1)  Minerals of Meteoric Origin.
    In   the aerolites     known to have fallen in Chile are found
only

            Nickel iron.               I        Protosulphide of iron.
   * Traces of apparently Triassic rocks are, however, found, especially in
the north of Chile, which become more strongly developed still further
northwards in Bolivia and Peru.

And it may    be remarked that a microscopic examination of the
peridote  found  in aerolites reveals a very distinct structure,
altogether characteristic of the same, and differing from that of
the olivine found in other rocks.

      (4)   Minerals composing           the Beds    of   the   Tertiary Formations.
   In these formations, besides lignite, sphserosiderite, calcite,
and iron-pyrites, 'few mineral substances are found in       suffi                       a

            (5) Minerals       of   the Post-Cretaceous         Basaltic Dykes.
   These rocks have     strong general resemblance to the basalts
                                a
of the Giant's Causeway in Ireland, and, like that, are generally
*o compact as only to allow of their components being distin
guishable         by

some cases Labradorite has been made out with certainty, along
with augite or hypersthene, and magnetic mineral the character

Causeway), or possibly magnetite or magnetic titanoferrite.
     The zeolites, Chabazite, Laumonite, Prehnite, scolezite, and
stilbite also occur, either in this basalt or at its junction with
the oolitic porphyrites.
    (6)   Minerals of     the Post- Oolitic Diorite Eruptions, with their
                         accompanying Metallic Veins.
     The diorites themselves are composed only of felspar and
hornblende when normal, and never contain quartz, unless in
localities where they have broken through quartzose strata, and
 in so doing may have taken up some quartz at points close to
the junction.        I  cannot state what exact felspar or felspars are
 to be regarded as normal constituents ; but albite appears to be
frequently present : the hornblende varies from dark green-black
 to light green; and occasionally even white (asbestos) appears as
 a constituent.        These eruptions are far the richest in associated
 minerals ; and we find the following species of primary mine

  them associated with the following .secondary minerals:—

(7) Minerals pertaining to the great Porphyrite Eruptions of the
    Oolitic Period, with their interstratified tuffs and other contem
   poraneous beds.
   These porphyries are seen both in the form of dykes break
ing through the strata, and as immense beds of crystalline rock
interstratified with ashes, tuffs, and breccias, the two latter of
which apparently have been poured out under and more or less
broken up and stratified by the action of the ocean.              These
rocks are     true porphyries, being composed of crystals of felspar
in a felspathic base ; when occasionally some crystals of Uralite
are found in them, they become true Uralite porphyries; but
quartz is never met with as a constituent, except in such circum
stances as indicate that it has been produced as the result of
subsequent alteration, or of more or less complete decomposition
of the felspar in the rock itself.
    It is to be regretted that as yet no study of the felspar species
constituting these rocks has been made ; but triclinic felspars are
present, whilst oligoclase is noted as having been met with along
with soda-lime felspars.       Thin beds of impure limestone and lig
nite are occasionally met with amongst the stratified tuffs ; and
in some of the porphyries the following zeolites have been spa
ringly encountered : — Chabazite, Laumonite, Prehnite, scolezite,
and stilbite, as well as agate, common opal, and calcite, the latter
three minerals evidently formed from the decomposition of lime-
felspar.

quent development of the following minerals, evidently formed
by a recombining and recrystallizing action on the components
of the strata themselves, viz. axinite, epidote, melanite, lapis lazuli,
scapolite, and tourmaline ; and we also find beds of limestone
converted into anhydrite and gypsum, apparently from the sul
phurous fumes which have accompanied the diorite eruptions, and
which also appear to have been a main agent in the production
of much kaolin and hydrosilicate of alumina produced from de
composition of felspars ; whilst the lignite beds encountered near
dioritic eruptions are frequently converted into true mineral
carbon, retaining the burnt woody structure, or into anthracite.

 140         M. P.   Schutzenberger     on the Substitution of the
      From the above resume of the mineralogy of Chile, it will be
 seen    that there is an evident tendency of the various minerals,
 or groups of minerals, to show definite relations of association
 not only with one another, but with the appearance of certain
 eruptions of crystalline rocks, and that the appearance of a
 mineral under more than one condition is the exception, and
 not the rule, and is only the case with some of the more
 common species, as quartz, calcite, iron-pyrites, and some few
 others.
     It can also be noted that frequently, when the same crystal-
 lographic species appears under more than one condition of oc
 currence, the mineral is found in each case to be marked by
 distinctive crystallographical or chemical characters : thus, for
 example, garnet, when found in the metamorphic                or granitic
 rocks, appears as almandine or common garnet (an iron-alu
 mina garnet), but when in the dioritic rocks, or in contact
 with the same, it appears as colophonite or melanite (an iron-
 lime garnet) ; and although as yet not found in Chile, we know
 that garnet, when occurring in trappean rocks, presents itself
 as pyrope.        Similar relations can be traced in the case of mica,
 olivine, hornblende, apatite, and various other minerals.
     Again, on perusal of our Chilean list, it will be found that
 many minerals, usually so abundant and characteristic of mi
neral deposits in other parts of the world, are here present in
 but extremely minute quantities, as magnetic pyrites, fluor
 spar, rutile, &c. ; whilst many others, as Cassiterite, Wolfram,
 strontianite, celestine, Witherite, chrome iron, beryl, are totally
wanting.
     When we examine the mineral list, we observe therein com
pounds of thirty-six of the chemical elements, but find that
tin, titanium, strontium, fluorine, glucinum, lithium, tung
sten, tantalum, columbium, platinum, yttrium, cerium,                lan
thanum, didymium, uranium, selenium, tellurium, and several
others are either undiscovered as yet or only found in minute
traces.

       This article is an abridgment of a very interesting paper of Dr.
Schutzenberger' s bearing date 1863. Owing to the circumstance of its

            Metal in   a Salt by Electro-negative    Elements.         141
acetic acid with oxide of chlorine. 20-02 grms. of anhydrous acetic
acid in a state of purity, and cooled by meansof a mixture of salt
and ice, were treated with 17 08 grms. of liquid hypochlorous
acid. The mixture of the two substances in equivalent propor
tions has the colour of blood at first, and shows no signs of im
mediate action, but soon begins to lose colour, even when kept
in the freezing-mixture, and does not disengage gas, nor lose
weight.      From this disappearance of colour, it is reasonable to
infer that combination, or at any rate some kind of chemical
action, has taken place.       To make sure that the acetic acid had
been saturated with hypochlorous acid, a portion of the product
was mixed with an excess of hypochlorous acid, which commu
nicated to it a persistent red tint.         On subsequent heating in
the water-bath to 30° C, the excess of hypochlorous acid was
driven off, and the liquid became colourless as before.
    The same result may be arrived at more conveniently by
leading a stream of dry hypochlorous acid at once into anhy
 drous acetic acid surrounded with cold water, until the liquid ac
 quires a decidedly yellow colour.         The gas is readily absorbed
 and combines immediately; afterwards the excess of hypo
 chlorous acid is expelled by heating to 30° C.
    The resulting acetate of chlorine is a liquid of a very pale
 bright yellow, with a powerful and irritating smell, calling to
 mind that of its two constituents.
     It explodes violently when heated to a temperature bordering
 on 100° C, sometimes with production of light, if the quantity
 of substance operated upon is sufficient.
     It keeps very well in the dark and at a low temperature ; but
 in direct or diffused daylight and at ordinary temperatures it
 undergoes gradual decomposition, evolving oxygen and chlorine,
 and leaving acetic acid.        Under these conditions the stoppers
 of the bottles containing it are thrown out with violence.
     It dissolves instantly and in all proportions in water, giving
 a  mixture   of hydrated acetic and hypochlorous acids which de
 colorizes solution of sulphate of indigo, disengages oxygen
 when heated, and in fact presents all the characteristic               re
 actions of the two acids.       This result shows that in the original
 compound both anhydrides exist combined without any com
 plex change.

 which it merits. The last-named reaction puts into the hands of the che
 mist a convenient method of making a regular descent of the fatty alcohol
 series. Any given normal alcohol being taken, it may be oxidized to its
 corresponding fatty acid.   The fatty acid then, by means of Schiitzenber-
 ger's reaction, gives off carbonic acid and leaves an ether of the alcohol
 immediately below the one started with ; and so the series may be regu
 larly descended. — J. A. Wanklyn.

     The following experiments exhibit the constitution of acetate
 of oxide of chlorine.
     Action of Metals. — Platinum, iridium, gold, silver, and pal
 ladium, unless finely divided, are without action in the cold.
 Platinum-black or sponge effects the decomposition of the acetate
 of chlorine, even at ordinary temperatures, into chlorine, oxygen,
 and anhydrous acetic acid.     Heated to 50° or 60° C, a similar
 decomposition is effected by the other metals, even when they
 are not finely divided.    There is no formation of chloride or
 acetate of the metal employed ; and, in fact, the action is purely
 one of contact.
    A second class of metals react at ordinary temperatures or at
 50°, with formation of acetate of the metal and disengagement
 of chlorine, a small quantity of chloride of the metal resulting as a
 product of a secondary action.    Sodium, potassium, and magne
 sium, which act with great energy, and aluminium, manganese,
iron, nickel, zinc, bismuth, copper, lead, cadmium, mercury, tin,
and antimony, which act with varying degrees of energy, belong
to this class.
    The third class contains the metals which do not act in any
way under any circumstances.        Only chromium and platinum
which has been fused belong to this class.
    Peroxide of manganese does not act at all on acetate of chlo
rine. Peroxide of lead acts when heated, behaving like plati
num-sponge, only less energetically.
    The metalloids act powerfully.     Sulphur is very violent, sul
phurous acid and chlorine being disengaged : —
        ( (C2 H3 0 CI) 0) + S = SO2 + CI4 + 2 ( (C2

    Iodine dissolves instantly and is decolorized.     There escapes
chlorine. No chloride of iodine results.       Bromine behaves like
iodine.
    Phosphorus acts violently, giving phosphoric acid, there being
disengagement of chlorine.
    Arsenic acts with violence, evolving chlorine and forming ap
parently an acetate of arsenic.
    Amorphous silicon is without action, even when heated.
    Wood-charcoal and graphite act when heated, producing chlo
rine and carbonic acid.
    Binary compounds of active elements behave as if the two
elements were separate.     Thus iodide of potassium evolves chlo
rine, giving  acetate of potash and acetate of iodine.       Chloride
of iodine disengages chlorine and gives acetate of iodine.
   The sulphurets of copper and bismuth, &c, give off chlorine,
sulphurous acid, and leave an acetate of the metal.
   Arseniuret of iron evolves chlorine, giving acetate of per
oxide of iron and apparently acetate of arsenic.

             Metal in  a Salt by Electro-negative     Elements.        143
   Organic matters, such as sugar, alcohol, &c, are oxidized at
the expense of the acetate of chlorine, and disengage the chlorine.
    In general, nearly all substances of a more electro-positive
character than chlorine drive chlorine out of acetate of chlorine.
    The acetate of chlorine was analyzed thus : —
    0-370 grm. of acetate of chlorine was dissolved in water and
treated with sulphurous acid, and then precipitated with nitrate
of silver.    It gave 0 580 grm. of chloride of silver, correspond
ing to 38-77 per cent, of chlorine.
    The formula (C2 H3 0 C1)0 requires 37 566 per cent, of chlo
rine.
    The reaction by which acetate of chlorine is formed is this,
       (C8  H3 O)2 0 + CI2 0 =     (C2  H3  0 CI) 0 +  (C2 H3  0 CI) 0,
being   a double decomposition,       chlorine and acetyle exchanging
against    one another.
    The reaction between acetate of chlorine and water is
          (C2 H8  0 C1)0 + Ha 0 = (C2 Hs 0 H)0 + CI H 0.
    Acetate of bromine has not been obtained pure.             It presents
many points     of resemblance     to  the corresponding    chlorine-com
 pound. It is very unstable and difficult to deal with.
                          2. Acetate     of Iodine.
    The most convenient way of preparing acetate of iodine is the
 following : —
    30 grms. of anhydrous acetic acid, to which 15 grms. of iodine
 have been added, are submitted to the action of a current of well-
 dried hypochlorous acid.        The apparatus must be kept cool by
 being   surrounded   with  cold   water.     The hypochlorous acid may
 be made with great ease and facility by passing a mixture of
 chlorine and carbonic acid over peroxide of mercury prepared by
 precipitation and dried at 100° C. The object of using the
 carbonic acid to. dilute the chlorine is to regulate the action.
 During the absorption of the hypochlorous acid by the anhydrous
 acetic acid and iodine, several changes in the appearance of the
 substances will be noted. The iodine will disappear by degrees,
 and then an abundant crop of yellowish-white acicular crystals
 will be formed.     If the transmission of the hypochlorous acid
 be continued, these acicular crystals will gradually dissolve, and
 at the same time there will be an abundant evolution of chlorine.
 The liquid will next become quite colourless.           This stage of the
 operation being reached,     it  is  well  to  stop the  transmission of
 the hypochlorous acid.      In a few minutes there will be an abun
 dant deposit of small crystalline grains, colourless at first, but

 144           On   the Substitution    of the Metal in a Salt.
becoming rose-coloured, and ultimately brown on exposure to the
light.     Thus, according to the stage at which we stop the addi
tion of hypochlorous acid, we obtain acicular or granular crys
tals sensitive to the light.         The granular crystals are separated
from   the   mother-liquor, washed with anhydrous acetic acid, and
finally dissolved in anhydrous acetic acid at 60° C.               The so
lution, which should be colourless, is separated from a small
residue of iodic acid and then allowed to cool, when it de
posits prismatic crystals with very brilliant facets.
    The greatest care must be taken to avoid the action of the
light. Even a strong gas-light is sufficient to yellow the crystals.
Finally, the adherent anhydrous acetic acid must be removed
from the crystals by warming them to 50° C. in a current of dry
air.   When exposed to moist air, the crystals deliquesce very
rapidly, iodine being set free. Water or absolute alcohol decom
poses them instantly, giving iodine, iodic acid, and hydrated
acetic acid.      In the case of alcohol there is also production<<of
acetic ether.      At 100° C, even in dry air, the crystals evolve a
little iodine.     At temperatures above 100° C. they decompose
rapidly, sometimes with a slight explosion, setting free much
iodine.     Analyses of the crystals purified by three crystalliza
tions and dried in a current of dry air were made as follows :—
    It was proved that chlorine was absent. 0675 grm. of the
silver-salt was prepared by calcining the crystals with pure lime
and then dissolving in dilute nitric acid and precipitating with
nitrate of silver. This silver-salt, which should be iodide of silver,
was then heated in a current of chlorine : loss in weight 0"260
grm. Theory, supposing chlorine absent, 0*262 grm.                   It was
furthermore shown that the whole of the iodine exists in a pecu
liar state, treatment of the crystals with water giving all the
iodine as free iodine and iodic acid.

the sums of the unknown local attractions at all the stations in
the three separate arcs.
 I   show that values of these three unknowns can be obtained
which make the three meridians almost precisely the same       and    ;
these values of (/j), (t2), (/3) are all very small so that no ex
                                                       ;
travagant hypothesis has to be resorted to, regarding the amount
of local attraction, to produce this identity of form.
   The average of the three values of the semiaxes thus deduced
gives
               a=20926184,     b= 20855304 feet,

less.  These, therefore,  I consider to be the true values      of  the
semiaxes of the mean figure of the earth.        They agree, as said

       virtually abandoned (see Monthly Notices of the Royal Astrono

       and without any foundation.

           In a future communication will consider the effect of the
       revision of my method of treating this subject upon the esti
       mated amount of local attraction in India, and upon my specu
       lations regarding the constitution of the earth's crust.
           2.   I will now give the calculations above referred to for
       finding the Mean Figure.                The data given in the following
       Table are gathered from the British Ordnance Survey Volume,
       pp. 766-768, and the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical
       Society, vol. xix. p. 35, and the values of n are calculated from
       the formula n= 13*75 sin 21.                  The meaning of brackets en
       closing an algebraical symbol, thus (<,), has been already ex
       plained to be, that the sum of all quantities like that within the
       brackets is to be taken for all the stations of the arc under con
       sideration.       The meaning of brackets when a logarithm is en
       closed within them is this, that the number is to be taken of
       which the number within the brackets is the logarithm ; thus

             " On a new specimen of Telerpeton Elginense."          By Prof.
 T. H. Huxley, LL.D., F.R.S., V.P.G.S.
    The specimen which was described in this paper had been broken
 into five pieces, exhibiting hollow casts of most of the bones of
 Telerpeton Elginense.       It is the property of Mr. James Grant of
Lossiemouth, and came from the reptiliferous beds of that locality,
along with some highly interesting fragments of Stagonolepis and
Hyperodapedon.          The casts described by the author consisted of
impressions      of the bones of the skull, together with the lower jaw,
and the teeth, of most of the vertebrae and ribs, of the greater
portions of the pelvic and scapular arches, and of representatives of
most of the bones of the fore and hind limbs ; and it was stated that
the characters of all these portions of the skeleton indicated deci
dedly Lacertilian affinities.
    In describing these remains. Professor Huxley discussed especially
the biconcave character of the vertebrae, the mode of implantation
of the teeth (which he believed to be Acrodont, and not Thecodont),
and the anomalous structure of the fifth digit of the hind foot (which

  Prof. Huxley     on a new Specimen   o/Telerpeton Elginense.          153
 presents only two phalanges, a proximal and a terminal) —a structure
 which differs from that of all known Lacertilian Reptiles, whether
 recent or fossil.   His researches had led him to conclude that the
 animal is one of the Iteptilia, and is devoid of the slightest indication
 of affinity with the Amphibia.     In all its characters it is decidedly
 Saurian, and accords with the suborder Kionocrania of the true
 Lacertilia ; but the author had not been able to make sure that it
 possessed a columella.     He also remarked that the possession by
 Telerpeton Elginense of vertebrae with concave articular faces does
 not interfere with this view, as, although most recent Lacertilia have
 concavo-convex vertebrae, biconcave vertebrae much more deeply
 excavated than those of T. Elginense are met with among the exist
ing Geckos.
    Professor Huxley in conclusion drew attention to the interesting
fact that Telerpeton presents not a single character approximating it
 towards the type of the Permian Proterosauria, or the Triassic
Wiynchosaurus and the probably Triassic African and Asiatic allies
 of that genus, or to the Mesozoic Dinosauria, and that, whether
the age of the deposit in which it occurs be Triassic or Devonian,
 Telerpeton is a striking example of a persistent type of animal or
ganization.
    2. " On a section at Litcham affording evidence of Land-glacia-
tion during the earlier part of the Glacial period in England."
By S. V. Wood, Jun., Esq., F.G.S.
    The structure of the Lower Drift and the limited area to which
it is confined seemed to the author to indicate that the glacial
conditions sustained by the area under consideration were chiefly
those of land-ice, while its limited extent and rapid attenuation in
all directions from the Cromer coast have led him to infer that only
 a small part of England was under water at the time. On the other
hand, the great masses of chalk and of chalky debris that were
carried into the marine sediment appear to indicate the presence,
near at hand, of some terrestrial chalk-area from which they were
detached, and he stated his belief that during this period much of
the chalk of Norfolk was covered by a great glacier.        In illustration
of this view Mr. SearlesWood described a section at Litcham, in which
the Chalk-with-flintbands is seen to become gradually more impure
towards the surface, the flints becoming at the same time detached
and scattered, this disturbance having been produced, in his opinion,
by a force acting downwards from the surface and becoming less
powerful the deeper the section descends.

    3.    On the   evidence of a third Boulder-clay   in Norfolk."       By

   The author described a deposit of true Boulder-clay, from 9 to 1 5
feet in thickness, resting on the chalk, and occurring at a slight
elevation above the bottom of the valley of the Yare.        It seemed to
him to be distinct in age both from the Till of the Cromer cliffs and
from the much more recent Boulder-clay which caps the high land
on each side of the valley ; and he gave sections which appeared to

prove  that it is posterior in age, not only to the Boulder-clay, but
also to the plateau-gravel capping the Middle Drift, by the time
necessary for the erosion of the deep valley in which it occurs. At
the same time he admitted the possibility of its being much older,
and intermediate in age between the Norwich Crag and the Chalk.

EXPERIMENTAL       DEMONSTRATION   OF THE ELONGATION OF A
       CONDUCTOR TRAVERSED BY A CURRENT, INDEPENDENTLY OF
       ELONGATION BY HEAT.  BY E. EDLUND.
HHHE     author was led, by experiments on the elevation of tempera-
 A    ture produced by the current, to suppose that the current, by a
special action independent of that of heat, causes an expansion of the
conductor which it traverses. This phenomenon formed the subject
of an investigation on the part of this physicist, from which it
results that this expansion is real and measurable.
   His method is as follows : —Taking a wire the amount of whose
expansion by heat is known with perfect exactitude, a current is passed
through          it,
              and its elongation    measured    is its temperature at the
                                                             ;   if
moment be known,          will be seen whether its elongation accords
                                     it
with this temperature or          more considerable.
                                           is            To measure this
temperature, M. Edlund measures the electric conductivity of the
wire, and deduces the temperature from it. Now, by this method, he
always finds     lower temperature than that which would correspond
                       a
with the observed elongation, from which         follows that an elonga
                                                             it
tion takes place in the wire independently of the action of heat.

    In the second place, the linear heat expansion of this same wire

                                                                      is
   Lastly comes the determination of the relation between the resist
ance and the temperature of the wire, which, as            well known,     is               is
liable to vary within certain limits in wires of the same metal and                    ;
the numerical values are found for the equation which gives the
conductivity      by the formula
                       \
                                          A=100-a*+/3i!2.
   Thus we have all the elements for calculating the excess of tem
perature, T' — T, which the wire possesses at the moment when its
resistance W     measured, and, on the other hand, the excess T° of
                       is
this same temperature, supposing that the dilatation U—         due                u   is

entirely to the calorific action.       We thus find that T° is greater
than  T  — T,  and that  this difference may rise to several degrees.
   These different operations and measurements          have been most
carefully effected by M. Edlund. The measurement of the elonga
tion of the wire was made by means of the angular displacement of
a mirror. The wire was stretched horizontally between a fixed clip
and one working as a lever round a horizontal axis bearing the
mirror.     The conductivity was measured by the method of the
galvanic bridge.     The rheostat was composed of two German-silver
wires stretched upon a horizontal board. To determine the relation
between the temperature and the resistance, the wire was rolled
round four glass pillars fixed in a wooden disk, and the cylin
der formed by the wire placed in a glass vessel containing thermo
meters, and immersed in a bath the temperature of which was
varied.   The metallic wires were 1-184 metre in length.         Care was
taken, before submitting them to experiment, to keep them for ten
or fifteen hours in an air-bath at 212°F., a precaution intended
to render the changes of their conductibility independent of a great
number of successive heatings and coolings.          To keep the wires
stretched horizontally, the axis supporting the moveable clip was
loaded with a certain weight.       It might be supposed that the value
of this weight would influence the elongation of the wire, assuming
that the current in its passage causes a diminution of elasticity ;
but this was not the case, and the elongation is by no means pro
portionate to the weight.      The following are some numerical data
which will show under what conditions these experiments were
made.

   In the second place, we find in this wire that the elongation by an
elevation of 1° C. is, in divisions of the scale, given by A=l-73.
   Lastly, the formula of the conductivity, in function of the tem
 perature, for this same wire is
                       X=100— 0-288 i+0-0005«3.

gave analogous results.
   The author concludes that " the current produces in the solid
bodies which it traverses an expansion independent of that of heat :"
and although these investigations are not sufficient to make known
the law of this expansion, they show that it increases rapidly with
the intensity of the current, and also that this action does not

          ON THE METEORIC         SHOWER OF 1866, NOV.          13-14.
                    BY SIR   J. F. W. HERSCHEL, BART.
    During the superb display of meteors on the night of the 13th
inst. my attention was particularly directed to the determination of
the exact situation in the heavens of the Radiant-point of their
courses, which has been commonly stated to be coincident with that
of the bright star y Leonis.         This, however, was certainly not the
case ; and I am enabled to say with perfect confidence that their
courses diverged, with a very remarkable degree of agreement, from
 a point considerably higher in declination and less advanced in
right ascension — nearly intermediate between £ and e, but a little
below their line of junction and somewhat above the place of the
star marked x in Bode's Chart.            Having fixed this point well in my
recollection, on laying down its place on that chart next morning,
                                        f
I found its longitude for 1866 (allowing 55' for precession since
1801, the epoch of the chart) to be 142° 20', and its latitude 10° 15'
north.       Several circumstances enabled me to fix on this point with
 full assurance of its being the true radiant : first, the frequent out*
 shooting from a very near proximity to it, and once in several
 different directions, of a volley of meteors ; secondly, on two or
 three distinct occasions a meteor appeared in this very point, and in
 all these cases it was motionless, devoid of a train, and on its ex
 tinction left only a small nebulous light to mark the place of its
 appearance ; thirdly, on one occasion a meteor shot forth horizon
 tally at a distance of about 6 or 8 degrees from the radiant, and
 disappeared after running a very short course, leaving a vaporous
 train which continued visible (fading gradually away) for 2m 40s
 (this afforded time for tracing back the direction of the train, which
 did not alter), and its course, continued, passed through the spot in
 question.
     The longitude of the Earth, as seen from the Sun at midnight of
 the 13th, was 51° 25', which subtracted from 142° 10' leaves 90° 45',

 been 96° 10', indicating an angle of 6° 10' between the tangent to
    * As early  as 1841 Professor Wartmann showed that "the direction of
 an electric current influences the facility of its passage through various
 metals, merely by reason of the peculiar arrangement which it at ODce
 impresses on the particles of the conductor.        When the current endea
 vours to pass in the opposite direction, it commences by depolarizing
 these ; and hence a loss of its own intensity ; then it gives them an oppo
 site polarity, which again offers it a free passage. These effects diminish in
 energy in proportion as they are repeated

 p. 88).    In 1853 he showed that the passage of electricity through rari-
 iied gases determines in them a polarization which facilitates discharges
 at distances insuperable but by its aid (Archives des Set. Phys. vol. xxii.

the Earth's orbit and that of the orbit of the meteors projected on
the ecliptic, while the actual small angle so included, of 0° 45' only,
indicates a very near (possibly an exact) coincidence of direction.
Hence we are constrained to conclude that the true line of direction
in space of each meteor's flight lay in a plane at right angles to the
Earth's radius vector at the moment, and that therefore, except on
the improbable assumption that the meteor was at that moment in
perihelio or in aphelio, its orbit would not deviate greatly from the
circular form. The absolute velocity in space of the meteors would
therefore be nearly that of the Earth ; and from this it appears to
follow of necessity that the direction of their revolution must be
retrograde.    Were it direct, the relative motion parallel to the
ecliptic would be nil, and the only effective cause of apparent motion
would be the meteor's resolved velocity perpendicular to the ecliptic,
which would produce a radiant in the pole of the ecliptic.
   In point of fact the elevation of the radiant above the ecliptic was
only 10° 15'; and as the relative velocity of the meteors in a direc
tion parallel to the latter plane must have been twice the Earth's
absolute velocity, it follows that, had the Earth stood still, the then
apparent radiant would have had very nearly double that elevation
(more correctly, 19° 53'), which is therefore the inclination to the
ecliptic of the meteoric orbits.
   How far this conclusion of a retrograde motion of the meteorite's
 revolution round the Sun — a conclusion already, I believe, arrived
at by Mr. Newton — is compatible with the truth of the " Nebular
hypothesis," we may leave it to the advocates of that hypothesis to
consider.
   I have mentioned the case of one of the meteors leaving a train
visible during 2m 40".       A much more striking instance occurred
in the case of one which exploded close to the three bright stars
in Aries. The train left at first was very bright, and very nearly
parallel to the line joining a and              fi.remained visible for no

INFERENCE FROM THE OBSERVED MOVEMENT OF THE METEORS
  IN THE APPEARANCE OF 1866, NOVEMBER 13-14. BY G. B.
  AIRY, ESQ., ASTRONOMER ROYAL.
   It    established by abundant evidence that the meteors seen in
        is
the late magnificent display diverged, for the most part, with singular
accuracy, from a point which may thus be described       join    Leonis
                                                                   :     y
and Leonis by an arc of
        e                       circle, the centre of divergence was
                                        a
about     degree north of the middle of the arc.
            a                                       There were other
centres of partial radiations, but this may be accepted as the centre
of radiation of the general mass.
   This was the case all through the night. In fact, the first exact

1 58              Intelligence and Miscellaneous   Articles.
determination     of the point which reached me was from my son
Mr. Hubert Airy, who had occasion to walk several miles between
five and six o'clock in the morning of the 14th (Nov. 13, 17h to 18h),
and carefully observed a considerable number of meteors, the inter
section of whose paths he determined accurately ; subsequently        I
received the chart of Mr. Alexander Herschel, made several hours
earlier, and observations of other persons at different hours ; and all
agreed in fixing on the point which I have specified as the centre
of divergence.
    It will readily be understood that this divergence from one point
is merely an effect of perspective, that the point of divergence is, in
fact, the point opposite to what is usually known as the " vanishing
point." It is, of course, theoretically possible to imagine an ex
plosive point in space so changing its position as to produce effects
like those which were seen ; but no person, I suppose, will really
maintain that explanation against the simple one that the meteors,
for the most part, retain a nearly unvaried relative position among
themselves,    and that the effects observed were produced by the
relative movement of the Earth and the collection of meteors.
    I assume here that the resistance of the air produced no remark
able change in the apparent paths of the meteors ; which assump
tion appears to be justified by the agreement of the diverging-points
when far from the meridian and when near the meridian.        The same
 agreement justifies us in thinking that the course of the meteors was
not much disturbed by the Earth's attraction — a consideration,
however, which in future must not be put out of sight.
    I ought in strictness to have ascribed the observed effects to the
relative movement of the point of observation and the collection of
 meteors ; but this differs from the other by an extremely small
 quantity, and if the corresponding correction were applied, it would
 diminish the angle which I am about to mention by an insignificant
 fraction of a degree.
    Now, if the meteors had been stationary in space, they would have
 appeared to diverge from that point in the celestial sphere towards
 which the Earth's motion was directed.       That point is very nearly
 the point on the ecliptic 90° behind the Sun's apparent place, or is
 in longitude 141° nearly.      The point of divergence did not very
 much differ, in longitude, from the point thus found ; but it was
 north of the ecliptic by about 11°.     It follows from this that the
 meteors were not stationary in space.      They had not much motion
towards or from the Sun ; but they were moving perpendicularly to
 the plane of the ecliptic, from north to south, with an absolute
velocity nearly one-fifth part of the velocity relative to the Earth in
 the direction of the Earth's motion.
    "We have no information as to the real value of their velocity
 relative to the Earth in that direction j and every subsequent stage
 of investigation is therefore imperfect.
    Let V be the velocity of the Earth in its orbit, and v the velocity
 of the meteors in the same direction (considered as perpendicular to
the Earth's radius vector), the relative velocity of the meteors in

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous     Articles.            159
that direction was V— v ; we may neglect the absolute velocity
towards the Sun ; the absolute velocity perpendicular to the plane
                        y „
of the ecliptic was           ; the total velocity of the meteors in space
                          5
was
     The smallest admissible value of v (in an algebraical sense) is
that which makes the orbit round the Sun parabolic, supposing the
meteors subject to the law of gravitation.         This gives
 of which    the negative solution is v=—Vx 1'32.            From this, the
 absolute velocity perpendicular to the ecliptic
                            =Xz^=Vx        0-464;
                                 5
 and as the metoors were then at the node, and the velocity v is
 perpendicular to the line of nodes, the tangent of the inclination of
 the orbit to the ecliptic  is=-0-464
                                   — — =0"35   nearly, or the inclination is
 =19|6.
     The largest    admissible value of v is that beyond which the
 meteors    would have been seen receding towards the vanishing
 point, or that which would have made them appear stationary.
 This gives V — « = 0; mption towards the ecliptic =0 ; velocity
 parallel to the Earth's motion is=V; tan inclination of orbit is
     We may therefore conclude that      the inclination of the orbit of the
 meteors   to the ecliptic is less than 19°.
     If the absolute motion of the meteors in the direction of the
 Earth's movement on Nov. 13-14 was very small, the excentricity
 of their orbit would not be great ; but in any other case it would be
 considerable. — Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society,

 ON AN ARRANGEMENT           FOR THE GRAPHICAL        REPRESENTATION OP
      CURVES OF VIBRATION BY MEANS OF MECHANTSM. BY ERNST
      MACH.
     For the purpose of an acoustical investigation,     I wanted to calcu
  late beforehand and construct a large number of the curves of vibra
  tion which were to be observed ; and as in cases which were at all
  complicated this is both tedious and laborious, I preferred to repre
  sent these curves mechanically by the aid of an apparatus.
     Wheatstone has already devised an apparatus for mechanically
 producing his kaleidophonic figures ; and Konig has constructed one.
     The plan of my apparatus is represented in the following figure.

A number of wheels, whose            axes   are denoted by a, b, c, act upon
one another.       This is most easily      effected by surrounding the cir
cumference with caoutchouc and pressing the wheels against each
other. The diameters of the wheels a and b are as I : \ ; a and c as
1 : A.   The three wheels have three rods, d, e, f, which fit in the
horizontal slits on the sliders g, h, i, which move in a vertical direc
tion.   The sliders have pulleys, m, n, andp; over these, and, as is
seen from the diagram, over several other pulleys, passes a string,
zmnpsr, fastened at s, and provided with a pencil at s, and sup
porting a weight r. The pencil s writes on the plate t, which is
moved by a string k v wound round the circumference of the wheel a.
The distance of the rods d, e,f relatively to the axes a, b, c, as well
as the initial positions of the lines ad, be, ef, can be regulated by
screws.
   If now the wheel a is set in motion by a winch, the pencil s de
scribes a curve on the plate t. If x be its abscissa, and y its ordi
nate, the curve has the equation
               y = a sin   (x + a) + b sin (2x + sin (3x

various vocal colours with reference to the three first partial tones.
   It isnot necessary to be limited to this.    The number of the             vi
brations which can be combined depends only on the number of the
wheels used, and the kind on their diameter.        the pencilIf moved   is
backward and forward in one direction and the writing -plate in an
other, we obtain Lissajous's figures.
   It worthy of remark that, by means of such an apparatus, any
      is
given functions may be represented as curves, which may be deve
loped by Fourier's series. The differential quotients, or the inte
grals of the same functions, are given by the apparatus with ease.
It therefore perhaps contains the germ of future calculating-ma

                By W. R. Grove, Esq., F.R.S. $c*
            address as President of the British Association at Not
 IN tingham
        my
                  last August,   I suggested
                                                " oily or resinous sub
stances, such as ca3tor-oil, Canada balsam, &c," as materials to
be used, in combination with glass lenses, to reduce or annihi
late the defect in the achromatic telescope arising from the irra
tionality of spectra.     Since the delivery of that address, the spe
cification of a patent of Mr. Wray has been published, in which
these, among other substances of similar optical character, the
principal one being oil of cassia, are named for the like purpose.
Although provisional protection was obtained previously, the
public could know nothing of the invention until the publica
tion of the specification : this was shown to me by a friend
last week.
    In it the author does not, to my mind, get rid of the greatest
difficulty which is experienced in the use of such substances, — viz.
the want of permanency in the telescope, arising from the unequal
shrinking or drying of the substances when used between lenses
not having touching curves.        He says that the glasses, when the
edges   are  chamfered, are hermetically sealed by the correcting
substance; but      I think he will find that this will not bear the
test of time.     It  seems to me desirable that       I  should publish
experiments     I  have  made   on  this  subject  at   different   periods
during many years, and which         I  have  communicated       to  several
persons, among whom           I may name Dr. Frankland and Mr.

Cooke, the well-known optician.     Such publication may assist
others in promoting this important object.      Though at work
on the subject for some time previously, the first published
record on the subject        I
                        can lay my hand on is in the Monthly
Astronomical Notices for January 14, 1853, in which occurs
                             "
the following paragraph : — In some cases where the inner
curves of the flint- and crown-glasses approximate, Mr. Grove
had employed with success a highly refracting cement made of
very clear rosin and castor-oil, which, acting as a third lens or
convex meniscus of a medium dispersing the coloured spaces
differently from the other two lenses, corrected to a very great
degree the chromatic without increasing the spherical aberra
tion."
    Before the date of the above communication,                 I
                                                            had used
for a similar purpose copal varnish between the lenses ; and a
3-inch object-glass, of four-feet focus, so corrected by me was
used for several years by Mr. B. Hill of Swansea.        Scarcely auy
secondary   colour  was perceptible ;   but in time, beginning at the
second year, small bubbles appeared between the lenses, arising
from the drying of the varnish, though the meniscus of it was
so thin that it only shortened the focus 0*7 of an inch.        It was
this defect that led me to use the rosin and castor-oil, which
formed a tough cement practically unalterable.         The telescope
alluded to in the above extract from the Monthly Notices was of
o inches aperture and 40 inches focus, the focus without the
cement being 42 inches ; this telescope was a very good one : it
 divided 7 Leonis, 7 Virginis, and other stars of that class ; the
 secondary spectrum was extremely slight, and capable of being
 detected only by a practised eye on a bright spot, such as the
 planet Venus.     I used it for some time ; but wishing to make it
 more perfect  I   broke       asit, have done many others.
                                       I                           was  I
 convinced from the above and other results that oils or liquids
 which dry or shrink more or less in time, were open to objec
 tion similarly to Blair's object-glasses, where the correction         is   by
a   concave lens of liquid instead of      convex meniscus, and the
                                               a
 substances for correction used with glass are therefore neces
 sarily chosen from towards the bottom instead of the top of
 Brewster's list ("Optics," Lardner's Cycl. pp. 374 and 375),
 in which oil of cassia stands first and sulphuric acid last.               I
was satisfied that the substance to be aimed at should be one
which liquefied        by
                      heat and became solid when cold       Canada  ;
balsam in its ordinary state was therefore objectionable,      but
when obtained hard and then tempered                by
                                            admixture with castor-
oil, so as to form    substance just taking, when cold, the im
                       a
pression of the nail,    succeeded very well, though from my ex
                            it
perience of the accidents with large glasses       only tried
                                                         I      on      it

small ones, 2 inches and under. Viscous Canada balsam and
castor-oil mixed and heated and cooled repeatedly, become ulti
mately solid.
  I   have nothing better to propose as a substance actually ex
perimented on than the above two cements, viz. rosin and cas
tor-oil, and fused Canada balsam and castor-oil.    Oil of cassia            I
abandoned after an experiment or two, on account of its lim
pidity : doubtless this and other substances might be used in
combination with a fused resinous substance; but         have notI
tried it. Sulphuret of carbon, the third liquid in Brewster's
list, mentioned by Mr. Wray, seems to me wholly impracticable
from its great volatility.
    Although the substances at the head of Brewster's list, speak
ing generally, have a greater dispersive action on the more re
frangible rays of the spectrum, and those at the bottom of it on
the less refrangible rays (see Brewster's diagram of oil-of-cassia
and sulphuric-acid spectra, "Optics," p. 78), yet each substance
has peculiarities and must be experimentally tried by the old
plan of two prisms, or similar methods, before it is used. None
in theory absolutely correct the irrationality ; but several do so
practically, and the problem      for each specimen of flint and
                                   is,
 crown glass used, to select   asubstance which sufficiently cor
rects the secondary spectrum and can be used             by
                                                         heat-fusion so
as to form tough solid when cold. To this point, in my opinion
               a
the most important, Mr. Wray does not allude.             Of liquids,     I
have found castor-oil the most durable        ;and     the lenses be in
                                                      if
an iron well-fitting cell (for  it  acts on brass rapidly),      am not
                                                                 I
sure that such material might not be used alone with advantage              ;

 XXIV.        On  Dynamical Theory of Deep-sea Tides, and the
                        the
 Effect of Tidal Friction. By D. D. Heath, M.A., F.G.S*
             effect     of tidal friction on the earth's rotation has lately
THEattracted    some of that general attention which is always
paid to any speculation   which, however remotely, bears on per
manent and  indefinite  alterations in the condition of our system,
and so appears to bring science into connexion with history or
prophecy.
   But the study of this effect requires a knowledge of the dyna
mical theory of the tides.      And this, so far as know, is only I
to be found in Airy's treatise in the Encyclopcedia Metropolitan.
                                       I
On betaking myself thither, found that the main principles and
typical cases, as regards deep and continuous seas, admitted of
being separated from the mass of more complicated calculations
in which they lie imbedded ; and, moreover,         thought   I  could        I
exhibit them so as to shed a clearer light on the physical laws
which they prove.                  I
                       And thought that what has given me so
much pleasure and insight might not be unacceptable to some
of the readers of this Magazine, more especially when           found         I
the Astronomer Royal himself implying that his work is not so
well known as it certainly ought to be to eminent mathema
ticians f.
    This is the'history of the earlier and larger part of this paper ;
the latter part, both what relates to Laplace's theorems, and to
the effect of friction, perhaps carry the theory a little onward.

   1. The moon attracts every particle of the earth with a force
which is smaller the greater the distance, but which is every
where much less than that with which the mass of the earth acts.
The effect        is,
               that the earth remains    coherent, nearly spherical

to a single particle at the centre; but the difference between
the effective force producing this motion, and that actually im
pressed at each point, causes      pressure which, combining with
                                           a
the resultant of the internal attractions, modifies the shape of all
fluid or flexible parts of the surface.
   What      known as the Bernoullian, or statical, theory of the

166           Mr. D. D. Heath on    the   Dynamical Theory of
added suggestion, that, the moon not being stationary, we may
expect such a shape (lagging behind perhaps, and not quite fully
formed) to accompany the moon.      And it is sometimes said that
with a perfectly open sea and without friction this shape would
be formed vertically under her.
   But it is easy to show that these anticipations rest on preca
rious assumptions.     For if the moon were suddenly removed,
the sea would not thereupon resume its spherical form, but the
waters would oscillate to and fro, and, may be, flow in some de
terminate direction, until the energy belonging to its disturbed
state should be dissipated by friction.      When, therefore, the
moon, instead of being entirely removed, shifts its apparent
place, we have to consider not only its instantaneous action
tending to form a spheroid under           it,
                                        but also the effect of the
shape, velocities, and  pressures due  to its past action and still
subsisting.
     The true problem of the tides in its simplest form     to find,
                                                                  is
if   possible, some state of disturbance, some combination of shape
and velocities, such that, once supposed to exist, these combined
causes will exactly keep   itup.
    2. The maximum of the moon's disturbing force, as above
described, may be the 10,000,000th part of gravity at the earth's
surface; and the problem may therefore be treated as one of
small perturbations, and the secondary effects neglected where
they come into competition with the primary ones.          Still the
general  discussion of the motion   in  our actual seas has proved
unmanageable      and the only case which has received
                  ;                                            com     a

(assuming, in our integration, that there is no permanent cur
rent, or that the average value of v is zero).
   We see, then, the necessary physical constitution of such a
wave.
   Contemplating the wave at a given instant, v is everywhere
proportional to y and of the same sign. At the ridge, or point
of greatest elevation, the particles of water are in their state of
greatest forward move'ment ; at the point of greatest depression
they have the same speed backward ; at the mean level, inter
mediate between the two other points, v=0.
   And if we look to the change of velocity at a given place as
                                                                  dy
time goes on, we    see   that its rate is proportional to —           which
represents the slope of the surface, estimated forward and down
ward, as referred to the undisturbed level, or horizontal line, on
which co is measured.     Assuming (what we shall presently jus
tify)  that the  horizontal, velocity is uniform throughout each
vertical section, each particle in the canal has a definite oscilla
tory motion on each side of a mean place which it occupies when
under the ridge or the lowest depression of the wave, reaching
its extreme distances eastward and westward when under the
forward and hinder shoulders respectively.
    The vertical motions and effective forces in such a wave as we
are considering may be neglected in comparison with the hori
zontal ones. For the water displaced by the conversion of a
ridge between two level shoulders to a hollow is a large frac
tion of the volume contained between the base (about 6000 miles)
and the whole vertical oscillation of a particle at the surface ;
and this has to be provided for by the lateral displacements
eastward and westward of the bounding sections, which yield a
space 2k x whole lateral oscillation ; and k is but a very few
miles.    And the vertical motion of a particle on the surface is
very much larger than the average motion of the particles under
it j for the water at the bottom remains there, and the rise and
fall in each horizontal stratum is proportional to the depth of
water under   it, the reasoning       which the equation of conti

   4. We have now to inquire whether the forces which arc
called into play in a system of disturbance, having the charac
teristics above described, can keep it permanently in action.
And first in the case of a free wave, as Mr. Airy denominates it
when there is no extraneous force like the moon's.
   (a) The earth rotating with a velocity (n), a force n2        in the                    is,
undisturbed state, employed in maintaining the circular motion,
and the force producing weight        less than the whole attractive

                             by                                             is
the disturbed state the centripetal force required becomes (n—v)2,
or alters        by
               —2nv nearly; and its direction          normal to the       is
now slightly inclined surface.     Resolving   the force  thus set free
into the vertical and horizontal directions, the latter component,
having the sine of very small angle as
                                  a           factor,    of the second
                                                                a               is
order of small magnitudes, and may be neglected.
    (b) The waved surface of the sea exerts an horizontal attrac
tion on each of its own particles.     But we may omit the consi
deration of        it,
                because    obviously depends on the mass of fluid
                                       it
in the surface, and becomes less, indefinitely, as we suppose our
canal narrower and narrower, while the other accelerating forces
remain unaffected.
     (c)We are thus left with only vertical forces, and these sen
sibly equal to gravity (g) acting on each particle     and the only         ;
effective force producing horizontal motion         the difference of  is
pressures before and behind each molecule.       And as we neglect
the vertical effective forces as of the second order, the vertical
pressures are the same as     the fluid were at rest
                                            if           e. the pres        ;    i.

ties of the particles in the same vertical column be equal at start

of the depth of the canal or of the effective force of gravity.
   An increase of k produces its effect through the condition
of continuity, causing a greater rise or fall for the same hori

effective force         of gravity would     be by    increasing the pressure-force

ceive  that  such loss must occur     in the  tide-wave,  not  only by
reason of the friction at the sea-bottom retarding         the  lowest
stratum, and that stratum the next above, and so on, but also                                      by
the series of infinitesimal collisions between contiguous columns
moving with different velocities.                    This last effect, however, will

the general form or position of the wave.      The friction on the

be   found    by
               the superposition of the waves due to these three
imaginary bodies.
    If there were no friction, these three waves would each lie
with their ridges at right angles to their respective luminaries,
and the highest tides would be when these bodies all coincide,

This is independent      of both h and  i; so that for small and slow
changes of force, the lagging of the maximum tide behind the
time of maximum force depends only on the mean rate m, a
more rapid change of force being counterbalanced           by a greater
value of e.
    For numerical calculation we may make our equations for S
and for t homogeneous by reintroducing the radius (a) of the
 earth, observing that t and/ are numbers ; whence we see that

 generally t is of the order of magnitude of          and may be very
 sensible.
    And this completes our theory of the tide in an equatorial
 canal.
    8.   If we suppose a canal drawn in any way along the earth's
 surface, the problem becomes very complicated in its details,
       I
 and do not here propose to work it out ; but the principles
 of the past investigation are generally applicable — unless, in
 deed, we have to deal with a case where the length of wave
 necessary to keep pace with the changes in any part of the
 moon's force ceases to be much larger than the depth of the sea
 (as in a small circle close to the pole, for instance), and so have
 to take account of vertical effective forces.
    For, first, with the motions restrained to be longitudinal only,
 the variations in the centrifugal force (mentioned in 4 (a)),
 although they are not vertical as on the equator, have no effect.

the moon ; and the sum of these waves will represent the true tide.

Airy in this way, and do not know whether they would come
out more or less simply than they do there.      There is no differ
ence in principle in the methods ; and this seemed to me the
best introduction to what follows.
   9. We now pass to Laplace's problem — to find the conditions
under which we may have in an open sea covering the globe a
permanent wave-shape accompanying the moon (which we will
suppose to move uniformly in longitude), with the same angular
velocity (m).
   If y be the height, u and    southerly and westerly (angular)
                                            v the
velocities, we must have, by our former reasoning,

   We will also assume, with Laplace, that the vertical motions
may be neglected.    This is so, by our former reasoning, where-
ever the linear length of the wave is large compared with k.
But it does not seem clear that near the pole the vertical motions
may not be comparable with the horizontal ; and this may per
chance account for a difficulty we shall hereafter come upon.
   On this assumption, however, it follows that the pressure-force
                                                                 du

particles in the same vertical column to move with the same
velocity.
   But there will now be an uncounteracted                       pressure arising
from the centrifugal force                    (8), which estimated southward              is

When the moon is on the equator the force is represented by the
last term alone ; whereas neither of the other terms can subsist
alone in nature.    We will therefore now take this case, the full
discussion of which will lead us on to the other.
    We want a solution independent of a, so that the wave may
always have the same aspect as seen from the meridian

         If we

180          Mr. D. D. Heath on       the   Dynamical Theory of
in which case we shall come to a differential equation of the first
instead of the second order.
    Be this as it may, the only results hitherto obtained of such
definite form as to illustrate general physical laws will appear,
 and, I think, more clearly, by using the equations to answer a
 question which the course of our previous investigations natu
rally suggests, viz. whether a wave exactly representing the form
 of the force be in any circumstances of sea-bottom possible ; and
 if so, whether the law as to the inverse position of the wave in
 shallow and deep seas will not apply.
     Let us then assume yl = c sin2 0.
     The left-hand terms of the first two equations will then take
 the form (C— gc) sin 0 cos 0, and — (C— gc) sin 0; and the left-
 hand term of the last equation will be — 2mc sins 9.
    And now, without solving the equations, we can answer the
 last part of the question.   For if we obtain ut and », from the
 first two equations, they will each be functions of 0 multiplied
 by (C — gc) ; and when substituted in the third equation (in its
 expanded form), it will take the form
wnere   P and Q are functions of 0 independent of either C or c.
   Now it is evident that k, if not constant, must have symme
trical values on each side of the equator, because the forces are
the same in both hemispheres.               Therefore,   when   0=g»

If,   then, on making   6= ^, the known functions           P   and   Q   do not

therefore a latitude where cos         0= + — , for which both            u, and v,

I     am not aware that the extremely special character given
to these theorems of Laplace, and particularly as regards the

   11. The friction, which makes the wave take an oblique posi
tion with reference to the moon, necessarily implies reaction on                 a
the solid earth    and   ;   now admitted on all hands that one

             a                                   But the mode and
the measure of this action seems not yet quite settled upon.
   Mayer, in     paper translated in this Journal (1863), argues
                      a
 (on false grounds     think) that there must be, and states that in
                             I
fact there        perceptible westward current in spite of causes
                 is   a

                                                   ;
derant motion the effect of diminishing the rotation.
   But then he goes on to assign another cause, viz. the form of
the wave, as presented to the attracting force of the moon      and                        ;
proceeds to calculate the amount
                                     " in the same manner as that
employed in computing precession," — process which        based on

the fact that the mass of the solid earth must move with the
protuberances without sliding*.
   The Astronomer Royal having (by an oversight,         venture to       I
think) convinced himself that no effect on the earth's rotation can
be produced by those forces of the first order, with friction, of
which his own canal theory took account, seeks for such an effect
entirely in        a   current produced by forces of the second or higher
orders.
   In an extract           from the 'Rede Lecture5 (May 1866) given in
this Journal, Sir W. Thomson calculates the effect in the mode
which Mayer also proposes, as if the water were merely a
machine for conveying the whole force of the moon to the solid
earth ; but this extract contains no discussion of the principle.
I proceed to give my own present view of the matter.
   The only case in which the tide with friction has been inves
tigated is in a canal.  For the purpose of facilitating the calcu
lation, we  have  assumed  that the friction at the bottom of each
vertical column acts as an equable accelerating force on every
particle of water in that column, i. e. that it is equivalent to a
set of moving forces whose resultant is proportional to the mass
of the column, or (K+y)da>, acting at                                              ~   above
                                                             a   height   ~    +
the bottom.              If
                   this be physically true, the reaction on the

pose, simply as      conductor of the external force*.

 I    do not suppose friction really acts as here supposed, or that
the theory of the equatorial tide with friction         perfect.   But        is

and must be greater in proportion to the greater number of those
layers.      think, therefore, there must be some effect of what
              I
one may call clinging friction, whether there be any current fric
tion or not.
     But any argument               tending to show             a   predominating current
tends        to show that         it     is    subject to   a   force which        is      increasing

existence of    preponderance of eastward protuberances of ascer
                   a

the less the total effect on the rotation of the solid earth.     For
the law of the conservation of areas cannot be affected        inter                        by
nal friction  and the moon's motion round the centre of gravity

ing in its eastward motion, the solid earth        not slackening so    is
much as the calculation founded on the shape would bring out.
   There still remains      question which

one might assume that the moon's orbit would remain (looking
only to the luni-terrestrial system) nearly circular, relative esti               a
mate of the various changes in the whole system (moon's dis
tance, length of day, magnitude of tide, and change of figure of
the earth) might be made, though perhaps not of the time                                             it

abstract of which appeared in this Journal*.         From his experi
ments he drew the conclusion that Prout's law is invalid, —that
is, that the atomic weights of the elements are not multiples                              by
a  whole number of fundamental unit — an idea which
                            a                                     at the          is

sions derived     by
                   Stas from his experiments were contested                                by
Marignacf,    who  upheld the validity of Prout's law.
   Since 1860 Stas has been engaged in continuing his investi
gations, and has recently published the results in        large quarto a
volume of 300 pages, illustrated         numerous engravings of the
                                                 by
apparatus he used.      Besides making fresh determinations, Stas
has incidentally investigated the question whether the circum
stances under which      bodya    formed have any influence on its
                                          is
composition   j  and  he has  found  that, in the case of chloride of
ammonium, neither different modes of preparation nor differ
ences in temperature and pressure at the time of its formation
have the slightest influence.
   He has also treated the question of the invariability of the
relations in weight of the elements forming chemical compounds.
Thus,   if there are two bodies,      binary compound

 188                 Chemical Notices : — M. Stas on the
     Silver was prepared partly by the reduction of chloride of
 silver by milk-sugar, and potash, but more advantageously by
 precipitation with sulphite of ammonia.         For this purpose silver
 coin was dissolved in nitric acid and the solution evaporated to
 dryness, the residue fused in order to decompose any admixture of
 platinum salts, then dissolved in ammoniacal water, and mixed with
 the requisite quantity of sulphite of ammonia.          The reduction
 takes place slowly in the cold, more rapidly when heated to
 60-76°.      The solution of silver must be so dilute that it does
not contain more than 2 per cent, of silver.          The precipitated
 silver is washed with ammoniacal water, and then concentrated
 ammonia poured upon it. On standing in the air the liquid ought
not to become blue; if it does, some silver is dissolved.     As much
 as five pounds of silver were worked up at once.          In order to
test the purity of the silver, it was heated on a lime support in
the oxyhydrogen blowpipe.          It fused without being covered with
any spots, began to boil with evolution of a bright blue vapour
 (a greenish vapour indicates the presence of copper), and finally
 distilled without leaving a residue. Distillation is probably the
best means of obtaining perfectly pure silver.
     Large burettes were used for estimating the silver solution,
and were kept in a reservoir of water always at the same tempe
rature. The normal solutions were placed in a perfectly dark
ened room, which was lighted by a gas-lamp with a yellow screen.
Determinations of silver by diffused daylight, according to the
author, never gave perfectly accurate results. The estimation
was effected in a black box provided with a slide, lighted by
a lamp whose light passed first through a round flask filled with
a solution of neutral chromate of potash.         Only a thin column
of the solution to be tested was thus lighted. But by this ar
rangement it was possible to detect          ^   of a milligramme of
 silver in a litre of solution, and, by waiting a suitable time (fifteen
minutes, for instance), as little as ^g-joff °f a milligramme.
Ten grms. of the pure silver were dissolved at a time and mixed
 with normal solution of chloride of sodium (containing 5-42
grms.), and the excess of the silver dissolved determined by
means of the normal solution of chloride of sodium.         The percen
tage    of pure  silver was  found  =99-994-10000 per cent., mean
99997.
    The Sal-ammoniac was purified in different ways. (1) Hot sa
turated boiling solution of sal-ammoniac was boiled with nitric
acid of 1*4 spec. grav. as long as chlorine was given off.           Hy
drate of lime was then added, and the disengaged ammonia col
lected in water and saturated with hydrochloric acid gas.            The
sal-ammoniac thus obtained was dried at 100° in a current of
ammoniacal gas, and then sublimed at as low a temperature as

                        Determination    of Atomic Weights.                           189
possible in glass flasks specially constructed. This sal-ammoniac
sublimed without leaving a black residue.              (2) Sulphate of am
monium was heated with concentrated sulphuric acid until decom
position commenced, nitric acid added so as to decolorize                 and   it,
it   was then treated with hydrate of lime in             bath of common
                                                             a
 salt. The subsequent treatment was the same as the above.
 (3) Nitrate       of
                    potassium prepared             by
                                                 Stromeyer's method was
 heated with zinc and iron wire. The zinc had been freed from
 charcoal     by  fusion with soda and saltpetre, or with litharge.
 The iron wire had been heated in            current of air and then re
                                               a
 duced with hydrogen.          This ammonia, as well as that prepared
 by methods (1) and (2), has simply penetrating smell, and not
                                                   a
 an unpleasant one, like the ammonia of commerce. The sal-am
 moniac prepared from the ammonia obtained                   by
                                                            method (3) was
 sublimed in vacuo         in long glass tube at as low
                                a                                temperature
                                                                      a
 as possible.      The sal-ammoniac used in the rest of the experi
 ments was always freed from an admixture of ammonia                    being  by
 heated until vapour began to form.
      Of all these kinds of sal-ammoniac definite weights were mixed
  with silver solution at the ordinary temperature or at 100°.
  For 100 parts of silver there were always 49592-49 602
  parts of NH4C1, the mean being 49-597.               If sal-ammoniac and
  silver were weighed      in atomic  weights (in round numbers 14 and
  108), there was always an excess of silver in the solution, which
  frequently amounted to one hundred times as much as the sources
  of error in the method.        Hence neither temperature nor pressure
  have any influence on the composition of sal-ammoniac.
      To prove the unchangeability of the relative weights of the
  elements which form chemical combinations, the author reduced
  chlorate, bromate, and iodate of silver               by
                                                      sulphurous acid.      In
  the chloride obtained, chlorine and silver were present in exactly
  the same ratio as in chlorate of silver.

   Only   in case  of  precipitation  with   sulphate    or hyposulphate of
   silveris   a   chemically pure preparation obtained.            Reduction
   with sulphurous acid was effected under complete exclusion of air,
   and only with freshly prepared acid.              Pure sulphurous acid
   produces    in  a solution   of nitrate   or  sulphate of silver      white a
   precipitate of sulphite of silver.       But      an acid be used which
                                                        if

twice recrystallized from water.         In order to avoid liberation of
bromine during the reduction, the decomposition                   must be
effected at 0°.
     Chlorate of silver cannot be obtained pure by dissolving oxide
or carbonate of silver in chloric acid ; chlorine must be made to
act directly on oxide or on carbonate of silver.          If  oxide or car
bonate of silver be diffused in excess of saturated chlorine-water,
all the silver is changed into chloride of silver, and the liquid
contains, along with chlorine, free hypochlorous            acid without a
trace of chloric or perchloric acids.       If during  constant   agitation
chlorine be passed into water in which excess of oxide of silver is
 diffused, hypochlorite of silver is formed, which is very easily soluble
in water, and in the presence of oxide or carbonate of silver can
be kept several days without change.            But without this admix
ture it is extremely unstable ; it decomposes into chloride and
perchlorate of silver.     Perchloric acid is not formed in this case.
    Eight pounds of pure nitrate of silver were precipitated with
carbonate of potassium (prepared from cream of tartar), washed
with water by decantation for fourteen days, diffused in water,
and treated with chlorine for 1       j  hour in a flask which was kept
in constant agitation.        (The manganese used for the chlorine
 was freed from nitrates by being boiled with dilute sulphuric
 acid.)     The agitation was continued until the cessation of
 the smell of hypochlorous acid, and the carbonate of silver was
 now washed completely pure.            Only in this way could the car
bonate of silver be gradually freed from alkali.          It was then dif
fused in water, again treated with chlorine, whereby a solution of
hypochlorite of silver was obtained by decantation, which was
 then left in the dark to spontaneous decomposition.             By evapo
 ration, pure chlorate of silver was obtained.         As the action was
 only carried so far that not more than two-fifths of the theore
 tical quantity of chlorate of silver was obtained, the formation of
 perchlorate of silver was excluded.         It was only after the third
 treatment of carbonate of silver with chlorine that the chlorate
 of silver obtained was perfectly free from potassium.                 Pure
 chlorate of silver is quite permanent in the air.         It only attracts
 moisture in case it contains some hygroscopic perchlorate of
 silver.   The reduction must be effected by a solution of sulphu
 rous acid at 0°.
     The Reagents. — The distilled water was freed from organic
 substances by being distilled with manganate of potassium.             The
 first portions of the distillate were removed.         If  rain-water was
 used, a considerable quantity of ammonia passed over.              In that
 case the water had to be distilled a second time, with the addition
 of some acid sulphate of potassium or sodium.              For very accu

rate experiments the condensing-tube of the still was made of
platinum.
     Iodaie of potassium was prepared by heating iodide of potas
sium with chlorate of potassium.          In order not to exceed the
temperature     of the decomposition   of iodate of potassium, a retort
containing    chlorate of potassium alone was simultaneously heated
in the same sand-bath.        The chloride of potassium was removed
 by lixiviation, the iodate three times recrystallized, and each
 time again lixiviated.     The pure salt did not become yellow in
the air. Pure iodate of potassium can also be obtained by treating
 iodine with caustic potash, but not by the action of chlorate of
potassium on iodine.
     In order easily to purify iodate of silver, it must only be pre
cipitated from dilute solutions (containing 2 to 2£ per cent,
of the salt) . The precipitate is shaken up with the wash-water.
 It is washed twelve to fifteen times with cold, and then several
times with hot water.        The precipitate is placed upon a funnel
 which is closed by fine silver wire and some linen. By means
 of the air-pump most of the water is removed.          It is then dried
 in a current of hot air freed from organic matter. Drying under
the air-pump is inadmissible ; there is always so much organic
matter from the grease of the plate that the silver-salt soon be
 comes coloured, and even blackened.          The behaviour of other
silver-salts (for instance, the nitrate, bromate, and chlorate of
 silver) is similar.
     Sulphurous acid was prepared by heating copper with sulphuric
 acid which had been diluted with one-half to two-fifths of its
 volume of water.       The iodic acid was prepared by oxidizing
 iodine with nitric acid.     In this case, however, only about one-
 fourth of the iodine used is obtained in the form of iodic acid.
 It is evaporated to dryness, dissolved in water, again evaporated,
 and the residue heated to 200°. But, from the operations in the
 glass vessels, the acid always contains an admixture of soda and
lime.
     Hyposulphate of silver was prepared by precipitating a manga
  nese salt with sulphide of barium.        The filtrate is evaporated,
  the residue dissolved in cold water, and the salt obtained recrys
 tallized three times.     It is then precipitated by sulphuric acid,
and at once saturated with oxide or carbonate of silver.         Neutral
 and colourless hyposulphate of silver is thus obtained.        The solu
tion of hyposulphuric acid has little stability. After some time
it contains sulphurous acid.
     Pure sulphate of silver must be perfectly indifferent to test-
  paper.    The solution of fused nitrate of silver is poured into
 a boiling solution of pure double sulphate of potassium.            The
  precipitate is washed with cold and then with boiling water.

The boiling solution of this body gives, with bromate of potas
sium, a bromate of silver which is unchangeable in the light,
and can be boiled with water without decomposition.            It soon
undergoes decomposition       in  contact with  organic matter  (under
the air-pump, for example).         Hence all the water used for the
decomposition had to be twice distilled over manganate of po
tassium.
                                    II.
    The second part of the research contains new determinations
of the atomic weights of silver, iodine, bromine, and chlorine.
    Iodide of silver. — 1. A weighed quantity of silver (97 aud 43
grms.) was dissolved in nitric acid of 1*21 to 1*25 spec. grav.
The long-necked flask was provided with a bulb apparatus which
contained some water, and the other end of which dipped in a
small flask also containing water.          The bulb apparatus was
ground in the neck of the flask, and all parts of the apparatus
were separately weighed.         The heating was effected in a gas-
furnace,   in which the heat was made as uniform as possible by
several superimposed layers of wire gauze.         When all the silver
was dissolved, the contents of the bulb apparatus and of the
little flask were added to the principal quantity of the liquid,
and the liquid distilled off at as low a temperature as possible.
The residue was treated with concentrated pure sulphuric acid,
and the sulphate of silver formed again heated with sulphuric
acid and with sulphate of ammonia. The acid distillate obtained
from the evaporation of the solution of silver was evaporated in a
porcelain dish, and the solution also treated with sulphuric acid.
All the sulphate of silver is now dissolved in water and precipitated
by a solution of hydriodic acid.        The latter is prepared by the
addition of a very dilute solution of sulphurous acid to iodine
 diffused in ice-cold water.     If the solution is not kept cool, or if
too much sulphurous acid is used, sulphur is separated in the
reaction.     The precipitate is well shaken and washed by decan-
tation with hot water.       After the wash-water has been allowed
to stand, it is filtered through a small filter, and the filtrate first
concentrated in a glass retort, then in a platinum one, and after
wards in a platinum dish.          There remained a residue of only
0 6 milligramme, from which 0*6 milligramme of Agl were
separated.
    The iodide of silver is introduced into a glass bulb provided
on two opposite sides with tubulures, one of which is closed with
fine platinum wire. The iodide of silver is dried in this bulb in
the air-bath and weighed.          In order that while the aqueous
vapour is escaping no iodide be lost, both tubulures of the glass
bulb are provided with weighed flasks.         The condensed aqueous

          M.   Stas on the Determination  of Atomic Weights.         193
 vapour is expelled and the flasks again weighed.         The iodide of
 silver is first weighed at 100°, then at 200°, and is finally fused.
 The weight remained unaltered.        During the whole operation the
 iodide of silver remained in the dark. Pure iodide of silver is of
 a dirty bright yellow, and is unaltered in the light.        It is only
 altered by light in the presence of sulphurous acid. Fused iodide
 of silver varies from yellow to dark reddish brown. It attacks glass
 more slowly than chloride or iodide of silver.         Treated in this
 manner, 100 parts of silver gave in the mean 217-5325 parts of
 iodide of silver; the mean difference was +0 0035.          The iodine
 used for the determinations of the atomic weights was purified
 in two ways.      Eight pounds of iodine were dissolved in a con
 centrated solution of two pounds of iodide of potassium, and then
 not more than three-fourths of the iodine precipitated by water.
 The washed precipitate was distilled off in a current of aqueous
 vapour, the distillate dried over nitrate of calcium (this being the
 only substance that can be used), and, in order to remove all
 water and HI, distilled twice over anhydrous caustic baryta.
 Or one pound of iodine is agitated with highly concentrated am
monia, and the almost colourless liquid separated by a drawn-out
funnel from the iodide of nitrogen formed.        It is washed by de-
 cantation with concentrated ammonia, and at length upon the
filter with cold water.     The iodide of nitrogen, while still moist,
can be rubbed in a mortar without danger.           Diffused in much
water, it slowly decomposes at the ordinary temperature, and ra
pidly and without danger between 60° and 65°, pure iodine being
separated.       Iodide of ammonium remains in solution along
with another salt, which is white and explosive and very little
soluble in cold, but more easily so in hot water (iodate of ammo
nium).      The washed iodine is distilled with aqueous vapour, in
which the admixed salt remains behind.         The latter decomposes
at a little over 100° with a slight explosion, and separates iodine
and gases.      The separated iodine is purified as above. The
quantity    of  iodine  obtained from the iodide of nitrogen was
always less than it ought to be from theory, if iodide of nitrogen
had to decompose into iodide of ammonium, iodine, and ni
trogen.
    Pure iodine differs in appearance from commercial.        Fused, it
is fluid, and almost entirely black.     At ordinary temperatures it
emits no vapours.      The saturated vapour is intensely blue, and
violet in the diffused state.    Iodine does not melt at 113°, but
is liquid at 1 15°. The boiling-point is above 200°. Ordinarily
the fusing-point is stated to be 107°, and the boiling-point
175°-180°.
    2. The complete synthesis of iodide of silver was effected in two
ways, (a) Pure iodine was sublimed in a glass bulb, rubbed while

 atill hot, and weighed* in a glass tube which was closed by a
 stopper.       The equivalent weight of silver was then changed by
 method 1 into metallic silver, and the cold solution of silver
  mixed with so much sulphuric acid that sulphurous acid pro
  duced no precipitate.       The iodine was changed into hydriodic
 acid by the addition of solution of sulphurous acid, and the latter
  then added to the solution of silver,          (b) Solution of ammonia
  was saturated with sulphurous acid at 0°, and the solution mixed
 with three times its volume of ammonia. The iodide was changed
  iDto hydriodic acid; the rest of the process was the same as in
  (a) .    The deposition of iodide of silver is promoted by lengthened
  agitation and then by warming. Iodine and silver were always
  weighed out in the ratios of the old atomic weights (127 and
  108).      It was found that there was each time an excess of un-
  combined iodine, which was estimated by standard solution of
  silver.    The whole of the iodide of silver was now collected, as
 described above, and weighed.            Six experiments, made with the
 greatest care and with varying quantities of material (28-160
 grms. of silver), showed that 100 parts of silver gave 2175371
 parts of iodide of silver, starting from the weight of the iodine
 and the silver used, — or 21 7*5335 parts, taking into account the
 weight of the iodide of silver used.        The numbers varied between
 217-529 and 217 543.           From the experiments in L,

     Bromide of silver was prepared by precipitating sulphate of
 silver with hydrobromic acid. To prepare the latter, bromide of
 potassium free from iodine is precipitated to the extent of three-
 fifths by means of nitrate of silver, and agitated for some time
 with the liquid.        In order to remove chlorine, the bromide of
 silver is again shaken and finally heated with a solution of bro
 mide of potassium.          Thereupon it is diffused in water and
treated with sulphuretted hydrogen.               The solution of hydro
bromic acid is freed from excess of sulphuretted hydrogen by
means of pure bromide of silver, and is then carefully distilled.
The concentrated hydrobromic acid thus obtained is colourless
and permanent in the air.            It is only the acid which contains
iodine that thus becomes coloured.            For precipitating the silver
a standard quantity of hydrobromic acid was used ; for an excess
of hydrobromic acid might dissolve some bromide of silver.
Bromide of silver precipitated in the cold is white. It was
washed with cold water, and then a current of
                                                           aqueous vapour

 mide of silver.       By this means bromide of silver becomes
yellow, as also when bromide of potassium is poured upon it.
By cold water it again becomes white with a very feeble tinge
of yellow. White bromide of silver rapidly becomes violet in
the light, yellow more slowly ; fused bromide of silver is quite
permanent       in the light. In the presence of traces of free
bromine, white bromide of silver is also permanent in the light.
 The bromide of silver obtained, like the iodide of silver, was
 weighed in a glass bulb.       It can be fused without loss of weight,
provided    no  gases or vapours enter the apparatus.
    For the complete synthesis of bromide of silver, pure bromine
had to be weighed.       The latter was prepared by distilling bromide
of potassium and bromate of potassium, or bromide of barium
 and bromate of barium, with sulphuric acid.           The bromide of
potassium of commerce was freed from admixed iodine by add
ing to a quarter of the solution bromine-water until the brown
colour at first formed passed into a very bright orange-yellow
colour.     The other three-fourths of the bromide-of-potassium
solution were theu added, and all the iodine removed by shaking
with CS2. The solution, which had been freed from CS2 by boiling,
was mixed with not quite six equivalents of hydrate of potash
for one of KBr, and chlorine passed in.            By evaporating the
liquid,  at first only  half  the   bromate  of potassium formed was
utilized, the mother-liquors served for the preparation of bro
mate of barium.       The bromate of potassium was recrystallized
three times, and suitably lixiviated each time.         The pure salt
ought neither to render turbid nor colour a boiling and perfectly
neutral solution of sulphate of silver.       By heating in porcelain
vessels (platinum vessels are attacked by it), the bromate is con
verted into bromide of potassium.         Towards the end there is a
little explosion and separation of bromine.         Five equivalents of
this bromide of potassium are mixed with one equivalent of the
unchanged bromate of potassium, and distilled with sulphuric
acid.   The bromine which separates in the cold is collected in a
retort containing a solution of bromide and bromate of potas
sium, from which it is distilled off in the water-bath.         To free
it from every trace of chlorine, it is dissolved in concentrated
solution of bromide of calcium, and precipitated therefrom by
water.    Bromide of calcium was prepared by dissolving purified
bromine in caustic lime mixed with ammonia and then concen
trating the solution.        The precipitated bromine is repeatedly
dried over bromide of calcium and distilled off anhydrous phos
phoric acid.      The latter was sublimed in a current of air. The
bromine is finally agitated with finely powdered caustic baryta,
and distilled after being poured off.
    The mother-liquors from the preparation of bromate of potas
sium were diluted with five times as much water, heated to 80°,

and freed from sulphuric acid by a dilute solution of chloride of
barium. The decanted liquid was heated to boiling, and chlo
ride of barium added so long as the precipitate formed was re-dis
solved.    The solution was poured into porcelain dishes, and by
rapid cooling the broniate of potassium deposited in as fine
powder as possible ; for only by this means could all admixed
chloride of potassium be washed away.           From the filtrate more
barium-salt is obtained by a repetition of the same treatment.
It i3 purified by threefold recrystallization, and by heating partly
changed into bromide of barium.         The subsequent separation of
bromine is effected as above. Pure bromine boils at 63° under
a pressure of 759"7 millims.       When solid, it looks like iodine,
with more of a steel-grey colour, however.         A dilute aqueous so
lution is intense and of a pure yellow. The bromide of potas
sium prepared from this bromine was identical with that pre
pared from bromate of potassium or barium.             The weighing of
the bromine was effected in a closed glass tube provided with
capillary tubulures.      One end of this tube dipped in a flask
filled with standard solution of sulphurous acid ; in the bottom
of this flask an S-tube was fused.       The flask was also connected
with a potash-apparatus, also containing sulphurous acid.          The
S-tube is closed by a caoutchouc stopper, and the flask cooled
to 0°.    Before one end of the bromine-tube is broken off, the
bromine itself is made to freeze. The bromine is now gradually
allowed to enter the sulphurous acid, which is always kept cool,
and the bromine is finally heated.       On cooling, sulphurous acid
ascends into the bromine-tube.        The other point of the latter is
then broken off, all parts of the apparatus washed out, and the
whole liquid poured into the solution of sulphate of silver which
in the mean time has been prepared.          If  bromine and silver are
taken in the ratios of the atomic weights 80 and 108, there is
only a very slight excess of silver.      The bromide of silver pre
cipitated  in   the absence of Ag Br is pale yellow, but becomes
dark yellow on being heated, or by treatment with bromide of
potassium.      If white and dark yellow bromide of silver be treated
with zinc and sulphuric acid, in the first case a blackish grey and
sonietimespurple,butinthe latter a pure white silver is precipitated.

    Complete analysis of iodate of silver. — A weighed quantity of
 the salt is decomposed by ignition, and the iodide of silver
weighed, as well as the oxygen which escapes.         The decompo
sition was effected in a current of nitrogen, in an apparatus in
which iodine that had become free, or particles mechanically
 carried away, could be held back. The iodate of silver was con
tained in a glass bulb, provided on each side with long tubulurcs,
 on which metallic tubules with cocks were placed.         In one of
 these tubulures, which was somewhat narrower, there was first of
all a stopper of silver wire, then some asbestos treated with aqua
regia and ignited, thereupon a layer (15 to 18 centimetres in
length) of finely divided silver, prepared by precipitating in the
cold solution of silver with sulphite of ammonium.        Then there
was again asbestos, fine silver wire, and finally a spring of silver
wire which held all the parts together.
    For the absorption of the oxygen a tube was used 75 to 80
centims. in length, provided with metallic cocks, which first
of all contained a stopper of metallic wire, then a layer 10 to 12
centims. in length of copper turnings, 10 centims. of copper
reduced from oxide of copper at a high temperature by carbonic
oxide, 20 centims. of copper reduced at a low temperature, and
then slightly oxidized copper turnings, to burn any hydrogen that
might have been formed.        It was then closed, first, with a fine
copper wire, then asbestos, and lastly a spring of copper wire,
which prevents the removal of the mixture by a current of air.
The oxide of copper used was prepared by the ignition of nitrate
of copper, and was boiled with caustic potash until it was free
from sulphur.
    The iodate of silver retains persistently some water ; and lience
the tube containing the copper was connected with three U-tubes,
 40 centims. in length and 2£ centims. internal diameter.         The
tubes were filled with pieces of pumice, which were twice mois
 tened with sulphuric acid, then ignited, filled in while still hot,
 and while at a temperature of 300° so much sulphuric acid added
that the latter was at a height of 1^ centim. in the bend of the
tube.    After filling, the tubes were drawn out and joined by
caoutchouc tubes, which were then bound round with silver foil.
    A fourth, smaller U-tube served as a control, and, lastly, a fifth
as a protection of the four against the atmosphere.
    The nitrogen, prepared by passing air over copper, was con
tained in a large gas-holder, to the water of which a solution of
hydrated protoxide of tin in potash was added, to absorb O and
 CO2.    The nitrogen is first passed through a tube containing
 sulphuric acid, then through two CaCl tubes, then over a layer
 of ignited copper 90 centims. in length (reduced from oxide of

 198      M. Stas on    the Determination    of Atomic Weights.
 copper by carbonic oxide), and lastly through five U-tubes filled
 with pumice and sulphuric acid.         These U-tubes are joined by
 tubes made of unvulcanized caoutchouc.             The last U-tube is
 provided with a metallic stopcock. Between the copper tube and
 the five U-tubes there is a T-piece, which is provided with
 stopcocks at its three ends, the lowest of which is connected
 with an air-pump. To get rid of all the air from the nitrogen-
 purifying apparatus, the gas is passed through, the apparatus
 exhausted, again filled with nitrogen, and this process is fre
 quently repeated.
     The apparatus for the analysis was now tested.         It was filled
 with nitrogen, connected       with  the   air-pump by   a tube 25-30
 centims.in length, and          millim. in breadth, pumped free from
 air, and weighed.       Heated to redness in the current of nitrogen,
 again exhausted and weighed, the weight was not found to
 change.      It did not change even on remaining five days on
 the balance, being thus exposed to considerable variations in
 the temperature       and in the barometer.        With loads of 100
 grms. the variation did not amount to half a milligramme.
 A system of apparatus constructed in exactly the same manner
 served as a counterpoise.       The balance had to be enclosed in a
 double layer of white linen, on account of the delicacy of the
 swing. The substance was now introduced into the glass bulb,
 everything exhausted, weighed, and the decomposition set up in
 the current of nitrogen.       Two experiments were made, with 98
 and with 159 grms. of iodate of silver.           The glass bulb in a
 dish coated with magnesia was heated with the greatest care, and
 more strongly only towards the end of the' experiment, which
 in one case lasted six, and in the other eleven hours. The silver
 does not then attack the glass.       It is well known that by heating
 silver in glass, yellow spots are often formed.     By heating weighed
 quantities of glass and silver in a current of dry air to the tem
 perature of bright redness, the weight remains unchanged.             It
is only when the heating is continued until the glass softens that
there is a considerable absorption of oxygen and formation of
 silicate of silver.   The substance which had spirted on the upper
part   of the  glass bulb during the heating of the iodate of silver
was decomposed by some burning charcoal.             At the end of the
experiment the parts of the glass with which the silver had been
in contact were coloured yellow, or brownish yellow. Direct expe
riments had shown that the glass increases considerably in weight,
though the total weight of the apparatus remains unchanged ;
silicate of silver is formed and an alkaline iodide.      As in the de
composition of the iodate of silver all the oxygen is combined, at
the end of the experiment the total weight of the apparatus ought
not to have changed, which was found to be exactly the case.

    Another portion of iodate of silver was reduced by sulphurous
acid, and only the iodide of silver weighed.         The iodate of silver,
after being dried at 180°, was weighed in exhausted flasks, then
heated to fusion, and freed from the last traces of water in a
current of air above 100°.        It was then dissolved in dilute am
monia and decomposed by sulphurous acid at 0°. From this
the composition of iodate of silver was calculated as follows : —
                                                                Mean.

    Hence the atomic weight of iodide of silver is in the mean
234-779, and the atomic weight of silver 107-928, and that
of iodine 126-857 (9=16), according                to the synthesis of
iodide of silver.
    A complete synthesis of bromate of silver did not succeed; for
on heating the salt there was finally and quite unexpectedly a
most violent explosion.        Hence the salt, dried at 150°-160°, was
weighed     in   a  glass   bulb closed by a doubly perforated glass
stopper, in which delivery-tubes         were ground.       The salt was
fused in a current of dry air, which had been freed from organic
matter by being passed over heated oxide of copper ; it was then
fused, and after condensation of all aqueous vapour transferred
into weighed U-tubes containing pumice and sulphuric acid.
The salt was then reduced in the usual manner with sulphurous
acid.    100 parts of bromate of 'silver contain,

into account the results of the synthesis of Ag Br, the atomic
weight of silver is=107-921, and of bromine 79-91.
    Chlorate of silver was also reduced by sulphurous acid.           This
salt is always rendered impure by traces of AgCl, which arise
from the organic constituents of the atmosphere.         Like the iodate
 and bromate, it persistently retains some water.           It was there
 fore put into a large weighed glass flask,         which   was   carefully
 heated on the air-bath. , At 243°-245° chlorate of silver fused,
 and through it was passed a continuous current of pure dry air.
                                                                            "
 After cooling and weighing, the silver-salt was dissolved in water,
 and the clear solution poured into another flask.        In the first one
 there remained only small traces of admixed chloride of silver,
 which were weighed with the flask and allowed for. The solu
 tion of chlorate of silver was reduced by sulphurous acid.             An
 accurate investigation of the wash-waters        showed   that  they  con
tained not a trace of silver dissolved.          The chloride of silver

persistently    retains some sulphuric acid, and is much more
 difficult to wash, especially if it cakes together.           It is intro
 duced into a flask closed by a stopper, which by a suitable
 arrangement is set in a circular and wavy motion. The clearing
 of the liquid was effected by passing steam into it and not into
 the chloride, by which caking is prevented.                The complete
 washing   out   lasted  seven  days,   the  flask  being  kept  warm day
 and night.      All the wash-waters,     after  being allowed to stand,
 were filtered through a fine filter; all the vessels were rinsed
 out with solution of cyanide of ammonium, and the latter
 evaporated with the addition of hydrochloric acid.             In one ex
 periment the chloride of silver obtained was fused in a current
 of hydrochloric acid gas. No liberation of sulphuric acid could
 be perceived, nor was there any alteration in the weight of the
 chloride of silver.     In one experiment 138 grms., and in another
 259 grms. of chlorate of silver were used.               The experiments
 gave, in 100 parts of chlorate of silver.

    The last part of the paper contains new determinations of
the atomic weights of nitrogen, potassium, sodium, and lithium.
 They were effected by the conversion of the chlorides into nitrates.
     The glass vessels used in this, as in the earlier parts of the in
vestigation, were made from a special glass.           Bohemian glass
 alone resists, in the most powerful manner, the action of concen
 trated acids.     By experiments at a glass manufactory, the author
 was convinced that a lime-soda glass possessed the requisite
 properties, provided it contained an adequate excess of silicic
 acid.   The following mixture was used :
                     Silica                     77-0
                     Potash                      7-7

in which equal atoms of Ca, K and Na are present, and which con
sisted of the purest materials.       On evaporating in a flask made
from this glass a pound of the most concentrated nitric acid, the
flask, after washing out the small residue, was only found to have
lost a milligramme in weight.        Melting nitre caused no loss of
weight. Nitre, twice evaporated with concentrated nitric acid
and fused, diminished the weight of the flask by 2 5 milligrammes.
    Pure nitric acid was prepared from commercial (spec. grav. =
1-5) by boiling and by two rectifications.         The chlorides were
heated in a platinum crucible, and while still hot filled into hot
glass tubes provided with glass stoppers.        It was established by
special experiments that, for the complete change of the chlorides,
three parts of nitric acid were required for the conversion of
1 K CI, four parts for the conversion of 1 Na CI, and 5-5 for one
part of Li CI.
    The weighed salt was introduced into a long-necked flask,
which, by means of a glass stopper, was connected with a
bulb-tube that dipped into a flask with water.         When the liquid
was heated to 40-50°, decomposition took place without effer

vescence.    "When all the gas was expelled, the flask was inclined,
and the nitric acid distilled off at as low a temperature as possible.
To prevent the salt from creeping; the flask was surrounded by a
cylinder of tin plate, s6 that only part of the bottom covered
with liquid was directly heated. The' dry residue Was now slowly
heated to melting in a current of dry air, and by rapid cooling
suddenly made to solidify. The flask was now weighed and treated
 a second time in the same manner.           A careful examination of
the water in the flask, as well as of the nitric acid distilled off,
 showed that no appreciable particles had been carried over.
    Chloride of potassium. — The salt investigated was prepared in
three ways : —

hydrochloric acid.      100 parts of this chloride of potassium
gave 135"643 parts of nitrate of potass.
    (6) Chlorate of potassium was decomposed by ignition in

platinum retort. As the chloride of potassium contained traces
of platinum and of silica,      was ignited with sal-ammoniac, dis
                                  it
solved,  and  the evaporated  residue    fused.   100 parts of chloride
of potassium gave 135-638 of nitrate of potass.            In another
preparation the fused salt was twice dissolved, again evaporated
and fused.     100 parts of, chjorijde .of .potassium then furnished

regia  and  mixed  in the dark  with   lime, then, after being acidified,
precipitated      chloride of potassium, and the fully washed pre
                   by
cipitate ignited with carbonate of potassium and sodium.               The
washed platinum       was    second
                              a         time  dissolved,  and  again pre
cipitated     chloride of potassium.
              by                            The precipitate, washed and
boiled with water, was divided into three parts          by
                                                         partial solution.
At first one-third      the whole mass was dissolved, then one half
                         of
of the residue, while, finally, an undissolved residue remained.
All three portions, dried at 200°, were reduced in current of     a
hydrogen, whereby water was given off, which thus only com
pletely escapes when the salt          is
                                      decomposed.      Hence this salt is
not suited for determining the atomic weight of platinum.
The chloride of potassium washed out was evaporated in                  a
platinum retort and fused.       Of the three portions of chloride of
potassium    100 parts gave, 135-649, 135 645, 135-640, and

absolute alcohol, mixed with its volume of ether, and the solution
treated by   a freezing-mixture. The chloride of lithium deposited
still contained much sodium.        Nor from nitrate of lithium can
all sodium be removed         ether- alcohol. The Li CI was now dis
                               by
solved, mixed with neutral carbonate of ammonium, and the mix

  ture warmed with continual agitation as long as the precipitate
 increased.     The salt was put into a cylinder which stood on
  a flask in connexion with the air-pump.         By this means all the
 mother-liquor     could  be drained  away.   It was washed in the same
 way with ammoniacal water.            From the wash- waters, by eva
 poration and ignition and treatment in a similar manner, afresh
 portion of carbonate of lithium was obtained.         The salt was now
 dissolved in nitric acid, again precipitated with carbonate of am
 monium, and the same operations repeated five times.            In this
 manner 55 grammes of pure salt were obtained from 1200
  grammes of crude carbonate of lithium. The salt obtained from
 the mother-liquor was diffused in water and brought into solu
 tion by means of carbonic acid gas (prepared by igniting bicar
 bonate of sodium). The clear solution boiled in platinum vessels
 separated a pure carbonate of lithium, which was cnce more sub
jected to a similar treatment. The salt was dissolved in a platinum
 boat heated to 160°-175°, and a current of dry hydrochloric
 acid passed over  it,   whereby all spirting was avoided. When the
decomposition was finished, the chloride of lithium formed was
 fused in the atmosphere of hydrochloric acid gas, and cooled in
a   current of nitrogen. The platinum boats were directly put
into cylindrical vessels, which were provided with metal caps and
stopcocks. The apparatus were pumped empty and weighed. To
 dry these cylinders, the author introduces small iron boats con
 taining oxide of copper and soda. For this purpose the author        ig
nites in a    porcelain tube the iron boats, which are half-filled with
a   mixture of part of saltpetre and 2\ finely divided copper. This
              1
mass dehydrates more rapidly than anhydrous phosphoric acid.
     For the purpose of an accurate investigation of the chloride of
 lithium, the contents of one of the boats was dissolved in water.
 The solution slowly but distinctly turned litmus-paper blue.
 The alkaline reaction remained even after part of the chloride of
 lithium had been volatilized in   a    current of hydrochloric acid, it
 being   allowed   to cool in a  current  of nitrogen. Entirely vola
 tilized in
          a    current of hydrochloric acid, chloride of lithium left
 no trace of  a  residue.
     If this chloride of lithium was mixed with solution of silver in
the ratios of the atomic weights CI = 35-5, Li =     7,   Ag= 108, the
liquid always contained an appreciable trace of silver, which
could be estimated       bymeans of normal solution of sal-ammoniac.
Here, as well as in the case of Na CI and     K    CI, the phenomenon,
was observed that an almost precipitated solution of silver, which
still contains 1-2 milligrammes of silver in solution,      is  precipi
tated both by chloride of sodium and           by    solution of silver.
The more acid the solution of silver, the more marked            is  the
phenomenon.

Li is = 7-022.
    Chloride of lithium was converted into nitrate by evaporation
with nitric acid.      Owing to the hygroscopic character of the
latter salt, the flask for weighing the residue was provided with
a chloride-of-calcium tube.      The nitrate of lithium, evaporated
in the platinum retort with excess of nitric acid, had a feebly al
kaline reaction after being fused in the platinum vessel. The
nitrates of potassium and sodium exhibit a similar deportment.
     100 parts Li 01 gave 162-588-1 62 600, mean 162-595 parts
of nitrate of lithium.
     Synthesis of nitrate of silver. — A weighed quantity of the
 purest silver was dissolved in nitric acid, the solution evaporated,
 the residue heated almost to fusion in a current of air and again
 weighed.      A repetition of the entire operation, by evaporation
 with nitric acid, &c, no longer altered the weight of the nitrate
 of silver.
     100 parts of silver gave 157-494-157-4964 (mean 157-4952),
 and sharply heated (mean) 157*484 parts of fused nitrate of
 silver.
     On fusion, nitrate of silver loses a trace of nitric acid. Hence
 its real weight is between those given above.

    Asa supplement, the author adduces some older and some newer
 experiments on the relative proportions between bromide of
potassium and silver.
     Bromide of potassium was prepared by igniting bromate of
 potassium.     As ultimately bromine is always given off, the salt
 was dissolved in water mixed with pure bromide of ammonium,
 the dry mass heated until all ammonia was expelled, and then
 fused.     Silver was then weighed out in the ratio of the atomic
 weights Br =80, Ag= 108, K = 39, precipitated with bromide
 of potassium, and the excess of silver estimated by a standard
 solution. 100 parts of silver correspond to 110-361 and 110 360
 parts of bromide of potassium.

 206      M.   Stas on the Determination     of Atomic Weights.
     After solution in water the bromide of potassium from the pre
 vious experiment left traces of silica. Filtered through spongy
 platinum, the filtrate decanted, after standing a day, was par
 tially evaporated and the residue fused in a current of nitrogen.
 100 parts correspond to 110 360 parts K Br.             The rest of the
 solution of K Br was evaporated to crystallization, and the se
 parated salt divided into three portions.           Each crystallization
 obtained was fused in a platinum boat and in a current of ni
 trogen. Only in the presence of bromate of potassium does fusing
 bromide of potassium attack platinum vessels.            From bromide
 of potassium once crystallized 110"342 parts were obtained for
 100 parts silver; from twice crystallized, 110,346; and from
 the salt which had been three times crystallized, 1 10'338 parts
 KBr.
     A fresh  portion of bromate of potassium which had been five
 times recrystallized     was changed into K Br.           100 parts of
 silver corresponded to 110-360 of this bromide of potassium.
 The same salt, recrystallized in the manner just described, showed
the relation 100 Ag : 110 336 KBr.              The mother-liquor and
wash-water from it evaporated, and a part of the residue ignited
in a current of bromine-vapour, gave a bromide of potassium
which exhibited the relation 100 Ag : 110-34.4 K Br. Another
part of the residue was changed into chloride by ignition in
chlorine gas, and this volatilized in a current of nitrogen. A
 residue of 0"005 per cent, silica was left.
     Bromide of potassium from bromine and caustic potash. — In
order to prepare pure potash, pure cream of tartar was lixiviated,
heated almost to decomposition, then crystallized seven times,
and carbonized in a silver crucible.        The carbonate of potassium
still contained silica, alumina, and traces of iron.          It was de
composed     in  a silver crucible by hydrate of lime prepared from
precipitated- carbonate of lime.       The lye was added to the bro
mine, evaporated, and the residue exhausted with absolute alcohol.
The bromide of potassium was washed away by ice-cold water,
and the residue, bromate of potassium, repeatedly recrystallized
and at length ignited.         After the separation of the bromate of
potassium,    bromide    of potassium was prepared from the mother-
liquor, which was heated to fusion. It was dissolved in bromine-
water, evaporated, and smartly dried.           The salt then dissolved
completely    in  water.    In  the  spectrum-apparatus     this salt ex
hibited no stronger reaction than other salts.             100 parts of
silver correspond to 110-332 and 110,343 parts of bromate of
potassium.
    Bromide of potassium from bromide of barium. — Bromate of
barium which had been four times recrystallized was precipi
tated with carbonate of potassium.          The filtrate evaporated, dis

            On Negative     Fluid Pressure on   a given Surface.     207
solved,   and, after standing, rapidly cooled, gave a bromate of
potassium, which was washed out with cold water, thrice crystal
lized, and then fused.         For 100 parts of silver, 110-357 parts
of this bromide of potassium were obtained.            The same salt was
dissolved in bromine-water, evaporated, the residue heated to
about 400°, again dissolved, and the solution, which was not
perfectly clear, filtered through spongy platinum and evaporated
to crystallization.     Of this salt there were 110-334 parts for 100
parts of silver.     The bromide of potassium in the residue from
this salt exhibited the ratio 100 Ag : 110335 parts K Br.
    As the general mean, 100 parts Ag correspond to 110-345
parts K Br.         Marignac found that 100 parts correspond to
 110343 parts K Br.             We give in conclusion the average
numbers for the atomic weights determined by the author : —

     XXVI.      On Negative     Fluid Pressure on a given Surface.
                  By Charles Brooke, M.A., F.R.S.
    To  the  Editors of   the  Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       Gentlemen,
            perusal of two papers in the last Number of your valu
THEable         Journal, containing some highly interesting experi
ments on fluid motion, but in which           I have sought in vain for
any definite exposition of their physical causes, has induced me
to send you a brief (unpublished) paragraph from my chapter
on Hydrodynamics, which will,           I think, help to place the origin
of these and other analogous phenomena in a somewhat clearer
   In the well-known experiment of Bernouilli, in which a current
of fluid passing through a diverging conical tube draws in addi
tional fluid through a lateral branch, and also in that of De-
sormes, in which a stream of air issuing from an orifice in a
plane surface virtually attracts a circular disk placed parallel to
and in front of it (which       I  have found to hold good equally with
a jet of water), and in other similar phenomena, the cause has

 208               Mr. C. Brooke on Negative Fluid
been ascribed to " lateral action ; " which in reality does no more
towards their elucidation, than did of old the " principle of suc
tion " for the explanation of the lifting-pump.
   In reference to Bernoulli's experiment,! proceed to observe: —
   " This physical fact
                        may probably be best explained thus : — Each
moving particle  has acquired a certain amount of energy, by which
it exerts a pressure in the direction of the axis of the tube through
 which it is passing. If flowing towards the smaller end of a conical
 tube, Ain the figure, this pressure, a b, may
 be resolved into a c perpendicular, and cb
 parallel to the side of the tube ; of these
 dc is wholly effective against the side of
 the tube, and if an aperture or lateral
 branch exists the fluid will escape thence.
 If, on the contrary, the fluid flow towards
the larger end, as in B, then c b, the por
 tion of the pressure a b resolved perpendi
 cularly to the side of the tube, acts en
tirely from its surface ; and if a lateral
brancb, entering the tube at a right angle,
be immersed in a small vessel of fluid, atmospheric pressure on the
fluid in the vessel being transmitted through the branch-tube, and
unopposed at its point of junction, will cause the fluid to enter the
conical tube at that point.      And it is evident that the greater the
value of c b, that is, the greater the velocity in the conical tube, the
greater will be the lateral influx ; this result is confirmed by experi
ment; for as the velocity of the fluid in B increases, that in the
lateral branch may be raised through a higher vertical column."
    In this case it is clear that the pressure of the fluid against the
interior of the diverging tube     is,  according to ordinary geome
trical language, negative.        Precisely the same reasoning will
apply to Desormes's experiment, because the space between the
parallel plane surfaces may be conceived to be made up of             a
number of radial wedge-shaped diverging tubes.
   In the experiments, however, which have induced these remarks,
the negative or diminished pressure on certain orifices    is  due, not
to the resolution of statical pressure, but to very different causes.
                      a
In the experiments of Mr. llodwell (and in analogous experi
ments   by  Professor Magnus, published in your Number for Ja
nuary   1851),  the existing negative pressure appears to me to be
fully explained  by   cohesion existing between similar, or adhesion
between dissimilar molecules   ;    and that these forces are sufficient
may,I    think,  be  inferred  from  the fact thata   column of water
about two feet high, and of sulphuric acid nearly four feet high,
may be sustained in    a   very nearly exhausted and sealed vertical
glass tube merely     by  the cohesion of the fluids themselves, and
their adhesion to the surface of the glass.

                      Pressure  on a given Surface.                   209
    In  the experiment of Mr. Rodwell (p. 105), in which a stream
of water descending freely from the orifice of a vertical pipe
withdraws water from the orifice of a horizontal pipe placed in
contact with the stream near the point of issue, the "lateral
action
         " is explained by " a strain upon the particles which acts
                                             " but surely this is only
against the lateral force of the stream ;
removing the       difficulty one step further, for what causes the
" strain."                                      "
                To this I would simply reply, Cohesion : as soon as
the velocity of the issuing molecules exceeds that at which they
will slide freely over each other, the pressure at the orifice of the
horizontal pipe becomes negative, and fluid escapes until the
negative pressure is balanced by the weight of the column vir
tually raised."       Precisely the same remarks will apply to the
steam-jet, except that when the lateral tube contained air only,
the force in action was adhesion of the molecules of air to those of
                                 "
             The " inner cone meutioned in p. 107 I presume to
vapour.
be the space occupied by "dry" steam.
     Before quitting this part of the subject, permit me to notice a
 remark of Professor Magnus in the paper alluded to. After de
 scribing the water-bellows (in which water descending by its own
 gravity in a large vertical pipe about 13 feet long draws in air
 through a number of orifices, which being carried down by the
 stream into a water-closed chamber, produces a stream of air
                                                           " the real phy
 sufficient for blowing a furnace), he observes that
 sical cause of the descent of the air is still totally unknown."
 Surely in this case the negative pressure of the water against
 any given point of the tube arises from the antagonism between
 the cohesion of the molecules above to the fluid at rest, and the
 downward pressure of the molecules below, due to their acquired
 energy.      These opposite forces acting on any two vertically con
 tiguous molecules will tend to separate them, and thus to pro
 duce a negative pressure on the horizontally adjacent molecules,
 which is transferred to the inner surface of the pipe ; and any
 air-bubbles that enter the orifices near the top of the pipe enable
  the molecules below them to acquire more vis viva than those
 above, and thus thenegative pressure becomes augmented as the
 fluid descends.
     In  regard to Mr. Rodwell's first experiment, there is a remark
 able resemblance between his lycopodium-figure and those ob
  served by Strehlke* when a drop of fluid covered with lycopo-
  dium is deposited on a vibrating plate near a nodal line ; he
  also observed that when drops were similarly placed on opposite
  sides of the line, the gyratory motion was (as might be expected)
  in opposite directions.

Professor Tyndall. In his " sensitive flames " the pressure of the
issuing gas is so adjusted that the slightest augmentation of
pressure makes the flame roar, the roaring being always accom
panied by elongation in bat-wing and fish-tail burners, and by
considerable shortening in a jet from a single orifice.
    The pressure at the orifice of the jet is of course the difference
of the external and internal pressures, and may be equally aug
mented by the diminution of the former, or the increase of the
latter : and the pressure is momentarily augmented by external
diminution each time that the phase of rarefaction of a progres
sive sound- wave* reaches the orifice; and, within wide limits, the
 more rapid the vibrations, the more decided will be the effect.        I
apprehend that there is not the slightest alteration of the mean
pressure (measured by the quantity of gas issued in a given
time), whether the sensibility of the flame be brought into action
or not.
    "With all due respect for the author's acknowledged experi
 mental ability,     I must demur to the inferences arising from his
concluding note.         I cannot conceive that the vis viva, or energy,
 of the few molecules at the orifice can be sufficient to impart sen
 sible vibration to the contents of the gas-pipe.        Could, for ex
ample,     a flute  or an   organ-pipe be made  to  speak with an em
bouchure no larger than the orifice of a gas-burner ?        "I   guess
                                                                        "
not : and the continuous gas-pipe would not even have the advan
 tage of these, in reinforcing by reciprocation the impressed wave-
 motion . And moreover, in one at least of the forms of burner (the
fish-tail), the supposed in-flowing wave-motion would be in pe
culiarly disadvantageous circumstances ; for the waves in similar
 phases entering by the two orifices would, after reflexion from
the opposite sides, of necessity interfere ; and would be in much
 the same condition as light-waves diffracted at the sides of a
 small object, as a pin, the resultant motion being nil, and, there
fore, the effect darkness.        But even granting the vibrations in
the gas-pipe, I do not see how they can affect the phenomena in
question ; because, from the progressive motion of the column
of gas, they would not be synchronous with those propagated in
the surrounding stationary atmosphere.           Is the final injunction
respecting ample gas-ways the result of experiment, or of infer
ence only ?

XXVII.      On the Physical Properties of Water in relation to Ter
       restrial Climate.     By Professor Hennessy, F.R.S. fyc.
     To the Editors   of the  Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      Gentlemen,
                me to express my satisfaction at seeing that conclu
ALLOW    sions  to which    I  have been led several years since, and
which have appeared in the pages of your Magazine as well as in
other publications, have been reproduced in your last Number by
Mr. James Croll. Your able contributor has already done me
the honour of sanctioning or adopting other results which            I had
previously published, and       I  may therefore be excused for briefly
referring to them in the course of the present communication.
    In your Number for March 1859, S. 4. vol. xvii. p. 181, a
paper is printed in which the properties of water in their rela
tion to terrestrial climate during different geological epochs is
the principal subject under discussion.          After establishing, as   I
venture to think, the superiority of water as a heat-distributor
over the earth's surface compared with the other materials of the
earth's coating,    I applied the results to explain the operation of
the Gulf-stream, and afterwards to the question of geological
climate.     After a short discussion of Sir Charles Lyell's theory,
of the calorific influence of a belt of equatorial land combined
with circumpolar oceans,       I  made the following statement, which

    Another conclusion which         I drew from this, namely that a

have existed during some geological epochs, would be brought
about by the absence of continents or large islands and the pre
valence of oceans, Mr. Croll in a former paper (Phil. Mag.
August 1 864, p. 128) attributes to Professor Phillips, although
Professor Phillips himself in a note cites my publication where
the conclusion was first enunciated.          In the same paper (p. 123)
Mr. Croll refers to the Astronomer Royal and "others" as hav

naeum      at the same time as the Astronomer Royal in 1860, it
is possible that      I am meant among the "others."             The prin
cipal object of my letter was to call attention to the        fact that my
proof of the stability of the earth's axis, contained in a letter
addressed to the late Sir John Lubbock, was published eight
years before, in the Proceedings of the Royal Society (see also
Phil. Mag. May 1852, S. 4. vol. iii. p. 386).

seriously and permanently disturb the orbits of the planets.
Such a result had been pointed out by Mr. Hopkins in 1852 ;
but at the Meeting of the British Association at Manchester in
1861, in the course of a discussion on a paper by Sir W. Thom

system so as to increase terrestrial temperature to the extent of
time required by geological phenomena, without the production
of a double star group of which our sun would thenceforth be a

XXVIII.      On the Reason why the Difference of reading between a
    Thermometer exposed to direct Sunshine and one Shaded Dimi
   nishes as we ascend in the Atmosphere.      By James Croll*.
           remarkable   fact was observed by   Mr. Glaisher, that the
THEdifference      of reading between a black-bulb thermometer
exposed to the direct rays of the sun and one shaded diminishes
as we ascend in the atmosphere.        On viewing the matter under
the light of Professor Tyndall's important discovery regarding
the influence of aqueous vapour on radiant heat, the fact stated
by Mr. Glaisher appears to be in perfect harmony with theory.
The following considerations will perhaps make this plain.
   The shaded thermometer marks the temperature of the sur
rounding air ; but the exposed thermometer marks not the tem
perature of the air, but that of the bulb heated by the direct
rays of the sun.     The temperature of the bulb depends upon
two elements : (1) the rate at which it receives heat by direct
radiation from the sun above the earth beneath and all sur
rounding objects, and by contact with the air ; (2) the rate at
which it loses heat by radiation and by contact with the air. As
regards the heat gained and lost by contact with the surrounding
air, both thermometers are under the same conditions, or nearly so.
We therefore require only to consider the element of radiation.
   We begin by comparing the two thermometers at the earth's
                     * Communicated   by the Author,

214    Mr. J. Croll  on the Diminution   of Difference  between
surface, and we find that they differ by a very considerable num
ber of degrees. We now ascend some miles into the air, and on
again comparing the thermometers we find that the difference
between them has greatly diminished.       It has been often proved,
by direct observation, that the intensity of the sun's rays increases
as we rise in the atmosphere.     How then does the exposed ther
mometer sink more rapidly than the shaded one as we ascend ?
The reason is obviously this. The temperature of the thermo
meters depends as much upon the rate at which they are losing
their heat as upon the rate at which they are gaining it. The
higher temperature of the exposed thermometer is the result of
direct radiation from the sun.    Now, although this thermometer
receives by radiation more heat from the sun at the upper posi
tion than at the lower, it does not necessarily follow on this ac
count that its temperature ought to be higher. Suppose that
at the upper position it should receive one-fourth more heat from
the sun than at the lower, yet if the rate at which it loses its
heat by radiation into space be, say, one-third greater at the
upper position than at the lower, the temperature of the bulb
would sink to a considerable extent, notwithstanding the extra
amount of heat received.       Let us now reflect on how matters
stand in this respect    in  regard to the actual case under our
consideration.   When the exposed thermometer is at the higher
position, it receives more heat from the sun than at the lower,
but it receives less from the earth ; for a considerable part of
the radiation from the earth is cut off by the screen of aqueous
vapour intervening between the thermometer and the earth.
But, on the whole, it is probable that the total quantity of radiant
heat reaching the thermometer is greater in the higher position
than in the lower. Compare now the two positions in regard to
the rate at which the thermometer loses its heat by radiation.
 When the thermometer is at the lower position, it has the warm
surface of the ground against which to radiate its heat down
wards.    The high temperature of the ground thus tends to di
minish the rate of radiation. Above, there is a screen of aqueous
vapour throwing back upon the thermometer a very considerable
part of the heat which the instrument is radiating upwards.
This, of course, tends greatly to diminish the loss from radiation.
But at the upper position this very screen, which prevented the
thermometer from throwing off its heat into the cold space above,
now affects the instrument in an opposite manner ; for the ther
 mometer has now to radiate its heat downwards, not upon the
 warm surface of the ground as before, but upon the cold upper
 surface of the aqueous screen intervening between the instru
 ment and the earth. This of course tends to lower the mercury.
 We are now in a great measure above the aqueous screen, with

          exposed and shaded Thermometers    in upper Air.      215
nothing to protect the thermometer from the influence of cold
stellar space. It is true that the air above is at a temperature
little below that of the thermometer itself ; but then the air is
dry, and, owing to its diathermancy, it does not absorb the heat
radiated from the thermometer, and consequently the instru
ment radiates its heat directly into the cold stellar space above,
some hundreds of degrees below zero, almost the same as it would
do were the air entirely removed. -The enormous loss of heat
which the thermometer now sustains causes it to fall in tempe
rature to a great extent.      The molecules of the comparatively
dry air at this elevation, being very bad radiators, do not throw
off their heat into space so rapidly as the bulb of the exposed
thermometer ; consequently their temperature does not (for this
reason) tend to sink so rapidly as that of the bulb.      Hence the
shaded thermometer,       which indicates the temperature of those
molecules, is not affected to such an extent as the exposed one.
Hence also the difference of reading between the two instruments
must diminish as we rise in the atmosphere.
    This difference between the temperature of the two thermo
meters evidently does not go on diminishing to an indefinite
extent.    Were we able to continue our ascent in the atmosphere,
we should certainly find that a point would be reached beyond
which the difference of reading would begin to increase, and
would continue to do so till the outer limits of the atmosphere
was reached.      The difference between the temperatures of the
two thermometers beyond the limits of the atmosphere would
certainly be enormous.       The thermometer exposed to the direct
rays of the sun would no doubt be much colder than it had been
when at the earth's surface ; but the shaded thermometer would
now indicate the temperature of space, which, according to Sir
John Herschel and M. Pouillet, is more than 200° Fahrenheit
below zero.
    It follows also, from what has been stated, that even under
direct sunshine the removal of the earth's atmosphere would
tend to lower the temperature of the earth's surface to a great
extent.     This conclusion also follows as an immediate inference
from the fact that the earth's atmosphere, as it exists at present
charged with aqueous vapour, affects terrestrial radiation more
than it does radiation from the sun ; for the removal of the
atmosphere would increase the rate at which the earth throws
off its heat into space more than it would increase the rate
at which it receives heat from the sun ; therefore its tempera
ture would necessarily fall until the rate of radiation from
the earth's surface exactly equalled the rate of radiation to the
surface.     Let the atmosphere again envelope the earth, and ter
restrial radiation would instantly    be diminished ; the tempera

ture of the earth's surface would therefore necessarily begin to
rise, and would continue to do so till the rate of radiation from
the surface would equal the rate of radiation received by the
surface.      Equilibrium being thus restored, the temperature
would remain stationary.          It is perfectly obvious that if we
 envelope the earth with a substance such as our atmosphere,
 that offers more resistance to terrestrial radiation than to solar,
the temperature of the earth's surface must necessarily rise until
the heat which is being radiated off equals that which is being
received from the sun.         Remove the air and thus get quit of the
resistance, and the temperature of the surface would fall, because
in this case a lower temperature would maintain equilibrium.
    It follows, therefore, that the moon, which has no atmosphere,
must be much colder than our earth, even on the side exposed to
the sun. Were our earth with its atmosphere as it exists at
present removed to the orbit of Venus or Mars, for example, it
certainly would not be habitable, owing to the great change of
temperature that would result.            But a change in the physical
constitution of the atmospheric envelope is really all that would
be necessary to retain the earth's surface at its present tempera
ture in either position, as has been clearly shown by Professor
Tyndall*.

XXIX.      Note on "Sensitive Flames." By W.F. Barrett, Teacher
    of Experimental Science at the London College of the Interna
    tional Education Society, late Assistant in the Physical Labo
    ratory of the Royal Institution^.
        the last Number of the Philosophical Magazine Professor
IN Tyndall       has published the abstract of his Friday evening
lecture at    the  Royal Institution,
                                           " On Sounding and Sensitive
Flames."       In the historical note prefixed to that abstract, Pro
fessor Tyndall has stated my relationship to the latter subject. It
is briefly this.    In 1865, while preparing the experiments for one
of the Christmas lectures at the Royal Institution,          I noticed that
the higher harmonics of a brass plate (which          I was sounding with
a violin-bow in order to obtain Chladni's figures) had a remark
able effect on a tall and slender gas-flame that happened to be
burning near. At the sound of any shrill note the flame shrank

down several inches, at the same time spreading out sideways
into a flat flame, which gave an increased amount of light from
the more perfect combustion of the gas.            Having drawn Pro
fessor Tyndall's attention to this influence of certain notes on a
naked gas-flame, with his consent I followed up the observation
by a short investigation, of the results of which he was unaware,
with a view to ascertain the cause and exalt the action of this
singular phenomenon.
     I subsequently heard that a somewhat similar but reverse
 effect to that which I had observed had been noticed in America,
 and for the first time read the details of these experiments in the
 lecture to which I have referred.       I  was then made aware that
 Professor Leconte had noticed (in 1858) that musical sounds
 caused the spasmodic jumping of a fish-tail gas-flame, and had
 made the happy observation that the flame did not jump until
 the pressure of the gas caused it to be near flaring.          Having
 submitted Professor Leconte's discovery and my own simple ob
 servation to a careful examination, Professor Tyndall incorpo
 rated the results in his elegant lecture demonstration of January
 the 18th last.
     As, however, that lecture dwelt almost entirely upon the action
 of sounds on gas-flames rendered sensitive by increasing the
 usual gas-pressure, which, with many, introduces a difficulty in
  the repetition of the experiments,    I  have thought it worth while
 to publish the following brief record of my experiments, made
  with gas burnt direct from the main.         The experiments for the
  most part were executed at my own home, during the months of
  June and July 1 8G6. They will be found to add but little, if any
 thing, to the comprehensive paper published by Professor Tyndall.
      The general effect noticed is as follows.    A gas-flame burning
  from the tapering jet, B, fig. 1, gives the appearance represented
  in that figure. It is a dull quivering flame, throwing off clouds
  of unconsumed carbon. When a shrill note is uttered or played,
  this flame at once shrinks in height and spreads out in width,
  taking the shape shown in fig. 2. In the first figure the flame
  has a loose and ill-defined shape ; in the second it has, as it
  were, a certain degree of tension, with a flat divergent appearance,
  thick at the edges. To naked flames capable of responding
  by their motion to certain sounds Professor Tyndall has given
  the name of sensitive flames ; by this expressive word they will
  in future, I trust, be designated.         When a sensitive flame is
  spread out under the     influence  of   sound, I will term it in this
  paper a divergent flame.      It was noticeable that the divergence
  of the flame did not reach to the burner, but under the main flat
  tening, a, fig. 2, was a small swelling, b, at right angles to, and

  be due to the shape of the burner, and its presence will be.

  lected.   The plane of the divergent flame is uninfluenced by

the direction of the sound, but depends entirely on the position
of the burner, and moves with it.
    I now sought to find how far the effect was influenced by the
size and shape of the burner whence the gas issued.       Burners
were formed of glass tubing drawn out and the points broken off
so as to obtain orifices of various sizes.   Flames of different
length and volume were thus produced.      Sensitiveness was only

obtained with the longest and most voluminous flames.                 Having
found the best size for the burner,           I  now altered its shape by
carefully snipping and filing the orifice.           It was at once noticed
that the shape as well as the size of the burner was an important
element in the production of the phenomenon.                 Metal burners
with circular orifices, after adjusting by repeated trials their size
and shape, answered equally as well as glass ones.              The stem of
a tobacco-pipe       does not answer for a burner          the bore is too
small ; but a gas-fitter's brass blowpipe, if straightened and filed
to a rather larger aperture, makes a very fair burner.                On ac
count, however, of the ease with which they can be reproduced,
I   preferred in general to use burners formed of glass tubing.
 By care a burner was obtained which gave a remarkably sensi
tive flame ; this burner is represented in fig. 3.           It is formed of
 glass tubing about       |  of an inch in diameter, contracted to an
 orifice  ^  of an inch in diameter.
                                           '
                                              It is very essential that this
 orifice should be slightly V-shaped, as shown in the figure*.
     When this burner was connected by a length of india-rubber
 tubing to the gas-pipes, the stopcock being fully open, a tapering
 flame about 15 inches long was obtained' (fig. 1). With this
                                                                       '¦¦,

                            —
     A noise of any kind walking on the ground, shutting a book,
 or stamping a chair, for example — caused the flame to shrink
 down more or less.         Its action was like that of a sensitive, ner
 vous person uneasily starting and twitching at every little noise.
 These noises consisting of a mixture of notes, the experiment
 was purified by trying a series of tuning-forks of different pitch,
 ranging from 256 to 512 vibrations per second.                 It was found
 that none of the fundamental notes of these forks caused the flame
 to shrink; but a fork of higher pitch, or the higher notes of the
 series of large forks, instantly caused a divergence of the flame f.
 A large inverted bell was sounded by a violin-bow and caused to
 yield one of its higher harmonics.          The flame was intensely influ
 enced ; and a very pretty effect was here observed : the beats (due
  to the interference of the vibrations of the bell), which were faintly
  audible, were rendered more apparent by the movements of the
  flame ; at every beat the momentary silence allowed the flame
  partially to regain its original height, from which, however, it
  was almost immediately thrown down by the sound which fol-

     t This and the next experiment I made at the Royal Institution in
  June 1866. The influence of pitch on the flame is well illustrated by
  running up the scale of a pianoforte : when the high notes are approached
  the flame becomes uneasy, and at last diverges strongly when the note
  equals about 1500 vibrations per second.

 lowed, erecting itself again at the next beat, only to be thrust
 back as the sound again welled up ; thus a sort of breathing
 flame was produced, the aspirations of which were strictly timed
 to the sighing of the bell*.          I  next tried the action of a large
 brass plate fixed at its centre to a stand.          Throwing the plate
 into vibration by means of a fiddle-bow, an energetic and large
 divergence of the flame was obtained when the higher notes of
 the plate were sounded.          Holding the plate thus sounding close
 to and parallel with the flame, a more strained and intense diver
 gence took place ; the flame was in fact almost split in two, the
 edges becoming denser and the central part a mere film of flame ;
 but the divergence never reached down to the burner. Slowly
 moving the plate so as to bring different parts in succession op
 posite the flame, the principal nodal lines could be traced as
 easily as with sand. The intervals of rest in the vibrating plate
 allowed the flame to raise itself up, and in its sluggish combus
 tion to stand, as it were, at ease, whilst the ventral segments
 dragged it down to active burning and apparent attention.                   As

 tions of a plate will be found useful where an audience is unable
 to look down upon the plate to see the arrangement of sand on
 the nodal lines.      In this, as in all other experiments, the sur
 prising change in the brilliancy of the flame is a most striking
 part of the phenomenon.
     The divergence of the flame is not due to the impact of trans
 lated puffs of air, but is an effect caused by sonorous vibrations.
 This can be easily proved.           For instance, standing a few yards
 from the flame and bringing the hands forcibly together as if to
 clap them, but stopping short of doing so, the flame remains
 undivergent, the slightest clap, however, at once produces a
 strong divergence.        It is astonishing how far off a sound affects
 the flame, notwithstanding the intervention of solid obstacles ;
 one experiment will illustrate this.           Whistling has a powerful
 effect on the flame, especially so the shrill whistle obtained by
blowing into a key.           Whilst     I  observed the flame, a friend
 whistling in this way left the room wherein was the flame,
 and, closing the door after him, slowly retreated upstairs;
though its action was enfeebled by closing the door, the flame
 still continued to shrink at every whistle, and was visibly affected
even, when the whistle was sounded where it could barely be
heard, in a closed apartment three stories away f.             It certainly is
    * I observe that Professor Leconte has previously noticed that his fish
tail gas-flame exhibited pulsations in height exactly synchronous with the
audible beats of a musical instrument.
    t  Professor Tyndall, in his lecture, has shown that by slightly increasing
the pressure of the gas the flame is susceptible of even greater sensitiveness
than is shown in this experiment.

a most wonderful thing to consider, how almost infinitely small
is the amount of vibratory motion sufficient to alter so com
 pletely the aspect of a large flame of gas : and this sensitiveness
 of such a gas-flame to certain sounds would lead one to hope
 that it might be put to some use for experimental or prac
 tical purposes.                                           I
                       The chirp of a cricket would, have no doubt,
 have an energetic action upon the flame.                  Speaking to the
 flame in an ordinary voice at a distance of 30 or 40 feet away
 caused a very marked divergence.                It was noticed that the
 letter s had a very strong effect on the flame ; and it was very
 curious to watch the flame as it apparently mocked any person
 who happened to be speaking*.
     Whilst making some of the foregoing experiments last summer,
 I  was led to observe that the pressure of the gas had an important
 influence upon the divergence of the flame, and remarked that
 an increased pressure acted like a shrill sound in spreading out
 the flame, which gave at the same time a roaring noise.                    Pro
 fessor Leconte has, however, decidedly the prior claim to this
 observation, which Professor Tyndall has raised to an expla
 nation of the phenomenon.             Professor Tyndall remarks, "The
 gas issues from its burner with a hiss, and an external sound
    * In the last Number of the
                                   Philosophical Magazine, Professor Tyndall
 has already remarked on the striking effect upon the flame produced by
the letters, or by the hiss given when compressed air issues from an orifice.
Associated with this observation there are some other remarkable pecu
liarities connected with the sound of the letter s. When listening from
 some elevated point to the singing of a large assemblage of people, I have
frequently noticed that when a word containing any sibilant was sung, the
 sound of the peoples' voices united itself into a sharp, loud and somewhat
 prolonged hiss, like the escape of high-pressure steam from a small nozzle,
and quite unlike anything produced by any other letter.        In a paper pub
lished in the Philosophical Magazine for June 1849, the Astronomer Royal
 has stated his belief that the sound of s or z is produced by
                                                                  " an interrup
 tion of the continuity of the particles of air " — that it is in fact a broken
wave, in its progress resembling the rush of a bore on a river ; and has
 compared it to a broken-headed sea which, meeting an embankment, is
 not regularly reflected as the larger waves would be, but runs along the
 side to a far distance.  In support of this analogy, Mr. Airy mentions the
 fact that a sibilant sound is not returned by an ordinary echo, and that in
 whispering-galleries the buzzing sound of a whisper is carried along close
 to and never quits the surface of the dome, being only heard at the oppo
 site side by applying the ear close to that surface, while an ordinary sound
is not transmitted along the surface, and is not so strikingly heard at the
opposite side.     From theoretic considerations, Mr. Airy remarks that any
clear musical sound would have a tendency to degenerate into a hiss by
mere distance of transmission, and that this conversion would soonest take
place with loud sounds on a high key.      That eminent philosopher is, how
ever, unaware whether there exists any instance of such a conversion :
might not a sensitive flame be applied to the determination of this interest

Modern Arithmetic, a Treatise adapted for School Work and Private
  Study. By the Rev. John Hunter, M.A. Pp. 246. London :
  Longmans and Co.
                the chief difficulty of drawing up a good practical book
PERHAPS
   on arithmetic    arises from the fact that the order in which the parts
of the subject have to be taught is not that in which they would be
systematically arranged.       For purposes of systematic arrangement
the parts of the subject would follow each other thus: — First, the
rules of addition, &c. for integers, vulgar and decimal fractions ; next,
the same rules and subsidiary processes for concrete or mixed num
bers ; and, lastly, the application of the rules to questions of com
mercial arithmetic.     A book so arranged may be very proper for boys
or young men already instructed, who merely wish to revise and ex
tend their knowledge of the subject, but is quite unfit as a manual
even for intelligent boys.      If the reader doubt this, let him imagine
an arrangement by which a boy is taught to      "find   the sum of 0-125,
4' 163, and 9*457 correct to five places of decimals," before he has
been taught to "find the value of 11 lbs. of beef at lOJrf. a pound."
Yet this is the order adopted in perhaps the majority of modern books
upon- arithmetic, and certainly in some written with conspicuous
ability.    And it must be allowed that a completely satisfactory alter
native arrangement is not easily suggested — though there can be
little doubt that the right order for teaching is to divide the subject
into two courses, so as to introduce the learner to concrete numbers as
soon as possible. This is in fact what Mr. Hunter has done in the
treatise before us.    His first course consists of the four rules for
integers, one or two processes in vulgar fractions in anticipation of
the distinct treatment of that subject in the second course, mixed
numbers, miscellaneous examples, and rule of three.        The arrange
ment, though causing a want of symmetry in the book, is doubtless
substantially right; but we think it might be improved in detail ;
                                                              "
e. g. such examples as "multiply       £76 19s. 8^d. by 5f (p. 49)
 should hardly be introduced before the formal treatment of vulgar
 fractions.
    The remainder of the work takes in the whole of the subjects ge
nerally contained in the best modern treatises, and seems to us, so
                               to be very well done. On the whole, we

more is given than its equation in its simplest form, and those of its
tangent and normal, together with a few properties that follow directly
from those equations.        The object of the work is to put the merest
elements of the subject in a very simple form, with a view to en
abling a beginner to obtain some knowledge of it before proceeding
to more elaborate works.          The simplification is mainly effected by
inserting steps of algebraical processes which are commonly sup
pressed or curtailed.       The author tells us, in his preface, that in
writing the book he has had an eye to what, from long experience in
tuition, he has found needful. We therefore infer that there are
mathematical students who find * An Easy Introduction to Conic

experience, it would have seemed better that a student who found
insuperable difficulties in such a book as Mr. Todhunter's

branches of mathematics before proceeding to the higher.

Balfour Stewart, M.A., F.R.S., and P. G. Tait, M.A. (Continued.)
     16. The apparatus and certain preliminary experiments having
been described in the previous paper *, the authors now proceed to
relate what further experiments have been made.
     In the preliminary experiments it was conclusively shown (art. 8)
that the effect on the pile caused by rotation of the disk was due
 to radiant heat, and also (art. 9) that this effect was not due to
the heating of the rock-salt which, in most of the experiments, was
placed before the mouth of the cone.
     It was also rendered probable that the effect was not due to ra
diation from heated air, by the two following considerations : —
     (1) Because in order that nearly dry air of such a tenuity might
give such a radiation it would require to be heated enormously.
     (2) Because when the lampblack was removed from the aluminium
disk, leaving it a rough metallic surface, the indication afforded by
the galvanometer was reduced to about one-fourth of the amount
with the blackened disk.
     The following observations tend to strengthen this proof : —
     (3) The heating effect is the same in hydrogen or in coal-gas as
in air, although there is no question that the absorptive, and there
fore the radiative power of coal-gas is much greater than that of air.
This is shown by the following "sets of experiments, which were
made with the blackened aluminium disk insulated with ebonite, and
with rock-gait in the cone.

228       Royal Society : — Messrs. Balfour Stewart and Tait on
conclusion that this effect is due to rotation under the earth's mag
netic force.
    It would therefore appear to be proved that in these experiments
the increased temperature of the aluminium disk is not due to rota
tion under the earth's magnetic force.
     19. It might perhaps be said that the heating of the disk may be
due to heat conducted from the bearings into the disk and then
 distributed outwards ; and this conjecture will require to be examined,
since the bearings are, no doubt, heated by friction during the mo
 tion.     This heating effect on the bearings was measured by means
 of a very delicate thermometer, which was inserted into a small hole
 in the bush through which oil is supplied to the spindle, and made
 to be in metallic contact with the sides of this hole ; the mean of
 three observations made the heating effect at the spindle due to ro
 tation to be 4° Fahr.
     In the next place, the aluminium disk, separated from its metallic
 spindle by the ebonite washer, and in every respect the same as
 when made to rotate, had its spindle heated artificially by a mercury
bath, generally at least 40° Fahr. above the previous temperature.
 After the lapse of two minutes the effect upon the pile was hardly
 perceptible— not more than five divisions.
     ( 1 ) It would appear from this experiment that the heating effect
 observed in rotation cannot be due to heat conducted from the
 bearings through the ebonite washer, since a-temperature difference
 between the bearings and the disk ten times greater than that pro
 duced by rotation causes a heating effect at least six times less than
 that caused by rotation in a somewhat less time.
     (2) The ebonite washer used to prevent the heat of the bearings
 from reaching the aluminium disk, is a cylindrical disk, its thickness
 being two-tenths of an inch, and the area of one of its faces 3" 15
 square inches.     It is shielded behind by a brass disk, of similar size,
which brass disk being near the bearings, and metallically connected
 with them, we may suppose to have the same temperature as the
 bearings.      Thus one face of the ebonite washer is in contact with
 brass, having the temperature of the bearings, while the other is in
 contact with the aluminium disk.       Supposing that this washer, used
 to protect the aluminium disk from the heat of the bearings, was of
 iron instead of being of ebonite, we can calculate approximately from
 Principal Forbes's determinations of the absolute conductivity of this
 metal, how much heat would be conducted across the washer during
 the experiment. According to these observations, if a cube of iron
 whose side is one foot, have one of its faces kept permanently at
 a temperature 1° C. higher than the opposite face, the quantity of
 heat conducted across in one minute will be -Oil unit nearly, a unit
 denoting the amount of heat required to raise a cubic foot of water
  1° C.    Since in these observations both the temperature difference
 and the unit are expressed in the same thermometric degrees, we
 may, if we choose, substitute degrees Fahr. for degrees Centigrade
in the above expression for conductivity.       Now, if we assume as an
 approximation that during the whole experiment of rotation the heat

         the Heating  of a Disk   by rapid Rotation   in vacuo.      229
 conducted across such a washer is the same as if for one minute the
 temperature difference between both sides of the washer were kept at
 2° Fahr., and if we make allowance for the surface and for the thick
 ness of the washer, we obtain the following expression as approxi
mately representing the heat conducted across the washer during
the experiment,
             Heat=-01   1 x 2 x ^144
                                     X ^='028

                                                  unit nearly,
where the first factor is on account of the double temperature differ
ence, the second on account of the surface, and the third on ac
count of the thickness.
    But a unit of heat in the above expression denotes the amount ne
cessary to raise a cubic foot of water (or nearly 1000 ounces) 1° F.
Now the weight of the disk is 10-5 ounces, and its specific heat is
0"22. Hence the above amount of heat will raise the disk
             •028 X ~     X 4o= 12° Fahr- in   temperature.
    Hence we see that if the material of the washer had been of the
metal bismuth, of which the conductivity is 7 times less than that of
iron, and if we suppose the circumstances of the experiment to be
equivalent to a temperature difference of 2° Fahr. between the two
sides of the washer lasting for one minute, then the quantity of heat
conducted across the washer will be a little greater than that observed.
But the conductivity of ebonite is no doubt very much less than
that of bismuth, and therefore on this account we cannot suppose
that the heating effect observed is due to conduction.
    (3) In this investigation no account has been taken of the unequal
 distribution of temperature from the centre to the circumference of
the disk, the tendency of which would be to diminish the effect upon
the pile (which was directed, to the circumference of the disk) of the
heat passing through the washer ; and indeed, when this element is
taken into account, it is not surprising to find, as was actually the
case, that in some preliminary experiments, where the disk was me
tallically connected with the spindle, the effect was not greater than
with the ebonite washer.
    (4) The short time in which the effect attains its maximum value
is against the supposition that it is caused by conduction from the
bearings.
    (5) The fact that (as    we shall  afterwards see) the temperature
effect  in three aluminium    disks of different thicknesses is inversely
proportional to the thickness, is also against this supposition.
    (6) And so is the fact that a heat-effect obeying apparently the
same laws, holds for an ebonite disk iu which there is but a very
feeble conduction.
    On the whole, therefore, we cannot suppose this effect to be due
to conduction, or at least we must conclude that the effect of conduc
tion constitutes only an exceedingly small fraction of that observed.

  230        Royal Society:  — Messrs. Balfour Stewart and Tait         on
       20. It was suggested to the authors hy Professor Stokes and by Mr.
•
  Grove, that the effect might be due to vibrations of the disk, the
  energy of which, owing to the viscosity of the disk for such vibra
  tions, might ultimately become converted into heat j and it is neces
  sary to examine this question.
       (1) The thickest aluminium disk was found to be out of truth not
  more than "015 inch on each side.         Hence, the thickness of this disk
  being     '05 inch, when  turned   with  moderate    rapidity, its apparent
  thickness should be
                            •015  + -05 + -015=-08;
   and experiment showed that when turned very fast, its apparent
   thickness was no greater. The greatest possible range of vibrations
   o Ithe disk at its circumference could not, therefore, be more than
   •015 inch on either side of the position of rest.
       Again, it was ascertained by means of the note given by this disk,
  that it vibrates about 250 times per second.
       Let us suppose the whole mass to have the same range of ex
   cursion (this will of course increase the result), the equation of
   vibration (not allowing for loss by viscosity) is
                                #=•015 cos nt,                                ¦

       But   an approximate experiment performed by causing the disk to
    ring,   and noticing how long the sound lasted, would seem to show
    that probably the energy of vibration of the disk diminishes at first,
    and therefore constantly (if it is maintained) at the rate of the whole
    in 3 seconds.     Hence in 30 seconds it loses 10 times as much as the
    whole ; that is to say, in 30 seconds the heat produced cannot be
    greater than that due to the energy produced by the disk falling
    under gravity through        of a foot. Reducing this to its heat-equi
    valent, the greatest possible heat-effect due to vibration during 30
    seconds rapid turning will be less than                -                •

          the Heating   of a Disk by rapid Rotation in vacuo.           231
     (2) The thin aluminium disk was out of truth about "02 inch on
 each side.     Its note of vibration was as nearly as possible one octave
 lower than that of the thick disk, while its coefficient of viscosity was
 somewhat greater, say in the proportion of 3 to 2, than that of the
 thick disk.     On the supposition that the heat generated is due to
 vibration, if we call the neat generated during 30 seconds in the thick
 disk =1, then that generated during the same time in the thin disk
 ought to be
 where the first factor is on account of difference of time of vibration,
 the second on account of difference of range, the third on account of
 difference of mass, and the fourth on account of difference of viscosity.
     But the heating effect (as far as quantity of heat is concerned) pro
 duced in the thin disk is as nearly as possible the same as that pro
 duced in the thick disk.
     This fact is therefore against the hypothesis that the heating
 effect is due to vibration.
     (3) In order to estimate the effect (if any) of want of truth in the
 disk, the thick aluminium disk was purposely put out of truth about
 3| times its usual amount ; but the heating effect was as nearly as
 possible the same in both cases, being 32 divisions of the scale in both.
    On all these grounds it would appear that the heating effect cannot
 be due to vibration of the disk.
    21. It is hardly necessary to mention that the heating effect cannot
 be due to radiation and convection from the wheelwork, which is
 no doubt slightly heated during the experiment, for the mass of this
 metallic matter is so great, that we cannot imagine it to be heated
more than 1° Fahr.        Now the radiation from this against the back
of the disk may certainly be neglected, while the convection must be
very small, since in the experiments the pressure of the air was very
small.     Besides, the heating effect, as will be seen shortly, was found
to be independent of the pressure.
    22. It has thus been shown that the disk is heated during the
experiment, and that this heating effect —
    (1) Is not due to rotation under the earth's magnetic force ;
    (2) Is not due to conduction of heat from the bearings ;
    (3) Nor to radiation or convection from the wheelwork
    (4) Nor to vibrations of the disk.
And in view of the large and constant nature of this heating effect
it may be asserted that it cannot be sensibly due, either to one of
these causes singly, or to their combined effect.
    23. It will now be shown that the heating effect is independent
both of the density and chemical constitution of the residual air
and vapour around the disk.
   In art. 16, if we compare together the 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th,
and 12th sets of experiments, we shall see that the heating effect was
sensibly the same, whether the residual gas was atmospheric air,
or hydrogen or coal-gas.

232                           Royal Society.
    As hydrogen diffuses very quickly, it might perhaps be supposed
that when heated by rotation it might find access to the pile through
the rock-salt cover more easily than heated atmospheric air, so that
while the whole effect might appear the same in hydrogen as in air,
yet only part of that in hydrogen might be due to radiant heat,
the remainder being due to heated gas which had obtained access to
the pile.    This was, however, disproved by an experiment, which
showed that by blackening the interior of the cone, the effect upon
the pile was just as much diminished in a hydrogen vacuum as in
an air vacuum ; and hence in both cases the whole effect is due to
radiant heat.
    But, besides the residual gas, it may with truth be supposed that
there is always more or less of aqueous vapour, and also a little of the
vapour of oil, and perhaps of the vapour of mercury in the receiver.
As regards the hygrometric state of the residual air and its influence on
 the disk, this would appear to be of the following nature : —
    (1) When the vacuum has just been made, there is generally a
hygrometric difference between the air and the surface of the disk, on
account of which there is a strictly temporary effect, either in the
direction of heat or cold, at the surface of the disk, owing probably to
condensation or evaporation of small quantities of aqueous vapour ;
but this effect disappears the moment the motion is stopped, leaving
behind the permanent effect apparently unaltered.
    (2) This temporary effect disappears when the disk has been left
for some hours in the vacuum.
    Next, with regard to vapour of oil, we cannot suppose its effect to
be so large or so different in character and constancy from that of
 aqueous vapour as to account for the effect observed.        Add to this
 that the effect takes place with an uncoated metallic disk probably
to the same extent as with a coated one.        The same remark may be
 made with regard to vapour of mercury.         The effect would therefore
 appear to be independent of the chemical nature of the residual gas
and vapour around the disk.
    In order to prove that this effect is also independent of the pres
 sure of the residual gas, it is only necessary to refer to the whole
 body of experiments which have been described, to see that between
 4 inches and 0"25 inch there is no perceptible variation in the effect
 observed.
    24. The following generalization may now be made : —
    (1)  If a perfectly true aluminium disk (without vibrations) be
 made to rotate in a vertical plane at the earth's surface, after the
 manner herein described, there will be an increase of the tempera
 ture of the disk, which is not due to communication of heat from
 the bearings or machinery, nor to the earth's magnetic force.
    (2) This heating effect is independent of the density and chemical
 constitution of the residual air and vapour which surround the disk.
    (3) It is probable that the quantity of heat developed in disks of
 similar extent of surface and similar circumstances of motion is the
 same.    For, in the first place, the quantity of heat developed in three
 aluminium disks, "05, "0375, -025 of an inch in thickness respect

                             Geological Society.                      233
ively, would appear to be the same, the relative thermometric effect
for these disks varying inversely as their thickness, and being in the
following proportions, 30, 43, 60, as determined by one complete set
of experiments.
     Again, the quantity of heat developed in the thick aluminium disk,
with its surfaces both uncoated, was probably the same as when one
surface was coated and one left bare, or as when both surfaces were
coated.
     25. The authors will not attempt here a further generalization,
but they would desire to make one remark.            In absence of definite
knowledge of       the nature  of  that medium which transmits radiant
light and heat, it might be supposed possible that when a radiant
body is in rapid motion, the intensity of its radiation is somewhat
 increased. But if we bear in mind that in these experiments the
 effect was observed      after bringing the disk to rest, and that the
 temporary effect during rotation sometimes observed can probably
 be otherwise accounted for, we are forced to conclude that, as far
 as we may judge from these experiments (and they are of a very
 delicate nature), there is no perceptible effect of motion upon radi
 ation.
  . In conclusion the authors desire to say that they are much in
  debted to Mr. Beckley, who not only invented the apparatus, but
  assisted at all the experiments, and without whom they could not
  have been performed in a manner so satisfactory.       They are also in
  debted to Mr. Atkinson for his kindness in lending them a large
  gasometer, and to Mr. Browning and Mr. Ladd for exceedingly true
  aluminium and ebonite disks.

      '*
         On the age of the Lower Brick -earths of the Thames Valley."
   By    W.  Boyd Dawkins, M.A. (Oxon.), F.G.S.
      The Lower Brick-earths of the Thames Valley have been a fertile
  source of discussion since the year 1836, — Dr. Falconer considering
   them to be anterior in age to the Boulder-clay, Mr. Prestwich be
  lieving them to belong to the Low-level series of Quaternary de
  posits.     The author divides the evidence upon this question into
  two     heads — Physical and Palaeontological. The sections at Ilford,
   Grays,   Thurrock,   Crayford, and Erith evince the same sequence of
   deposits.    At the bottom of all are the fluviatile Brick-earths and
   Gravels, whence the Mollusca and Mammalia are derived, and which
   are remarkable for the horizontality of their bedding and the even
   sorting of the component parts.       Lying on the eroded top of these
   is a deposit (the trail of Mr. Fisher) of a highly confused nature,

   £34            Intelligence- and Miscellaneous      Articles.
   containing stones, often with their long axes arched, and never
   sorted by the action of water.          It contains also many stones and
   boulders that could only have been floated to their present situation
   by ice.   It is as remarkable for the contortion of its bedding as the
  deposits below are for their horizontality.          On its uneven summit
   rests the surface-soil, which is the mere rain-wash of the neighbour
  hood. These three deposits indicate three epochs : — first, that of the
  Brick-earths, in which the water was unencouritered by floating ice ;
  then that of the trail, which is probably a mere ice-wash formed
  under a glacial climate; and lastly, the rain-wash, formed under
  temperate conditions.         The date of the excavation of the Thames
  Valley being uncertain, and also the fact of the Boulder-clay sea
  having extended into it being non-proven, it is possible that the
  trail, or ice-wash, may be the subaerial equivalent of the Boulder-
  clay, and that consequently the Brick-earths may be preglacial. The
  palaeontological evidence is also very important in deciding their age.
  The presence of Elephas priscus and Rhinoceros megarhinus indicates
  the affinity of this group of deposits to those of Preglacial age on
  the Norfolk shore, and to the foreign Pliocenes.             The tichorhine
  and leptorhine Rhinoceros, on the other hand, point towards de
  posits of clearly defined Postglacial age.        The beds under considera
  tion are also as remarkable for the absence of some as for the
 presence of others of the Pleistocene mammals.                The preglacial
  Trogonthere,    Rhinoceros     etruscus,  Elephas  meridionalis, Sorex mos-
  chatus, and Cervus dicranios are absent on the one hand, the entire
  group of Postglacial Arctic Mammalia on the other — and especially,
 among these latter, the Reindeer.            From these premises it follows
 that the beds in question, as affording remains in part peculiar to
 the forest- bed of Norfolk and the Pliocenes of France and Italy, and
 in part to the postglacial deposits, occupy a middle point in time
 between the two, being more modern than the former and more
 ancient than the latter.        For these reasons the author suggests the
 insertion of the group of deposits in the classified list of Pleistocene
 deposits as follows : — (1) Forest-bed of Norfolk — climate temperate ;
 (2) Lower Brick-earths of the Thames Valley — climate temperate ;
 (3) Glacial deposit — climate severe ; Postglacial deposits — climate
 severe, but gradually becoming temperate.

ON THE SPECTRA OF THE METEORS OF NOVEMBER                      13-14, 1866.
                          BY JOHN BROWNING, ESQ.
^1^0 view the shower I chose the observatory of Mr. H. Barnes, at
  JL Upper Holloway. The situation was good, the observatory being
built on high ground and so placed that the radiant-point rose in the
contrary direction to the lights of London.
     I devoted my attention exclusively to attempting to obtain the
spectra of as many meteors as possible.

                 Intelligence  andMiscellaneous     Articles.           235
    After catching a few spectra in different directions, I at length
decided on keeping the direct-vision prism pointed a little to the
west of Leo Major, with the axis of the prism parallel to the horizon.
The spectra which 1 saw were those of meteors which started from
the radiant-point and passed through the belt of Orion.           Of course
the number of meteors which came into my field was comparatively
limited ; but the whole of them travelled in a direction parallel to the
axis of the prism, a condition essential in the observation of the
spectra.
     From the rapid flight of the meteors rendering the spectra very
 difficult to catch, I cannot pretend to speak with confidence of the
appearance of the spectra shown by the prism ; but I saw a great
difference between the spectra. I believe that I saw spectra of the
following kinds : —
     A. Continuous spectra, or those in which the whole of the colours
of the solar spectrum were visible excepting the violet rays.
     B. Spectra in which the yellow greatly preponderated, but which
 in every other respect resembled those above described.
     C. Spectra of almost purely homogeneous yellow light, but with
 a faint continuous spectrum — that is, a faint trace of red on one side
 and green on the opposite side of the yellow portion of the spectrum.
     D. Spectra of purely homogeneous green light ; of this kind I
 only saw two.
     I observed through the prism spectra of several trains. The light,
 which was mostly blue, green, or steel-grey, generally appeared ho
 mogeneous ; but thi§ may have arisen from the light having been too
 faint to produce a visible spectrum.        Stars below the second or third
 magnitude, although visible through the prism, fail from this cause
 to give spectra in which blue and red are perceptible.
     It will probably, be remarked that I have not spoken of having
  observed any lines in the spectra. All the nuclei seemed to give
  continuous spectra which contained the whole of the colours of the
  spectrum ; what I should term the tails, not the trains, of the nuclei
  presented the appearances I have described. In every instance I
  remarked that orange-yellow appeared to preponderate over the
  other colours in the continuous spectra. When a prism only is used,
  it seems to me impossible that any sharply-defined lines should be
  shown.     Still, from differences in the colours of spectra, some infor
  mation may, I think, be obtained.         As is well known, chemists and
  mineralogists    infer the presence  of certain elements in the substance
  under analysis from the colour communicated by the substance to
  the blowpipe-flame.       Thus, if the flame become yellow, they suspect
  the presence of sodium ; red, strontium ; green, barium or thallium ;
  lavender, potassium. The prism will do more than this ; it will show
  if the flame contains even a faint trace of any other colour, while
  without the prism the faint colour would be completely masked by
  the colour which predominates.          From the difficulty of catching
  meteors within such a narrow space, I fear it will be found impossible
  to use a prism provided with a slit formed by a pair of knife-edges
   so as to define any lines.     But I think it may be possible to use a

 236             Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
 prism in connexion with a cylindrical lens. Such an arrangement
 would be capable of showing well-defined lines if the observed me
 teors contained any elements which would give bright lines in an
 ordinary spectroscope. —Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical
 Society, January 11, 1867.
    EXPERIMENTS ON THE EXPANSION OF SUPERHEATED                STEAM.
                   BY MM. G. A. HIRN AND A. CAZIN.
    We have proposed to ourselves to treat experimentally the follow
 ing question : — Steam being superheated (that is, brought to a cer
 tain tension, and at a pressure less than the maximum tension cor
 responding to this temperature), it is made to undergo a certain
 expansion, during which it neither gains nor loses heat, it remains
 superheated and overcomes a pressure equal at each moment to its
 elastic force ; required to determine under these conditions the
 final temperature and pressure. The following is the principle of
 our method.
    The vapour being contained in a reservoir under a pressure greater
 than that of the atmosphere, a large orifice is opened, by which a
jet suddenly rushes out. We may suppose a certain surface which
 separates the vapour into two parts ; one of these parts is completely
 expelled, the other exactly fills the reservoir at the end of the flow;
 and its elastic force has, during the expansion, always held in equi
 librium the external pressure on its surface, so that this part of the
 surface is under the given conditions.     It is enough to ascertain the
 final temperature and pressure of this part.     When the flow ceases,
 the pressure sought is equal to that of the atmosphere, and the tem
 perature has to be found.    For this purpose it is to be observed that
 three cases may present themselves : the vapour remaining in the re
 servoir may (1) be still superheated, (2) have exactly attained the
 state of saturation, (3) be supersaturated.       In the first case the
final pressure is less than the maximum tension corresponding to
the final temperature ; in the second the final pressure is equal to
 this tension ; in the third the final pressure is the same, but part of
 the vapour condenses, forming a visible mist in the reservoir if it is
 provided with parallel glass plates. By varying either the initial
pressure or the initial temperature, so that the mist gradually dimi
nishes, it ultimately disappears ; and then we have the expansion
under conditions very nearly corresponding to the second case.
Taking the pressure of the atmosphere as the maximum tension of
the vapour, the corresponding temperature is found from Regnault's
Tables, and is thus obtained with a certain approximation.          Thus
there is no thermometer : the vapour in expanding indicates to us
its own temperature when it becomes cloudy, and we have only to
observe under what circumstances this cloudiness ceases to be pro
duced. This new method is sufficiently delicate ; by its means we
have been enabled to resolve the question proposed with an unlooked-
for success.

                Intelligence   and Miscellaneous     Articles.           237
   The reservoir with parallel glass plates is that of the Scientific
Association of France, which one of us had constructed for another
research at the Paris Observatory, made under the auspices of M.
Le Verrier. It consists essentially of a horizontal copper cylinder,
of a capacity of about 7 litres, with glass plates at its extremities,
and heated by an oil bath. To this cyclinder we fitted a large stop
cock, of 4 square centimetres aperture, for the escape of the steam.
The duration of the flow was so small that the heating-action of the
sides during the expansion could be neglected.            To this apparatus
we connected a steam-boiler, of a capacity of 180 litres, so large
that it was easy to maintain a constant pressure, and, lastly, a
manometer arranged so that all the measurements               were accurate.
The experiments were made last September, in the manufactory of
Haussman, Jordan, Hirn, and Co., at Logelbach, near Colmar.
   The oil bath being at a given temperature, and the water in the
boiler at a lower one, a quantity of vapour was driven through the
cylinder sufficient to expel all the air. The escape stopcock was
closed, the pressure kept constant, and the tube from the boiler to
the cylinder heated so that the vapour of the latter was well dried.
Both the pressure and the temperature of the oil bath were noted.
Closing the communication, and opening the large stopcock, a
screen of paper brightly illuminated, or a mirror reflecting the day
light, was looked at through the glass plates. The experiment was
repeated at the same temperature, but with different initial pressures.
Supposing that we start from a pretty strong pressure, we observe a
thick mist.       Working then at decreasing pressures, the mist
diminishes, passes through a series of stages, and ultimately appears
no more ; the limit sought has then been exceeded.                Increasing
the pressure, the mist is again found ;- and by repeating the observa
tions under pressures alternately increasing and decreasing, we can
ultimately estimate the original pressure corresponding to the limit
sought with an absolute error of         of an atmosphere.

with observed facts. It is sufficient to add to the equation express

produced, another equation which replaces Mariotte's and Gay-

strated from the principles of thermodynamics (G. A. Hirn, Exposi

existence of internal work in the expansion of vapour, but they also
confirm one of the consequences      of the new theory, and give a
means of measuring internal work. — Comptes Rendus, Dec. 31, 1866.
 INDUCTION-CURRENTS  ON TWISTING JRON WIRES     THROUGH
   WHICH A GALVANIC CURRENT IS PASSED. BY G. WIEDEMANN.
    The twistings of the molecular magnets in magnetic bars effected
by torsion may give rise to induction-currents which traverse the
.bars in the direction of their axis, or circulate in a spiral in the axis
 of which the bar is fastened.    Both these phenomena have been used
by Wertheim and by Matteucci to determine the changes in the
temporary and permanent magnetic moment of iron and steel bars in
 torsion —which may, however, be more accurately and completely
effected by direct measurement of the magnetism of the bars by the
 deflection of a steel mirror suspended in front of them.
    In the same manner induction-currents are formed if an iron wire
is twisted through which a galvanic current is either passing or has
been passed.     As a supplement to my earlier experiments on similar
matters, I beg to communicate a few experiments made in this
 direction.
    1. Between a brass clamp fastened on a board, and a second clamp
provided with a divided circle, which could turn in a bearing screwed
 on the table, a well-annealed iron wire of 1*3 millim. diameter^ind
400 millims. in length was stretched. The wire was surrounded by
a spiral of copper wire, the ends of which were connected with the
multiplier of a reflecting galvanometer at a distance of 3 millims. from
the torsion-apparatus.     A galvanic current was next passed through
the iron wire, which was twisted by turning the rotating clamp.
 The deflection of the mirror of the galvanometer indicated in this
the formation of an induction-current.         After its occurrence, the
mirror recurred to its former position of rest, proving that the de
flection could not have been directly produced by the magnetization
of the twisted iron wire.
    If the current passed through the iron wire traverses it from the
rotating to the fixed clamp   (*'from back to front "), the current pro

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous     Articles.           239
duced in the coils of the spiral is in the same direction as that of the
rotating clamp-^that is, in the direction of the torsion, and this
whatever the direction of the rotation.           On untwisting the wire
there is an induced current in the opposite direction.        If the direc
tion of the current passed through the wire he reversed, the direction
of the currents produced by torsion and detorsion is changed also.
     If even after opening the current the wire is twisted and untwisted,
induction-currents occur in the surrounding spiral which have the
same direction as the induction-currents on twisting and untwisting
the wire during the passage of the current.
     By the assumption of rotating molecular magnets these phenomena
may be sufficiently explained.        If a current is passed, for instance,
from the rotating to the fixed clamp, the molecular magnets arrange
themselves in such a manner that their north poles are turned towards
 the left of a man swimming in the current on the axis of the wire,
 and even after the cessation of the current they retain this position.
 If now the wire is twisted in the direction of the hands of a watch,
 for instance, for an observer standing in front of the clamp, according
 to earlier observations the molecular magnets will turn their south
 poles to the posterior end of the wire at the clamp, by which the
 wire also acquires a south pole.      Hence an induction-current must
 be formed in the induction-spiral, which would impart to the wire an
 opposite polarity, and must traverse the wire therefore in the same
 direction as that in which the rotation of the clamp has taken place;
 in untwisting, the molecular magnets return to their original posi
 tion, and a current in the opposite direction is produced, which would
 of itself prevent them from doing this.       Inverting the direction of
 the current passed through the wire, or of the torsion, an ignited
 wire was clamped, as before, in the torsion-apparatus, and a galvanic
  current passed through it. After opening the latter, the fixed and
 the rotating clamp between which the wire was stretched were con
 nected with the multiplier of a mirror galvanometer.           If the wire
  was now twisted either in one direction or the other, the deviation
 of the magnetic mirror again indicated the occurrence of induction-
 currents.     The direction of these currents is always the same as the
  direction of the current previously passed through the wire, whatever
  be the direction of the torsion.     Hence in a certain sense the cur
  rent which had been passed through the wire occurred again on
  twisting.    If now the wire was untwisted, a new induction-current
  was formed in the opposite direction.
      The formation of these induction-currents also can be deduced
  without difficulty.     By the current which is passed through the iron
  wire its molecular magnets are placed transversely, with their axes
  at right angles to the axis of the wire.      If now the wire is twisted,
  the molecular magnets are deflected on one side or the other from
  their transversal position, and at the same time an induction-current
  must be formed which of itself would bring them back into that po
  sition — that is, having the same direction as the current previously
 passed through the wire.       As, on untwisting, the molecular magnets

 240              Intelligence and Miscellaneous      Articles.
 return more or less completely to their transversal position, the induc
 tion-current thereby formed must have such a direction that it opposes
 this motion, and must thus be in an opposite direction to the cur
rent passed through the wire. — PoggendorfF s Annalen, Dec. 1866.
          APPLICATION OF THE TUNING-FORK TO HOROLOGY.
                         BY M. NIAUDET-BREGUET.
    M. Duhamel, and         several  physicists  after him, have    used the
iuning-fork for measuring small intervals of time.           Following their
steps,   I have proposed to myself to prolong indefinitely the vibra
tions of a tuning-fork by clockwork.
    The apparatus I have constructed consists, like an ordinary clock,
of two parts, a clockwork and an apparatus for isochronous oscilla
tions, acting on each other by the intervention of an escapement.
The tuning-fork regulates the rate of the clockwork, which in turn
gives at each vibration a small impulse to the tuning-fork, necessary
for prolonging its oscillatory motion.        The clockwork, by means of
needles on the axes and turning in front of dials, renders it possible
to count the vibrations of the fork.
    The most accurate method of controlling the regularity of an in
strument of this kind consists in comparing the regulating tuning-
fork with a free one, by M. Lissajous's optical methods. I have
thus been able to confirm the agreement of the two forks once set
going, the free tuning-fork being put in vibration by the hand each
time the comparison is to be renewed.           The accord is retained even
if the motive- weight of the apparatus is doubled or tripled.
    The tuning-fork which I used made about 100 single vibrations
(50 double) in a second. I have tried another which made about
200 single vibrations in a second ; and the apparatus worked with
out necessitating any change.          I think it certain that much more
acute tuning-forks might be used, provided the dimensions of the
escapement were suitably diminished.
    It is easily understood that by placing on the limbs of the tuning-
fork two equal symmetrical masses, the rapidity of the vibrations
will be diminished ; and it is easy to conceive arrangements by
which all velocities between two extreme limits can be obtained.
    I think the principle of the instrument might be very useful in
chronoscopic experiments — that is to say, those destined to measure
small intervals of time.       It might also be used for giving a uniform
motion to various apparatus of registration or observation which are
employed in the sciences.           Lastly, it gives synchronism to two
rapid clockwork movements, which has not yet been realized, and
which is frequently wanted in telegraphic and other applications. —

XXXIII.     On the Propagation of Electricity in highly Rarefied
   Elastic Fluids, and in particular on the Stratifications of the
   Electric Light in very rare media*. By Professor A. de la
   Rive f.
                    § 1. General Considerations.
      was long supposed that whereas gases oppose a greater or
IT    less resistance to the passage of electricity, a vacuum con
ducts it very well.     The use of Ruhmkorff's induction-coil, by
supplying a better and more certain means of studying the pro
pagation of electricity in rarefied gases, has shown that the pre
sence in a space of the smallest quantity of ponderable matter
in the shape of an elastic fluid is sufficient to enable this propa
gation to take place, but that an absolute vacuum prevents it
entirely. The demonstrative proof of this important principle is
due essentially to the conclusive experiments of Mr. Gassiot ;
although previously, if not completely admitted, it was at least
foreseen as an indirect consequence of earlier investigations J.
   * These researches form part of a more extended investigation into the
propagation of electricity hy highly rarefied elastic fluids, which has ap
peared in the Memoires dela Societede Physique et d'Histoire Naturelle de
Geneve, vol. xvii. p. 59, and an abstract of which has been published in the
Comptes Rendus de V AcadHmie des Sciences de Paris for April 13, 1863. I
now publish them with some additions; and I shall also publish in an
early Number of the Archives another part of the same investigation,
which  I have completed since the first publication, and which relates to the
action of magnetism on electric discharges which are traversing highly rare
fied gaseous media. — A. de  la    Rive.

242        Prof. De la Rive   on the    Propagation of Electricity
Mr. Gassiot      has succeeded in giving a direct and rigorous
proof   of this principle, by producing an almost absolute vacuum
in tubes previously filled with rarefied carbonic acid, by intro
ducing into them a fragment of potash which was allowed to cool
after having been heated.
    The talented English physicist has since obtained a confirma
tion of his first results by using a water-battery of high tension
instead of the induced current of RuhnikorfFs apparatus*.             It
may therefore be regarded         as  completely proved    that an abso
lute vacuum does not permit the passage of electricity, and that
 this passage can only take place through the agency of a ponde
 rable medium.       This medium may be of extreme tenuity, it is
 true ; but its presence is not therefore the less essential for the
 transmission of electricity.
    Thus elastic fluids, which had long been considered such
imperfect conductors of electricity that they were classed among
insulators along with glass or resin, are capable, when reduced
to a sufficient degree of rarefaction, of transmitting electric dis
charges of sufficient force to affect a magnetized needle, and to
be acted upon in their turn by magnets in the same way as vol
taic currents.
    The transmission of electricity through elastic fluids presents
 certain special characteristics which render it one of the most
 important physical phenomena.
    In the first place, the fact that gases do not conduct electri
city until they are reduced to a certain degree of rarefaction, ap
 pears at first sight incompatible with the principle that an abso
lute vacuum is a non-conductor ; for if electricity is propagated
by matter, it seems as if the propagation ought to take place so
 much the more easily in proportion as the matter is in larger
 quantity.     It is not so, however ; and experiment shows that
 between a vacuous space and a space filled with gas at the
 atmospheric pressure, there is a degree of rarefaction of the gas
 (for example 2"5 millims. for hydrogen) at which it possesses a
maximum of conductivity or a minimum of resistance ; and this
appears to prove that the mutual disposition of the particles, in
 dependently of their particular nature, exerts great influence on
 the conducting-power of the gaseous medium.
    Another not less important characteristic of the propagation
 of electricity through elastic fluids is the production of strise, or
 the stratification of the electric light, which occurs when the
 gaseous medium is brought to such a degree of rarefaction that
 the discharge or current passes easily. -This stratification was
 attributed at first to the employment of induced currents, and to
 the opposition of the currents succeeding each other in contrary

directions, which occurs under these circumstances.           But several
physicists, and particularly Mr. Gassiot, have obtained this phe
nomenon by means of the electricity of the ordinary electrical
machine, and still better with that of a battery of high tension,
in which cases there could be discharges and currents in one di
rection only.
    Mr. Gassiot has found, by studying these strife in a great
number of tubes containing vapours or gases more or less rare
fied, that their number, colour, form, and mutual position depend
upon the degree of rarefaction of the elastic fluid and upon the
power of the battery.       If a column of distilled water, the length
of which can be varied by bringing closer together or separating
to a greater distance two platinum wires which dip into               in           it,   is
 troduced into the circuit of the battery, all the above-mentioned
 variations in the stratification of the electric light can be pro
 duced in one and the same Geissler's tube,                           by
                                                         altering in this
 way   the total resistance  of  the circuit.   These  appearances vary
 so regularly with the amount of tension, that they may serve to
 indicate the degree of tension in        closed circuit, just as the di
                                               a

 phenomenon of the propagation of electricity                         by
                                                         gaseous media.
     In 1863 made some preliminary researches upon the con-
                I
 ducting-power of some of the gases, and more particularly of
 hydrogen, nitrogen, and atmospheric air;            perceived the great
                                                                I
 superiority in this respect of hydrogen to the other gases           and           ;
I   showed that, when brought to such          degree of rarefaction that
                                                      a
 their conductivity was near its maximum, columns of these three
 gases obeyed the same laws as the best conductors, with reference
 to the influence of their length and diameter upon the intensity
 of the electricity transmitted.      Since then, M. Morren has pub
 lished* the results of careful examination of this question, and
                               a
  has given for several gases the pressure at which each of them
  possesses its maximum conductivity.
     But, in order to complete this investigation, there are still
  some determinations wanting, and some points which call for
  further examination, particularly the influence of temperature,
  and that of the presence of different vapours in the rarefied gases.
  Thisis     subject with which      am at present occupied, and
                                        I                             will

  244        Prof. De la Rive    on the  Propagation of Electricity
  results which    I have succeeded in obtaining while studying the
  propagation    of electricity in metallic vapour3, and which, although
  still far from complete, are not without interest. But previously
  it is necessary that I should shortly indicate the process which         I
  have employed in my experiments for generating and for mea
  suring the electricity.
      The electricity is produced by means of a Ruhmkorff's appa
  ratus of moderate power, worked by two Grove's cells of large
   surface, and a contact-breaker of the ordinary construction.           It
  is true that the electricity thus produced consists of two dis
   charges successively in opposite directions ; hence, if the circuit
   which the discharges have to traverse is composed of good con
   ductors only, such as metallic wires, or even distilled water, no
   deflection is produced by them on a galvanometer, since, the cur
   rents being alternately of equal intensity in opposite directions,
   and succeeding each other very rapidly, the effect of their joint
   action is that they neutralize one another.         But if the circuit
   contains an elastic fluid, even very much rarefied, the resistance
   which this fluid opposes to the passage of the two successive
   discharges causes one of them to predominate, so that the result
   ing phenomena are such as would be produced by a series of
   discharges all taking place in the same direction.          This differ
   ence arises from the mode of construction of the [apparatus,
   which causes the two induced currents, though equal to each
   other in quantity, to be of unequal tension ; .so that when an
   imperfect conductor,      such as a gas more or less rarefied, is placed
  in the circuit, only one of the currents is transmitted (or at least
  it is transmitted in much greater force than the other) , and hence
   the series of currents have all one and the same direction.
      In order to measure the intensity of the transmitted currents,
   a glass trough, 20.centims. long by 5 wide and 3 deep, contain
   ing distilled water, is placed in the circuit which they are required
   to traverse ; two platinum plates, fixed one at each end of the
  trough and having a surface exactly equal to the transverse sec
  tion of the water, serve to establish a connexion between this
  water and the rest of the circuit.        Two platinum wires inserted
_ into glass tubes are held vertically by firm supports, so that their
  lower ends dip into the distilled water — these ends projecting
  only a millimetre beyond the glass, so as to form a pair of " Wol-
  Jaston's points," — while the upper ends are connected with the
   two terminals of a galvanometer the wire of which is well insu
  lated. The supports which hold the platinum wires are moveable
  along a divided scale ; so that the ends which dip into the water
  can be brought as near together as possible, or can be separated
  by nearly the whole length of the trough. The distance between
  the platinum-points is regulated by a micrometer-screw,            and is

                  in highly Rarefied Elastic Fluids.               245
thus known within a tenth of a millimetre. These two points
lead off an almost inappreciable proportion of the current which
traverses the distilled water, but a quantity which is nevertheless
sufficient to act very distinctly on the magnetic needle.         For a
constant strength of the principal current, the intensity of the
derived current depends on the distance between the two points;
and hence, if the intensity of the principal current varies, the dis
tance to which it is at any time needful to separate the two points
in order that the indication of the galvanometer may remain con
stant is a measure of the proportionate strength of the corre
sponding derived current, and therefore gives, by a relation
which is easily found, the intensity of the total current.
                          I
    The apparatus that have employed to study the propagation
of electricity by metallic vapours consists of a large glass globe
provided with four tubulures and supported on a foot.          The two
tubulures which are at the extremities of the horizontal diameter
are provided with stuffing- boxes, through which pass metallic
rods fitted with points of metal or of carbon, between which the
voltaic arc can be produced by means of a battery of sixty or
eighty Bunscn's cells.       The two tubulures situated at the extre
mities of the vertical diameter allow of the passage of two brass
rods terminated by metallic balls, between which the discharge
of the HuhmkorfFs apparatus passes at the same time.              After
exhausting    the  globe,  it is filled with well-dried  nitrogen, and
this is rarefied till its pressure becomes from 2 to 3 millims. ;
the electric discharge is then allowed to pass, and its intensity is
measured by the process of derivation that I have just described.
    After having ascertained that this intensity is constant, the
horizontal metallic points are brought near each other, so as to
set up the voltaic arc, which acts here simply as a source of heat,
and is kept going for some minutes.          At a certain moment the
intensity of the electric discharge, which is in action at the same
time as the voltaic arc, is observed to increase very considerably.
At the same instant the colour of the discharge, which in the
nitrogen was a dark rose-colour, changes completely, and it
assumes a hue which depends upon the nature of the points
between which the voltaic arc is passing.         This new appearance
lasts for some instants after the arc has ceased; and in fact it
is then that it is most remarkable, for it is no longer affected by
its contrast with the light of the arc.
    The voltaic arc was produced successively between points of
silver, copper, aluminium, zinc, cadmium, and magnesium, and be
tween points of gas-carbon, all these substances being capable of
being volatilized at the high temperature to which they were
subjected.
    With points of silver and zinc, the electric discharge assumes

246         Prof. De la Rive        on the Propagation of Electricity
a very decided blue colour,          but darker with zinc than with silver.
With points        of  copper, cadmium, aluminium, and magnesium
the tint is green, very dark with copper, apple-green with cad
mium, very light green with magnesium, and a whitish green
with aluminium.            With points of gas-carbon, the colour of the
discharge is light blue, and changes to bluish when the arc
ceases; this is owing to the production of a small quantity of
carburetted hydrogen gas.              The effects arc most distinct at the
upper part      of   the   globe, where the vapours resulting from the
voltaic arc collect.          The striae or stratifications of the electric
light are even more marked in these vapours than they are in
rarefied gases.
    The intensity of the electric discharge is increased in conse
quence of the presence of metallic vapours within the globe ; this
increase depends on the nature of the vapour : with silver and
copper it is very considerable, the galvanometer going suddenly
from 30° to 60° at the moment when the change of colour of the
discharge shows that it has begun to be transmitted by the me
tallic vapour.        The increase, though smaller, is still distinct with
aluminium-Vicoouv ; with the vapours oizinc, cadmium, and mag
nesium it is much smaller, namely from 10° to 20° only.                  It is
very large     in   the  case  of  the arc produced by    means of  points of
 gas-carbon, perhaps in consequence of the presence of small
 quantities of carburetted hydrogen gas.
    I have also tried points of iron and platinum : with the former
 I observed certainly a change of colour in the electric discharge
 and a slight increase of its intensity; but with the latter            I ob
 tained nothing more than a very small increasB in the intensity
 of the discharge, which might be due to the influence of the
 enormous elevation of temperature on the conductivity of the
 rarefied nitrogen — an effect, however, which is too slight to exert
 any sensible influence upon the foregoing experiments.
•
     These experiments appear to me to prove, not only that ex
 cessively rarefied metallic vapours have a conducting-power for
 electricity which greatly exceeds that of other elastic fluids, but
 also that this power varies with their nature, and is possessed in
 the highest degree by the vapours of those metals which are
 themselves the best conductors.             As to the appearance of the
 discharge,     its  colour   depends upon the nature of the vapour, and
 is the same as that which the metal yielding the vapour produces
 on combustion ; and, what is of some importance to notice, the
 stratifications arc more distinct than they are in ordinary rarefied
 gases*.
    * I  was not aware, when      I made the experiments upon metallic vapours
which I have just described, that M. Faye had made analogous experiments

     § 2. Investigation       of   the   Stratification of the Electric Light.
     It
      is well known that when the elastic force of a gas through
which an electric discharge is passing is diminished to a certain
point the discharge becomes stratified ; that              is,
                                                       breaks up into
                                                                 it
alternate dark and light slices.      The stratification begins with
the appearance of      few slight strise near the positive electrode;
                          a
then gradually, as the elastic force     diminished, the discharge,
                                                  is
which      at rirst very narrow, expands and the striae become
          is
broader.    Soon afterwards     dark space appears separating the
                                         a
luminous column from the negative electrode, which latter itself                is
surrounded         bluish atmosphere. This atmosphere continues
                   by a
to expand, and the dark space to get longer, in proportion as the
rarefaction of the gas increases.
   The pressure of the gas must be the more diminished, in order
to obtain the stratification of the electric light, the greater the
resistance which the gas offers to the transmission of electricity.
Thus, with hydrogen, even with        pressure of 18 millimetres, the
                                              a
electric discharge, which as yet consists merely of     narrow rose-  a
coloured vein, of     or  8 millims. diameter,
                                  4                 seen to separate

into sharply defined circular slices, alternately dark and bright,
and  \   niillim. in thickness. These striae, which are at first
most distinct at the positive electrode, appear afterwards through
out the luminous vein, whatever may be its length; and as the
pressure diminishes, the discharge spreads out, so as to occupy
the whole width of       tube a  centims. in diameter
                                         5                and at the  ;
same time the thickness of the alternate dark and luminous slices
increases, to such an extent that under      pressure of
                                                       a   millims.       2
it   about
     is       millims.
               5         These slices are annular, as    convinced    I
myself    by
           closing one end of the tube which contained the rare
fied gas    byflat plate of glass, which allowed the inside of the
                 a

dark space may,    as we have said, be seen to form in front of the
negative  electrode,  and to increase in size in proportion as the
pressure diminishes, so as to acquire a length of 10 centims., a
length which is independent of that of the gaseous column.
Nevertheless, on looking attentively at this dark space, we can
discover in         it,
                 beyond     perfectly dark and sharply limited slice
                               a

                                               a          pale rose-a
colour, which      visible only in complete darkness.
                        is                               This glow,
which has the form of cone whose base

luminous column, does not appear until the pressure has become
very low, much less than that at which the dark space shows
itself;   it   is
              accompanied           by
                                the appearance in the same dark
space  of some   more  luminous   rings    have counted as many as
                                                     (I
four of them), at unequal distances from each other, whose im
mobility and sharply marked outlines contrast with the agitated
striae of the rest of the discharge.    It should be added that the
luminous and stratified part of the discharge, which         far theis   by
longest,   isseparated from the dark or lambent part more sharply
and distinctly the stronger the electric discharge.
    The bluish atmosphere also which surrounds the negative
electrode increases in extent considerably as the pressure                    di
minishes, and nearly at the same rate as the striae.     At the same
time its brilliance becomes less vivid, and its outer margin less
sharply defined.      This bluish atmosphere, which at first enve
lopes only the negative knob, at last, in proportion as the pres
sure becomes less, surrounds the whole length of the metallic
rod which carries the knob — that         unless   is,
                                                    has been coated

with  a   layer of some insulating substance.      This phenomenon
indicates, on the part of negative electricity, great facility of
flowing out into the surrounding medium when this medium                      is
rarefied.
    The agitation of the striae of the luminous part of the dis
charge becomes very considerable under the small pressure of                  2
millims.        shows itself at first very vividly near the positive
               It
electrode, whence the luminous discharge issues in the form of
a  cone very much opened out, which as the pressure diminishes
becomes more and more cylindrical, until         assumes completely
                                                          it

is  occupied      the electrode, while at the same time the agitation
of the striae becomes general throughout the whole extent of the
discharge.
  When the discharge       caused to take place in
                               is                       cylindrical a

cupying  the centre  of the ring as negative electrode, the bluish
atmosphere which surrounds the knob spreads out several centi-

bristles with greatly elongated little filaments which form a sort of
projecting tui't. These filaments are probably formed by the series
of molecules which transmit the discharge.            They are much
 more distinct in the case of hydrogen (the best of gaseous con
 ductors) than with other gases.         If the knob is employed as
positive    electrode,  it is surrounded   by a bright rose-coloured
halo (about a centimetre in diameter) which shows very distinct
 stratifications ; next comes a dark annular space terminating at
 the ring, which is in its turn completely enveloped by a light-
violet opalescent sheath.
    Nitrogen presents just the same phenomena as hydrogen, ex
cept that the stratification of the electric light does not begin till
 a much lower pressure is reached.        In a long tube (1 metre in
length), the agitation of the strise under a pressure of 2 millims.
is even greater than with hydrogen ; the strise seem to form a
 helix animated by a movement of rotation about its axis; the
 light also is brighter, and peach-coloured instead of pale rose;
 and altogether the phenomenon is very brilliant.          In other re
 spects, there is the same dark space near the negative electrode,
 the same faint rose-coloured       glow in this dark space under a
 pressure of 1 to 2 millims., and the same appearance of a kind of
 mist, and of sharply defined motionless rings of greater bright
ness than the surrounding space.
    Atmospheric air behaves like nitrogen ;     I have only found that
the strife are less strongly agitated, and that the light is not of
 so dark a rose-colour as in the latter gas.
                              I
    The appearances that have described are accordingly, with
 the exception of slight differences of tint, exactly the same in
 hydrogen, nitrogen, and atmospheric air; they are the same also
whether these gases are dry or whether they contain a greater
 or less quantity of the vapour of water or of alcohol.       The only
differences are that the pressures at which the various pheno
mena are obtained, and the tint of the light which accompanies
them, differ with the nature of the rarefied elastic fluid.       These
 effects, therefore, cannot be attributed to an electro-chemical de
 composition (which could not take place in a well-dried elemen
 tary gas), nor to any action depending upon the chemical nature
 of the elastic fluid. They are evidently the result of a mecha
nical action which accompanies the transmission of electricity, as
was first suggested by M. Riess, who showed that an analogous
phenomenon is presented, under a slightly different form, by
liquids and solids.
    The phenomenon, in the' case of elastic fluids, must consist of
alternate condensations and rarefactions of the gaseous medium,
produced by the always more or less discontinuous series of dis
charges which constitute the electric jet.        In fact, whether the

250           Prof. De la Rive   on the   Propagation       of Electricity
 stratifications    are produced by a Ruhmkorff's apparatus, or by
  an ordinary electrical machine, or an Armstrong's hydroelectric
  machine, or even by a battery of high tension, we never get a
  continuous discharge, but only a series of separate discharges,
  which may, it is true, succeed each other so rapidly that their
  discontinuity is not indicated by a galvanometer; but this dis
  continuity nevertheless exists, as Mr. Gassiot showed by means
  of a Grove's battery of high tension, which, with the same elec
  trodes and in the same medium, may give rise at first to stratifi
  cations, and afterwards, when the current has become continuous,
  to a voltaic arc.
     Moreover the mechanical action of the series of discharges can
  be directly proved by very distinct oscillations of the mercury
  column of a manometer placed in communication with the elastic
  fluid, which accompany the propagation of electricity through
  this fluid. These oscillations amount to two or three tenths of
  a millimetre in the case of hydrogen under a pressure of 16 mil
 lims.; they begin to be perceptible as soon as the electricity
 passes — that     is, ata  pressure of 36 millims.     they attain their
                                                            ;

 tween 20 and 12 millims., and decrease rapidly when the pres
  sure falls from 12 to      5millims., below which pressure they do
 not occur.      With nitrogen and atmospheric air, the same tube
  (16  centims.   long and in diameter) being used, the oscillations
                             5
 begin    to show  themselves as soon as the electricity passes, namely
  under   a  pressure of about 20 millims.       they attain their maxi

 lims. pressure, and then diminish till the pressure reaches           or    2
3    millims., below which they are no longer sensible.

                             a

      a         I   was unable to detect any perceptible oscillations
 accompanying       the  transmission of electricity, whatever gas was
 contained in the tubes, and to whatever pressure          was subjected.
                                                                it
 Ou the other hand,      I   obtained very distinct oscillations of one
 or two tenths of        a millim. with    ajar 20 centims. in height
 and 16 in diameter, containing hydrogen at pressures varying
 from 30 to 15 millims., through which the electric discharge
passed between       a  central knob and       ring 12 centims. in dia
                                               a
meter concentric with this knob.            This last result shows that'
the absence of oscillations in the long tubes depends less upon
the volume of the gaseous medium, which             not so great in them
                                                       is

effect of the sides of the tubes, which impede the movement of
the gas.      It proves also that the oscillations really result from            a
mechanical action, and. not from          arise of temperature.     As to
the intensity of the oscillations, that evidently depends upon the

                   in highly Rarefied Elastic Fluids.              251
greater or less resistance which the gaseous medium opposes to
the passage of the discharge, since the oscillations are larger
with nitrogen than they are with hydrogen, and they diminish
with the pressure after a certain point, namely that at which the-
discharge is able to take place completely and the intensity of
the oscillations attains its maximum.
     The stratification of the electric light appears, therefore, to be
a phenomenon analogous to the production of sound-waves — that
is to say, a mechanical phenomenon resulting from a succession
 of isochronous impulses acting upon a column of rarefied gas,
 and produced by the series of electric discharges following each
 other in very rapid succession.       A further confirmation of this
 view is afforded by the disturbance of the stratifications caused
 by a displacement of the gaseous matter and the consequent
 alteration of the equilibrium of the elastic fluid in which the
 stratifications appear.     In order to produce such a disturbance,
 it is sufficient to introduce into the tube containing the rarefied
 elastic fluid an additional quantity of the same gas, so as to in
 crease the pressure by 4, or at most       \ a millimetre.    The fol
 lowing is what takes place with hydrogen, the effects being the
 same    with tubes 15, 50, or 100 centims. in length.
      First of all the gas is rarefied as far as 2 millims., so as to
 produce the phenomenon of stratifications in as marked a manner
  as possible.     A small quantity of hydrogen is then allowed to
 enter.    If  the gas enters near the negative electrode, striated
  slices of a beautiful rose-colour are immediately seen to form in
  the dark space ; their diameter is the same as that of the strati
  fied column — that is to say, of the tube ; but they are very narrow
  and very sharp.       They advance gradually into the tube, be
  coming mixed up with the original much wider and less well-
  defined striae ; then, on stopping the entrance of the gas, the
  luminous column is seen to recede slowly from the negative
  electrode, and gradually to resume its first appearance.        When
  the gas enters near the positive electrode, in place of striae occu
  pying the whole width of the tube, there appears a brilliant jet
  of very small diameter (2 or 3 millims.) sharply striated, and
  exactly like a small spiral spring, which advances along the axis
  of the tube in the comparatively dark interior of the luminous
  column, which last, when the gas begins to enter at the positive
  electrode as well as at the negative, immediately advances so as
  to occupy the whole of the dark space as far as the negative
  electrode, from which it is separated only by a stratum of 2 mil
  lims. in thickness which it cannot pass. Afterwards, when the
  entrance of the gas is arrested, everything soon returns to its
  normal condition. At whichever extremity of the tube the gas
  is allowed    to enter, its entrance  is seen to be accompanied by

252         Prof. De la Rive on   the Propagation of Electricity
the appearance of a very fine mist of a rosy white tint which ad
vances into the tube, but which, when the introduction of the
additional quantity of gas has stopped, progresses from the ne
gative to the positive electrode, allowing the dark space to be
reproduced, and hiding, as it passes, the successive stratifications
of the different parts of the column, enveloping them as a light
cloud would do ; this mist afterwards disappears, and the lumi
nous column resumes its first appearance, which it retains as
long as there is no change either in the flow of electricity or in
the state of the gas through which it passes.
     The appearance of this mist, which exactly resembles that
which    I  have already mentioned as existing within the dark
space   of the  column when in a state of rest, clearly indicates the
agitation which the introduction of a small additional quantity
of gas produces throughout the column, an agitation which is also
proved by the advance of the strise and their encroachment one
upon another.       The phenomenon moreover exhibits this further
peculiarity — namely, that the sharpness and brilliance of the
 striae in the additional portion of gas introduced, which distin
 guish them so clearly from those in the gas previously in the
 tube,   enable us to follow the movement of the additional gas
 from one end of the tube to the other.          The experiment may be
repeated several times      in succession   by  the introduction of suc
cessive portions of gas, provided that the pressure is not increased
by more than      \ a millim. each time, and that the total pressure
does not exceed more than 5 or 6 millims. in all.
    With nitrogen and atmospheric air the phenomena are simi
lar ; but the experiment cannot be carried to the same extent,
as the pressure at which the effects cease to show themselves
is much lower with these gases than it is with hydrogen.
The narrow strise which appear at the moment the gas enters,
and at the end of the tube at which the entrance takes place,
are also less sharp and less brilliant; but there is the same
momentary disappearance          of the dark space, the same pro
duction of a rose-coloured mist, and the same advance of this
mist, when the introduction of the gas has ceased, from the
negative to the positive electrode.        With all three gases alike,
when the gas enters near the negative* electrode the mist is
seen advancing as a narrow vein along the axis of the tube from
the positive to the negative electrode ; then, after arriving at this
end of the tube, it turns back and progresses, as we have said,
from the negative to the positive electrode.
     This mist is evidently caused by a portion of the gas which,
on entering the tube, becomes enormously expanded and is ren-
                           * [Query, positive.]

dered visible by the electricity which traverses it.          The slow
ness with which this mist spreads affords an indication of
the small elastic force of the gas.       It is probably in conse
quence of the same cause that the gas which enters the tube
mixes so slowly with what was there before, as is rendered
evident by the sharp and narrow striae which appear in the new
portion of gas, while those in the original quantity of gas are
much wider and less well defined — a difference which can only
be due to the fact that the entering gas is not, at the moment
of entering the tube, as greatly rarefied as that which was already
there.    Lastly, the fact that the narrowly striated gaseous column
is much wider when the gas which produces it enters near the
negative electrode than when it enters near the positive elec
 trode, is a proof that before the introduction of the additional
 quantity of gas, the gaseous column which the tube already con
tained was much more expanded in the neighbourhood of the
 negative than in that of the positive electrode.           Accordingly
 the passage of a rapid succession of electric discharges through
 a rarefied column of ga3 must produce in         it,
                                                  when the rarefaction
 has reached   a certain point (which varies with the nature and
 therefore with the conductivity of the gas), first of all considera
 able expansion of the gaseous matter surrounding the negative
 electrode, and then, starting from this greatly expanded portion
 of the column,    asuccession of alternate expansions and conden
 sations all the way to the positive electrode.       It very probable
                                                             is
 that the same effect takes place when the gas          not rarefied suf

 ficiently for stratifications of the electric light to be produced.
 But in that case the greater elastic force of the gas, combined
 with the necessarily less rapid succession of discharges, allows
 the condensed and expanded strata to return immediately to their
 normal density, and thus prevents this twofold condition from
 showing itself; whereas, when the gas             less elastic and the
                                                  is
 discharges follow each other more rapidly, the condition of ex
 pansion and contraction produced        by  first discharge lasts until
                                              a
a   second discharge occurs, and    is thus rendered permanent. and
sensible.
   The transmission of electricity through        column of gas thus

quently the portion of this medium which is near the negative
electrode must become more highly charged with (negative) sta
tical electricity than that portion of the rarefied gas which is
near the positive electrode does (with positive electricity); it is
therefore not surprising that the repulsion of the gaseous mole
cules, and consequently the rarefaction of the gas, should be
greater in the former portion than in the latter*.               Now why
does negative electricity diffuse itself more easily than positive,
under like conditions as to tension, as well as size and position
of the electrodes and nature and state of rarefaction of the sur
rounding medium ? This is a mystery, or at least a very inter
esting point to investigate in connexion with the theory of
electricity.
  § 3. Special Phenomena presented by the different parts          of the
                      Stratified Electric Discharge.
    The gaseous column traversed by an electric discharge is com
posed, as we have said, when it has been brought to a certain
degree of rarefaction, of alternate expanded and condensed strata,
 with a greatly rarefied dark space near the negative electrode.
 The more expanded parts of the column, since they oppose less
resistance to the passage of the electricity, must remain dark ;
while the more condensed parts, possessing a lower degree of
 conductivity, must become heated and luminous even when all
 parts are traversed by the same discharge.           We ought to have
here a phenomenon absolutely analogous to that which is pro
 duced when a chain formed of wires of the same length and dia
 meter, alternately of silver and of platinum, is placed in the cir
 cuit of a galvanic battery : although they all transmit the same
 current, the platinum wires, having a greater resistance, become
 heated and even incandescent, while the better-conducting silver
 wires remain cold and dark.
    In order to prove that the part which remains dark does in
 reality offer less resistance to the passage of electricity than the
 luminous portions of the stratified column, I employed two small
 disks of platinum, each of them fixed by a point in its circum
 ference to the extremity of a platinum wire enclosed in a glass
 tube, in such a way that they were kept parallel to each other at
 a distance of 3 centims.         The two disks were firmly fastened in     -
 proximity to, but very carefully insulated from, each other, and
    * The fact that
                      electricity of tension spreads more readily round the
 negative than round the positive electrode can easily be proved experimen
 tally — as well as the state of permanent electric tension of the gaseous
 column during the passage of the electric discharge, whatever may be the
 degree of rarefaction of the gas.

  could have ho electrical communication except through the plati
  num wire soldered to the circumference of each and enclosed in a
  glass tube. The free extremities of the two platinum wires could
  be put into connexion respectively with the terminals of a galvano
  meter. The apparatus was so arranged that the two platinum disks
  could be introduced into the stratified electric discharge, so as to
  cut it transversely and to have their centres in the axis of the dis
  charge. They thus served the purpose of a shunt to lead off a part
  of the current, and the intensity of this derived part, which is less
  in proportion to the conductivity of the interval contained between
  the extremities of the branch-circuit, was measured by the deflec
   tion of the needle of the galvanometer placed in communication
  with the free ends of the platinum wires carrying the disks ; the
  wires, as we have said, were surrounded by glass tubes through
  out that portion of their length which traversed the receiver
   containing the rarefied gas, in order that they might remain
   well insulated, and that the disks alone might be in contact with
, the gaseous substance which transmitted the discharges.            It was
   now only needful to reverse the direction of these discharges, in
   order that, -without moving the platinum disks, they might be
   either in the dark space near the negative electrode, or in the
   luminous space near the positive electrode. The apparatus was
   moreover so constructed that they could be placed in other parts
   of the electric jet. We may add that the electrodes between
   which the electric jet passed were two platinum disks, each 5
   centims. in diameter, placed parallel to each other at a distance
   which could be varied from 50 to 30 centims., and that they were
   consequently, like the small disks which served to lead off the
   derived current, perpendicular to the axis of the jet.

   It will be seen from these Tables that the intensity of the de
rived current diminishes with the pressure, although the total
current becomes much stronger as the pressure falls, which proves
with what rapidity the resistance of the gas diminishes as it is
more and more rarefied.           But at the same time the diminution
of the derived current, and consequently that of the resistance,
is much greater when the platinum disks are immersed in the
dark space near the negative electrode than when they are in the
luminous part of the electric jet near the positive electrode.
Thus under a pressure of 3 millims. it is not possible, in the
case of hydrogen,        to detect the smallest derived current with
the disks in the dark space, whereas, when they are in the lumi
nous part, the derived current still gives a deflection of 35° :
with 15 millims. pressure, the deflection was 90° with the disks
near either electrode ; but under this pressure there was not yet
any formation of a dark space, and consequently the condition
of the gas as to density was the same at both ends of the tube.
The resistance of the dark space is likewise very small in the
case of nitrogen under a pressure of 2 millims., since the deflec
tion caused by the derived current is only 3°, while the current
derived from the luminous space gives a deflection of 18°; but
the difference between the two currents is less than it is with
hydrogen. This difference is due to the fact that, hydrogen
having a much greater conductivity than nitrogen, on the one
hand the total intensity of the discharge is greater, which is the
reason that we have a deflection of 35° instead of 18° in the
luminous space; and on the other hand, the derived portion of
the current must be less when the conductivity of the gas is
still further increased by rarefaction, in consequence of which
we have 0° instead of 3° in the dark space.
   We may observe that all the results which indicate an un
equal resistance offered to the passage of the electric discharge
by different parts of the same gaseous column are perfectly

                  in highly Rarefied Elastic Fluids.             257
comparable with each other, since it is the same jet of electricity
which traverses successively these different unequally conducting
parts.
    If the platinum disks are placed in a part of the jet which is
at one-third of the whole distance from one of the electrodes, and
consequently at two-thirds from the other, under a pressure of 2
millims. the derived current gives a deflection of 8°, in the case of
air or nitrogen, when the electrode nearest to the disks is nega
tive, and 12° when it is positive.   In hydrogen the corresponding
deflections are 20° and 36°.      Hence the conductivity of the ga
seous column diminishes gradually from the dark space, where
it is a maximum, to the space near the positive electrode, where it
reaches a minimum.
    The disks being always in the same part of the jet, the inten
sity of the derived current may serve as a tolerably accurate ex
pression for the relative resistances of the different gases at dif
ferent degrees of pressure, provided that care is taken to keep the
total intensity of the principal current the same in each case by
means of a rheostat.                                        I
                          This is an investigation which have in
hand, and which is not yet finished.
    We see therefore that the dark space near the negative elec
trode offers much less resistance to the passage of the electric
current than is offered by the luminous part near the positive
electrode.     Hence it follows, for the same reason that the por
tion of the gas whose conductivity is lowest is more luminous
than that which has the highest conductivity and which remains
almost dark, that the temperature of the former must be higher
than that of the latter.     This has been fully borne out by ex
periment.
    Two mercurial thermometers with cylindrical bulbs were placed
inside a tube 16 centims. long and 4 in diameter, each at a dis
tance of 1 centim. from one of the electrodes, at which distance
it was found that the heating or cooling effect of the electrodes
was imperceptible.      Any effect which they might have produced
would have been cooling, as was proved by bringing them nearer
to the bulbs of the thermometers ; considering their dimensions
 (solid metallic knobs, of a centimetre in diameter), this is not to
be wondered at.
    It did not take long, when the electric discharge was made to
pass through rarefied nitrogen or hydrogen, to perceive that the
 temperature indicated by the thermometer in the dark space near
the negative electrode was very different from that shown by the
thermometer in the luminous space near the positive electrode.
These differences maintain nearly a constant ratio between the
pressures of 1 and 10 millims., even although the absolute tem
peratures, with which they must not be confounded, vary with

258       Prof. De la Rive       on the   Propagation of Electricity
the pressure and nature of the gas.               Thus, even when there is
no sensible dark space       near    the negative electrode, the thermo
meter placed at that part rises less than the one near the positive
electrode, showing that still the gas is there most expanded and
has the highest conductivity.            The difference of temperature is
thus more sensitive criterion, than even difference of lumino
       a
sity, of the greater or less electrical resistance of different parts
of the gaseous column.          The absolute temperature is in general
lower in hydrogen, at all degrees of rarefaction, than it is in
nitrogen or atmospheric air, which offer more resistance to the
 passage of electricity.       Moreover the difference between the two
 thermometers was never as great in hydrogen as it was in nitro
 gen or atmospheric air.           Thus in hydrogen the greatest differ
 ence  was  4Q,5   R.,  attained    when the pressure was between 9 and
 12 millims., the thermometer having risen in two minutes from
 21° to 28°-5 R. at the negative electrode, and from 21° to 31° R.
 at the positive.      In nitrogen the maximum difference of 5° was
 reached under a pressure of 5 millims. (the negative thermometer
 rising from 20° to 24° R., and the positive from 20° to 29° R.).
 In air the maximum difference was 6° under a pressure of 6 mil
 lims. (the negative thermometer rising from 18° to 26° R., and
 the positive thermometer from 18° to 32° R.).                  Under 20 mil
 lims. pressure the difference was only 2°"5 R. in hydrogen (rise
 of thermometers from 21° to 26°, and from 21° to 28°-5 R.) ; in
 nitrogen it was only half a degree (rise of thermometers from 20°
 to 25°, and from 20° to 25c,5 R.) ; and in air there was no dif
 ference (both thermometers rising from 19° to 28°). When
 there is no longer any difference between the indications of the
 two thermometers, or only a very small difference, the appear
 ance of the luminous jet may be observed to be perfectly uniform
 throughout its whole extent.

   As the duration of the experiment increases and the absolute
temperature rises, the difference between the indications of the
two thermometers becomes relatively smaller ; the readings of

  260     Propagation of Electricity in highly Rarefied Elastic Fluids.
 the two thermometers finally approximate to each other, and even
  after a certain time become the same.
      Hydrogen and nitrogen give the same results.
      The numbers representing the temperatures in the foregoing
  Tables cannot be given as perfectly exact ; they vary, in fact, as
  to their absolute values, with the intensity of the electric jet ;
  but they are sufficiently constant and exact to prove : —
      1. That the transmission        of the electric discharge through
  rarefied gases is accompanied by a sensible elevation of tem
  perature ;
      2. That, when the gases are sufficiently rarefied for the dis
  charge to pass readily, and for the light to be stratified, this ele
  vation of temperature is less near the negative electrode than it
  is near the positive electrode ;
      3. That the absolute rise of temperature at the two electrodes,
 and the differences between them, vary with the density and
 nature of the gas *.
      A fact which strikingly proves the great calorific and illumi
 nating power of electricity is that hydrogen, under a pressure of
 only 1^ millim., may be rendered luminous and become sensiblyf
 heated by the passage of electricity, although at this pressure its
 density is so small that a cubic centim. of the gas weighs scarcely
 more than ttuW °f a milligramme.
      When one sees that so subtile a substance as hydrogen reduced
 to 1 or 2 millims. pressure is capable of becoming luminous
 under the influence of electricity, it is impossible not to be
     * The experiments recorded above must not be confounded with those
 that have been made as to the temperature of the electrodes between which
 the electric discharges are passed through the elastie fluids.    Mr. Gassiot,
 who has given much attention to this latter class of phenomena, has shown
that it depends on the dimensions of the electrodes, and upon the nature
 or greater or less degree of continuity of the electric discharges, which cir
 cumstances sometimes cause the positive electrode and sometimes the ne
gative to be most heated. He concludes from his numerous researches
that the development of heat, whether at the positive or the negative elec
trode, results exclusively from the resistance which is opposed to the trans
mission of the electricity at these two parts of the circuit respectively. My
experiments were made with two electrodes whose size was too great for
them to become heated {copper knobs, from half a centim. to one centim.
in diameter) ; the results obtained can therefore be due only to the more
or less elevated temperature of the different portions of the rarefied gaseous
column traversed by the electric jet which eseapes between the two elec
trodes.
    t  T he gas must in fact have been very considerably heated for it to have
been able to raise the temperature of a thermometer of which the bulb,
filled with mercury, was a cylinder      millims. in diameter and 3 centims.
long 3° in two minutes.      The simple fact that the gas becomes luminous
is a further proof of its high temperature ; for its luminosity is evidently
only a result of its incandescence.

 quantity of gas is caused to enter the tube, as described in § 2,
 and which likewise appears in the dark space when a certain
 degree of rarefaction has been passed.           The gaseous matter is
 there even more highly rarefied than it is at the other parts of the
 mass, thus making its resemblance to the luminous matter form
 ing the comets and nebulae still more decided. We may add that
 recent researches on the part of various astronomers have shown
 that the rays yielded by the prismatic analysis of the light of
 these celestial bodies are exactly similar to those given by the
 electric discharge when transmitted through rarefied nitrogen,
 and especially through hydrogen.          Do these gases, then, which
 intervene in most of the phenomena of terrestrial physics, play
 an equally or even more important part in the phenomena of cos-
 mical physics ? There is nothing improbable in this conjecture,
 especially since the analysis of aerolites has shown that planetary
 space does not contain any element not found also upon our
 globe.
 XXXIV.        What   changes can be made in the arrangement of the
    materials of   the mass of a Body, its external form remaining the
    same,    without affecting its attraction on an external particle ?

       Gentlemen,                                        January 30, 1867.
       has been observed to me that, in a paper I sent to you last
 IT    year on the above subject (Phil. Mag. S. 4. vol. xxxii. p.
 132),  I  have materially limited the generality of the investigatioii,
by assuming that p the density can be expanded in a convergent
series of integral powers of r ; also that      I  seem not to have con
sidered that M0, M„              . . . may be functions      of i.  (These
letters will be understood by a reference to my former paper.
Or they will be understood by what follows.)               I now give the
demonstration again, modified so as to meet these objections.
    If we subtract the body when under its original arrangement
from the body under its new arrangement, particle from particle,
we obtain an Imaginary Body, the total mass of which is zero
(some parts being of positive and some of negative density), and

the  external attraction of which is zero.        It is required to
find the form and law of density of this imaginary body.         Let
r, 6 (cos 0=fi), to be coordinates to any point of       the density                  it, p

                                                             B. A.        Murray.
                                    Preliminary.
   (a) Two quadrangles are equal, if they have each three sides
and the two angles comprised
                              by them respectively equal.
    (b)In quadrangle,
                 a              if
                           two opposite sides and two
                                                       adjacent

                          of the Twelfth Axiom of Euclid.                                           265
angles comprised by them and a third side are respectively equal,
the other two angles are equal.
    (c)In quadrangle,
              a            two adjacent angles are equal and the
                                          if
two opposite sides comprising them are unequal, the other two
angles are unequal.
   (d) In                  two adjacent angles are equal and the
            quadrangle,
              a                           if
other two angles are unequal, the opposite sides comprising the
adjacent equal angles are unequal.
   Obs. — When the opposite sides comprising two adjacent equal
angles are unequal, the longest of those sides will comprise the
smallest of the two unequal angles.

   In    quadrangle,
          a             two opposite sides are equal and two adja

cent angles comprised       them and      by

H prolong F H until its prolongation H I is equal to F H. From
I draw a perpendicular to H A, and suppose it to fall at a point
K between A and H. The triangles BFH, K I H are equal, the
sides B H, K H are equal ; and as H B is longer than G E, K H
is longer than G E ; and considering the quadrangle HBGD,
the entire quantity K H is in advance of GE (Obs.). And sup
           I
posing K prolonged from K to meet C D at a point L between
C and G, L G would be longer than K H. Now by prolonging
I L, as in the preceding cases, you can construct a triangle equal
and similar to GIL, whose perpendicular will cut off D C, or its
prolongation, a quantity (equal to G L) in advance of and greater
than K H, and, a fortiori, greater than all preceding similar
smaller quantities as G E.   Now supposing the sides A B, C D
to be not more than m times as long as G E, by constructing m
triangles with the conditions of construction of E F G, the per
pendicular of one of them must, if prolonged, meet the side A C
at C or E as in fig. 1, or meet the extremity (A or C) of A B or
C D as in fig. 2, or meet the prolongation of one of them as in
fig. 3, thus demonstrating, as in those cases, the acuteness and
equality of the angles A C D, B A C. Therefore &c.
    Cor. 1. In a quadrangle, if two adjacent angles are right an
gles, the sum of the others cannot exceed two right angles.
   It is demonstrated to be impossible if the               Fig.   5-
opposite sides comprising the two adjacent
right angles are equal. Suppose those sides
to be unequal,     and in the quadrangle
A B C D (fig. 5) the angle B A C to be
a right angle and ACD obtuse.        Prolong
from C the shortest side D C (Obs.) until         it,
                                  AE, AED
D     is equal to     the angles     B
E,                   B
                     A  ;
                                                                        1

would be equal and obtuse.          Impossible.
We have the same result if we suppose
BAC, ACD (fig. 6) both obtuse.
   Suppose (fig. 7) one angle B A C to be ob
tuse, and the other ACD acute.        From the
middle point E of the side A C lying between
the unequal angles, draw to B A prolonged
a perpendicular E F.       E F prolonged from
E will meet C D at some point G. The sum
of F A E, E A B would be less than the sum
of E C G, E A B j therefore E C G would be
greater than FAE, andEGlonger than EF.
Of E G take a part E H equal to E F ; draw
CH. C HE wouldbe a right angle, CGH
acute, and H G D obtuse.            You would
then have F, B, D right angles, and F G D
obtuse.   Impossible. Therefore &c.
   Cor. 2. In a quadrangle having three
right angles, if a line is drawn perpendicular
to one of the sides which is limit of two right angles from the
side opposite to       it,
                      the line so drawn cannot be shorter than the
other line which        limit of two right angles, nor longer than
                           is
the one opposite to it.
   In the quadrangle ABCD (fig. 8), let
B, D, be right angles from any point

                                       Lemma.
  If two      right-angled triangles have
the hypothenuses equal, and      given  a
acute angle of one be greater than                 a
given acute angle of the other, the
second acute angle of the first-named
triangle will be smaller than the
second acute angle of the other, and
all the sides have   relative propor
                            a
tion to the angles opposite to them.
   Put one triangle ABC (fig.       on      9)

angles may coincide, and the side

 268        Mr. B. A. Murray on      a rigorous Demonstration
  of the smaller.    The extremity A of A B cannot be at A', nor
  at a point  D   beyond A'; for the other extremity B would be
  beyond B', and then the hypothenuse A' B or J) B would be
  longer than A' B', contrary to the supposition ; it must then be
  between A' and C, and the other extremity B of the hypothenuse
  A B must be beyond B'. It is evident, then, that the second acute
  angle B of A B C is smaller than the second acute angle B' of
  A' B' C, and that the sides A C, B' C opposite the smaller angles
  A B C, B' A' C are shorter than the sides A' C, B C opposite the
  greater angles A' B' C, B A C.
                      Second  Principal Proposition.
     In a quadrangle,   if two  opposite sides are equal, and two adja
  cent angles comprised by them and a third side are equal and
  acute, the other two angles are equal and obtuse.
     In the quadrangle     ABCD      (fig. 10), let the sides AB, CD
 be equal,  and the angles B A C, A C D be equal and acute, and
 suppose   A B D, B D C     to be right angles.    From A and C draw
 to the opposite sides CD, AB perpendiculars A E, C F, and
 prolong (either) A E from E until the prolongation E G is equal
to A E. Prolong B D from D until the prolongation D H is
equal to B D ; draw G H.         The quadrangles A E D B, G E 1) H
are equal (a), and the quadrangle A B G H is similar to A B C D
so far as having two opposite sides A B, G H equal, comprising
two equal and acute angles B A E, H G E, and two right angles
A B D, G H D,— the other two sides, however, AG, BH, being
longer, and the acute angles B A E, H G E smaller than their
respective similars.     From A and G draw to the opposite sides

                           of the Twelfth Axiom of Euclid.                                       269

              XXXVI.       On the Tension of Liquid Films.
                 By  M.   G.  Van der Mensbrugghe*.
A      FORCE of
         to  the
                      contraction or tension has long been attributed
                  surface-layer of films.        If  this conception is in
conformity with fact, liquid films are in all respects similar to
stretched membranes ; it was by starting from this idea that M.
Plateau arrived at the enunciation of a general principlef, accord
ing to which, in every laminar system constituting a polyhedral
structure, the sum of the areas of all the plates is a minimum.
Yet the tension of liquid surfaces was still a simple hypothesis ;
but M. Lamarle, in a memoir in which he has brilliantly turned
to account the above principle, has shown that in the case of a
liquid mass submitted solely to the action of its own parts, the
known phenomena of molecular attraction are necessarily accom
panied by a superficial tension J.         It merely remained to render
manifest    this force  which    had so long remained mysterious. This
has been recently effected by Professor Dupre of Rennes : in the
second part of his Cinquieme Mimoire sur la Theorie M&canique
de la Chaleur he gives several ingenious methods of demonstra
ting the contractile effects produced on the surface of liquids.
I  may be permitted to adduce here one of the experiments which
this able physicist describes in regard to a laminar surface.               He
uses " a very simple apparatus, consisting of a vertical metallic
plate (fig. 1) cut out at G F E H, and of                     Fig. 1.

against the first at K and L. The faces
opposite each other are moistened with
solution of soap ; and when the moveable
plate, at first placed at F E, is made to
descend, a liquid film fills the interval.
The rapid ascent of K L when left to
itself is enough to prove the existence of

the force of contraction ; a fall, on the contrary, is observed
if the liquid film has been burst. The friction is less and the
success more certain if K L i3 replaced by a wire, one bent end
of which fits at F in a small hole, while the other end moves on
a  circular edge replacing EH"*.
    Reflecting on these experiments,       I have devised some others,
which, at the same time that they show very neatly the force of
contraction, acquire a special interest in this respect — that they
can be used for certain exact verifications of the theory.            Hence
I  have no hesitation in submitting to the judgment of the Aca
demy these new methods of studying the tension of liquid films.
  I. Equilibrium of a Flexible Thread       submitted to the Tension     of
                             a Liquid Film.
    Given a plane or curved film produced, for instance, by Pla
teau's glycerine liquid ; it follows clearly from the principle of
tension that, by giving to this film a contour one portion of
which is perfectly flexible, it will at once be seen to assume the
figure corresponding to the least possible extent of the laminar
surface. Now this is confirmed by facts in a decisive manner.
    Let us first investigate the pheno-                   Fig. 2.
 mena in the case of plane films. Let
 abed (fig. 2) be a horizontal square      f
 of iron wire, in any two points of                          ,
 which (m and n) in one of its sides (a b)
 are fixed the ends of a perfectly flex
 ible and very fine silk or cotton
 thread; let this arrangement, sup
 ported by a hook /, also of iron wire,
 be immersed in the glycerine liquid ;
 as soon as we withdraw it we obtain a
                                              a m               n 6
 plane film in which the thread mon
 floats without affecting any regular shape.         That being the case,
 if by means of a point of filter-paper the laminar portion monm
 be broken, the flexible contour soon assumes the form of a per
 fect arc of a circle. It is obvious that the experiment would
 still succeed even if the portion m n of the solid wire a b were
 first suppressed.
    This result proves that the residual film amonb cda occupies
 in fact the least surface possible ; in fact the calculus of varia
 tions teaches us that the area comprised between a straight line
 m n, and a curve mon of given length, is a maximum when this
 curve is an are of a circle j this condition clearly necessitates

272             M. G. Van der Mensbrugghe on                     the
that of a minimum of the laminar surface which remains.          We
shall see further on how statics lead to the same law.
    If the silk thread has a length equal to or greater than the
perimeter of the solid skeleton diminished by mn, the whole of
the liquid film should be destroyed at the moment that the part
between mn and the flexible thread is burst. This is confirmed
by the following observation : when the contour is circular or
oval, the entire film disappears, and the thread lies along the
solid skeleton ; when this is polygonal, the adherence between
the flexible thread and the solid wire sometimes leaves little
films in the angles.
    The experiment described may be modified so as to be still
more striking.    A fine silk thread of suitable length is chosen,
and    its two ends  tied, so as to form a closed contour ; it is
then moistened with the glycerine liquid ; the horizontal film is
then formed, and the moistened thread carefully placed in it j
this remains on the surface, assuming an irregular figure; but
the moment the portion within its contour is burst, this assumes
suddenly the shape of a perfect circumference, which is retained
even if the film is placed in a vertical po-           Fig. 3.
sition. Fig. 3 represents the liquid film
perforated by its circular aperture.
   I   come now to the case where we work
with curved films. We are not concerned
here with surfaces of equilibrium whose mean
curvature is not zero — for example, the
sphere, the cylinder, the unduloid of M.
Plateau, &c. ; for when surfaces are obtained
in the laminar state, they always exert a pressure on the air they
contain ; but if any portion of their figure were burst, this would
quickly disappear completely.                    I
                                   Hence have been obliged only
to operate on minima surfaces, or on those whose mean curva
ture was zero j produced in the form of lamina;, they exert no pres
sure on the air in contact with them ; hence it is that I have
been able partly to burst these films without destroying them in
their entire extent.
   I  first made some experiments on the catenoid, that          the        is,
surface produced     bythe revolution of    chain about the right
                                                 a
line perpendicular to its axis of symmetry. To obtain this figure                 I
employed M. Plateau's method*, which consists in using two
rings 70 millims. in diameter, for instance one of these rests on
                                                     :                            a

two rings are first placed almost in contact, and the small inter
val which separates them is filled with the glycerine liquid by
means of a pencil ; the upper ring is then raised, and the desired
surface is formed between them : the distance                 between the
two rings should be less than two-thirds of their diameter, as
otherwise the equilibrium would become unstable.               Having thus
obtained the catenoid, I carefully applied to the film a closed
thread 14 centims. long ; in virtue of its weight, it sank to the base
of the figure, leaving generally a narrow lamina within its contour.
When      I  burst this, the tension of the liquid was exerted in all
directions ; the form of the residual film did not appear altered,
and the thread was arranged in the form of a perfectly stable
and symmetrical skew surface.             Holding in the hand the upper
ring, and thus successively giving to the catenoid different heights,
I  could procure variations in the shape of the curve described by
the thread.       When the height was only 1 or 2 centims.,            I  ob
served two symmetrical arcs placed on each side of a vertical plane
passing through the axis of the catenoid ; the rest of the thread
adhered to the two metallic rings.            In proportion as these were
more separated, the parts adhering were gradually detached ;
and the two symmetrical arcs, coming closer, became longer,
while their curvature diminished.             When    I continued to raise
the upper ring,       I observed the skew curve become continuous
and touch the lower ring.
    It is scarcely necessary to add that the experiment may also
be made by fixing two points of the flexible thread to the upper
ring and then bursting the portion of the film between this ring
and the thread.
    I then repeated the same operations on the surface having the
equation

    I have previously said that these experiments may be used
for certain accurate verifications of theory. In fact, let it be pro
posed to obtain a mathematical solution of the following general
problem : —
    Given a laminar surface in equilibrium, to ascertain the curve
produced by a very flexible inextensible thread, without weight and
at its exterior contour solely acted on by the contractile force of
the liquid film ; this thread may, moreover, form a closed contour,
or it may have two points fixed on the solid skeleton, serving as sup
port  for   the surface  in question.

and lay it on the liquid
surface, holding in the hand
the wax pellet and keeping
the free end of the silk in
a vertical position. Burst
ing then the film formed be
tween the silk and the solid
skeleton, the thread will
be immediately stretched,
and if we raise the weight
a little we shall see the
part immersed gradually
increase.       The parts of the
 thread which are in this
 manner gradually added to
 those     already  submitted to the tension of the liquid should
 be previously moistened, otherwise the film will burst.                 When
 equilibrium is judged to have            been   established     between     the
 tension of the thread and the weight it supports, the skeleton
 is gently raised, being turned about the side a b, which during
  this movement of rotation remains horizontal : when the film
 is nearly vertical, the weight is let go, and the direction ob
 served in which it tends to move ; if it descends, it is clearly
  because the traction exerted by the liquid is too small; and accord
  ing to theory the radius of the circle ought to be increased, which
 is effected by increasing the distance of the fixed point m from
  the last part immersed, n, and submitting at the same time a
  fresh portion of silk to the action of the liquid ; we can thus re
  tain the curve in its form of a semicircumference.                If, on the
  contrary, the weight is raised, we ought to diminish the radius
  of the arc. We endeavour in this manner to attain equilibrium ;
  and we ascertain whether the curve produced is semicircular by ex
  amining, with the aid of compasses, whether the maximum height
   e o is equal to the semidistance of m n. When the weight remains
  immoveable, if the film be made perfectly vertical, in general equi
  librium will still be maintained ; yet it is only due to the friction
   exerted at the point n, where the thread quits the film.             In fact,
   disregarding this friction, we see       that  as  the    weight  sinks,   the
   radius of the arc decreases. But in this case the            tension   of  the
   thread also diminishes, and the motion should continue in the
   same direction ; if the weight ascends, on the contrary, the radius
   of curvature, and hence also the tension of the thread, increases
   more and more, which imparts to the motion commenced a gra
   dually increasing velocity.
      This being the case,       as  long   as equilibrium continues,         due

to the small resistance previously mentioned, let us note the dia
meter m n of the curve, cut the thread near the point n, and weigh
the end of the thread along with the pellet which it supports.
If  the theory previously given be correct, the ratios between the
weights and the corresponding radii should be equal.             I have
made by this method a series of experiments, and I have ob
 tained the numbers in the following Table (the first column
contains in the order of decreasing magnitude the weights t in
milligrammes, the second the radii p in millimetres, and the
third the corresponding values of the ratio       t: p): —

    The values of t : p are thus seen to be so near as to show the
constancy of the ratio between the tension of the thread and the
corresponding radius of curvature ; the deviations (which, more
over, are very irregularly distributed) ought to be attributed
especially to the nature of the equilibrium to be realized before
effecting the measures, and to the varying action of the friction,
which exerts more influence in either direction when the radius
of curvature is less. There still remains, however, a slight cause
 of error, arising from the weight of the part of the thread im
mersed, and the small liquid mass which adheres to it. This dis
 turbing cause, which clearly increases with the length of the
part immersed, has always the effect of diminishing the ten
sion t, and therefore the ratio   tip;   this effect seems to be shown,
in fact, by the numbers in the third column of the preceding Table.
    We have seen above that the theoretical ratio t : p expresses
the tension of the liquid film ; in the special case of the gly
cerine liquid   I used, I obtained for the intensity of this force the
approximate value 6-029, being the mean of ten numbers in
the last column of the Table, which amounts to saying that the
tension of a liquid film is about 6'03 milligrammes for a millimetre
in length. This refers to the double force exerted by the two
faces of the film ; hence the superficial tension of the glycerine

                         Tension   of Liquid Films.                 279
liquid employed       would always      be about  3 milligrammes    per
millimetre.
    In fine, as regards plane films, the experiments seem to me
to exhibit a sufficient agreement with the three laws deduced
from statical principles. An exact and direct verification of these
laws in the case of curved films presents serious difficulties.      In
all the attempts     I have made from this point of view, the skew
curves which the thread assumed always appeared to have the
same radius ; but in order to be quite sure,         I must have had
recourse to very long and complex calculations.             Yet in this
case, as in that of plane curves, everything leads to the suppo
sition that observation would confirm theory.
    II.  Equilibrium of a Metal Ring suspended to a Liquid Film.
    I have observed, in experiments on the catenoid, that when I
moved the upper ring on either side of its normal position, the
film would often raise the lower ring — an effect evidently due to
the tension of the liquid.       I  concluded from this fact that, by
making the lower ring sufficiently light, I might be able to obtain
it suspended to the liquid plate and kept in equilibrium by the
force of contraction of the latter.        To determine this, I had a
ring made of iron wire 53"30 millims. in diameter, and 0 6 mil-
lim. in thickness ; it rested on three feet, also of iron wire, 25
millims. in length, and 0-25 millim. in thickness.           This ring,
previously well moistened with the glycerine liquid, being placed
 with its feet on a table,     I approached to it the large ring (at
 tached to a fork), on which was already a liquid film ; as soon as
 the two rings had stuck together, I gently raised the forked
 ring.    The portion of the film in the lower ring remained
 plane; but the annular part was
 curved, as was to be expected, in
 the shape of a portion of a catenoid.
 Raising then the higher ring, a mo
 ment was soon reached at which the
 lower system was also raised,and was
 then suspended to the liquid film.
 Fig. 5 represents on a scale of one-
 half the system in equilibrium; the
 portion of a catenoid is shaded.
 I   found that the stability of the
 equilibrium was perfect; for by blow
 ing on the circular film with suffi
 cient force to make the system de
  scend,  I  saw the portion of a ca
 tenoid elongate without breaking ;
 as soon as     I  ceased  to blow, the
 small ring quickly ascended.

280             M. G. Van der Mensbrugghe on          the
   This experiment not only demonstrates in an elegant man
ner the tension of liquid films, but renders it possible to find
approximately the intensity of this force.       In fact, knowing
the mean diameters* and the vertical distance of the rings, the
portion of a catenary can be found which would, by its revolu
tion round the line of the centres of the two circumferences,
produce the surface obtained ; from this the angle a can be
calculated, which the tangent to the lowest point of the genera
ting curve makes with the vertical.       Now this tangent gives
exactly the direction in which the tension S of the film acts on
the suspended ring to keep it at rest.    This being granted, it is
clear that the sum of the vertical components of this tension along
the lower ring holds in equilibrium the weight of the system sup
ported. Hence, calling this weight p, and r the mean radius of the
lower ring, we have
                         2wrS cos «        =p,
whence                        S    = -—
                                    lirr cos a
   This formula shows us now why the equilibrium of the ring
is very stable.  In fact, as the system is made to descend the
angle a diminishes, cos a increases, as well as the resulting
action 27irS cos « directed upwards ; the ring ascends therefore,
and passes its position of equilibrium, to return quickly to               it,
for the weight   pthen preponderates.
   The investigation of the angle a gives rise to pretty long cal
culations to avoid them

the small mass of liquid which adheres to the lower ring. Placing
then sand on the paper disk, 1 load the system until the tan
gent at the lowest point of the generating curve is but little
removed from the vertical, after which            I  wait five minutes,
and remove as soon as possible the fresh quantity of liquid
which surrounds . the small ring. Taking care, then, always
to keep this horizontal,      I   gradually increase the burden, but
by gradually    smaller   amounts, in proportion as       I more closely
approach the point at which the tangent to the base of the curve
 will become vertical.      Let us suppose this point attained; the
 weight suspended    is  then   at its maximum value, and equilibrium
 should cease to be stable.        To understand this, it must be ob
 served that when the tangent is exactly vertical, the lower ring
 passes by the summit of the meridional chain ; if then, for any
 reason, the ring descends by the smallest amount, it passes beyond
 the summit in question, and hence the tangent should be inclined
 in a contrary direction. But from this moment a increases, and
 therefore the action ZirrS cos a of the tension diminishes, so that
 the weight ought to continue to descend.           This is just what ob
 servation confirms.     As soon as the ring is low enough to rest on
 the table,  I can burst the film without fearing to derange the
 load and thus alter its weight.         In this manner   I  have made a
 series of ten experiments ; the following numbers give in milli
 grammes the greatest weights successively obtained : —
                   1012                            1005

                   1011                            1068
     These values- are sufficiently close to one another, excepting
 two, which exceed the least by 49 and 67 milligrammes respect
  ively.   These deviations are probably due to a cause of error
  which escaped me, — for instance, to a drop of liquid which was
  added to the load at the time the film was broken.               In any
  case, taking the mean of the ten values, and dividing by
  27rr= 167-45, we get           1020.4
                           i=>=        TP  =o-095.

  Excluding the two greatest values and taking the mean of the
  other eight, we should have

                   1866.     By George Forbes, Esq.
    To  the Editors of   the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       Gentlemen,
             addressing my last communication to you*, the ob
SINCE   servations    made by Mr. Maclear at the Cape of Good
Hope, on the late meteoric shower, have been published in the
Monthly Notices of the Astronomical Society. The observations
of the numbers      I collected in successive periods of five minutes
each, and projected them on the plate of curves          I had before de
duced from British observations.          A most curious fact immedi
ately became apparent.         In the first place the time of maximum
¦frequency reduced to Greenwich time was fourteen or fifteen
minutes earlier than the time of maximum frequency in Britain.
And also,    as may be seen     in
the    annexed     woodcut,     in
which both curves are esti
mated by Greenwich time,
every point on the Cape
Town curve is about a quar
ter of an hour earlier than
the corresponding point on
the   British curve.

minutes. In looking at the curves, we see that they are extremely
like, except that every point on the Cape Town one is about a
quarter of an hour earlier than the corresponding point on the
British one. Now this appears to me to be easily explained thus.
If  the earth in its orbit cut that of the meteors at right angles,
there would be little difference in the times.             But since these
orbits cut each other at an angle of about 19°*, the case is
very much altered ; and if we take p to represent the perpendi
cular distance between two planes passing through Essex and
 Cape Town, both parallel to the ecliptic, then the distauce
 passed over between the times that Cape Town and Essex touch
 the middle of the meteoric band =p cot 19°. Now, from a rough
                     I
 approximation, find that p = about 5000 miles.                 Hence, since
 cot 19°=2-90421, and the velocity of the earth in its orbit is
 1134 miles per minute, we have
                               s _ 5000 x 2 90421
                               v~         1134
 from which the time t is about 13 minutes.                 So close an ac
 cordance between the calculated and observed times is very re
 markable.      And what has been said with respect to the time of
 maximum applies equally well to each point of time.
     I should like to take this opportunity of mentioning an error
 which I made in drawing the curves in Plate           III.  in the February
 Number of the Philosophical Magazine.                 I by accident made
 every point   of the   lowest   curve (that of Mr.  Talmage) five minutes
 earlier than it should have been.

                 XXXVIII. On Radiation and Vapour.
                       By J. Park Harrison, M.A.f
                   lately shown that the intensity of insolation near
  HAVING   the surface    of the ground is increased by the presence of
 a certain quantity of vapour and cloud J,         I wish to submit one or
  two reasons for hesitation in accepting, at any rate to their full
  extent, the conclusions at which Mr. Croll has arrived on the
  subject in the higher regions of the air.

284           Mr.    J.   P. Harrison on Radiation and Vapour.
   There can be no doubt that the apparent variations in solar
radiation at the same altitudes of the sun is due to heat re
ceived by our instruments from the counterradiation of cloud
and other matter.    Precisely the same laws are in operation as
regards this secondary radiation by day, as Dr. Wells proved so
conclusively are at work by night, though the action in the case
of the solar-radiation thermometer is masked by a continuous
supply of heat from the direct rays of the sun.
   On the occasion above alluded to, it was assumed as an axiom
that transparent vapour absorbs less heat than cloud, or even
fog, and consequently    exercises less influence over temperature.
Now Dr. Wells, whilst perfectly aware of the fact that radiation
from the air itself was very slight, had found that it nevertheless
occurred, though he attributed                it,
                                      in the absence of experiment,
to the presence  of particles of solid matter suspended in the at
mosphere.      Professor Tyndall's discovery of the absorptive pro
perties of aqueous vapour shows the sagacity -and accuracy of
Wells's conclusions, but in nowise alters the results of his inves
tigation.      Itwas found      both Prevost and Wells that on clear
                                    by
nights the slightest cloud passing across the zenith at once
caused    a considerable rise in the mercury of an exposed ther
mometer, and stopped the deposit of dew.
    The question has recently been submitted                 by
                                                      Colonel Strachey
to the test of numbers in the pages of this Magazine*          but his  ;
Tables afford materials for showing that the fall in temperature
 by  night at Madras, which was considered to be owing to the
decrease      in
               vapour-tension,      to be ascribed, according to Dr.
                                         is
Wells's law, to the absence of cloud.
    As regards the effects of vapour or cloud in the higher regions
of the air,     may be gathered from somewhat conflicting evidence
               it
that bodies of vapour, of more or less tenuity and extent, float
about in the drier atmosphere, and affect the temperature of the
air in much the same way relatively as in the case of clouds
nearer the earth.
     Ifthis be so, however,     may be asked, how
                                   it                     that so little
                                                                  is
                                                                   it
difference     found four or five miles high in the readings of the
               is
exposed and shaded thermometers            It appears to follow as a
                                                    ?
matter of necessity that less difference would be found, provided
no floating cloud (however light) overshadowed the instruments.
But here we are met at once with the fact that sufficient shelter

is supplied         by
                  the balloon itself.
    May   it not  be that in the recent balloon ascents there were
special circumstances which rendered          difficult to obtain high
                                                        it

         1.   If the  sun was in even moderately high altitude, the rays
     could not reach the instruments.
         2. Most of the ascents took place early or late in the day,
     when the sun was in very low elevation ; or if nearer midday,
     at seasons when from its altitude the sun has also little power.
         3. A balloon is constantly " gyrating                  so that the instru
     ments were more frequently in the shade of the several persons
     who occupied the car than in sunshine ; in addition to which
     there were shadows from the numerous ropes.
        4. Under these circumstances, even when moved into the sun,
     the few seconds allowed for taking observations with the solar
     thermometer would not suffice for heat to be absorbed and con
     ducted through the mercury.
         5. The solar thermometer was not placed in a box so as to be
     protected from the wind.
        6. And the delicate blackened-bulb thermometer, which is
     most frequently alluded to, does not appear to have been enclosed
     in  a glass sphere.
        That the cause of the slight differences between the readings
     of the shaded and exposed thermometers must be sought for
     within the car of the balloon itself and the circumstances at
     tending the several ascents, would further appear to be evident
     from the fact that the readings of the solar thermometer ob
     tained under half a mile (2640 feet) above the sea-level also differ
     very little from those which were taken in shade.                       The parti
     culars of each case, which are exhibited in the following Table,

      and 1863.

286          Mr.  J.  P. Harrison on Radiation and Vapour.
     On comparing these observations with the mean results ob
tained under similar circumstances at higher elevations, the dif
ferences are found slightly to increase with height.                  Still it
would appear that the excessive readings of solar thermometers
in dry regions, mountainous, or otherwise, must be in a great
measure due to reflexion and secondary radiation, and not (at
least to the extent supposed) to increased force in the solar rays
in consequence of the absence of vapour, or their passage through
a less depth    of atmosphere*.
     The conclusion arrived at by Mr. Croll, that the moon, if sur
rounded by aether, would be colder than the earth, is neither in
accordance with the laws of radiant heat uor, if correctly under
stood, to be gathered from the remarks on the subject by Pro
fessor Tyndall.                  I
                        Indeed was not long ago informed by this
eminent physicist and experimenter, that the question had been
set at rest by the exhaustive researches of Dulong and Petit.
The law, as laid down by them, is very simple and easy to be
understood.       " When a body cools in a vacuum its heat is en
tirely dissipated by radiation ; when it is placed in air, or in
any other fluid, its cooling becomes more rapid, the heat carried
off by the fluid being in that case added to that which is dissipated
by radiation f.
                "
     Count Rumford also subjected the question to experiment,
and found that a thermometer half an inch in diameter in the
centre of a hollow globe of glass void of air and hermetically
sealed, after having been transferred from a bath of boiling
water to one of water mixed with pounded ice, on the mean of
two experiments, cooled down from 80° to 10° (R.) in 16m 10s,
whilst the same thermometer under similar treatment in a globe
filled with air, cooled down from 80° to 10° in 9m 45SJ.
     It appeared well that the fact should be made more widely
known that, whilst the sun's rays may pass through dry air
as freely as through a vacuum, heat from a secondary source,
or from a surface heated by the sun, passes with more difficulty
through a vacuum than through dry air§.
    * Under a vertical sun and clear
                                       atmosphere no doubt maximum insola
tion is obtained independently of radiation from cloud or other matter.

with a thermometer heated by the sun's rays admitted through a hole in a
shutter, and directed on the black bulb of the instrument by means of a

in the winter solstice, at Edinburgh, was 40-5 F. In the height of sum
mer, when the sun was 3" above the horizon, the intensity was 1° F.

    SINCE    in the last Number of the Philosophical Magazine, I
    have arrived at what              I
                                    believe to be the cause of the phe
    nomena there described.            In that paper                   I
                                                             showed that a tall
    and voluminous flame of coal-gas, burning in the ordinary way,
    under the influence of a shrill sound sank nearly half its height
    and changed its shape, at the same time entering into a state
    of rapid isochronous vibration which continued so long as
    the sound was sustained.           Hitherto the only explanation to this
    effect is that given by Dr. Tyndall in his exposition of the sub
    ject at the Royal Institution, which is based on the fact that an
    increased pressure similarly changes a sensitive flame.               The ex
    planation given     in the  abstract  of  that  lecture     that "an external
                                                                            is,
    sound added to that of         gas-jet already on the point of roaring
                                      a
    is   equivalent to an augmentation            of pressure on the issuing
     stream of gas"f.         But venture to think that this statement
                                      I
     does not show how sonorous vibrations can effect an increase in
     the pressure of the gas, nor does            explain the many perplexing
                                                     it
     facts that have been observed.
         These perplexities are removed and the whole phenomena,                                       it
     appears to me, made very simple                     by
                                                   the following considerations.
"
    A    sensitive  flame   isone  which,    on  the   slightest mechanical in
     crease in the pressure or, what here comes to the same thing, in
     the velocity of the gas as       issues from the burner, will change its
                                          it
     shape    and  take  very  much   the appearance         has when influenced

     by   sound.     Now the sonorous pulses excited                          by
                                                                    sound throw,   a
      among other things, the pipe which conveys the gas to the
      burner into vibration, the flow of gas            thereby driven from the
                                                                  is
      sides and urged      more  towards    the   centre   of the tube and the         ;
      current, thus confined within narrower limits, must issue from the
      burner with an increased velocity so long as the sound continues.
    It    is  the greater rapidity thus induced in the issuing stream of
      gas which causes the flame to shorten and diverge               the lowering ;
      of the flame being an analogous effect to that noticed and ex
      plained     byDr. Thomas Young in his well-known experiments on
      streams of smoke escaping into the air at different velocitiesj.
          Ifthe above explanation be correct, then certain facts should
      be observed.      For example, under the influence of sound the
      gas,  as    passes through the pipe leading to the burner, will
                 it
      partake of the vibratory motion impressed on that pipe, the

 flame ought therefore to be in a state of vibration : this is the
 case.    Moreover the gas will ripple through the burner with a
 rhythmic flow timed to the pitch of the exciting sound ; and
 therefore the rate of this vibration of the flame should vary with
 the pitch of the note :     I have found this also to be the case. The
 louder and more sustained the exciting sound, the greater the
 amplitude and the more continuous the vibrations of the gas-
 pipe ; and hence the greater should be the effect on the current
 of gas and thus on the flame : this is so.       The higher the pitch
 of the sound, the more rapid the vibrations of the pipe and the
 greater the disturbance of the gas within ; hence there should be
 a more marked effect with such notes : and this is well known
 to be the case.     A sound excited contiguous to the pipe, even if
 far distant from the flame, should have more effect than away
 from the pipe at the same distance : this is so. A contraction
 of the gas-pipe near the burner should cause a greater velo
 city of the gas, and ought, therefore, to produce a somewhat
 similar action to a sound : it does so, as is easily proved by
 pinching a flexible tube near the burner; the flame at once
 shrinks and roars ; and if a Bunsen's screw-clip be used to pinch
the tubing, it will be seen how wonderfully small a pressure on
the screw is sufficient to cause the shrinking and roaring of the
flame when near its sensitive point.             Hence, mechanically
 checking the flow of gas near the point where it issues from the
burner should disguise the effect produced by the sonorous vi
brations, and the more effectually if the gas pass through an
 oblique as well as a contracted channel : this is the case, a par
 tially turned stopcock at all near the burner being fatal to a .
sensitive flame.      Many feet of free tubing should thus be neces
 sary, after the stopcock, in order to abolish the ricochetting of
the current of the gas from side to side of the pipe, and allow
the stream to resume its tranquil flow* : and this is found to be
the case, Professor Tyndall having remarked, as an essential
condition of success, " that a free way should be open for the
transmission of the vibrations from the flame, backwards, through
the gas-pipe which feeds it," —not, however, for this reason,             I
believe, but that a current of gas filling the tube and of. equal
density throughout is necessary, in order that the feeble vibra
tions of the pipe may be impressed on and retained by the stream
of gas. The material and thickness, as well as the length of
                                                                 I
the gas- pipe, should cause a difference in the result; and believe
such a difference can be detected with various kinds of tubing.
    Although the foregoing observations strongly support, if they

      I am indebted to Mr. Sugg, the eminent gas engineer, for information
on this among* other points, he having ascertained that such a rieoehet-
ting of a current of gas can be produced.

do not establish, the theoretical explanation I have offered, yet
I  sought directly to determine its truth by examining the state
of the current of gas in the pipe. For this purpose a burner
was attached to a long length of glass tubing and the stream of
gas rendered visible by passing it through two bulbed tubes,
the first containing hydrochloric acid, the second ammonia.
The dense fumes of amnionic chloride thus formed tracked the
passage of the gas through its conduit, and clearly marked the
unignited column of gas rising from the burner.           Owing per
haps to the narrow diameter of my tube        I  could not detect any
change in the appearance of the smoke passing through it whilst
a sound was being made.         A new and most instructive effect
was, however, observed.      The column of unignited gas was as
sensitive to the influence of sound as the flame itself, shrinking
and diverging at a whistle, a clap of the hands, &c, just as did
the flame.
    Substituting air for the coal-gas,    I  forced a stream of the
former through the same apparatus, employing as the nipple
from which the air issued a steatite burner having a circular ori
fice "046 inch in diameter, a burner which with coal-gas under
an increased pressure (about 3^ inches of water) gives a most
sensitive flame.     Gently urging the air from the bag, a slender
stream of smoke was obtained which, when undisturbed, rose to a
height of 14 inches before it broke and scattered into a divergent
head.     The sound of a whistle instantly brought this head down
to a height of only an inch above the nipple : so swift and large
a fall astonished me greatly ; for it exceeded anything     I  had ob
tained with flames.      So wonderfully sensitive was this column
of smoky air that, although the pressure was kept constant,
yet it was rarely still for long together, the recurrence of little
noises, and inaudible vibrations communicated to the room, con
stantly disturbed and shivered the fragile thing.         In fact, to
certain notes this stream of air was        far  more  sensitive  than
the most sensitive flame I have ever obtained.          This greater
sensitiveness of the air might be expected, as it is unattended with
the upward draught of the long column of heated air which ac
companies the flame.      But not to the same notes were the air
and the flame equally sensitive ; for comparatively low notes influ
enced the stream of air, whilst the sound of a hiss, so energetic in
its action on the flame given by this burner, had but little effect on
the column of smoky air.      This is accounted for by the fact that
the velocity of the stream of air was much less than that of
the stream of gas ; and, as a general rule, the less the velocity
of the stream of gas the graver the note which affects the flame.
    When a sound, as of a whistle, was sustained and loud, it
could be seen that the brush-like head of the column was broken

290               Sir David Brewster    on the   Polarization
into two separate diverging streams, the size of the enclosed
angle varying with the intensity of the sound*.                  Just as with
the flame, an increase in the velocity of the current diminished
the length of the unbroken stream of air ; and at a great velocity
the head did not split, but was brought down close to the nipple,
after the manner of the experiments of Dr. Young, to which re
ference has been made.
     Having thus,      I think, proved that the main agent which pro
 duces the change in a sensitive flame is the vibration imparted
to the gas-pipes, it must not be forgotten that the character of
 the orifice in the burner is a very essential part of the pheno
menon, not only determining the shape into which the shrinking
 flame is thrown, but also influencing the pitch of the note which
 most powerfully affects the flame.          A small orifice yields a flame
affected by higher notes than the flame from a larger orifice, where
the velocity of the issuing gas is less, — another expression of a
 fact already stated.        There are other phenomena connected with
this part of the subject, which may be worthy of future consi
deration.

 on the same subject, by Dr. R. Rubenson, has ' appeared in the
 Acts of the Royal Society of Sciences of Upsal §. The observa
 tions which it contains were made with the finest instruments,
 and with a degree of accuracy which had not been attempted by
 previous observers.         They were begun at Upsal in 1859, and
 carried on at Rome between the 6th of June and the 5th of
 August, 1861, at Segni in the Campagna between the 6th and
 the 27th of August, 1861, and at Rome from the 5th of October,
 1861, to the 27th of July, 1862.
     Although Dr. Rubenson has devoted a section of his work to
 ascertain the cause of atmospherical polarization, another section
    * This
            observation at once brought to my recollection the result of an
 experiment I had made, at the request of Dr. Tyndall, some time ago when
 at the Royal Institution : it was a precisely similar splitting up of a column
 of smoke under the influence of the energetic vibrations of a large tuning-
 fork. Whatever merit, therefore, may attach to the priority of this observa
 tion does not belong to myself.

a third to the causes which disturb the polarization of the atmo
sphere, yet the chief object of his labours was to study the daily
variation of the polarization of the maximum point; and so

the description of his polarimeter, of his method of using                   and  it,
the discussion of his observations, with the observations them
selves, occupy three-fourths of his memoir.
    In his section on the Cause of Atmospherical Polarization,
Dr. Rubenson             led to the same conclusion which
                         is                                             had deI
duced from my earliest observations — namely, that the light of
the blue sky        is
                     polarized               by
                                       reflexion from the molecules of air,
and not from vesicles of water with parallel sides, as maintained
 by   Clausius, nor, as conjectured                         by
                                                      others, from extremely
minute drops       of  water,   nor   from   molecules    of aqueous vapour in
an intermediate state between that of gas and that of vesicles.
    According to Arago, the distance of the place of maximum
polarization from the sun was 89°                       6',
                                                     the mean of six observa

                                                                 a
vations, but, like Arago,           Iconsidered 90° to be the nearest ap
proximation to the place of maximum polarization. Dr. Ruben-
 son found    it to undergo, as          did, great variations, chiefly from
                                             I

                                                  reflexion from its particles.
     In his section on the Causes which disturb the Polarization
 of the Atmosphere, Dr. Rubenson found, as                      did, that clouds
                                                                          I
 and fogs   and   smoke     were  the   cause  of  the  greatest perturbations            ;
 and he also found, as           had done*, that the intensity of the po
                                   I
 larization was reduced            the crystals of ice floating in the atmo

    Dr.  Rubenson       has  not   observed     the secondary neutral point
 which I    found sometimes accompanying the neutral point of
 Arago when          rises above the horizon, or

 and he has never been able to see, even under the fine sky of
 Italy, the neutral point which              discovered under the sun, and

 which, I   believe, has not been seen by any other observer than
M. Babinet.
      In 1854 M. Felix Bernard      made several observations at
                                                  f
Bordeaux in order to determine the intensity of the maximum
polarization at different hours of the day. Though made only
on four days of the month of October (from the 16th to the
19th inclusive), he found "that in proportion as the sun ap-

292              Sir David Brewster on     the Polarisation
proaches the meridian, the value of the maximum polarization
 diminishes, that this value increases, on the contrary, in a con
 tinuous manner as the sun recedes from the meridian, and that
 it reaches its maximum when the sun is very near the horizon,
 the amplitude of this variation being about 009."
     On the 16th of October, 1854, the maximum polarization in
 creased gradually after middav from 25° to 0° of the sun's alti
 tude, from 0-6236 to 07051           and on the 19th of October, from
 5° to 35° of the sun's altitude, it diminished from 0-7083 to
 0-6106.      On these two days the maximum polarization, at an
 altitude of 20°, was 0 6582 and 0-6464 respectively, the mean of
 which is 0-6523, differing only 0*12 from 0-64, as computed from
 Fresnel's formula by M. Bernard, from my observation in 1842,
 that, when the sun's altitude was 20°, the intensity of the maxi
 mum polarization at 90° from the sun was equivalent to that
 which would be produced by reflexion from the surface of glass
 whose index of refraction was 1-486, at an angle of 65° 30'*.
    Before he became acquainted with the memoir of M. Bernard,
 Dr. Rubenson had completed his observations on the same sub
ject ; and though they lead to a similar result, yet they possess
 a peculiar value from their having been made with the finest in
 struments, in different localities, at almost all the seasons of the
 year, and under various states of the atmosphere.
    From a careful examination of his observations, Dr. Rubenson
 arrives at the general conclusion " that the atmospheric polariza
 tion is subject to a diminution during the morning, and to an in~
 crease during the evening, without one's being able to assign with
 certainty the precise hour of the minimum polarization." These
changes Dr. Rubenson found to be often influenced by pertur
bations, commonly of short duration, and taking place indiffer
 ently at all hours of the day.       They frequently arise from clouds
 or smoke, and probably often from cirrus too faint to be seen.
According to Dr. Rubenson, the blue colour of the sky, in a
normal state of the atmosphere, and 90° from the sun, is feeble
at sunrise, increases rapidly in intensity, and attains to its maxi
mum some hours before noon, the number of hours being differ
ent at different seasons.       The intensity of the colour diminishes
towards noon.         It then increases, reaches a second maximum
after some hours, and then diminishes quickly towards sunset.
The relation between the blue colour of the sky and the inten
sity of its polarization is a problem which remains to be solved.
    In 1859 M. Liais made observations on the polarization of
the atmosphere during his voyage from France to Brazil, and
at San Domingo in the bay of Rio Janeiro.              His observations

                                of the Atmosphere.                           293
were made at the beginning of dawn and at the end of twilight,
with the view of determining the height of the atmosphere.
From the observations made at sea he obtained 320, and from
the observations made on land o40 kilometres, or 212 miles, as
the height of the atmosphere *.
   The most recent observations on the polarization of the atmo
sphere were made by M. Andres Poey, between 1862 and 1864,
under the tropical sky of the Havannah. The observations them
selves have not been published ; but he states, as one of the
most important of their results, that " at sunrise and sunset the
system of atmospherical polarization ought necessarily to present
two planes of rectangular polarization— one vertical, passing
through the eye of the observer and the sun, and the other hori
zontal, with four inversions of the signs, and four neutral points
90° from each other."
    M. Poey adopts my theory of atmospherical polarization, and
the analogy which           I pointed out between the lines of equal po
larization and the isochromatic lines of biaxal crystals, and be
tween the same lines and those of uniaxal crystals when the
sun is in the zenith, the neutral points now meeting the sunf.
    It will be seen from the preceding details that the subject of
atmospherical polarization has become one of the most important
branches of optical meteorology.                 It has already thrown much
light on the constitution of the atmosphere ; and when it has
been studied in different climates and at different altitudes above
the sea by Alpine travellers and scientific aeronauts, it will doubt
less have still more valuable applications.
    Under this impression            I have been induced to submit to the
 Society    the   rest  of  four  years' observations which        I made at St.
Andrews, and which, along with those already published, will
exhibit the optical condition of the atmosphere on many days
 during every month of the year.

               a                                By the Rev. George C. Ilodgkin-
son.    In  a Letter   to    Professor      Stokes,    Sec. R.S..
    Sik,— I have the honour to forward you an account of some acti

                        Observations among the Alps.                   305'
nometrical observations made last summer on the summit of Mont
 Blanc and at Chamonix, and at the same time to thank the Com
mittee of the Royal Society for the grant which they were so good as
to vote me for that object.
    I reached Chamonix on the 7th of July, in bad weather, which had
been prevailing for some time, but which ushered in a fine week very
opportunely for my work. After allowing a few days for the weather
to settle and for the snow to consolidate, I left Chamonix in the after
noon of Friday the 13th for the Grands Mulcts, having previously
arranged for a corresponding series of observations being taken the
next morning in the valley.         Leaving the Grands Mulets at about
                            I
2\ a.m. on the 14th, reached the summit of Mont Blanc about
8 a.m., and proceeded at once to work.
   I  had brought with me from England two of Newman's mountain-
barometers,      a thermobarometer of Casella, six small thermometers
graduated on the stem (three for the dry-, and three for the wet-
bulb observations), three of the tubes described in Appendix (A), with
two of the actinometers in each.         I carried besides an aneroid by
Cooke, which proved to be of excellent quality.           The third set of
apparatus was taken in some faint hope that          I might be able to ar
range for a third set of simultaneous readings at the Grands Mulets.
          I
In this was disappointed. Notwithstanding the greatest care had
been taken, one of the barometers was found on the Brevent on the
 9th to be deranged, and one of the actinometers to be broken ; and
on the 12th a second actinometer was broken at Chamonix by an ac
cident.     I  thought it best to leave the remaining barometer for the
valley observations, and to depend upon the thermobarometer, as being
more portable and less liable to fracture, for the readings on the
summit.       I was eventually obliged to rest satisfied with a single ob
servation of this ; and the downward range of the small thermometer
unfortunately proved too limited for the wet-bulb readings.          Thus
the meteorological observations at the upper station are of the scan
tiest. Neither above nor below were the actinometrical readings so
continuous as     I  had wished to make them.     I had no one with me on
the summit capable of rendering me the smallest assistance ; but it
is some consolation to think that, even had this been otherwise, the
results could not, under the circumstances, have been materially
enhanced.
   There either did not exist,' or I failed to detect, as the sun's
altitude increased, anything like a uniform progression of actinic
power at either station during the limited time in which the obser
vations were continued.
   The results do little more than determine the ratio of the average
intensity at the two stations for a portion of the forenoon. This
indeed was the main object which I had in view.         For looking at the
experience of Principal Forbes under easier conditions, when the
continuance of the observations, as long as the clearness of the sky
might last, presented no difficulty, I did not at all anticipate being
able to trace a dependence of the actinic power on the hygrometric
    Phil. Mag. S. 4. VoL 33. No. 223. April 1867.                  X

306     Royal Society:   — Rev. G. C. Hodgkinson's Actinometrical
state  of the atmosphere. He thus remarks (Bakerian Lecture, Phil.
Trans, part 2 for 1842, p. 253) of the experiments on the Faulhorn
and at Brienz, that "it cannot he affirmed they are sufficient to show
the kind of dependence which the opacity has on the dampness, and
that the values of the coefficient of extinction do not present any cor
respondence     with the hygrometric variations;" and again, p. 268,
" It must be confessed that no evident relation to the hygrometric
condition of the air appears in the individual observations."
    From the experiments of the 14th of July the actinic ratio between
the summit of Mont Blanc and Chamonix, from 9h 31m to 10h llm
apparent time, presents, with a single exception, a gradual decrease
from l-244 to 1-206. The interest of a comparison of these results
with those which Principal Forbes obtained between the Faulhorn
and Brienz is unfortunately diminished by the fact that his actino-
meter was not furnished with an internal thermometer for ascer
taining the temperature of the liquid employed.         This was ammonio-
sulphate   of copper,  which has a  coefficient of dilatation  varying from
 1 at 60° F., to 2-562 at 32° F., and 0-626 at 100° F.         His recorded
numbers for three hours before and three hours after apparent noon
derived from his freehand curve, are as follows : —
                 Hour.                                Ratio.

                   3                                  1-217
   At 10h on the Faulhorn the ratio seems to have been rapidly in
creasing; on Mont Blanc it was slowly diminishing.               The actual
amount of the ratio at 1 0b is almost exactly coincident in the two
cases ; but at I lh on the Faulhorn it was 1-345, a value much higher
than any which was obtained at any time on Mont Blanc, or seemed
likely to have been obtained at that hour had the observations been
continued so long.      What share the greater depression of the lower
station in the experiments of 1832, the more complete isolation of
the upper station in those of 1866, Or variable atmospheric conditions
in both sets may severally have had in contributing to this effect, re
mains a matter for future investigation.        The respective heights of
the stations are as follows : —

   The sky during the observations   was not only cloudless,     but, as seen
' from the summit, remarkably clear.
   The observations have all been reduced by means of Tables derived
 from Gmelin's '
                 Chemistry,' vol. i. p. 231, to what they would have
 been had the mean temperature of the liquid during each minute
 been 32°   F.
   By  a prolonged and careful comparison of actinometers (K) and
 (A) the factor for reducing the indications of (K) to the standard
 of (A) was found to be T29.
   Considerable practice is necessary to acquire expertness       in the use
of the actinometer employed.      It is desirable, as nearly as may be,
to work it at such a temperature that the rise in the sun may be
equal to the fall in the shade.   If the mean of the two mean tempe
ratures of the liquid, in taking the shade observations which precede
and follow a given sun, differ much from the mean temperature of
the liquid during that sun, a sensible error will be introduced.
This, however, is to a great extent eliminated by taking the mean of
three, and still more completely by taking the mean of five suc
cessive actinic results in column (1).
    The difficulty of using the instrument was overcome by the kind
 cooperation of several friends for the Chamonix observations. To
 the good offices of my cousin, Mr. G. F. Hodgkinson, were added
 those of a lady, a worthy sister of one of the foremost mathematicians
 of his year, and her two nieces.     Under her auspices an admirable
 arrangement of the work was made, by which each of the party was
 responsible for a precise and definite function, the adjustment and
 direction of the instrument, with the shading and unshading, the
 watch, the readings, and the records. To this friendly and efficient
 help I am greatly indebted for whatever success has been achieved.
 How small this  is, no one can be more sensible than myself; yet         I
 venture to hope that when the difficulty of the undertaking        con
                                                                     is
 sidered, to those at least who are acquainted with the experience of
 Principal Forbes in 1832, 1841, and 1842, as given     in  his Bakerian
 Lecture, the results will not appear either disappointing or discou
raging.    The season was extremely unfavourable for the further pro
secution of the work.     Looking to the imperfection of the instrument
employed by Principal Forbes in his observations in 1832,          would
                                                                   it
seem to be highly desirable that his experiments on the column of
air between the Faulhorn and Brienz should be repeated, and that
other pairs of stations, intermediate in character to that and the
Chamonix pair, should be essayed.    I    have selected, in the hope of
future opportunities, the following among others — :

  While simultaneous observations    at several adjacent stations of
progressive heights are much to be desired, it should not be forgotten
how largely the condition of simultaneousness at even only two sta
tions adds to the difficulty of the work.       And the question arises,
whether detached readings of the actinometer (with the accompany
ing meteorological facts) taken at various points, as opportunity
offers, may not be encouraged with advantage.         An accumulation of
these, carefully reduced and tabulated, could hardly fail to be valu
able ; and they may be obtained with comparative facility.       It would
indeed only be prosecuting these observations as we do those of at
mospheric temperature and pressure.        In process of time we might
hope   to obtain the mean   actinic power  at stations of various heights
and circumstance for different altitudes of the sun.
   Since the scale of each actinometer is empirical, in order that ob
servations with different instruments may be comparable, a standard
of reference is necessary.      If
                                 such a standard were kept at Kew, and
each instrument employed were marked with a factor of reduction,
ascertained by careful comparison, a great encouragement would be
afforded to actinometry ; nor can any material progress in that de
partment of observation be looked for until some such arrangement
is made.    The actine-standard of Sir J. Ilerschel can hardly be snid
now to have been preserved ; to recover               it,

trary standard, which may be assigned without any such trouble
will answer every purpose,       seems best at once to resort to this.
                                it
I    would venture, in conclusion, to couple with my thanks to the
Committee for their kind encouragement, an earnest recommendation
that measures be taken to provide      astandard actinometer accessible

                              Description of the Actinometer.
   The actinometer employed consists of a thermometer with a sphe
rical bulb one inch in diameter, and a tube, of which an inch and a
half next the bulb     for      is,
                            reason which will presently be apparent,
                                            a
left unsealed.  The succeeding ten inches      made to represent, as     is
nearly as may be, the range from 40° F. to 45° F.    At eleven inches

and a half from the bulb the tube is widened, so that the following
inch and a half may represent the range from 45° F. to 115° F. The
tube then finishes in a spheroidal chamber, of which the diameters
are about an inch and half an inch.       The widened portion of the tube
may   be   dispensed  with, as the correction which it serves to ascertain
may   be    otherwise  found  by means of a Table experimentally con
structed for each instrument.       In that case the spheroidal chamber,
in which the tube will then terminate at eleven and a half inches
from the bulb, should be made somewhat larger.             The fluid em
ployed    is alcohol coloured with a drop of pure aniline-blue.     A con
siderable quantity of air is left in the chamber. As a running column
has to be read at a particular instant, great plainness is the first requi
site for the scale.     On this account graduation on the tube has not
been adopted ; but at an inch and a half from the bulb is attached
an ivory scale, nine-tenths of an inch broad and eleven and a half
inches long (or somewhat less if the widened tube be dispensed with),
its other extremity coinciding with the commencement of the sphe
roidal chamber. This scale is graduated throughout in millimetres.
The number of millimetres corresponding to each degree Fahr. on the
tube of narrow bore, and to every fifth degree from 45° to 115° on
the widened tube, should be noted on the back of the scale.
   The principle of the instrument is the same as that of Sir J. Her
schel' s ; and it is to be worked according to the directions given by
him in ' The Manual of Scientific Enquiry.'           It was devised for
mountain use, where the weight of the Herschel and the fragility of
its internal thermometer are elements of difficulty.      It has also the
advantage of being less costly. The air- chamber is made to serve the
purpose of the screw in the Herschel, viz. that of altering at will,
according to circumstances, the range of the thermometer.           This is
effected by throwing off into the chamber a greater or less quantity
of fluid, retaining it there by holding the instrument with the cham
ber end somewhat lower than the bulb, and working with the remain
ing column.      As alcohol expands unequally between its freezing- 8nd
boiling-points, a small correction is necessary, depending on the tem
perature of the alcohol at the time of working.      This temperature is
ascertained by noting the point in the widened tube, at which the
column stands, when the fluid is thrown off into the chamber.          The
excess of this temperature above 45° F., the point from which the
fluid is thrown off, has to be added to the temperature between 40°
and 45° shown by the head of the working column, in order to have
the true temperature.        From the openness of the scale, and con
sequent small range of the instrument for any one adjustment, it is
necessary to select for working a temperature not much removed from
that at which the rise in the sun is equal to the fall in the shade.
This temperature, which may be called the temperature of equili
brium, will vary practically, according to the solar intensity, from
some 5° F. to 20° F. above the temperature of the surroundiug in
fluences.      By driving the fluid into the chamber until the tempera
ture of equilibrium is represented at a point near the middle of the
tube, the readings will go on for a considerable time without altering

                                 Geological Society   :   —
the quantity of fluid in the chamber, and ten inches of graduation
are found to be ample under all circumstances.         By thus taking all
the readings, so to speak, on the balance, a uniformity of proceeding
is secured, which is not without its value.         The instrument, con
structed according to the dimensions here given, will denote the in
tensity of the noonday sun at the summer solstice near the sea-level
in England by about 100 divisions of the scale.
   Owing to the difficulty of shading satisfactorily, and anomalies
found to occur in observing among the snow-fields on the high crests
of the Alps, the following contrivance has been adopted : —
   A plain telescope-tube of bright metal, 18 inches long and 2|
inches in diameter, open at both ends, is pierced in its central section
with a circular hole        \\
                             to 1^ inch in diameter, from which springs
a flanged shoulder projecting about          inch to receive
                                             -J-                 perforated
                                                                      a
split bung, which clasps the thermometer-stem and holds the bulb
firmly in the centre of the axis of the tube. Two caps, fitted at the
ends with clean plate-glass, are made to slide off and on at the two
ends to admit of the glasses being readily wiped.            By protecting
these with      little wadding, the tube serves as
                   a                                     case for two acti-

the blocks of saccharoid sandstone scattered on the surface of
many parts of the Chalk-districts, which appear to have been derived

crystalline structure ; but the hardest of those found in situ were
resolvable into sand by the action of hydrochloric acid, and ap
peared to be merely held together by a calcareous cement.
    A block resting on the Red Crag near Woodbridge was found
on analysis to contain no lime, excepting a small quantity in the
form of silicate.
    The springs in the gravel-bed at Crowfield near Coddenham are
chalybeate, containing in solution lime and iron, which are pre
cipitated on standing ; and much carbonic acid is evolved from a
well sunk through the gravel : the author considered that the
carbonic acid may have been the solvent agent in forming the
calcareous cement, and that the first stage of the consolidation of
the blocks of saccharoid sandstone may have been by the agency of

solution, when in contact with silica, giving rise to silicate of lime,
a very small proportion of which would form a powerful cement in
agglutinating siliceous particles together.
    2. " Notes on    some   Chemical Analyses of variegated Strata."
By George Maw, Esq., F.G.S., F.L.S., &c.
    The author gave the results of some analyses for the determination
of Iron in the light and dark parts of variegated Slates, Sandstones,
and Marls, the colour of which is due to oxide of iron, and of
which the variegation appears to be disposed independently of
mechanical arrangement.       The analysis in each case exhibited the
fact that the lighter blotches, spots, and stripes contained a smaller
portion of the colouring oxide than the average mass, a proportion
which implies an actual difference in the percentage of the metallic
iron, and which could not be accounted for by any mere difference in
 the state of its combination. This shows an actual departure of a part
 of the colouring oxide out of the colourless patches, and a dispersive
process which seemed to be the very reverse of the segregation of
 nodules of Carbonate of Lime and Carbonate of Iron out of a clayey
 matrix.    Among the forms of variegation referred to were : — (1st)
 that resulting from the segregation of dark blotches out of a lighter
 matrix, the evenness of colour of which does not appear to have been
 materially affected by the withdrawal of a part of its colouring- matter;
 (2nd) that resulting from the segregation of dark blotches out of a
 lighter ground, each of which is concentrically surrounded by a distinct
 and well-defined zone lighter than the general ground ; (3rd) strata
 variegated with light blotches containing a smaller proportion of
 colouring-matter than the general ground, but not arranged con
 centrically round a darker nucleus ; (4th) the variegation of coloured
 strata with both light and dark blotches, containing respectively
 a smaller and larger proportion of the colouring oxide than the
 general ground, but which are not arranged, as in the 2nd case, con
centrically with each other.

  ON THE      THERMAL RADIATION PRODUCED BY FLUORESCENCE.
               BY PROFESSOR VICTOR PIERRE OF PRAGUE.
 T^HE question       has been repeatedly asked whether radiant heat also
       is produced by fluorescence ; and Studincka ( Wien. Akad. Ber.
xliv. 2. p. 289) and Prince Salm-Horstmar have convinced them
 selves that the answer must be affirmative.       As regards visible rays,
it is virtually superfluous to put the question ; for it is established
 that by fluorescence such visible rays are formed as are known to
 produce heating effects ; and the only question that can arise is,
whether by fluorescence obscure rays also are formed — those, that
is to say, whose wave-length is greater than that of the extreme
red rays.
    This question engaged my attention nine years ago, yet without
yielding satisfactory results ; my want of success I attributed to the
very imperfect apparatus at that time at my disposal.               I have
since resumed the investigation with better apparatus and in a more
favourable locality, and my results form the subject of this paper.
    The best way of deciding the question appeared to be to trans
 mit the light of the sun, or of an artificial constant source of light,
first through a medium which is transparent, but at the same time
opake (or nearly so) to obscure rays ; the transmitted rays are then
to be received on the free surface of a fluorescent substance, and the
thermoscopic action of the reflected rays measured.       Inverting, then,
the process by allowing the light first to act directly on the fluores
cent substance, and then, before it impinges on the thermoscope,
passing it through the opake medium, there ought to be a diminu
tion of the thermal action in the second case, provided obscure rays
were formed by fluorescence.
    If s is the quantity of luminous rays, and d that of the obscure
rays in incident light, the quantity of rays emerging from the inter
posed plate are as and fid.         By reflexion these rays are changed
into pas and p'fid.       By fluorescence, a new quantity of luminous
and obscure rays are formed — by the radiation as the quantity fas
of luminous send   fas    of obscure rays, by the radiation ftd the quan
tity f'fid of obscure rays. Hence the total radiation acting on the
thermoscope is
                   M=as(p'+f)+pd(fi' +/") +/'«*.
    If the light falls directly on the fluorescent substance, there is ob
tained in reflected light the quantity of rays ps and p'd, owing to
mere reflexion ; by fluorescence there are added the quantities/* of
luminous tad    ft   of obscure rays from the incident radiation s, and,
further, the quantity f'd of obscure rays from the radiation d. If
these rays pass through the same plate as before, the quantities
emerging are as(p+f) of visible, and fid(p +f")+fif's of obscure
rays ; so that the quantity of rays acting on the thermoscope will be
                    M,=*8(p+f)+pd(p,+f")+ftf's.

I     instituted the experiments both with, the light of           Locatelli's a
lamp and with that of the sun. But as the intensity of the rays in
the former case was so small that no perceptible phenomena of fluo
rescence were produced,         laid no weight on the results obtained,

galvanometer     ;  and in my subsequent experiments           used sunlight
                                                                     I
exclusively.      But even here material difficulties are met with. The
alteration of the radiation, due to the varying heights of the sun
and to the changes in the condition of the atmosphere, must be care
fully allowed for mistakes are to be avoided. Hence those experiments
                     if
alone can yield useful results which are obtained at midday — that is,
when the height of the sun           constant, or nearly so, and .with as
                                       is
cloudless   a  sky as possible. The experiments were made by reflect
ing the light brought horizontally into the chamber by Silbermann's        a
heliostat on second metallic mirror suitably inclined to the horizon.
                a
The light reflected from the metallic mirror was collected in quartz               a
lens of pretty long focus placed in           metal screen, and was then
                                                   a
thrown on the open surface of fluorescent liquid.
                                            a                 This latter was
 contained in    a shallow dish between two metal screens, which were
 provided with apertures for the passage of the incident and reflected
 rays, and fixed in        suitable manner.
                              a                  The thermopile was pro
vided with   a   short additional tube on the side turned to the source
 of heat, and was placed quite near the aperture of the posterior
 screen,, so that     could take up the reflected pencil of rays as com
                     it
 pletely as possible.
    For measuring the current, an ordinary astatic thermomultiplier
 made with silver wire was used.             third screen was used to cut

 the height of the liquid should be such that the reflected pencil of rays
 could completely reach the thermopile.           For the interposed plate
I   used an alum plate about           millims. in thickness
                                        2                        and     tried,

 besides this, a dark-violet glass which transmitted no red rays, as
 well as glasses of other colours (green, blue, and brown).                  As
 fluorescent liquids,       used an ether alcoholic extract of dry leaves
                            I

 prepared by Rochleder from aesculine (Rochleder's                solution of

    Denoting the two positions of the interposed plates as anterior and

    Hence in both fluorescent liquids the thermoscopic action of the re
flected ray was the same whether the interposed plate was in the incident
 or reflected light. As itcan scarcelybe assumed that in all cases a=/3,
 the less so that the result was the same even when glasses of different
 colours were interposed, it is clear that, though it cannot perhaps be
 maintained that no obscure radiation is produced by fluorescence, yet
         f
 it is so small as to produce no appreciable thermal action — therefore
 that if    is not =0,it can have but an extremely small value. In most
 cases I am inclined to the first assumption, thaty = 0 ; only in the
 case of chlorophyll-solution        the case is doubtful, inasmuch as
 might there have a very small value scarcely differing from zero.
                                                                        f
 For if the composition of the mixture of colours produced by fluores
 cence be prismatically analyzed, in no case within my knowledge"
 does the visible radiation extend to the extreme limit of the red, in.
many cases scarcely beyond the orange, and seldom further than into
 the neighbourhood of Fraunhofer's line C; hence it is not to be-
expected that obscure rays of greater wave-length than the extreme
red should occur in appreciable intensity. — Poggendorff 's Annalen,

            ON THE DYNAMIC          THEORY OF DEEP-SEA      TIDES.
                             BY E.   J.  STONE, ESQ.
   In the March Number of the Philosophical Magazine is an interest
ing paper by Mr. D. D. Heath,
                                        " On the Dynamical Theory of Deep-
sea Tides, and the Effect of Tidal Friction."           On page 185 Mr.
Heath states as follows : — " The Astronomer Royal having (by an
oversight, I venture to think) convinced himself that no effect on the
earth's rotation can be produced by those forces of the first order,
with friction, of which his own canal theory took account, seeks for

such an effect entirely in a current produced         by forces of the second
or higher orders."         It is clear, however, that  the Astronomer Royal
is right and Mr. Heath wrong.            Mr. Heath's   mistake is on the same
page (185), where he determines the moment             tending to destroy the
earth's rotation.       The moment, according to       Mr. Heath, is
 where
                      y=    c cos 2oi.
     Mr. Heath has not here seen that in his approximate solution to
the first order, y2 must be neglected, because it is of the same order
as the forces of the second order, which have been neglected through
out the solution.       If we neglect y2, the moment reduces to zero, as
Mr. Airy found.

      ON THE    DIRECTION       OF  VIBRATIONS IN POLARIZED LIGHT.
                                 BY M. MASCART.
     Mr. Stokes*     was the first who proposed to use the phenomenon
of diffraction in gratings for deciding the important question of the
 direction of vibrations in polarized light.          He observed that if the
plane of polarization of the incident light is oblique to the lines of
 the grating, the diffracted light is polarized in another plane.          As
 suming the vibrations to be parallel or perpendicular to the plane of
 polarization, he calculated what ought to be the displacement of the
 plane of polarization of the diffracted light, and he has thought him
self entitled to conclude that FresnePs opinion was correct, namely,
 that the vibrations are perpendicular to the plane of polarization.
 Holtzmannf replaced the gratings made on glass with a diamond by
 those made with lampblack ; and the result of his experiments is in
 disaccordance with the hypothesis of Fresnel.             EisenlohrJ, finally,
 has considered the question from another point of view, by taking
 into account the influence of the longitudinal vibrations, which had
 been hitherto neglected.
   - Having at my
                      disposal a grating of unusual perfection, I endea
 voured to repeat these experiments by comparing the intensities of
 the light diffracted at the same distance by two incident pencils, one
 of which was polarized parallel, and the other at right angles to the
 lines of the grating.       These two pencils are obtained polarized at
 right angles by placing before the slit of a collimator two pieces of
 the same tourmaline the axes of which are crossed, or, better, a crys
 tal of Iceland spar whose ordinary and extraordinary pencils are sepa
 rated on emerging from the crystal.          The grating is placed at right

  angles to the path of the incident light, and the lines are on the
  second face of the plate.
     Observing with the astronomical telescope, two superposed spectra
  are seen in the field, arising from the two halves of the incident
 pencil.   As long as the deviation is small the intensities are vir
 tually equal ; but from 30° the difference becomes appreciable, and
 goes on increasing in a regular manner ; the feeblest spectrum arises
 from the pencil polarized parallel to the lines of the grating.
 The same test, repeated with the spectra diffracted by reflexion,
 taking care that this time the lines should be on the first face, gave
 the same result.
    From Mr. Stokes's explanation, assuming that refraction takes
 place before diffraction, the ratio of the amplitudes of the two dif
 fracted pencils should be equal to the cosine of the deflection.     To
 determine this ratio, the two pencils are to be received on a Nicol,
arranged so that the two images may become equal. The following
are the results of a series of measurements made with the Drummond
light, the grating being placed as in the first experiment : —

    The agreement is not very close ; but, allowing for the difficulties
attendant on measuring the intensities, the feebleness of the light
used, and the enfeeblement of the light diffracted at a great angular
distance, these differences are seen to be due to errors of observa
tion. In any case the more rapid enfeeblement of the pencil polarized
parallel to the lines appears discordant with M. Holtzmann's views,
and confirmatory of the ideas of -Mr. Stokes.
    The explanation of diffraction by gratings is complicated in theory
by the longitudinal vibrations, whose action is not well understood,
and in practice by phenomena of polarization by interference, which
are produced by striated lamina, as has been shown by M. Fizeau. —

  XLIII.    On one  of Ohm's Laws relating to an Insulated Circuit.
                        By F. C. Webb, C.E.*
              of the formulae given by Ohm are in constant use in
MANY      practical telegraphy, and have thus for years borne the
test of experiment.       There are, however, some others which,
having at present apparently no practical bearing on telegraphy,
have not been so frequently tested, or, indeed, noticed, even if they
have ever before been subjected to experiment, except by Ohm
himself.
    The following experimental verification of a very peculiar pro
perty of the galvanic circuit (certain conditions being fulfilled
which, it will be seen, should have been specfied by Ohm) may
perhaps be of interest to those who take an interest in the science
of electricity.
    The problem relates to the alteration in the distribution of the
tensions in an insulated closed galvanic circuit when one point
of the circuit is connected to an insulated conducting body, and
is thus stated in the translation given by Mr. W. Francis of-
 Ohm's paper : —f
    " Since each place of a galvanic circuit undergoes of itself the
 same change' to which a single place was compelled, the change
 in the quantity of electricity, extending over the whole circuit, is

city is diffused in the galvanic circuit, and imagine this circuit
touched at any one place by a non-conducting body*, and desig
nate by m, the electric force at this place before contact, by u that
after contact, the change produced in the force in this place is
Mj— u; consequently the change of the whole quantity of elec
tricity in the circuit is («,— u)r. If, now, we suppose that the
electricity in the touched body is diffused over the space R, and
is at all places of equal strength, and at the same time that at the
place of contact itself the circuit and the body possess the same
electric force, viz. u, it is evident «R will be the quantity of elec
tricity imparted to the body, and
                              (ul—u)r=uR)
whence we obtain
                                       w,r
                                   r+ R
The intensity of the electricity received by the body will there
fore be the more nearly equal to that which the circuit possessed
at the place of contact before being touched the smaller R is
with respect to r; it will amount to the half when R = r, and
become weaker as R becomes greater in comparison with r."
   This problem, as stated by Ohm, if taken according to the
strict reading of the wording, is not correct, and requires a
further proviso, as will easily be seen.
   Ohm has treated all bodies as having an inductive capacity
                                                       "
simply proportional to their surface, in which case the density
                                                                "
                    wou^ always         proportional to the

 (°r   lurfacef)
                                   De
"potential."     Consequently one term would serve for both these
properties  of electricity;and accordingly we find the term " elec
troscopic force," employed        by
                               Ohm, standing indiscriminately for
both tension and density.
   Thus we find, in defining what Ohm calls " tension "    e. elec (t.
tromotive force of modern language), the following quotation,
showing the word
                    " electroscopic force " employed as tension or
potential of our present phraseology —
   " The mode in which electricity makes its appearance at the

  And again —

   And with regard to its employment in the sense of the term,
density, we have only to look at Ohm's definition of quantity —                          :
   " We shall in future term the sum of the electroscopic actions
referred to the magnitude of the elements —
                                                                by by
                                                       which, therefore,
we have to understand the force multiplied             the magnitude                         of
the space over which         diffused in the case where the same force
                               it   is
prevails at all places in this space — the quantity of electricity,
without intending to determine anything thereby with respect to
the material nature of electricity."
   Here, therefore, evidently since space (or surface) multiplied                            by
        " electroscopic       action or
the                                       force" equals the quantity             of   electri
city,   it   is   evident that                 equals electroscopic action orforce,
or, in fact, electroscopic action or force stands here for density.
   In the quotation stating the problem itself, will be seen,    it                          by
the meaning of the words
                              " and at the same time that at the
place of contact itself the circuit and the body possess the same
electric force, viz. u," that here
                                    " electric force " means tension

of contact, yet the density would be much greater on the body
R  than on the conductor at the point of contact.        These two

324            Mr. F. C. Webb    on one of Ohm's Laws
operations on the part of Messrs. Bright and Clark,     I performed
an experiment     to test the  accuracy  of this law.  In  order to
render the whole problem and experiment intelligible, it will be
better to illustrate it geometrically.
   Let C A represent the resistance of the battery of seventy-
one elements and having a resistance of 520 Siemens's units, and
A B the resistance of 78 nautical miles of cable having a resistance
also of 520 units, the number of elements having been selected in
order to equal this resistance.     Let C Q represent the electro
motive force of the battery of seventy-one elements ; then if
the pole C of the battery and the end B of the cable are con
nected to earth, the tension at A will be A L = half C Q.        But
if the circuit is formed by joining the end B of the cable to the
pole C previously to any charge existing in the cable, and when
the. battery is also carefully insulated, the tension at A will be
AH^=-g        j:  supposing  this the zinc plate or negative pole,
the tension A H will be negative, and the tension at C and at B,
which is now joined to C, will rise to C K and B D equal and
opposite in name to A H.
   The line of tension throughout the circuit is represented,
therefore, by the step-like line K H in the battery, and by the
line H D in the cable. The quantity of electricity in the cable
and its distribution is represented by the equal triangles A H 0
and 0 D B, the first negative, the second positive.     The distri
 bution of the electricity on the surface of the battery is repre
sented by the triangles (with step-like hypothenuses) C    KP    and
PAH;      but the equality of these triangles with those represent
ing the quantity in the cable does not show equality in the
quantity on the battery with that in the cable, on account of the
minute inductive capacity of the former as compared with that

                  relating to an Insulated Circuit.              325
of the latter. Indeed this quantity is inappreciable, and vanishes
in the problem.
   A length of cable B M forty-three miles in length, of the same
pattern as the length A B, and having its end M insulated, was
attached to the circuit at B, thus representing the " body R
                                                                 " of
Ohm's problem.       This becomes charged, subtracting electricity
from the dynamic charge of the circuit ; and by Ohm's formula
the line of tension H D should fall to a position 6 E such that
the quantity of electricity represented by the parallelogram
6HDE which the circuit has lost shall equal the charge which
the length B M has received, and which is represented by the
parallelogram B F M Z, whilst still preserving the necessary con
dition that the tension throughout the length B M, represented
by B F, shall equal the tension B E, to which the tension at B
has fallen in the cable forming the principal part of the circuit.
   The tension at B was accordingly measured, before the length
B M was added, by placing it in contact with a condenser having
an inductive capacity equal to that of one mile of cable, and then
discharging the condenser through a galvanometer, the swing of
the needle reaching 7°.      The quantity thus subtracted from the
circuit, though, strictly speaking, slightly altering the conditions,
is so small as to produce no sensible difference.   The length B M
being now added, the condenser was again charged by contact
at B and discharged through the galvanometer, and gave a swing
of 4°-3.
   Now by Ohm's formula we have
                                  u,r
                                r+U

                     7 x 78
                       —
consequently   u—            = 4"5 instead of 4"3.
                    7o + 4o
   The difference between the calculated and observed values of
m  are, it may be fairly admitted, within the limits of error occa
sioned by the difficulty of reading to the fraction of a degree.

XLIV.          On Binocular Vision.         By Dr. Wilhelm von Bezold*.
          author has recently published some articles on binocular
THEvision     in the Zeitsckrift fiir Biologie\. The object of this
communication     is to give a condensed account of their chief
contents.    A few preliminary observations are here given, in
order to render the matter intelligible to the reader who is not
acquainted with the physiological literature on the subject.
   A theory of binocular vision must first of all satisfy two re
quirements.     On the one hand it must explain the occurrence
of a simple perception of solidity through the cooperation of
both eyes in vision ; on the other hand it must account for the
double images which are produced under certain circumstances.
   For the attainment of this object two methods have been
pursued.             One was followed       by   J.   Miiller, and depends on the
principle which he propounded of the " Identity of the Retinas."
He says the points of the two retinas correspond in pairs in such
a manner that the excitation of two such corresponding      (or, as
he thence calls them, "identical") points always produces a single
perception ; while the excitation of non-identical points always
produces a double image.         But those points are identical on
which, with parallel visual lines (optic axes J), an infinitely
distant point is depicted. On viewing the heavens, for example,
the images of all stars fall upon identical points.
     If
      now, starting from this principle, we seek the geometrical
focus of the points which, for any position whatever of the fixed
point, are formed on identical points of the retina, and must
therefore appear single, we find in general a curve with several
                                 " mathematical Horopter"
branches, which is called the                                §. All
points  which  do  not  lie in  it must,  if the theory  be  correct,
appear double, and at a greater distance the further the two
images are from each other on the double retina.        By
                                                            " double
retina" is to be understood the combination of the two retinas
when they are supposed to be so laid one upon another that
identical points coincide.
   Now experience teaches that the apparent distance of the
double images       in fact, proportional to the distance of cor
                         is,
responding points on the double retina, provided this distance
exceeds certain limits, the " limiting distances" (Grenzdistanzen) .
If   it within these limits, the object appears single, even
          is                                                                  if
                                                                               it
does not lie in the mathematical horopter.       Hence we speak of

an      " empirical
                  horopter/' by which is understood the aggregate
of all points which, in accordance with experience, are observed
single.    The fact just adduced shows that the principle of iden
tity is not strictly valid.  To bring it into unison with the prin
ciple, it was assumed that in vision the attention is exclusively
 devoted to the object fixed, and therefore the double images
 which occur by the way, being simply overlooked, were neglected.
    In spite of this weak part, and of the unsuccessful attempts
to discover by means of the microscope a connexion of the nerve-
fibres leading to identical points, and thus give the theory an
anatomical basis, it kept its ground for a long time, and during
a series of years served as the sole starting-point for all investi
gations upon this subject.
    Views on this matter have taken a different shape since
Wheatstone,    by his ingenious discovery of the stereoscope,
showed that it is just the difference in the two images on the
retina which forms the chief condition for the production of the
perception of solidity.    Stereoscopic experiments showed that
simultaneous    excitation of non-identical points can produce
single perceptions of a special kind which are by no means ex
plained by simply neglecting the double images.
    As the principle of identity in its rigid form was thus shaken,
it was endeavoured to overthrow it completely, and trouble was
taken to prove that it is possible to see double even with
identical points*.    Yet, according to E. Hering's investigations,
all the attempts in this direction must be regarded as complete
failures. The first of my above-mentioned papers had the object of
adducing further proofs of the untenability of this proposition.
   It was now incumbent on the opponents of the theory of
identity to replace by another the principle which they had
rejected.   They did this by making the following assumption: —
The cause of the excitation which a spot in the retina ex
periences is involuntarily sought in the straight line joining
the excited spot with the object; that                 is,   it   is

surface in two points.       It is here presupposed, as is at once
evident, that, by the so-called muscular feeling, we are at all times
cognizant of the position of our eyes.
   In order now to explain the production of the perception of
solidity from this point of view, the assumption was made that
in cases in which a small displacement of the images on the
retina out of the surface of projection is sufficient to obtain a
single image, such a displacement does actually take place ; hence
in such cases the lines of projection should be drawn to their bi
secting points. But as single vision can take place notwithstand
ing the use of prisms (which occasion a considerable deviation
from the normal position of the eyes) — as, further, stereoscopic
images coincide within very wide limits without reference to the
position of the eyes (that                   is,
                                with or without the use of an instru
ment),   — in order to explain this case also, the further assumption
must be made, that under these circumstances the muscular
feeling becomes inactive,
                                " alienated."is
    Thus, as regards simplicity, the projection theory has no ad
vantage over the old theory of identity.          For even     like the                if,
latter,it   can explain the occurrence of double images,          needs                  it

assumption, however,        totally unjustifiable follows most clearly

   In order to explain the perception of solidity, the theory of pro
jection, just like the theory of identity, must abnegate complete
precision, and admit exceptional cases.        In order to explain
stereoscopic phenomena, as well as those which occur with the
use of prisms,      again needs an auxiliary hypothesis.

identical places may be, and yet allow of single perception.

Taking into consideration    the result obtained, that this devia
tion   must  always      within
                           be    tolerably narrow limits, it will
be seen that these phenomena accord with the principle of
identity, if we only consider "identical points" replaced by
" corresponding places."
   The latter construction of the principle is moreover more
natural and probable than the older one referring to mathe
matical points.   For even in monocular vision points are only
seen separate when the distance of their images on the retina
exceeds certain limits ; how much more must this be the case
for images on separate retinas.    Hence the principle in its new
modification by no means loses in precision ;        Pig.l.
but when 'brought into unison with the spe
cial fact just mentioned, it acquires a form
which corresponds far better to all physio
logical representations and analogies than
the original one.
   The rarity with which double images in
general are seen is at the same time ex
plained.    For    taking as

               2

 figures show that even with a very moderate distance of the
fixed point, the space in which alone double images are perceived
is extremely limited.     It      is,
                                 moreover, so placed that under ordi
nary circumstances objects will very seldom be found in                      it,
since, as    amatter of fact, we involuntarily endeavour to avoid it.
    If we invert this principle, we arrive at another, which                 is
moreover easily intelligible, that under ordinary circumstances
the images of all points fall upon almost identical places.        In
this the distance of he images

further, the occurrence of
crossed       and   homonymous
images       isequally probable,
it follows     further that the
 images corresponding to one and the same object fall, on the
 average, on corresponding points.

  Finally there remains the question whether stereoscopic pheno
mena accord with the assumption.        Before entering on an inves
tigation of this point, we must be clear as to the meaning to
be assigned to the words Sensation (Empfindung), Perception
 (Wahrnehmung) , and Conception or Idea (Vorstellung) ; for an
intermixture of these ideas has produced great confusion.
   The objects surrounding us produce on our senses impressions
which come to our consciousness as sensations. By frequently
meeting the same objects, we always perceive the same sums of
sensations.   Every such sum of sensations is in the course of
time apprehended by the memory as a connected whole ; and
thus we attain to conceptions of things, to which latter certain
signs are attached as characteristics.       Meeting an object after
the formation of a conception, the sum of sensations          without             is,
further mental activity, directly combined with the conception to
form    perception.
         a,           Sensations are conceivable without simulta
neous conceptions referring to them       conceptions without simul
                                                 ;

                                            ;
require both simultaneously.
    If an object be looked at with both eyes, or we look into
a  stereoscope, not merely          there formed
                                       is               conception of   a
the object (for     linear drawing would be sufficient for this,
                      a
or even      description), but the sensuous impression imme
              a
diately evokes the conception in so cogent         manner that both
                                                               a
come simultaneously to the consciousness as         single perception.
                                                                   a

merely an optical sensation, but we see the body in question.      The

known kind be touched in any way, held in the hand, we are
no longer conscious of the individual sensations, but we at once
perceive    rope,

                      a     billiard-ball, &c. as such, even

other sense comes to aid that of touch.
   This being premised, the fact that the images projected in
both eyes are blended to      single perception of solidity appears
                                   a
 by  no means strange    and after such considerations no one will
                           ;
consider     necessary to look for an anatomical connexion be
              it
tween so-called identical points.    Why should not single per               a
ception be thus produced just as well as           produced   ittheis                    by
two parts of the skin of adjacent fingers, which, turned to one
another, touch one and the same object                    ?
    From the point of view thus established, we need for ex
plaining the perception of solidity     binocular vision the single
                                                 by
assumption only,   that the impression which   the excitation   two                      of
adjacent parts      the double retina produces depends, under all
                      of
circumstances, on the mutual position                of
                                          these places, even   they                     if

 332             . Archdeacon Pratt on      a Problem in
 allow that the impression       even   with blended double images* is
 different, according as we have to do with a crossed or an un
 crossed one, with a greater or a less distance, experience is
 quite sufficient to explain stereoscopic vision.        For as points
 which lie on the other side of the fixed point always produce
 homonymous, those on this side crossed double images, experi
 ence must gradually lead us to combine with the impression of
 an homonymous blended double image the conception of a more
 distant, with that of a crossed one that of a nearer object.        The
 distance of the double image will give in this way a measure
 for the greater or less distance of the object.
     I  imagine that in this     I  have explained essentially the pro
 duction of the perception of solidity ; that other circumstances
 (such, for instance, as aerial perspective, or the position of the
optical axes) have at any rate a subordinate influence is well
known.        Hence  I  imagine that the following results have been
 arrived at by these investigations : —
      1. Under ordinary circumstances the images of most objects
which are simultaneously           visible are projected upon almost
identical places.
     2. This continuous simultaneous use for the same purpose
justifies us in considering that the peculiar deportment of these
places is an acquired one.         This view is moreover supported by
various other reasons.
     3. Considered     from this point of view, the explanation of
binocular perception of depth presents no difficulty, if it be
allowed that it depends upon the impression which two blended
images produce, according as they are crossed or homonymous,
and more or less distant.

ALTHOUGH  topic, I do   not scruple to ask you to publish a third,

    *  I may be permitted to speak of a double image whenever two points
of the same object occur on the retina, without reference to the question,

terials rearranged, particle from particle.  Let p be the density
of any point r, 6, a> (cos 0=fi) of the body; c, &, a>' the coordi
nates of any external attracted point ; p the cosine of the angle
between r and c ; r and a the general and mean radii of the sur
face; and let r=a.M, u will be greater than 1 for points out
side the sphere of which the radius is a, and less than 1 for
points inside the sphere.
   Our problem is to find the form and law of density of this
imaginary body — that is, to find u and p.    The potential of the

   As the total mass of the imaginary body equals zero, the first
term of this integral vanishes of itself. That the external attrac
tion may be zero, the remainder of the integral must be zero,
and this for all values of c.  Hence

   As p is a function of r, and must be independent of all parti

For those parts of the body which are outside the sphere (of
radius a) u is greater than 1, and the quantity outside the
brackets (as            I
                 show below) becomes infinite, and therefore the
whole expression under the signs of integration is infinite when
» is indefinitely increased, unless u= 1.     As the integral must
not become infinite,                   I
                         come to the conclusion that m=1 or r = a,
and the surface of the imaginary body is a sphere and can have
no other form.

       'ICHTYNE. — A         mineral which I refer to this species was
           brought  to me    by a farmer from Cornwallis, King's co.,
where it had attracted attention as something possibly valuable,
and was known as " little pebbles," a name which, in the absence
of information upon the geological situation of the mineral, gives
some clue as to the mode of its occurrence.                  What   I  received
consisted of several small pieces, either rounded and bean-like
with smooth dull surfaces, or irregular in form with angular
prismatoidal outline and of lustre somewhat glassy.                This lustre
was much more distinctly seen on breaking the pieces ; these were
brittle, and had a conchoidal fracture.              The greatest hardness
observed was about 7'5 ; the specific gravity in three experiments
was respectively 2 775, 2-815, and 2-881, the mean of which
numbers is 2'823.        In colour it was indigo-blue, blue-black, and
greenish black with a grey tint in some parts ; the streak and
powder were white.        Before the blowpipe, fragments frothed and
fused to a dark enamel.         As might be expected from the differ
ences in colour and the varying specific gravity, the composition
of the "pebbles" is not uniform : the constituents appear to be
the same; but their relative proportions are not constant, as is
shown by the following analyses which were made by fusion with
carbonated alkalies for the constituents other than potash and
soda, these being estimated after treatment with fluor-spar and
sulphuric acid. The iron was found to exist both as peroxide
and protoxide, the latter being by far the more abundant ; no
attempt, however, was made to ascertain the exact relative pro
portions on the small amount of mineral in my possession.                   The
nature of the alkalies present was made out by fusion with car
bonate and chloride of barium and subsequent testing with bi
chloride of platinum dissolved in strong alcohol.                 The results
obtained were —                             I.          II.          III.

   Since the iron exists in small proportion as peroxide, there is
a close general accordance between the numbers found, especi
ally in the third analysis, and those given for Wichtyne by Lau
rent (Dana's 'Mineralogy,' 4th edit. p. 177), viz.: —

    The physical characters of Wichtyne, as stated by Laurent,
agree upon the whole tolerably well with those given above ;
they are — specific gravity 3-03, hardness sufficient to scratch
glass, colour black, lustre dull.        There is therefore little doubt
that the Nova Scotian mineral now described is rightly referred
to the species Wichtyne, which, taking all its characters and its
composition into consideration, it resembles more closely than it
does any of the allied minerals, glaucophane, violan, Sordawalite,
and tachylite. The whole group is of extremely rare occurrence,
none of the members of it apparently being found at more than
one or two localities.       The only locality given for Wichtyne is
Wichtis in Finland, whence Hausmann changes Laurent's de
signation to Wichtisite, which seems preferable.            The matrix of

 mineral was fused with about four times its weight of the mixed
 alkaline carbonates, the alumina was not perfectly separated from
 the silica, but the quantity retained was not large enough to be

 with chloride and carbonate of barium, and subsequent testing
 with bichloride of platinum in alcohol.              The iron is given as

with which mineral, however, the Merigomish pencil-stone
agrees in its softness, texture, and colour.         It is decidedly differ
ent from the "pencil-slate" of Von Cotta (Rocks Classified,
p. 264), which he describes as separated or separable into pen
cils.    Very characteristic specimens of this were found some
years ago by Dr. Dawson and myself in lower carboniferous
rocks at Horton Bluff, at the mouth of the Avon, N.S., in a

    Variegated Soft Slate. — Among the Devonian rocks at Beech
  '
Hill near Kentville, King's co., is found a very soft mineral which
somewhat resembles the pencil-stone just described; it is ex
ceedingly easily cut with a knife, writes well on a slate, adheres
slightly to the tongue, and has the same elements, as shown by
a qualitative analysis, the peroxide of iron, however, being much
more abundant (the alkalies were not tested for).      It glistens on
a fresh surface as if from the presence of minute scales of mica.
Its characteristic quality is that of showing, when cut to a smooth
surface, sets of concentric bands of different colours (which may
be described as white, grey, yellow, and red, and tints made up
of mixtures of these) and varying thicknesses about a centre of
a long oval shape.     The colours arise of course from variations
in the amount and state of oxidation of the iron present.         The
material is very much admired, and would form handsome inlaid
work not subject to friction.

    Indian Pipe-stone. — mention here as probably in composition
 analogous to the preceding, a dark-coloured nearly black mi
neral,   found on the Montengan shore in the district of Clare,
Digby co., in the extreme west of the province, which was used
 by the Micmac Indians for making their stone pipes. The rocks
 at Montengan Cave, Poole describes (Report on Gold Fields, Nova
 Scotia, 1862) as slates of varying hardness : he could not find
 the seam from which the specimen of pipe-stone given him, to,
 which I am now referring, was obtained.          The pipe-stone of
 Dana (Mineralogy, p. 252) is clay-slate, a greyish-coloured
 variety from Oregon having been analyzed by Thomson, and is
 mentioned in connexion with Catlinite, described as a reddish
 claystone.
    Bitumen in Calcite. — This interesting addition to the minerals
 of the province was made by W. Barnes, Esq., Mining Engineer
 of Halifax, who kindly furnished me with specimens, and gave
 me some details as to its mode of occurrence.        It is found in
 Inverness co., Cape Breton, in an elevated range of altered rocks
 in which the lower carboniferous strata are apparent. Limestone
 is abundant but very much altered, and rests at a high angle of
 inclination on altered black shales containing much pyrites;
 gypsum also occurs in the neighbourhood.
     The mineral is dull black externally ; it breaks with a con-
 choidal fracture, giving a very brilliant jet-black surface.     It ia
 scattered in separate masses on the surface of a highly siliceous
 rock, containing pyrites among calcite in six-sided prisms and
 in dog-tooth crystals.     Some of these masses are an inch or
 more in length, of rounded outline, and lie free ; others, smaller,

 are nearly surrounded by groups of crystals ; in one case a mass
 is imbedded in a nearly transparent crystal ; and sometimes the
 calcite when broken exposes a brilliant surface of enclosed mi
 neral.    These masses look occasionally like a drop of black wax
 melted on to a crystal of calcite, and are sometimes perfectly
 globular. It is brittle and affords a black powder.        In a closed
 tube it softens, swells, gives a bituminous odour and a little oil.
 On platinum it swells up and burns with a smoky flame to a
 bulky black porous residue, not having the coherence of coke,
 and finally leaves a very small ash.       It sinks in benzine and
 floats in bisulphide of carbon ; so that its specific gravity is pro
 bably about 1 "1 : it dissolves to a small extent only in these
 menstrua, and after being boiled in them is readily powdered
 under a glass rod.      It cannot be distinguished in appearance
 from the Albertite of New Brunswick, the mineral which has
 been called Albert coal and New-Brunswick asphalt.           It resem
 bles this mineral also   in being slightly affected by benzine ; but
 it dissolves somewhat less freely in bisulphide of carbon, which      I
 find to become rapidly coloured on Albertite, especially when
 heated (this property does not seem to have been noticed in the
 discussion as to the character of this mineral).         Side by side
 with Albertite on an iron plate on which tin had been melted
 for a short time, it smelt of bitumen, became tough and some
 what elastic, and finally rubbed down to a brownish-black powder,
 while the Albertite scarcely smelt, but also became tough and
 somewhat elastic under a glass rod, and rubbed down to a black
powder.      I regret not being able to compare the composition of
these minerals : Professor Anderson of Glasgow was kind enough
to undertake an ultimate analysis of the Cape-Breton bitumen,
but at the close of the combustion an unfortunate accident de
prived him of the results.      There appears unquestionably to be
a close relationship between this mineral and Albertite; and
the occurrence of the former imbedded in a globular form in
calcite is absolute proof that it is not coal.      This mode of oc
currence is precisely similar to that given for some bitumen by
Andrews, in a very interesting paper on Petroleum in its Geo
logical Relations (Silliman's Journal, July 1866, p. 40), who
found " among the crystals of calc-spar globular masses of pure
bitumen, showing that the bitumen was at least in a semifluid
state.    This bitumen originated in the shales."
    With regard to the origin of the Cape-Breton bitumen now
under consideration, since it is altered by strong heat, and is
found underlying and overlying calcite as well as imbedded in
the same, the formation of both must have resulted from alter
nating action other than distillation, and it was probably of a
chemical nature and took place at an elevated temperature.

XL VII. On the Function of the Blood in Muscular Work. By C.
   W. Heaton, F.C.S., Lecturer on Chemistry to Charing Cross
   Hospital Medical School*.
                of the recent writers on the origin and nature               of
MOST
   muscular power                seem to have assumed that the oxidation
from which it is derived is effected in the tissue itself, outside
the walls of the capillaries.       Those who, with Liebig, Voit,
Ranke,   and  Playfair,  derive   the whole of the power from the
oxidation of the tissue, find this assumption a necessity ; but it
appears to have been adopted also by Fick and Wislicenus, who
follow Traube^ in assigning the office to the fats and so-called
carbohydrates, and by Donders, who attributes it to both classes
of compounds.
    Mayer, however, in his now celebrated treatise J, adopted a
different view, and argued with extreme ability that all oxidation
took place in the blood.     Since his time this theory has received
some occasional isolated support ; but upon the whole it appears
to have been neglected.      This is the more curious, since its truth
would not only destroy the hypothesis of Liebig, but also the
opposite and not less extreme one of Traube.        For if force ge
nerated inside a capillary is capable, under the influence of the
nerves, of producing muscular contraction outside            it,   ob
                                                                   it   is
viously impossible to assign the origin of that force to either
nitrogenous or non-nitrogenous compounds exclusively.             Fick
and Wislicenus have shown, as Donders had before, that the
oxidation of the latter class of compounds contributes something,
perhaps the greater part, to muscular work         but, on the other
                                                      ;

342             Mr. C. W. Heaton             on the   Function of
reduce itself by remaining for a few days in a tube out of contact
with air. The cruorine was again oxidized instantaneously by
agitation with air. This last experiment proves that the corpus
cles have the faculty of oxidizing nitrogenous materials, either
their own substance or else some portion of the serum with
which they are in contact.      Hoppe-Seylerhas since found* that,
in a rabbit killed by drowning, the blood exhibits the spectrum
of reduced cruorine.       That the oxygen is held in combination
in the corpuscle by the weak force termed by Frankland " mole
cular combination," is evident from the well-known fact that
carbonic oxide displaces from it its own volume of oxygen.
    Now, if the oxidation of muscle is effected in the tissue itself,
it is clearly necessary to suppose either that the oxygen, upon the
stimulus of the motor nerves, leaves its combination in the cor
puscle, traverses the walls of the capillary in company with the
outgoing stream of nutrient fluid, and only enters into new com
binations when it has passed to some comparatively distant
muscle-fibre, or else that the corpuscle itself liquefies and passes
out bodily through the thin membrane with its loosely combined
oxygen.      Both suppositions seem to me very improbable ; for,
as Stokes's experiment proves that the absorbed oxygen of the
corpuscle is capable, without any nerve-influence,        of entering
into direct combination with the materials of the blood itself, it
is difficult to understand why such combination should be de
ferred until the oxygen has traversed the walls of the capillary.
Moreover, as muscle-fibre is now known to be at any rate not
the only substance oxidized to produce muscular work, it is
plain that much of that muscular work must, upon the current
theory, be produced by the oxidation outside the capillary of the
very same substances, fat &c, which are present abundantly in
side it.   Why oxygen should reject fat inside the capillary and
oxidize it outside it is hard to imagine.
    But evidence of a more direct kind                is,
                                                think, accessible to

 which exudes from the walls of the capillaries in virtue of the
 pressure to which the blood          is
                                   subject.  As the tissues disinte
 grate they liquefy  and are carried, together with the excess of the
nutritive fluid, back to the blood              by
                                          means of the lymphatics,
 which take their origin in the intervascular spaces of the tissue.
 Hence Mayer suggested that the lymph was            measure of the

 amount of fluid exuded from the walls of the capillaries.    Taking
 the quantity of lymph from Majendie's calculation, he inferred
 that not1    per cent, of the blood left the blood-vessels in the
 course of the circulation, and consequently, as all the blood re-

                      the Blood in Muscular Work.                     343
quired renewal on its return to the heart, that 99 per cent, of the
total oxidation of the body was effected in the blood-vessels. In
this form, however, the proof is not quite complete.           It may be
argued that a large proportion of oxygen leaves the blood-vessels
in the exudate, and that, small as is the total quantity of the
latter, it may yet contain enough oxygen to do the work of the
muscles.
   ¦ I have therefore made a calculation of the quantity of oxygen
which cau possibly be supposed to pass out of the blood.           I pur
posely exaggerate every figure employed, in order if possible to
avoid cavil.
     The first point is to ascertain the extreme quantity of fluid
exuded in twenty-four hours.           Bidder and Schmidt estimate the
lymph at 22 lb.         I will take it at 30 lb. A large proportion
of this arises of course from glands and other organs which do
no muscular work ; but this          I  neglect.   It may be suggested
 that some part of the fluid exuded may return direct to the ca
 pillaries without passing through the lymphatic system.               No
 doubt this is the case ; but the quantity so returned is probably
 small, as the pressure in the vessels would naturally tend to
 prevent it.     The pressure, indeed, probably acts in forcing the
 fluid onwards into the lymphatics.          Nevertheless, to avoid ques
 tion,   I  will  assume   that  the   quantity returned in this way is
 twice as great as the lymph, and         I thus get 90 lb., or about 40
                                                    I
 litres, as the daily amount of exudate ; and think every one will
 admit that this is an extreme overstatement.
     Any oxygen which passes out into the tissue must obviously
 pass in solution in this 40 litres ; and the next point is to ascer
 tain the quantity of oxygen which it can possibly be supposed to
 carry with it.      Lymph resembles diluted liquor sanguinis in
 composition, and is destitute of colour.        The exudate is therefore
 in all probability derived mainly from the liquor sanguinis, which,
 as Berzelius showed,        will hardly dissolve more oxygen than
 water.     Moreover, its dilution proves that, as might have been
  anticipated from the colloidal character of blood, a considerable
 part of the exudate actually consists of water.          But, to put the
 case in the strongest possible light,      I will assume that the whole
  of the exudate consists of liquefied corpuscles — of scarlet cruorine,
 in fact, charged to its utmost with oxygen. Again exaggera
  ting,  I assume that the corpuscles of arterial blood contain 40
  per  cent, by volume of oxygen.         This gives as the quantity of
  oxygen in the 40 litres of exudate 16 litres, or 22-88 grammes.
  Is this sufficient to do the muscular work actually accomplished
  in the twenty-four hours ? The following is an extremely low
  estimate of the daily work of the muscles : —

      To do even this small amount of work, double the quantity,
   or 200,000 metrekilogammes of force, must be developed (Hei-
   denhain).    Now 22"88 grammes of oxygen would oxidize —
         7-89 grms. of fat, taken as having average composition of
                oleine, margarine, and stearine (Lawes and Gilbert),
  or    15-39 grms. of muscle, taken as equal in composition to
                 albumen.
      Multiplying these quantities by the force-values obtained by
  Frankland *, we obtain these figures : —
                                                  Metrekilogrammes.

              Muscle        15-39x1848       .   .   =28,440
      So that, even upon this extravagant calculation, we see that
  whether it oxidized fat or muscle, the oxygen exuded could not
   account for one-sixth of the work done by the muscles.                 To
  give   even the  200,000     metrekilogrammes      of  force there must be
  a daily exudate    of   264 litres, or more than a quarter of a ton of
  arterial corpuscles !
      I think it is therefore certain that all, or nearly all, the force
  of the body is generated in the blood, and that Mayer was per
  fectly right in saying that
                                     " the muscle produces mechanical
  effect at the expense of the chemical action expended in its capil-
*
  lary vessels."     Hence it is natural to inquire what modification
  this view compels us to make in our ideas of muscular disinte
  gration.
     In the first place, it forces us to admit that this disintegra
  tion is a simple decomposition, and not an immediate oxidation.
  When a muscle suffers disintegration, either by natural change
  or during muscular work, two classes of compounds are known to
  be produced.      The members of one class are ternary and contain
  the residue  of  water, while those of the other are quaternary and
  contain directly or indirectly the residue of ammonia.              To the
  former class belong the fatty acids, lactic acid, sugar, &c,
  and to the latter such bodies as leucin, creatin, creatinin, uric
  acid, and urea.       The greater portion of these products of de
  composition are probably carried to the blood by the lymphatics ;
  and some of them, notably sugar, leucin, and urea, have been
  discovered in the. lymph.        The oxidation in the blood of such of
                          *

these compounds as are capable of it contributes to the heat,
and probably to the work also of the body. Professor Haughton,
in his well-known papers on Diabetes mellitus*, while he as
sumes that the normal disintegration of tissue is an oxidation,
suggests that in the diseased state a large portion of the tissue
is not oxidized, but is simply decomposed into urea and sugar.
Mayer's view compels us to believe that this, or something like
this, is the normal process, and consequently that the pheno
mena of diabetes, as far as they are independent of the nature of
the food, must be due either to increased disintegration or to
diminished oxidation, or possibly to the conjunction of both
causes.       He found that increased excretion of urea went hand
in hand with the presence of sugar in the urine ; but as the food
of the patients was increased from two- to four-fold, the observa
tion does not prove much.            The great bulk of the nitrogen of
the food must be excreted as urea.
     I will not speculate on the mode in which force developed in
the blood is capable of producing contraction in the tissue.            The
process    is  subject  to  the  control of the  nerves,  and  is probably
connected with the production of electricity ; but one conclusion
seems so probable that        I cannot help suggesting it.     It has long
been known that muscular contraction is invariably attended
with increased muscle-metamorphosi3.                 Liebig, Helmholtz,
Du Bois Reymond, Ranke, and others have left no doubt upon
this point ; and it may even be considered to be proved that in
 creased work is attended with a slight though irregular increase
in the excretion of nitrogen ; for though in Fick and Wislice-
nus's experiment, as well as in many previous ones, this result
 was not observed, its absence has been shown to be due to the
 shortness of the time during which the observation was made,
and in the recent careful experiments of Dr. Parkesf, in which
this source of error was eliminated, the increase was clearly
 shown.
     What, then, is the cause of this increase? It is obviously
absurd to attribute it to mere mechanical friction of the muscle-
 fibres, to ordinary wear and tear ; and it therefore seems natural
 to ascribe it to the excess of force which remains after the per
formance of the work.           That an excess of force is always deve
loped is certain ; and though much of it may afterwards assume
the form of heat,, it seems not improbable that some part may
be spent in producing chemical decomposition,              and so be once
 more stored up as potential energy.           It appears indeed possible
that all normal muscular disintegration, inasmuch as it is sub
ject to the influence of the nerves and attended with electrical

                                           this view be accepted,
muscular disintegration, so far from being the cause of muscular
work, must rather be regarded as an effect contingent upon it.
   Banke's beautiful experiments upon the effect of the products
of muscle-metamorphosis    iu checking muscular contraction by
increasing the conductivity of the tissue, are in perfect accord
ance with Mayer's theory.

       XLIX.          On some of the Conditions of Molecular Action.
             By Arthur Ransome, M.B., M.A. Cantab.*
                  theories have been broached respecting the ultimate
 MANY       molecular constitution              of bodies.          The energies of sub
 stances have been supposed to depend upon the shape and size
 of their constituent particlesf, their possession of one or more
 axes of polarity J, their mobility §, and their rotation in various
 orbits. The phenomena of heat, light, electricity, &c. have also

been referred to the possession by the material particles of im
ponderable atmospheres with various properties*.
    It is not intended in the present paper to enter upon the dis
cussion of the atomic or molecular constitution of bodies ; and
although the modes in which matter is related to, or affected by,
heat and other physical forces are intimately connected with the
subject, and will probably eventually throw much light upon
molecular actions, for the present these relations will only be in
cidentally mentioned, and the substance of these remarks will be
restricted to more material reactions.
    It is convenient also to mark off chemical from purely mole
cular actions ; and this may be roughly effected by stating that,
whether or not chemical combination results from molecular ac
tions, the peculiar forces of which we shall treat do not take part
in the chemical reactions, nor assist in binding together the ele
ments of the resulting compounds.            The force of cohesion also,
which binds together the particles of the same substance, will
not here be considered. We shall be mainly concerned with the
action of different substances upon one another through the in
tervention of certain molecular forces or affinities, or, in other
words, with the relations to be observed between the particles of
 various substances, apart from their chemical activities, when
they are brought into close proximity with one another.
     There are many groups of these actions, and chief amongst
 them the so-called catalytic or contact actions.       Certain of them
will now be brought closely under review in an endeavour to
 ascertain the special circumstances under which molecular ener
 gies come into play.
     It may be well first, however, to state briefly what is known
 of the forces in question ; and the following propositions respect
 ing them will probably include all that can at present be affirmed
 about them     : —
      (1) That molecular influence depends essentially upon the
 elementary nature of bodies.
     (2) That it acts without regard to mass.
      (3) That it increases inversely as the distance, at some enor
 mous ratio.
      (4) That its action is in some way affected by calorific, elec
 tric, and probably by luminous vibrations, and by chemical
 affinity.
      (5) That it does not seem to differ in kind from the attraction
  of cohesion, which binds together the particles of the same
 substance.
      (6) That chemical affinity may be similar in kind, but that it

      When molecular operations take place between the particles
 of bodies of dissimilar chemical composition, the following con
  ditions are found to favour the production of molecular and che
 mical changes: —
      (1) That two or more of the substances submitted to mole
 cular influences have a more or less powerful attraction for one
 another.
     (2)   That their physical condition is favourable to molecular
 action.
     (3) That the molecular agent or catalyte has very low chemical
 affinities for the substances acted upon.
     (4) That the molecules of the catalyte are free.
     Each of these conditions will be considered separately, and
 their bearing upon different molecular actions will be noticed
 somewhat in detail.
                         1.  Of Molecular Affinity.
     It  is a question whether the real molecular force of all sub
 stances may not be the same in degree.           All substances may
 possess absolutely the same amount of molecular force ; but from
 their varying chemical affinities, and from the various extent to
 which they are subject to the different affections of matter, they
 may not be able equally to exert their molecular power.
     The molecular force depends so greatly upon the degree of
 approximation of the particles, and this must be so seriously
 affected by variations in the above-mentioned conditions, that
we cannot affirm that different manifestations of the molecular
influence of different substances may not be governed by these
conditions, and that the molecular force is not the same in all
 substances.      Until we can appreciate the minute differences in the
 degrees of approximation       of substances to one another during
any     molecular  action,  no absolute measure of molecular force can
be applied.       Professor Tyndalland M. H. Ste.-Claire Deville, in
some of their recent researches, seem to have approached,
although they have not as yet effected, the solution of this pro
blem, and no certain means are yet known of testing the dis
tance of atoms from one another.            In some minds, indeed,
there seems to be doubt as to whether such an influence as we
are considering exists apart from chemical affinity.
    We may therefore be permitted to notice those cases in which
molecular force seems to come into play, and to endeavour to
point out the mode in which it acts.
    Attraction of Solids for Liquids. — This heading includes all
the cases of so-called capillary attraction, the rise of liquids in

                   Conditions  of Molecular Action.             363
capillary tubes, in porous substances, and upon the surfaces of
solids, and the formation of drops ; probably also many of the
phenomena of cementation by means of colloid substances.
    The simplest case is perhaps that of true capillary attraction.
When a fluid rests in a horizontal tube open to the air at both
ends, and so small that cohesion of the fluid will prevent it from
running into drops, then all the forces acting upon the fluid are
equal and antagonistic, except the force of gravitation, which
is neutralized by the cohesion of the fluid ; the solid and the
liquid act and react equally throughout the whole length of the
column of fluid; and at each end of this column the particles of
the solid which are just beyond the limits of the fluid act un-
perturbedly,    and draw it in opposite directions : hence the po
sition is one of equilibrium, and no movement takes place.
When, however, the tube is raised into a vertical position, the
attraction of gravitation tends to draw the fluid downwards ; and
if the molecular attraction of the walls of the tube and the cohe
sive power of the fluid are not sufficient to counterbalance the
force of gravity, the column of liquid will descend in the tube
until it reaches its lower extremity. Here,
if the tube be small enough, it will stop,
and no portion exude ; for the molecular
attraction of the lowest part of the tube,
which had before been acting in the same
direction as gravitation, and in opposition
to the same molecular force at the top of
the fluid, now changes its direction and
tends to draw upwards the lower particles
of the fluid (as in the figure) ; and if the
weight of the fluid is not too great, equilibrium is again esta
blished, and the column of fluid remains at rest.
    It will be seen that the molecular attraction now acting up
wards both at the top and bottom of the fluid has no power to
cause the column of fluid to ascend ; by any upward movement
the lower force is at once changed in direction and draws down
wards again.      But now let the lower end of the tube be plunged
into a vessel containing the same kind of fluid : the particles
composing this portion of the tube now draw up successive por
tions of fluid which press upward those already in the tube, and
thus act along with the molecular force at the top of the column,
 and gradually raise it in the tube until its vertical hydraulic
pressure equals the united force of these two attractions.
    It might be supposed that in these cases of capillary attraction
we have what we were just now looking for, an actual measure
 of the molecular force exerted, in the height to which the fluid
 rises in the tube.    If it were possible to learn the exact number

364                 Dr. A. Ransome       on some   of the
of particles in any transverse section of the column of liquid and
their distance from one another, it might be possible to calculate
the force exerted ; but it is needless to say that at present this
knowledge is withheld from us.
    It is interesting to notice the part played by the attraction of
cohesion in this case.      It has recently been shown by M. Jamin
 (Comptes Rendus, vol. 1. p. 172) that when successive beads of
fluid are contained in a capillary tube, the resistance offered by
the cohesive force of these beads may be so multiplied that they
will resist considerable pressure, even to 3 or 4 atmospheres.
Mercury produces still greater effects ; but, on the other hand,
alcohol and oil oppose no resistance to pressure.
    The same variation, from the varying molecular force of differ
ent substances, is also observed in experiments on capillarity;
and, in relation to this subject, it may be mentioned that the
magnitude of drops of fluid distilled from a tube is in proportion
to the weight of that fluid raised in that tube by capillary attrac
tion — the chemical composition of the liquid affecting the weight
of its drop in a remarkable manner*.
    Mixtures. — Mixtures of different fluids afford perhaps the
simplest examples of the varying extent to which molecular affi
nity may be manifested.
    Some fluids will mix in any proportions with one another —for
example, alcohol, and glycerine and water.               Others, again, as
ether and water, at the same temperatures will only mix in cer
tain fixed proportions.
    In order that two fluids may be entirely miscible, it seems
necessary that the particles of each fluid have for those of the
other a greater molecular affinity than they have amongst them
selves ; in other words, the molecular attraction of one fluid for
the   other   must   be  sufficient   to overcome the cohesive forces
of eachf.
    When fluids are only partially miscible, we can conceive that
up to a certain point the particles of one fluid are so separated
from one another by those of the other fluid that their cohesive
forces cannot draw them together ; but as soon as the solution
becomes more concentrated and the particles get sufficiently close
together, then the cohesive forces gain the ascendant, no further
mixation can take place, and saturation is the result.
    Molecular attractions of Vapours and Gases. — Gases and va
pours also display certain degrees of molecular affinity in their
relations to one another, gases being susceptible of mixture with
other vapours up to a certain point of saturation.

   t The contraction of volume which takes place in some fluids after mix
ture gives considerable probability to this opinion.

                       Conditions    of Molecular Action.                       365
   Professor Wanklyn* has pointed out the influence of adhesion
and of vapour-density upon the distillation of mixtures, by which
means a less volatile liquid can be made to distil faster than one                    .
more volatile with which it is mixed — as, for instance, in the
facilitation of the distillation of oils in steam ; and Dr. Graham                f
seems to think that nitrogen may diffuse more readily through
a platinum plate in company with hydrogen than without its
assistance.
   It seems probable that the rate of diffusion of gases through
various porous substances is affected by the molecular affinities
of the solids and gases, as well as by the constitution of the gases
themselves %.
   Solution. — The solution of solids in different solvents, without
change of chemical composition, must be similar in its nature to
mixture; but in this case a species of liquefaction (or rather dis
integration) must precede mixation. In many instances the action
is accompanied by an absorption of heat from surrounding objects,
showing that a change of state similar to liquefaction has taken
place.
   If,however, solution involved true liquefaction, the solvent
ought to lose exactly that equivalent of heat which     required to
                                                                  is
melt or liquefy  the  substance  dissolved, which     not  the case.

But if the particles of the solvent simply come into such close
contact with the particles of the solid as to disintegrate and
overcome their cohesion to their fellows, then            no means
                                                            it   is   by
necessary that any   heat should disappear  from  the solution.
   The action of most minute portion of alcohol in assisting the

pulverization of camphor testifies the probability of this expla
nation.

    Catalysis. — The degree to which molecular affinity is exerted
upon different substances must play a most important part in de
termining the results of those actions ordinarily termed catalytic,
in some cases bringing about decomposition, in others synthesis.
    When contact with a substance produces decomposition, as
when binoxide of manganese facilitates the evolution of oxygen
from chlorate of potash, the molecular affinity of the catalyte is
probably greatest for one of the constituents of the substance
acted upon, and it will attract this to such an extent as to enable
it to gain its freedom.
    When, however, synthesis is the result, as in the action of pla
tinum-black upon alcohol, assisting its oxidation, the catalyte
in this case may draw the particles together, or it may be able
to concentrate upon itself one of the elements so exclusively that
it may appear in an undiluted or liquid form, and hence able to
act with greater energy upon the substances presented to it.
    Osmose. — The phenomena of osmose are probably dependent
purely upon molecular affinity. Osmose takes place when a porous
but, usually, water-tight septum or membrane separates two mis-
cible fluids.   In this case the fluids both pass through the mem
brane, but at different rates. The structure and composition of the
septum influence the rate of diffusion, and determine which of
the two fluids shall pass through most rapidly.         Thus, when
water and dilute alcohol are separated by an animal membrane,
the water will pass through most rapidly ; but when the septum
is composed of caoutchouc, the alcohol diffuses at much the
greater rate.
    The more rapid rate of diffusion of one
 fluid (A) over that of another fluid (B) may
 be accounted for by supposing that the sep
tum has a greater, molecular affinity for fluid
A than for fluid B. The particles of fluid
 A may perhaps fill the pores of the septum,
 and if there were no other fluid with which
it could mix on the other side of the septum,
its attraction for the septum would suffice
to keep it from exuding ; but since on this
other side of the septum there is a fluid with
which it is miscible, and since, as we have before seen, miscibi-
lity seems to assume that the particles of one of the mixing fluids
must have a greater molecular attraction for the particles of the
other mixing fluid than they have for one another, it follows
that when the particles of fluid B come into contact with those
of fluid A they will at once mix with them and drive out some

                        Conditions     of Molecular Action.                      367
of those particles of fluid           A which      previously filled the pores of
the septum (those particles of fluid A perhaps alone remaining
unmixed which were in close contact with and lining the sides
of the pores)     .
    We may now easily surmise the mode in which the opposite
currents are produced.               The particles of each fluid at each end
of the pores, from their miscibility, will be continually taken up
by the opposite fluids (those of fluid A by fluid B, and vice
versd), and thus a flow of each fluid one into the other will be
started ; and since upon one fluid (A) a double influence is ex
erted, by both fluid B and the septum, its diffusion will proceed
at a greater rate.           The currents will continue to flow until the
affinities of each are satisfied or are in equilibrium.
    It seems possible that the size of the pqres may to a certain
 extent determine the direction of the current, since upon this
 circumstance depends the quantity of fluid in contact with the
 septum ; and this, if it were true, would assist the solution of
many vital problems.
     In this explanation of osmosis it will be seen that the chief
part in the action has been attributed to molecular affinities
 similar to those which produce solution and mixation — with this
 difference, that in the septum between the fluids we have certain
 mechanical conditions and a rigid insoluble material concerned,
 instead of a fluid or a soluble solid*.
     Dialysis differs from osmose in the extent to which the current
 from one fluid (the crystalloid) prevails over that of the other
 (the colloid) ; it is in fact little more than the diffusion of the
 crystalloid through the colloid.
     A colloid possesses all the qualities most favourable to mole
cular (as distinguished from chemical) action. Its particles have
    * The account
                       given of endosmosis by M. Lhermite [Annates de Chimie
 et de Physique,     vol. xliii, p. 420) is, in the main, similar to that just stated,
 except that he scarcely ascribes sufficient importance to the molecular in
 fluence exerted by the two fluids one upon the other.                Thus he thinks
 that the passage of the second fluid (B), which is less influenced by the
 septum than fluid A, is purely passive and due to pressure, and that if the
 pores of the septum were ever to become entirely lined by fluid A the
 osmotic action would cease.          His experiments, however, give striking evi
 dence of the general correctness of the views which I have endeavoured to
 elucidate.   Thus he shows that a kind of osmosis takes place when two
 miscible fluids, as water and alcohol, are separated by a third fluid (such as
 essence of turpentine), or ether and chloroform separated by water.              And
 the influence of the intervening septum is well illustrated by an experi
 ment made with alcohol and water separated by a diaphragm of porous
 earthenware.       In this case the chief current is from the water into the
 spirit ; but if the cylinder, after careful drying, be steeped for three or four
 days in castor oil and then again used, the alcohol will pass over in greatest
 amount into the water.

 368                Dr. A. Ransome         on some  of the
a feeble cohesive    attraction for one another, but they are the
more capable on this account of exerting their molecular affini
ties for other bodies ; a crystalloid therefore diffuses into a gela
tinous mass as readily as into water.            During dialysis the par
ticles of the colloid cling powerfully to the substance of the sep
tum, and thus are unable to pass off into the opposite fluid; but
the crystalloid readily traverses the colloid lining the pores of the
membrane, and is taken up by the molecular affinities of the so
lution on the opposite side.
   Molecular Attraction of Colloids and heated metals for Gases and
 Vapours. — Dr. Mitchell of New York (in 1830) first noticed the
varying rates at which different vapours and gases will diffuse
through films of india-rubber and other substances ; and Dr.
                          '                              '
Draper, in his work On Human Physiology (p. 152), makes
further observations on the subject, and notices its bearing on
the physiology of respiration.
    The same phenomena have recently been more fully investi
gated by Dr. Graham ; and his results were given in an admirable
memoir to the Royal Society, and are now published in the Phi
losophical Magazine. It will not be necessary therefore to review
this work ; it will be sufficient to state that his experiments show
that different substances possess very different powers of attract
ing vapours and gases, that the attraction exerted seems to be
independent of mass, that the power of attraction which can be
exerted by the particles of red-hot or molten metals seems to be
sufficiently great in many instances to overcome the dissipating
influence of heat, and that certain gases will pass at various rates
into and through the substance of these metals when their mo
lecules are so far separated as to allow the passage of liquid or
gaseous particles.     All these phenomena lead to one general ob
servation, which is most important so far as our present subject
is concerned — that in all the actions which have been mentioned
powerful molecular influences are at work, and that there is a
great diversity in the degree of molecular affinity put forth by
different substances.
           2. Molecular conditions favourable        to Catalysis.
    It might   be anticipated that molecular          actions would take
place   most  readily   when     the   substances  involved    in them are
either in a fluid or gaseous condition ; but in most so-called ca
talytic actions a powerful influence upon the result is generally
exerted by solid substances.
    The researches of Messrs. Jamin and Bertrand* and Professor
Magnust have proved that all solid bodies condense upon their

                       Conditions   of Molecular Action.
surfaces more or less of any vapour or gas to which they are
exposed*.
   It is not difficult to understand why the mechanical condition
of the solid should materially affect the result. Since molecular
attraction is independent of the mass, and since its power is only
exerted at very small distances, it is evident that molecular at
traction (strictly so called) is only exerted upon foreign sub
stances at the surfaces of the active body (catalyte).    The second
stratum of molecules will scarcely, if at all, affect substances
lying on the surface.     It follows, therefore, that a large extent
of surface is an important assistance to molecular (catalytic) ac
tions : thus spongy or laminated bodies act more readily than
dense solids.     Finely divided or pulverulent substances enjoy
this advantage to the utmost ; but they are under favourable cir
cumstances from another cause — namely, that they present to the
substances submitted to their influence an infinite number of
points.
    Action of Points. — When a particle of matter rests upon a
surface, it comes within the range of the molecular attractions
of several of the particles composing that surface.     It is affected
not only by the molecule upon which it immediately rests, but
also by those closely surrounding it ; and the influence of these
last-mentioned molecules perturbs the action of the one support
ing molecule, and prevents it from exerting its full power.
When, however, this molecule forms a point protruding from the
surrounding surface, it is removed to that extent from the range
of the disturbing forces, and its own peculiar energy is brought
fully into action.
    This property of points is well illustrated by their power of fa
cilitating vaporization, or the release of a gas from solution.
When a point is placed in a fluid in the act of vaporizing, or
giving off gas which had been dissolved in                 it,   by
                                                         virtue of its
undisturbed attraction for the molecules of vapour which are
being formed,     it soonest collects these molecules into bubbles             ;
and these collections of gas or vapour, therefore, at this point
first attain sufficient magnitude to overcome the resistance of the
surrounding medium, and ebullition starts from the point                  f.
         interesting to observe that, of the

tact, lose their power when                  by
                                     heat or any other agency they
are coagulated or pectized, and the molecules are thus brought
closer together.         seems probable that in some medicines, as

tractions of the points which form the rough surfaces of the
bodies in contact.       may perhaps be permitted to surmise that
                                  It
when these projecting points are brought together, their mole
cular affinities will have some influence upon the result.
                   3.   The      Low Chemical Affinity    of   a   Catalyte.
     When       considered that the molecular forces exerted
                  it   is                                                                   by   a
catalyte  can only be employed when the substances to be acted
upon are brought into very close contact with      (so close that
                                                                   it                        if
these substances had strong chemical affinities for one another
they would certainly combine), and when, further,        considered     it   is
that    the
         if catalyte united chemically with other material    would                it
(and probably other suhstances) radiate more heat than when smooth. But
the points which these surfaces present are not the cause of the increase of
radiation   this depends rather upon the diminution of density of the sur
              ;
faces and their state of greater subdivision.  According to Professor Mag
nus, " in consequence of the roughening of the surface, the amplitudes of
the heat-oscillations are altered, but not their rate." (Professor Dana in
Silliman's Journal, vol, iv.)

 soon cease to exist as such, and would lose its catalytic property,
 it becomes obvious that catalytes must be chemically indifferent
 to the substances they act upon.     And not only is this the
 case  in fact, but we find that all the substances which have the
 greatest catalytic energy display chemical indifference, not alone
 towards those substances which they affect, but also towards or
 dinary chemical reagents.
    Thus, among metalloids, charcoal is at once the most energetic
 in molecular actions and the least attracted chemically ; pounded
 glass and sand, compounds of silica, also rank high amongst ca
 talytes.    Among metals, only those placed at the highest point
 of the scale, as least subject to the action of oxygen (the
 most powerful chemical agent) — metals like platinum — these
 alone act catalytically, without change of chemical constitution.
 This fact is very clearly shown by some experiments made in the
 year 1834,     by Dr. Charles Henry and my father, "on the
 Action of Metals in determining gaseous combination"*.                They
proved that the oxidizable metals, such as copper, cobalt, nickel,
lead, iron, silver, even when in a state of minute subdivision
(produced by reducing their oxides by hydrogen), did not them
selves act catalytically, but in every case their oxides possessed
the power of determining the union of oxygen and hydrogen.
   The oxides whose power of assisting the combination of oxygen
with various substances has been best observed are lime, alumina,
binoxide of manganese, sesquioxide of iron, sesquioxide of chro
mium, sesquioxide of nickel, protoxide and sesquioxide of cobalt,
protoxide of cadmium, hydrated sesquioxide of uranium, prot
oxide of copper, red oxide of lead, protoxide and binoxide of tin,
tungstic acid, and oxide of silver.   And amongst these it is in
teresting  to mark  that Mr. Eyre Ashby, who has most carefully
studied this subject, observes that it is not those oxides which
have an excess of oxygen, nor yet those which most readily part
with    it,
          whose influence    most felt, but "
                             is                    the sesquioxides
                                                   it   is
which have the strongest tendency    to produce  and  maintain the
catalytic glow, and which do produce        in every case in which
                                              it
they are not decomposed           by   the heat necessary to begin      the
operation."
   In relation to this condition of molecular action,        worthy
                                                             it   is
of notice that ferments, the most remarkable substances in the
organic kingdom for their catalytic power, belong universally
to the class of colloid bodies, one of whose chief characteristics       is
that of "chemical indifference "f.

culty of thoroughly cleansing glass and silver plates from stain

experiment     of  producing   union   of oxygen and hydrogen                                   by
means of platinum plate, requires for its success the most ac

   "When heat quickens        molecular action, as in most catalytic

tensity of the subsequent action, when the heat          withdrawn,             is              is
probably partly owing to the cleansing-power of the heat, which
drives off the layer of vapour with which the catalyte was sur
rounded.      The same favouring condition          also probably pre is
sent when an acid       assisted in its attack upon

                           the presence of another more attractive
metal alloyed with it.
   To take one instance, when nitric acid dissolves the platinum
in an alloy of platinum with another metal, apart from galvanic
action,      seems likely that during the operation the acid
             it                                                                                 is
brought into much closer contact with separated particles of the

bodies containing nitrogen,     substance which not only displays very little
                                        a
combining-power, but confers the same indifference upon many of its com
pounds.     An observation of the eminent chemist Berthelot gives peculiar
point to this remark.    He noticed that in fermenting sugars, having the
general formula Cen m(HO),                  by
                                   means of animal nitrogenous substances,
such as caseine (together with an alkaline carbonate to neutralize any acid
asit   isformed), decomposition took place simultaneously in the sugar
(glycerine, mannite, &c.) and in the ferment.    The ferment, however, did
not rot, but lost the whole of its nitrogen. (Chemist, vol. iv. p. 580.)

                       Conditions of Molecular Action.                   373
      The nascent state of Bodies. — The great energy of bodies when
  recently formed, and before their evolution is completed, may
  be partly due to their greater concentration          at this time ; but
 it seems likely that the freedom of their particles, at the moment
 of their formation, from all taint of other matter may enable them
 to put forth all the molecular vigour they possess, and assist
 them to overcome obstacles which would otherwise prevent them
 from forming a chemical combination*.
      Catalytic actions. — It will have been noticed that, under the
 head of each condition of molecular action, allusion has been
 been made to some form or other of catalytic action.             This term
 has been made to include a very wide range of both physical and
 chemical reactions ; but strictly its use should be confined to
 those cases in which a substance (the catalyte) brings about che
 mical or physical changes without being itself in any way altered.
 Thus defined, it would apply to all those actions carried on by
 means of the catalytes which have already been enumerated — the
 oxidations of ammonia, of alcohols, ethers, essential oils, and
 other hydrocarbons, and the decomposition of chlorate of potash
 by means of binoxide of manganese or the sesquioxide of iron.
     When these operations are attentively considered, it will be
 seen that in all of them the conditions we have already examined
 are fulfilled.    Catalytes are substances having little or no che
 mical affinity for the materials upon which they act ; their mole
 cules are loosely aggregated so as to be able to act independently;
 in nearly every case their energy is increased by the cleansing
of their surfaces from all taint of other matter.             The only re
maining condition, their molecular affinity for the substances
acted upon, may be inferred from what has gone before respect
ing the enormous power possessed by several of them of absorb
ing large quantities of certain gases. Upon the hypothesis that
catalysis depends purely upon molecular force, it is not difficult
to understand why a very small portion of a catalyte is sufficient
to produce changes in a large quantity of suitable material : the
molecular action once completed upon one part of the substance
is not necessarily exhausted.        If  the substances formed by con
tact with the catalyte have less affinity for it than the original
material had, they will readily be given up, the molecular power
of the catalyte will be again set free, it will attract fresh portions
of the more appropriate material, and the action may go on
almost indefinitely.
    *
       This observation must have at least equal weight in reference to vital
as to purely physical molecular phenomena ; and we can hardly doubt that
the power of constantly bringing forth newly formed untainted material in
the processes of vital growth must have a most important influence in pro
ducing physiological reactions.

374             On some      of    the Conditions   of Molecular Action.
     But there is probably more than one influence at work in the
case of certain of the oxidations by catalysis which are effected
by the aid of metallic oxides and heat. From the accounts of
the process- given by Mr. Eyre Ashby* and Dr. Henryf, it ap
pears most probable that the heat by which the action is started
drives off from the pulverulent oxide all stain or taint of foreign
vapour, and leaves its particles free to exercise their molecular
energy, and to draw closely to them the vapours freshly sub
mitted to them.    In certain cases the approach is so close that
the chemical affinity of the organic vapour for oxygen overcomes
that of the metal, and reduction of the oxide and oxidation
of the vapour take place simultaneously.     In the case of silver
this accident only increases the energy of the operation, probably
from the well-known attraction of silver for oxygen ; but with
most other metals       g. cadmium) the action
                                  (e.               not carried on
                                                                is
until the nascent metal has attracted fresh oxygen from the air,
and nascent oxide       again ready to carry on the catalytic process.
                             is
  It evident, however, that even in these cases, although che
          is
mical actions are going on in the catalyte, yet the purely mole
cular force plays an important part in producing the result.
I    have been led to make these few and imperfect observations
upon    difficult and obscure subject, chiefly because believe that
           a                                                      I

  L.  On the Action   of Sonorous Vibrations on Gaseous and Liquid
              Jets. By Professor Tyndall, F.R.S. fyc.
     [With the permission of Professor Tyndall we print the fol
  lowing extract from the sixth lecture of his work on Sound, now
 on the point of publication.       A portion of the extract has already
 appeared in an abbreviated form in the Philosophical Magazine.
  We have also to thank Professor Tyndall for the use of the
 woodcuts which illustrate the paper. — Eds.]
        a former lecture  I referred to the oscillations of water in a
  IN    bottle as revealing the existence of vibrations of a definite
 period in the general jar of a railway train.      The fish-tail flames
 in some of our metropolitan railway carriages are far more sen
 sitive acoustic reagents.    If  you pay the requisite attention, you
 will find single flames here and there jumping in synchronism
 with certain tremors of the train. A flame, for example, having
 a horizontal edge when the train is still, will, during the motion,
 periodically thrust forth a central tongue, and continue to jump
 as long as a special set of vibrations is present.      It will subside
 when those vibrations disappear, and jump again when they are
 restored.     When the train is at rest, the tapping of the glass
 shade which surrounds the flame rarely fails, when it is sensitive,
to cause it to jump.
    This action of sound upon a naked fish-tail flame was first ob
served by Professor Leconte at a musical party in the United
 States.    His observation is thus described : — " Soon after the
music commenced,      I  observed that the flame exhibited pulsations
which were exactly synchronous with the audible beats. This
phenomenon was very striking to every one in the room, and espe
cially so when the strong notes of the violoncello came in. It was
exceedingly interesting to observe how perfectly even the trills
of this instrument were reflected on the sheet of flame.         A deaf
man might have seen the harmony.           As the evening advanced,
and the diminished consumption of gas in the city increased the
pressure, the phenomenon became more conspicuous. The jump
ing of the flame gradually increased, became somewhat irregular,
and finally it began to flare continuously, emitting the charac
teristic sound indicating the escape of a greater amount of gas
than could be properly consumed.          I  then ascertained, by expe
riment, that the phenomenon did not take place unless the dis
charge of gas was so regulated that the flame approximated to
the condition of flaring.     I  likewise determined by experiment
that the effects were not produced by jarring or shaking the floor
and walls of the room by means of repeated concussions.           Hence
it is obvious that the pulsations of the flame were not owing to

376             Prof. Tyndall   on the Action of Sonorous
indirect vibrations propagated through the medium of the walls
of the room to the burning apparatus, but must have been pro
duced by the direct influence of aerial sonorous pulses on the
burning jet" *
   The significant remark that the jumping of the flame was not
observed until it was near flaring suggests the means of repeat
ing the experiments of Dr. Leconte ; while a more intimate
knowledge of the conditions of success enables us to vary and
exalt them in a striking degree.          Before you burns a bright
candle-flame :    I  may shout, clap my hands, sound this whistle,
strike this anvil with a hammer, or explode a mixture of oxygen
and hydrogen : though sonorous waves pass in each case through
the air, the candle is absolutely insensible to the sound ; there
is no motion of the flame.
    I now urge from this small blowpipe a narrow stream of air
through the flame of the candle, producing thereby an incipient
flutter, and reducing at the same time the brightness of the
flame. When I now sound a whistle the flame jumps visibly.
The experiment may be so arranged that, when the whistle
 sounds, either the flame shall be restored almost to its pristine
brightness, or the amount of light it still possesses shall dis
appear.
    The blowpipe-flame      of our laboratory is totally unaffected by
        Fig. 1.
 the sound of the whistle as long as no air is urged through it.
 By properly tempering the force of the blast,       I obtain a flame of
 the shape shown in fig. 1, the blast not being sufficiently pow
 erful to urge the whole of the flame forwards.           On sounding
 the whistle the erect portion of the flame drops down, and while
it continues to sound we have a flame of the form shown in fig. 2.
    Here, moreover, is a fish-tail flame, which burns brightly and

steadily, refusing to respond to any sound, musical or unmusical.
I urge against the broad face of the flame a stream of air from a
blowpipe.    The flame is cut in two by the air ; and now, when
the whistle is sounded, it instantly starts. A knock on the table
causes the two half-flames to unite and form for an instant a
single flame of the ordinary shape.    By a slight variation of the
experiment, the two side flames disappear when the whistle is
sounded, a central luminous tongue being thrust forth in their

   Before you now is another thin sheet of flame, also issuing
from a common fish-tail burner (fig. 3).     You might sing to               it,

visible.  You might employ pitch-pipes, tuning-forks, bells, and
trumpets, with  a like absence of all effect. A barely perceptible
motion of the interior of the flame may be noticed when this
shrill whistleisblown close to it. By turning the cock more
fully on I bring the flame to the verge of flaring. And now,
when the whistle     blown, you see an extraordinary appearance.

The flame thrusts out        quivering tongues (fig.

as the sound continues,the tongues jut forth, being violently agi
tated;  the moment the sound ceases, the tongues disappear and
the flame reassumes the form of fig. 3.

    Passing from   a   fish-tail to       a    bat's-wing burner, we obtain this
broad steady flame (fig.         5)   .   It   quite insensible to the loudest

                                 Finally turn on gas until the flame
 is on the point of roaring, as flames do when the pressure is too
 great.    On sounding the whistle, the flame roars, and suddenly
 assumes the form shown in fig. 6.
     When a distant anvil is struck with a hammer, the flame in
 stantly responds by thrusting forth its tongues.
     An essential condition to entire success in these experiments
 disclosed itself in the following manner.        I was in a room illu
 minated by two fish-tail flames. One of them jumped to a whistle,
 the other did not.      The gas of the non-sensitive flame was turned
 off, additional pressure being thereby thrown upon the other
 flame; it flared, and its cock was turned so as to lower the
 flame.    It now proved non-sensitive, however close it might be
 brought to the point of flaring. The narrow orifice of the half-
 turned cock appeared to interfere with the action of the sound.
 When the gas was turned fully on and the flame lowered by
 opening the cock of the second burner, it became again sensitive.
 Up to this time a great number of burners had been tried, inclu
 ding those with single orifices ; but with many of them the action
 was nil.    Acting, however, upon the hint conveyed in this ob
 servation, the pipes which fed the flames were widely opened ;
the consequence was that our most refractory burners were thus
rendered sensitive.
    The observation of Dr. Leconte is thus easily and strikingly
illustrated ; in our subsequent and far more delicate experiments
the precaution just referred to is still more essential.
      A gas-bag properly weighted also answers for these experiments.

              Vibrations on Gaseous and       Liquid Jets.                       379
   Mr. Barrett,   late laboratory assistant in this place, first ob
served the shortening of a tall flame issuing from the single
orifice of this burner when the higher notes of a circular plate
were sounded ; and, by the selection of more suitable burners,
he afterwards succeeded in rendering the flame extremely sen
sitive*.   Observing the precaution above adverted to, we can
readily obtain in an exalted degree the shortening of the flame.
It is now before you, being 18 inches long and smoking copi
ously. When       Isound the whistle the flame falls to a height of
9 inches, the smoke disappearing, and the flame increasing in
brightness.
   A long flame may be shortened and         short one lengthened,

for example, are two flames issuing from rough burners formed
from pewter tubing.     The one flame (fig. 7) is long, straight,
and smoky ; the other (fig.     -8)   short, forked, and brilliant.
                                      is
On sounding the whistle, the long flame becomes short, forked
and brilliant, as in fig. 9 ; the forked flame becomes long and
smoky,  as in fig. 10. As regards, therefore, their response to the
sound of the whistle, one of these flames    the complement of the
                                                is

   * For Mr. Barrett's own account of his experiments          I     refer the reader
to the Philosophical Magazine for March 1867.

380           Prof. Tyndall on      the   Action of Sonorous
    In fig. 11 is represented another smoky flame, which, when
the whistle sounds, breaks up into the form shown in fig. 12.
    The foregoing experiments illustrate the lengthening and
 shortening of flames by sonorous vibrations. They are also able
to produce rotation.     I    have here several home-made burners,
from which issue flat flames, each about 10 inches high, and 3
inches across at their widest part.        The burners are purposely
so formed that the flames are dumpy and forked. When the
whistle sounds, the plane of each flame turns 90° round, and
continues in its new position as long as the sound continues.
    A flame of admirable steadiness and brilliancy now burns be
fore you.     It issues from a single circular orifice in a common
iron nipple. This burner, which requires great pressure to make
its flame flare, has been specially chosen for the purpose of en
abling you to observe with distinctness the gradual change from
apathy to sensitiveness.      The flame is now 4 inches high, and is
quite indifferent to sound.       By increasing the pressure       I
                                                                  make
its height 6 inches ; it is still indifferent.      I
                                                   make it 12 inches ;
a barely perceptible quiver responds to the whistle.           I
                                                               make it
16 or 17 inches high; and now it jumps briskly the moment the
anvil is tapped or the whistle sounded.         I
                                               augment the pressure ;
the flame is now 20 inches long, and you observe a quivering at
intervals, which announces that it is near roaring.           A slight
increase of pressure causes it to roar, and shorten at the same
time to 8 inches.    I    diminish the pressure a little ; the flame is
again  20  inches   long, but it is on the point of roaring and short
ening.     Like    the  singing flames which were started by the
voice, it stands on the brink of a precipice.       The proper sound
pushes it over.       It shortens when the whistle sounds, exactly
as it did when the pressure was in excess.         The action reminds
one of the story of the Swiss muleteers, who are said to tie up
their bells at certain places -lest the tinkle should bring an
avalanche down.      The snow must be very delicately poised be
fore this could occur.   Ibelieve it never did occur ; but our flame
illustrates the principle. We bring it to the verge of falling, and
the sonorous pulses precipitate what was already imminent.
This is the simple philosophy of all these sensitive flames.
    When the flame flares, the gas in the orifice of the burner has
been thrown into vibration ; conversely, when the gas in the orifice
is thrown into vibration, the flame, if sufficiently near the flaring
point, will flare. Thus the sonorous vibrations, by acting on the
gas in the passage of the burner, become equivalent to an aug
mentation of pressure in the holder.        In fact we have here re
vealed to us the physical cause of flaring through excess of pres
sure, which, common as it     is,
                               has never,    believe, been hitherto
                                               I
explained.    In the orifice of the burner the gas encounters

friction, which, when the force of transfer is sufficiently great,
throws the issuing stream into the state of vibration that pro
duces flaring.      It is because the flaring is thus caused that an
almost infinitely small amount of energy, applied in the form
of vibrations of the proper period, can produce an effect equiva
lent to a considerable increase of pressure.        Augmentation of
pressure     is,
               in  fact,   comparatively
                            a            clumsy   means of causing                  a
flame   to flare*.

                                                                         ;
special periods are required to produce the maximum effect.              The
effectual periods are those which synchronize most nearly with
the waves produced              by
                                the friction of the gas itself against the
sides of its orifice.        With some of the flames which you have
already     seen,   a  low   deep   whistle    more effective than
                                               is                      shrill a
one. With the flame now before you, the exciting tremors must
be very rapid, and the sound consequently shrill.                 have here
                                                                         I

clear and forcible note.          It has no effect upon this flame. Here
also are three other forks, vibrating respectively 320, 384, and
512 times in        a second. Not one of them produces the slightest
impression upon the flame.               But, besides their fundamental
tones,    these   forks,  as  you   know,   can be caused to yield     series a
of overtones of very high pitch.           I  sound this series   the vibra

tions are now 1600, 2000, 2400, and 3200 per second respect
ively. The flame jumps in response to each of these sounds,
the response to the highest sound of the series being the most
prompt and energetic of all.

                        a                  a board the flame also responds           ;
but to the tap of the same hammer upon an anvil the response
is  much more brisk and animated.              The reason          is,
                                                              that the clang

 lery, where he detaches the hammer.              The
 strokes  follow  each   other   in  rhythmic     suc
 cession, and at every stroke the flame falls
 from a height of 20 to a height of 8 inches,
 roaring as it falls.
    The rapidity with which sound is propa
gated through air is well illustrated by these
experiments : there is no sensible interval
between the stroke of the bell and the duck
ing of the flame.
    When the sound acting on the flame is of
very short duration, a curious and instructive
effect is observed.     The sides of the flame
 halfway down and lower are seen suddenly
fringed by luminous tongues, the central
flame remaining apparently undisturbed in
 both height and thickness.             The flame,
both in its normal state and with its fringes,
is shown in fig. 13. The effect is due to the
retention of the impression upon the retina.
The flame actually falls as low as the fringes,
but its recovery is so quick that to the eye
it does not appear to shorten at all*.
    The most marvellous flame hitherto discovered is now before
you. It issues from the single orifice of a steatite burner, and
reaches a height of 24 inches.            The slightest tap on a distant
anvil reduces its height     to  7  inches.     When     I  shake this bunch
of keys the flame is violently agitated and emits a loud roar.
The dropping of a sixpence into a hand already containing
coin knocks the flame down.                 I cannot walk across the
floor without agitating the flame : the creaking of my boots
sets it in violent commotion.           The crumpling or tearing of a
bit of paper,   or  the  rustle   of  a silk  dress, does the same.             It
is startled by the patter    of  a  raindrop.      I  hold   a watch   near   the
flame : nobody hears its ticks ; but you all see their effect upon
the flame : at every tick it falls.        The winding up of the watch
also produces tumult.       The    chirrup of a distant sparrow shakes
the flame down ; the note of a cricket would do the same. Prom
a distance of 30 yards I have chirruped to this flame, and caused
it to fall and roar.       I  repeat a passage from Spenser : the

    In our experiments down stairs we have
 called this the "vowel flame," because the differ

that they differ from each other through the
 admixture of higher tones with the funda

with   a  " hiss," the flame would instantly sympathize with him.
A   hiss contains the elements that most forcibly affect this flame.
 The gas issues from its burner with               hiss, and an external'

                                          is                             I

 384           Prof. Tyndall on  the Action of Sonorous
hold in my hand a metal box containing compressed air.                I
 turn the cock for a moment, so as to allow a puff to escape :
 the flame instantly ducks down, not by any transfer of air from
 the box to the flame ; for I stand at a distance which utterly
 excludes this idea; it is the sound that affects the flame.          I
 send a man to the most distant part of the gallery, where he
 permits the compressed air to issue in puffs from the box ; at
 every puff the flame suddenly falls.         Thus the hiss of the
issuing air at the one orifice precipitates the tumult of the
 flame at the other.
    Finally, I place this musical box upon the table, and permit
it to play.    The flame behaves like a sentient creature ; bowing
 slightly to some tones, but courtesying deeply to others.
    I at one time intended to approach this subject of sensitive
flames through a series of experiments which, had the flames
not been seen, would have appeared more striking than                I
can expect them to be now.           It is not to the flame, a3 such,
that we owe the phenomena which have just been described.
Effects substantially the same are obtained when a jet of
unignited gas, of carbonic acid, hydrogen, or even air itself,
issues from an orifice under proper pressure.          None of these
gases, however, can be seen in its passage through air; and
therefore we must associate with them some substance which,
while sharing their motions, will reveal those motions to
the eye.     The method which we have from time to time em
ployed in this place, of rendering aerial vortices visible, is well
known to many of you.        By tapping a membrane which closes
the broad mouth of a large funnel filled with smoke, we obtain
beautiful smoke-rings, which reveal the motion of the air.          By
associating smoke with our gas-jets in the present instance, we
can also trace their course ; and when this is done, the unignited
gas proves as sensitive as the flames.        The smoke-jets jump,
they shorten, they split into forks, or lengthen into columns
when the proper notes are sounded.             The experiments are
made in this way.      Underneath this gasometer are placed two
small basins, the one containing hydrochloric acid and the other
ammonia.      Fumes of sal-ammoniac are thus copiously formed,
and mingle with the gas contained in the holder.          We may, as
already stated, operate     with   coal-gas,  carbonic   acid, air, or
hydrogen : each of them yields good effects. Here also our ex
cellent steatite burner maintains that supremacy which it exhi
bited with the flames.      From it    I  can cause to issue a thin
column of smoke.        On sounding the whistle, which was so
effective with the flames, it is found ineffective.     When, more
over, the highest notes of a series of Pandean pipes are sounded,
they are also ineffective.    Nor will the lowest notes answer.

                 Vibrations   on Gaseous and    Liquid Jets.        385
But when     a certain pipe, which stands about the middle of the
series, is sounded, the smoke-column            drops, forming a short
stem with a thick, bushy head.             It is also pressed down, as
by a vertical wind, by a knock upon the table. At every tap
it falls. A stroke on an anvil, on the contrary, produces little
or no effect. In fact, the notes here effective are of a much
lower pitch than those which were most efficient in the case of
the flames.
    The amount of shrinkage exhibited by some of these smoke-
columns, in proportion to their length, is far greater than that
of the flames.      A tap on the table causes a smoke-jet eighteen
inches high to shorten to a bushy bouquet with a stem not
more than an inch in height.             The smoke-column, moreover,
responds to the voice ; a cough knocks it down : and it dances
to the tune of a musical box.          Some notes cause the mere top
of the smoke-column to gather itself up into a bouquet; at
 other notes the bouquet is formed midway down ; while notes of
 more suitable pitch cause the column to contract itself to a
 cumulus not more than an inch above the end of the burner.
 As the music continues, the action of the smoke-column consists
 of a series of rapid leaps from one of these forms to another*.
 Various forms of the dancing jet are shown in fig. 16.

 slender smoke-columns          rise
 sometimes to a height of two
 feet,   apparently      vanishing
 into air at their summits.
 Even the most sensitive flame
 then falls far behind them in
 delicacy ; and though less
  striking, the smoke wreaths
 are often more graceful than
  the flames. Every word and
  every syllable, for example,
  of the foregoing stanza from
  Spenser      tumbles     such     a
  smoke-jet      into confusion.
  To produce such effects a
  perfectly tranquil atmosphere
  is necessary.      Flame-experi
  ments are possible          in an
  atmosphere     where   smoke-jets are utterly unmanageable.

386                Prof. Tyndall on     the   Action of Sonorous
whose       notes,       written last   June,   I   make   the   following    ex
tract : —
   " From many experiments made with care the following facts
were obtained        :   —
   "   1.   A jet of air
                       rendered visible by suspended particles of
chloride of ammonium, when moving slowly, leaves the orifice
from which it is forced as a slender stream of the diameter of
the orifice, and of equal thickness throughout a length of from
6 to 12 inches.    It then spreads out in an inverted cone. When
at a higher velocity the apex of the cone approaches the orifice,
but maintains the same angular opening.             At the greatest
velocity the cone is formed almost immediately as the smoke
leaves the orifice.
    " 2. The appearances of a jet of air are in all respects the
 same as those of a jet of steam.
   " 3. When a tuning-fork is held near to this stream it causes
the cone to appear where it is held, thus instantly reducing the
height of the stream.              If
                                 held near the orifice the cone is no
longer one,   but   is split  into two, and each of the two streams
issuing from the central stream is seen to possess a kind of
involving motion.
   " 4. The splitting of the jet depends on the velocity of the
current in relation to the pitch of the fork.
   "5. With a very low velocity, giving a long parallel line ot
smoke, Ut4 will not divide the column, but Ut3 will easily
do so.    Increasing the velocity, the higher notes are all capable
of splitting the stream, whilst the lower notes lose their power.
   " 6. At a certain velocity the issuing air often is heard to
sound.     When this takes place, the column of air is seen to be
feebly bifurcated near its root.       A tuning-fork in unison with
the note (Ut3 or Mia) augments the intensity with which
the streams diverge.       The angle of divergence in all cases re
mains about the same, viz. about 60°.
   " 7. By tapping the table or support of the jet, the smoke is
caused to issue in pulses, giving the smoke as it rolls away a
most beautifully crimped appearance.
   " 8. The jet of smoke can be best seen by reflecting the sun
light on     it,
             and shielding the eyes from the direct glare.
   "9. The image of the jet, single and bifurcated, can be dis
tinctly seen     its shadow, and can be cast on
                   by                                screena        by

   " 10, The bifurcation occurs in the plane of the
                                                         prongs of the
tuning-fork.     This    invariably the case.
                             is

                             always easier to split near its root, and

generally the subdivision occurs at right angles to the plane of

    We have thus far confined our attention to jets of ignited
and unignited coal-gas, of carbonic acid, hydrogen, and air.
We will now turn to jets of water. And here a series of experi
ments, remarkable for their beauty, have long been known, which
claim relationship to those just described.     These are the expe
riments of Felix Savart on liquid veins, which have been
repeated, verified, and modified in various ways in this place.
If the bottom of a vessel containing water be pierced by a
circular orifice, the descending liquid vein will exhibit two parts
which are unmistakeably distinct. The part of the vein nearest
the orifice is steady and limpid, presenting the appearance of a.
solid glass rod.    It decreases in diameter as it descends, reaches
a point of maximum contraction, from which point downwards
it appears turbid and unsteady.       The course of the vein, more
 over, is marked by periodic swellings and contractions.           Savart
 has represented the vein in the manner shown in fig. 17.               In
 this figure a is the orifice end of the vein, the part a n is
 limpid and steady, while all the part below n is in a state of
 quivering motion.      This lower part of the vein appears continu
 ous to the eye ; still, when the finger is passed rapidly across                   it,
it    sometimes not wetted.
     is                             This, of course, could not be the
case     the vein were really continuous.
          if                                   The upper portion of the
vein, moreover, intercepts vision        the lower portion, even when
                                            ;
the liquid        mercury, does not.
                 is                         In fact, the vein resolves
itself at n into liquid spherules, its apparent continuity being
 due to the retention of the impressions made                        by
                                                              the falling
 drops upon    the  retina.        If

and no rupture of continuity can be observed.            If, while look
ing at the disturbed portion of the vein, the head be suddenly
lowered, the descending column will be resolved for              moment   a
into separate drops.        Perhaps the simplest way of reducing
the vein to its constituent spherules            one long ago adopted
                                                          is

                    Prof. Tyndall on  the Action of Sonorous
     exhibits.     The drops, as they Fig.     17.     Fig. 18.    Fig. 19.
     descend,    are continually chan-         «             a           a
     ging their forms.       When first
     detached from the end of the
     limpid portion of the vein the
     drop is a prolate spheroid, with
     its longest axis vertical.   But a
     liquid cannot retain this shape
     if abandoned to the forces of its
     own molecules.       The spheroid
     seeks to become a sphere.      The
    longer diameter therefore short
    ens; but, like a pendulum, which
    seeks to return to its position of
    rest, the contraction of the verti
    cal diameter goes too far, and the
    drop becomes a transversely ob
    late spheroid.       Now the con
    tractions of the jet are formed
    at those places where the long
    est axis of the drop is vertical,
    while the swellings appear where
    the longest axis is horizontal.
    It will   be  noticed that between
   every two     of the larger drops is
   a   third of much smaller dimen
   sions.   Whenever a large drop is
   detached, by a kind of kick on
   the part of the retreating vein,
   a little satellite is shaken after
   it. According to Savart, their
                                           'i
   appearance is invariable.
        This breaking up of a liquid
  vein into drops has been a sub
  ject of much discussion.      I hold
  it to be due to the tremors im
  parted to the water by its friction
  against the boundaries of its ori
  fice.    To this point Savart traced
  its pulsations,      though he did
  not think that friction was their
  cause.       Whatever their cause
  may be, the pulsations exist, and        1
  they arc powerfully influenced
  by sonorous vibrations, which render the
                                                    limpid portion of the
  vein shorter than it would
"                               otherwise be.      In the midst of a large
  city it is hardly possible to obtain the
                                              requisite aerial tranquillity

for the full development of the continuous portion of the vein ;
still Savart was so far able to withdraw his vein from the influ
ence of such irregular vibrations that its limpid portion became
elongated to the extent shown in fig. 19.          Fig. 17, it will be
understood, represents the vein exposed to the irregular vibra
tions of the city of Paris, while fig. 19 represents a vein pro
duced under precisely the same conditions, but withdrawn from
those vibrations.
    The drops into which- the vein finally resolves itself are inci
pient even in its limpid portion, announcing themselves there as
annular protuberances, which become more and more pronounced,
until finally they separate. Their birthplace is the orifice itself;
and under even moderate pressure they succeed each other with
sufficient rapidity to produce a feeble musical note.       By permit
ting   the drops   to  fall upon a membrane, the pitch     of this note
may be fixed ; and now we come to the point which connects the
phenomena of liquid veins with those of sensitive flames and
smoke-jets.      If a note in unison with that of the vein be sounded
near it,, the limpid portion instantly shortens : the pitch may vary
to some extent, and still cause a shortening ; but the unisonant
note is the most effectual.        Savart's beautiful experiments on
vertically descending veins have recently been repeated in our
laboratory with striking effect. From a distance of 30 yards
the limpid portion of a vein has been shortened by the sound
of an organ-pipe of moderate intensity but of the proper pitch.
    The excellent French experimenter also caused his vein to issue
horizontally and at various inclinations to the horizon, and found
 that in certain cases sonorous vibrations were competent to
cause a jet to divide into two or three branches.         In these ex
periments, the liquid was permitted to issue through an ori
fice in a thin plate.      Instead of this, however, we will resort to
our favourite steatite burner ; for with water also it asserts the
 same mastery over its fellows that it exhibited with flames and
 smoke-jets.     It will, moreover, reveal to us some entirely novel
results.    By means of an india-rubber tube the burner is con
nected with the water-pipes of the Institution, and by pointing
it obliquely upwards, we obtain a fine parabolic jet, fig. 20. At
 a certain distance from the orifice, the vein resolves itself into
spherules, whose motions are not rapid enough to make the vein
appear continuous.         At the vertex of the parabola the spray of
 drops is more than an inch in width, and further on they are
 still more widely scattered.      On sweeping a fiddle-bow across a
 tuning-fork of the proper pitch, the scattered drops, as if drawn
together by their mutual attractions, instantly close up and form
an apparently continuous liquid arch some feet in height and span,
fig. 21 . As long as the proper note is maintained the vein looks

like   a frozen band, so motionless    does       it appear.   On stopping
the fork, the arch is shaken asunder, and we have the same play
                               Fig.   20.
of liquid pearls  as before.  Every sweep of the bow, however,
causes the drops to fall into a common line of march.
   A pitch-pipe, or an organ-pipe yielding the note of this
tuning-fork, also powerfully controls the vein.       My voice does
the same.     On pitching it to a note of moderate intensity,            I
cause the wandering drops to gather themselves together.          At
a distance of 20 yards, my voice                 is,
                                             to all appearance, as
powerful in curbing the vein and causing its drops to close up
as when  I  stand close to the issuing jet.
   The effect of beats upon the vein     also beautiful and instruc
                                            is

                                          organ-pipes or         by

of maximum solar radiation in autumn, and also the diurnal maxima,
coincide with monthly and daily periods of maximum humidity.

     Postmeridian maxima of solar radiation. — Though it is well
 known at observatories that the hour of mean maximum solar heat
 occurs in England after midday, there is no numerical proof of the
 fact available, excepting the results of six days' observations by Pro
 fessor Daniel].     From experiments made by him in June (1822)
 between 9h 30m a.m. and 7h 30m p.m., the mean highest readings
 of a black-bulb thermometer were obtained at lh 30m. The following
 are the means before and after noon : —

    Daily maxima of vapour. — The means of vapour-tension have been
deduced at 10h a.m., noon, and 2h p.m. from the bi-horary observations
at Greenwich in 1842-47; the following Table, which contains the
monthly results for these hours, shows that the means at 2h are
higher than those at 10h-A.M., or at noon, in each month from March
to September : —

    Actinometer-observations. — The observations of the actinometer
made by Mr. Nash at the Royal Observatory in 1864 supply further
evidence of the fact that the maxima of radiation occur in the autumn,
and after midday.

tions which were taken at or near the same elevation of the sun, in
the months of August and September in autumn, and in March and
April in spring, the value of the mean increase of the scale-readings
in the autumn proved to be about 100 per cent, greater than in the
spring*.
   The mean increaseof the scale-readings in March and April was 1 9*4 .
   The mean increase of the scale-readings in Aug. and Sept. was 39'6.
   The difference is 20-2, at the same mean altitude of the sun.
   The means of the contemporaneous observations of the vacuum-
thermometer on the grass were as follows : —
                  In March and April                      70°-3 F.
                 In August and September . . . 84°- 7 F.
   The difference is 14°-4.

  Increased solar radiation supposed to be due to the action of
aqueous vapour. — Herr von Schlagintweit, applying Professor Tyn-
dall's discovery of the absorptive properties of aqueous vapour to the
phenomenon of insolation, attributed the high readings of his solar
thermometer, in certain parts of India, to the fact that air, when
highly charged with moisture, impedes free radiation ; that is to
say, the air restores to the instrument some portion of the heat which
has been radiated off from it.
   A like cause has been recently assigned for the variations in tem
perature which take place on clear nights in Madras under different
tensions of vapour, those nights being considered clear on which the
percentage of cloud did not exceed -10.        It was found by Colonel
Strachey,  on  a careful tabulation of hourly observations, that the fall
in temperature was decidedly greater when the quantity of vapour was
relatively small*.
   Cloud, haze, and opalescence t of the atmosphere more probably
the principal cause of the phenomenon. — It appeared of much im
portance to ascertain whether the presence of cloud, and the imper
fect state of transparency in the sky which usually accompanies                            it,
may not have materially assisted        producing the results alluded to
                                                   in
in the last paragraph, and, fortiori, account for the increased inso

lation noticed in cloudy weather in various parts of India — e. g. "on

 &51).
    To test this point, the results of the observations for the four years
 ending 1844, over which the inquiry at Madras extended, were di
 vided into groups of contemporaneous observations of temperature,
 vapour-tension, and percentage of clear sky, when the mean nume
 rical results showed that a progressive fall of about 1° F. for every
   10 of vapour- tension was accompanied by a proportionate increase
 •
 in the percentage of clear sky, — a result which is the more significant
 when it is considered that the infusion of visible cloud was limited
 to -10.
     To prevent mistake, the fall in temperature on the nights of maxi
 mum clearness was compared with the fall on nights of minimum
 clearness within the limits above stated.         There were twenty-five
 nights which were estimated to be perfectly clear, and twenty-two
 nights when the percentage of clear sky ranged from *90 to "93, the
 average being '915 (1*0 representing an entirely clear sky).          The
 results were as follows : —
     The mean fall of temperature at an estimated clearness of sky de
 noted by 1-0 was 8°-3 F.
     The mean fall of temperature at an estimated clearness denoted by.
 •915 was 6° F.
     The difference    is 20-3.  The contemporaneous mean tensions of
 vapour were -68 and '83 respectively.
     It is probable then, since cloud accompanies humidity, that tension
 of vapour gives some indication of the state of transparency of the
 sky.
     In any case it is sufficiently clear, both from the results at Madras
 and from the slight increase in tension at 2h p.m., that the amount
 of aqueous vapour alone is not sufficient to account for increased or
 diminished solar radiation.
     The explanation of the phenomenon of high insolation occurring
 on days of great relative humidity in India, however, which has been
 already alluded to, applies with increased force to the absorptive
 properties of visible moisture ; and the known action of even the light
 est form of cloud in radiating heat to the earth, would point to this
 as the principal cause of the phenomenon, though it cannot be
 doubted that it is partly due to the action of invisible vapour, whether
 as warmed directly by the solar rays, or by heat derived from a secon-
¦dary source.
     The dependence of terrestrial heat on vapour and cloud. — It
 was to increased or diminished radiation under a clear or clouded
 sky that the inflections of the curves of mean temperature, which
 were communicated to the Royal Society by the author in May 1865,
 were ascribed. The effects produced were on that occasion considered
 to be principally due to radiation at night ; but an examination of the
 daily means proved that a similar action occurred also by day, — the
 phenomenon in fact depending, as in the case of increased insolation,
 on the quantity of moisture in the air.

        " On the Jurassic Fauna and Flora of South Africa."           By
Ralph Tate, Esq., F.G.S.
    In this paper the author gave descriptions of the undescribed
fossils in the Society's Museum, obtained from the following
secondary deposits of Cape Colony, in ascending order : —
    1. Karoo Beds. — These strata, containing Dicynodon and Iridina,
have yielded a flora which was stated to present close analogy with
the plants of the Coal-formation of Burdvvan and Nagpur, India,
and the Newcastle Coal-field, New South Wales.         The characteristic
plant in each of these deposits, and in the Karoo Beds, is a Glos-
sopteris. The author regarded the age of the Karoo Beds, from
their position and organic contents, as approximating to that of the
Trias ; and he described from them species of the following genera :
— Glossopleris, Phyllotheca, Dictyopteris, Rubidgea, n. g., andAther-
stonea, n. g.
    2. Phytiferous Beds of Geelhoutboom. — The flora of this deposit is
characterized by the presence of Palceozamia, Arthrotaxites, Asple-
nites,Pecopteris,Sphenopteris, and Cyclopteris, several species of which
are comparable with certain others from the Oolitic series of Eu
rope, and of the Rajmahal Hills, India.          One species, Asplenites
lobata, Oldh., is common to South Africa and India.
    3. Marine Limestones, &c, of Port Elizabeth Province. — The
great mass of the fossils from this series are bivalves ; and the
extreme rarity of Cephalopoda, Polyzoa, Echinoderms, and Corals
was stated to call to mind the conditions of life which prevailed
 during the deposition of the upper members of the Lower Oolites in
 England.     The generic grouping is such as occurs in the Jurassic
 series ; and though no genus, represented in the South-African fauna,
is peculiar to the Jurassic rocks, yet the following give a marked
Oolitic facies to them : — Belemnites (Canaliculati),Act<eonina,Alaria,
Neritopsis, Pleuromya, Placunopsis, Isastraa, he.            Four species
 were referred to European forms, viz. Trigonia Cassiope, d'Orb.,
 T. Goldfussi, Ag., Serpula filaria, and S. plicatilis ; but a very large
number of the African shells have their representatives in the Lower
 and Middle Oolites of Europe, and their equivalents in India.

 the Fluviomarine    Crag."   By  the Rev.  O. Fisher, M.A., F.G.S.

 one on Aldringham      Common, the other near Henham Park Farm,
 given by Mr. Searles Wood in his paper
                                              " On the structure of the
 Red Crag."      Mr. Fisher admitted that the former is at a higher
level than the Thorpe Crag-pit, and the latter than the Wangford
 Crag ; but he denied that the loam on Aldringham Common is
 Chillesford clay, and was doubtful whether even that at Henham

Park Farm belongs to that deposit. Granting, however, that the
loam in the latter case is really Chillesford clay, the author stated
that it is probably carried under the Wangford Crag by a northern
dip.    Thus he considered that neither of these sections contains
indisputable evidence of the superposition of the Chillesford clay to
the Fluviomarine Crag.          He also expressed a doubt of the crag at
Bulchamp being        a continuation     of the Wangford bed, and stated
that it much more resembles the Mya-bed as seen at Yam Hill. If
this interpretation be correct, Chillesford clay might occur at
Henham Park Farm intermediate between the Crag of Wangford
and the Mya-bed at Bulchamp.

    electricians who have adopted the British-Association unit for elec
trical measurements, that in place of expressing this unit, as is va
riously done at present, by

it would   be very convenient to adopt some universal symbol analo
gous to that used for degrees (°).
   The Greek letter to appears to me very convenient, not only from
its similarity in name, but from its comparative freedom from general
use as expressive of any particular function or quantity.
    Moreover it offers a simple and admirable method by which we
may distinguish conductivity from insulation resistance — a source of
great inconvenience at present — by joining the small letter (w) to
the former, and the capital (G) to the latter.          Thus, instead of dis
tinguishing the two as is now         done,  by an immense series and rows
 of figures, or, as is proposed to be done, by calling the one Ohm,
and the other Megohm or Milliohm, we should have
                                                   metre

The conductivity of the Atlantic cable would be given by

and its insulation by
                                  2349Q per knot,
which may still be read Ohm and Megohm.

 ON    THE   VELOCITY      WITH WHICH     A DISTURBANCE, PRODUCED
     IN A GASEOUS      MASS  CONTAINED IN A CYLINDRICAL TUBE, IS
     PROPAGATED.        BY M. P. F. LE ROUX.
    The memoir which I have the honour of submitting to the
 Academy contains the description and the results of experiments
 made in 1862 and 1863, on which I have already made a commu
 nication, and of which several members of the Academy have been
witnesses.
    I proposed to solve experimentally the following question : — to
measure directly by purely mechanical means on a relatively short
base the velocity of propagation of a single impulse, communicated
 to a gaseous mass of determinate temperature contained in a
 cylindrical tube.
    I began by devising a new chronoscope, based on the law of the
descent of bodies, by which short intervals of time may be measured
with great accuracy, and which is always ready to work in exactly
the same manner without needing special preparation — an advan
tage which chronoscopes moved by clockwork do not possess.            As
 a means of pointing, I used the action of the induction spark on a
slightly iodized surface of silver — a method on which I shall not
 dwell, as it has already been the subject of a communication to the
Academy.
    The tube in which the disturbance was to be produced was 7           .
 centimetres in diameter by 72 metres in length ; it was bent in
two, and it could be surrounded with water or with melting ice.
    The two ends of the tube were closed by very thin and tightly
stretched membranes of vulcanized caoutchouc.        A wooden hammer,
moved by springs, struck one of these membranes with a single blow,
and thus imparted to the air in the pipe a disturbance which in
about y of a second moved the second membrane. In front of each
was placed a kind of little pendulum traversed by the induction
current of a RuhmkorfPs coil ; the motion of the membrane dis
turbing the pendulum broke the secondary current, and produced
the induction spark, the trace of which was received on the scale of
the moving chronoscope.        In this way the beginning and end of the
propagation of the impulse were indicated.
    This method, which is very simple in principle, requires in practice
a large number of precautions, which cannot be given here.
    To dry the air in the tube, a circulating motion was imparted to
it by means of a special pump, so as to pass it several times over
substances which would deprive it of moisture and carbonic acid.
As an accessory, and also in order to estimate the tension of the
small quantity of aqueous vapour which might still exist in the air,

I lowered the temperature by causing the gas to traverse a glass
tube immersed in a freezing-mixture whose temperature was indi
cated by a thermometer.
    The rectilinear distance traversed was measured with particular
care, by means of iron measures          2 metres in length, which were
compared     with  the  official standards.
    The bent part was directly estimated by taking the rectilinear
length equivalent to it : I determined it by comparing the lengths
of two organ-pipes — one straight, and the other comprising the
bend itself which had been used in my experiments — these two
tubes being brought to render exactly the same fundamental note.
    From the mean of several series made at the temperature of
melting ice, and comprising seventy-seven determinations, I deduce,
for the velocity of the propagation of a disturbance under the given
 conditions, the number 330*66 metres in a second, — the possible error
not exceeding y^Tr*
    In the introduction to my memoir I discuss the previous experi
 ments on the propagation of sound in the atmosphere ; I reduce
 them to zero by means of Regnault's coefficient of expansion, and
 make at the same time the probable correction in each case for the
 hygrometric state of the air.        Of eight numbers representing the
 results, five are between 332 and 332*44 metres.            On the other
hand, the number obtained in 1822 by Arago and the Bureau des
 Longitudes, agrees almost exactly with my estimate. The English
 astronomer Goldingham's number(331-l metres) is very near Arago's
 number.
    Experiments made in the open air on a base of several kilometres
 can clearly only inspire a very limited degree of confidence, owing
 to the considerable uncertainty which must prevail as to the true
 value of the temperature of the air in the path of the sonorous im
 pulse. And the error in this respect is the more to be feared,
 as most of these experiments have been made during the night.
 Now the researches of modern physicists, such as MM. Babinet,
 Becquerel, Martens, &c, have proved the existence of a maximum
 temperature during the night extending to a greater or less height.
 And Mr. Glaisher's balloon-ascents during the night have shown
 that the temperature often continues to increase for considerable
 heights.     The influence of this cause would be to give velocities
 which are too great ; and it is exactly the smallest of the numbers
 found for the propagation in free air which is nearest to that I found
 for the propagation in a cylinder.
    Hence it is probable that the two velocities of propagation,
 spherical and cylindrical, are equal ; but to obtain a definite solution
 of this question it would be necessary to work in the atmosphere
 on a small basis, so as to be able completely to study the distribu
 tion of temperature in the space'.          My experimental method is
 eminently fitted for such an investigation ; I had arranged ap
 paratus with this view ; but the perfect calm of the atmosphere
 which is necessary for the working appears difficult to meet with
 in our climates. — Comptes Rendus, March 4, 1867.

               NOTE ON THE THEORY OF TIDAL FRICTION.
                             BY D. D. HEATH, M.A.
        To the  Editors of the Philosophical Magazine       and  Journal.
                                                             Kitlands, Dorking,
        Gentlemen,                                            April 12, 1867-
    I have only today seen a short criticism on my March paper, by
 Mr. Stone.
     I think he will see, on reconsideration, that there is no inconsis
 tency in my treatment of the orders of small magnitudes.                 In the
 first investigations I am dealing with linear magnitudes ; and I believe
 I keep them in due subordination. In (11), which Mr. Stone com
 ments upon, I am concerned with a moment, or product of volume,
 accelerating force, and leverage, and I compare two quantities of
 this kind together.
     As this is the part of my paper which is most likely to be gene
 rally interesting, I may perhaps be allowed to restate its purport.
     On the assumptions which I have borrowed from Mr. Airy, the
 tide-wave, with friction, will lie obliquely at a certain angle S to
 the moon's position.        If we imagine it to become momentarily rigid
 and attached to the earth, the moon's action will tend to produce
 rotation westward, or check the actual eastward rotation ; and the
 moment of this action I calculate as 2^Hcsin 25 (I +ic)7r. If the rigi
 dity continued, the obliquity, and consequently the moon's action,
 would change. But in fact the oscillatory motion of the water is
 such as to keep the ridge always in the same relative place.               And
 the question then is, Does the reaction of friction (supposing it to
 act as required by Mr. Airy's theory) produce the same effect on the
 earth as would be produced at each moment by a rigid wave-shape ?
 And my answer is that the effect of such reaction is a force whose
 moment is                      — a quantity not only of the same order of
                     (1 +ic)ir,
 magnitude, but identical with the former one, as appears by the pre
 vious calculation.
     In the investigation, v is essentially the oscillatory velocity which
 produces the wave-shape.           If therefore there is a permanent current
 (which     I neither  affirm   nor  deny), the force of friction will not be
jv, as we have supposed, but/(V+«), where V is the velocity of the
 current ; and I fear the whole matter, when friction is taken account
 of, may require reexamination.
      I take this opportunity of requesting the readers of my original
 paper to strike out the latter part of the paragraph (4, a) as thought
 lessly written.      The reason for taking the force set free as simply
 vertical and — 2nv is, that we have just before shown that the whole
 velocity is sensibly horizontal.
     I will also notice a misprint. In page 167, last line, read

 LIII.   On some Phenomena connected with the Adhesion of Liquids
    to  Liquids.       By Charles Tomlinson, F.C.S., Lecturer on
    Experimental Science, King's College School, London*.

            force of adhesion that exists between liquids and liquids
THEis generally treated             of under the heads of diffusion and
 solution.    While, however, there may be little or no adhesion
between the respective masses or volumes of two liquids, there
may be a powerful adhesion between their surfaces.                 A drop of
creosote, for example, may remain at the bottom of a vessel of
water for honrs, or even days, apparently unchanged; but if
gently deposited on its surface it will disappear, partly by solu
tion and partly by evaporation, in the course of a few minutes.
There exists, in fact, at the surface of liquids a remarkable force
of adhesion for other liquids, different from what is commonly
understood by diffusion and solution, but rather resembling the
attraction that has been recorded and measured between disks
of glass or metal and liquid surfaces.
    The remarkable properties of liquid surfaces have attracted
the attention of physicists at various times.            Not to dwell upon
the fact noticed by Pliny, and experimented on by Franklin,
that oil, by spreading over the surface of water agitated by
the wind, tends to calm it (as we believe, by destroying the ad
hesion between the water and the wind), we may refer to the
researches of Carradori, who wrote expressly              on the subject    f,
   * Communicated by the Author.
   t Dr. G. Carradori, Honorary Professor in the University of Pisa, was,
I believe, the first to call attention to some of the remarkable properties of
the surfaces of liquids.     His first memoir, " Dell' Adesione o Attrnzione

402      Mr. C. Tomlinson      on some Phenomena connected with
and also to those of Volta, Brugnatelli, Prevost, Venturi, and
others who noticed it incidentally in their discussions on the
cause of the motions of camphor on water.              Carradori distinctly
showed that oily liquids insoluble in water adhere to its surface
with varying degrees of force, and that in general essential oils have
a greater adhesion for water than fixed oils. In 1842-43 Dutrochet
published an elaborate work* on the surface-action of liquids, in
which he endeavoured to account for the phenomena by assu
ming the existence of a peculiar force which he termed the epi-
polic, and which according to him is not identical either with heat
or electricity, though partaking somewhat of the characters of
both those forces.
    I  have at various times during the last few years published
some researches on this surface-action of liquids f.               It is pro
bable that most of the facts discovered by the earlier inquirers
and the new facts introduced by me are to be explained by re
ference to the forces of adhesion and cohesion ; but some of them
point apparently to a variation or modification of these forces
which does not seem to be well understood.                 For example, in
all my experiments on cohesion-figures             I  have insisted on the
necessity of employing a chemically clean vessel and a chemi
cally clean liquid surface, or there would be no adhesion between
the two liquids, and the experiment would fail.                  But   I have
 often been struck with a failure of adhesion when want of che
 mical purity could scarcely have been the cause.              I  have failed
to produce figures in glasses and with glass rods that had been
washed in sulphuric acid or caustic potash and well rinsed, until,
 apparently by exposure to the air, the glasses, the rods, and the
liquid surface had assumed an active condition.
     I will illustrate these and some other phenomena by reference
 to the motions of creosote on water.            When a drop of creosote
 is gently deposited on the surface of clean water in a chemically
 clean vessel, it forms a well-defined cohesion-figure.            The drop
 flattens down into a disk about three tenths of an inch in dia
 meter ; its edge enters at once into rapid vibratory motion, pro
 ducing a quivering of the whole surface of the water; minute

 over the surface of the water, diminishing in size, and vibrating
 even more rapidly, until at length it disappears.            (See Plate IV.
 fig. 1.)
     I have already explained* that this figure is the resultant of
 two forces —namely, that of cohesion among the particles of the
 creosote, which tends to keep the figure together, and that of
 adhesion of the surface of the water, which tends to break it up.
     The figure from one drop of creosote on the surface of two
 ounces of distilled water contained in a shallow glass vessel 3
inches in diameter lasts about five minutes.              But if the tempe
rature be below about 50°, the cohesion of the figure cannot re
sist the adhesion of the surface.         As soon as the drop is placed
on the water, the figure is formed for an instant, but it splits
open, forms a kind of brittle arc (figs. 2 & 3), which is shivered
into a number of separate disks (fig. 4), each of which is a per
fect cohesion-figure       of creosote.    These figures perform their
evolutions independently of each other, sailing about with rapi
dity, but never clashing with or disturbing each otherf.
    The drop of creosote, instead of forming an active figure, may,
under certain conditions, rest on the surface of the water in the
form of a well-shaped double-convex lens.             These conditions are,
 (1) want of adhesion, which may result from impurity of surface,
and is to be got rid of by a thorough washing ; or (2) that un
explained condition of inactivity already referred to.            This inac
tivity  can   be  produced by     heat.   For     example,  the  end  of the
glass rod used for depositing the drop on the water was held in
the flame of a spirit lamp for a short time and then dipped into
the creosote.       The drop delivered to the surface of the water
was an inactive lens.        After about two minutes it became active.
The rod was kept in boiling water for some minutes, and after
a hasty wiping was used for depositing the drop ; an inactive
lens was again formed.          A few drops of ether were poured on
the surface of the water and fired ; the surface was rendered in
active for about five minutes ; the drop of creosote then flattened
down from a lens into a disk with a sharp edge ; it began to
sway about, then to progress slowly over the surface ; in five
minutes more the edge began to quiver, and, after various at
tempts, the vibratory motion set in, but not with the vigour dis
played by the figure under its most favourable conditions.                It

    t In the follow ing experiments (unless otherwise stated) the same vessel
of 3 inches in diameter was used with 2 oz. of distilled water. The vessel
was cleaned after every experiment, either with sulphuric acid or caustic
potash solution.     Morson's creosote, redistilled at about 418°, was used.
The distillate was bright and colourless, and did not become coloured by
exposure to light.

40A      Mr. C. Tomlinson     on some Phenomena connected    with
is remarkable that the flame of pure hydrogen jetted on the glass
rod and on the surface of the water had no effect in rendering
either inactive.    The inactive condition of the rod is exchanged
for an active one by exposure to the air.
    A moderate elevation of the temperature of the water is suffi
cient to produce this inactive surface.      At 160° F. there was no
adhesion ; the creosote slipped through the surface and formed
 an inactive sphere at the bottom.      At 110° the creosote was in
 active at the surface, and remained so during twenty-five minutes.
 In anbther experiment an inactive lens on a surface of water at
 114° became an active figure on pouring in cold water.
     If the creosote itself be heated instead of the water or the rod,
 it forms inactive figures for a few seconds.      Creosote raised to
 120° was thus inactive.
     The surface of the water is also rendered more or less inactive
 by heat for other substances as well as creosote.        The well-de
 fined but rapid figures of carbolic and cresylic acids are delayed
 on water at 120° : they first form clear cut disks, and continue
 many seconds longer than on cold water.         Ether becomes sphe
 roidal on water at 120°, and rolls about in the form of a sphere ;
 or if the figure be formed, it is imperfect.        The well-defined
 figures of castor-oil and oil of lavender are either not produced
 at all, or are greatly injured, on water at 120°.
     At lower temperatures than the above, the adhesion of the
 surface is so far diminished as to exert a marked effect on the
 duration of the creosote figure.       With water at 98° the figure
 was very active, but its duration was eighteen minutes instead of
 five.    In summer weather, when the air is at 70°, the figure
 does not in general split up.
     This diminished force of adhesion consequent on a rise of
 temperature seems to be the commencement of the condition
 which finally ends in inactivity. There are not only fewer par
 ticles within a given area, but their attractive force is diminished
 and the repulsive force increased.      This is not like a case of in
 creased solubility from heat, as when a body dissolves more
 freely in a hot than in a cold menstruum; for in such case the
 body is not only expanded by the heat, but currents are excited
 in the liquid which are constantly bringing fresh particles to
 act on it.    But in the surface-action to which we refer, the cur
 rents, if any, are chiefly horizontal, and the first touch of the
creosote with the heated surface may saturate the exceedingly
thin upper liquid layer, where the adhesive force chiefly resides.
 It is possible, too, that in some cases, when the disks are inac
tive, the inactivity may be due to a spheroidal condition, although
this would not account for all the phenomena above noticed.
    In another experiment the active creosote figure was sur

                     the Adhesion    of Liquids   to   Liquids.                       405
rounded by atmospheres of hydrogen and carbonic acid.     In hy
drogen the vibrations of the figure were changed into a series of
rapid jerks, and the duration was extended from five minutes to
eleven or twelve; but this may be accounted for by the fact that
evaporation was checked and that moisture condensed on the
figure.       In   carbonic acid the action was very energetic, and the
duration shortened from five minutes to two or three.           A second
and a third drop on the same surface also disappeared quickly,
very much more so than on water in air, where the first drop lasts
five minutes, the second twelve,and the third twenty-five; whereas
in a carbonic acid atmosphere the first drop disappeared in two
minutes, the second in three, and the third in six; so that car
bonic acid greatly assists the adhesive force of the water-surface
for creosote.
    Other modes of modifying the adhesive force of the water-
surface are, (1) by the addition of small portions of liquids or
of solids more or less soluble in water, and (2) by covering the
surface more or less with a liquid film.
   A single drop of strong acetic acid was added to the water
 (below 50°) before the creosote was put on.         The figure did not
split up; it was very active, but the duration was seventeen
minutes instead of five.
    Now the addition of a body soluble in water partly satisfies,
and so far diminishes its adhesive force ; that                    is,
                                                             the water                 is
occupied    with  other  business   and  cannot  give  its undivided   at
tention to the creosote.        Although    water   alone   has   certain     a
adhesion to creosote, and acetic acid        much stronger adhesion,
                                                  a
yet the adhesion of acetic acid to water         stronger than that of
                                                       is
water to creosote.      The figure does not break up, because the
adhesion of the water-surface         actually diminished
                                         is                     the addi by
tion of   a substance in which creosote           is
                                               very soluble.
    In like manner,      drop of ether added to the water before the
                         a
creosote  is  put on may prevent the figure from breaking up.

as to increase that quivering of the surface already referred to                       ;
and yet in an experiment of this kind the duration was fourteen
minutes instead of five.
    Six drops of alcohol were added to water.       The creosote figure
did not break up, and its duration       was  twelve  minutes.
  A    drop of bisulphide of carbon forms        lens on the surface of

 the lens, and bombarded        with minute globules, which the lens
                                it
 absorbed.     After some time the lens flattened down into film                  a

 and these at once became active.         Meanwhile the parent figure
 continued to vibrate, and its duration was greatly prolonged. .

406    Mr. C. Tomlinson        on some Phenomena connected   with
   A    drop of benzole on the surface flattened out into a disk
 about an inch in diameter.      The moment the creosote touched
 the water, the benzole reasserted nearly the whole of its cohe
  sive force, and shrunk up into a double-convex lens. The creosote
 figure played about this lens and drove it about; and the dura
 tion of the figure was, as in the other cases, greatly increased.
     A drop of Persian naphtha spread out into a film. The creo
 sote figure did not make it collapse as in the case of benzole,
 but ploughed through it and cut it up in various directions, as
 camphor does through films of newly distilled essential oils*.
     Small portions of certain soluble salts greatly diminish, or
 even destroy the adhesion of the surface of the water.         About
 three-quarters of an ounce of a hot saturated solution of sulphate
 of magnesia was poured into the glass, which was filled up with
 about 1£ ounce of cold distilled water.         A drop of creosote
 gently   delivered to the surface sank  to the bottom,  and remained
 apparently without change during twenty-four hours.
     Twenty grains of sulphate of magnesia were put into the glass
 and 2 ounces of cold distilled water poured in.        When the salt
 was dissolved, a drop of creosote was placed on the surface.       It
 formed a large flat circular disk, the edge of which showed
 minute vibrations. After a few minutes a portion only of the
 edge vibrated, the other part being rounded and sharp.            In
 this way it made several attempts at vibration and progressive
 motion ; but after about twenty minutes it became inactive, and
 continued so during twenty-three hours, gradually diminishing
 in size during that time.
     It thus 'appeared that a much less quantity than 20 grains
 would suffice to lower or destroy the adhesive force of the sur
 face.    Five grains of Epsom salts to the 2 ounces of water ex
 tended the duration of the figure from five to fifteen minutes. Six
 drops of the saturated solution (cold) added to the water, extended
the duration to fourteen minutes and a half, and prevented the
 quivering of the surface.     A second drop of creosote placed on
 the surface when tbe first had disappeared, sank to the bottom.
     Four grains of common salt extended the duration to fifteen
minutes; 4 grains of alum rendered the figure inactive in four
teen minutes ; 6 grains of acetate of soda in 2 ounces of water
at 70° did not seem to disturb the activity of the figure, but
changed its character to a shuffling kind of motion.       The figure
was greatly influenced by the capillarity of the side, sailing
round near the edge, and leaving behind          it,
                                                  rather than throw
ing out, numerous small disks, which, usually so active, were in
this case inactive.     The duration of the figure was thirteen
minutes.

   The duration varied considerably with several other salts. A
curious effect was produced when the creosote was placed on 2
ounces of lime-water.    The figure was very active; but, instead
of shooting out globules in radial lines, the globules were united
into rays, giving the figure the star-like appearance of the cre-
sylic-acid figure, with the rays occasionally forked and waving.
A film was quickly formed by the union of the creosote and the
lime, and strong currents were excited in this film by the vibra
ting figure. Gradually the film gained consistence and closed
in on the figure more and more, until it disappeared by solution
or combination with the lime.       A second drop made its way
through the film, cleared out a small space, and was very active.
When this was over, a third drop sank through the film and was
suspended by it just below the surface, where it remained inac
tive until a portion of the film was cleared away ; and then it
started into life.
   It appears, then, that the preoccupation of the surface by
another film destroys its adhesion for creosote, unless the film or
a portion of it be cleared away.    In a large variety of cases cre
osote exerts a displacing-power of its own, which is often differ
ently exerted in the case of volatile oils as compared with fixed
oils.  This difference, which serves as a sort of measure of the
adhesive force of the surface for various oils &c, may next be
considered.
     Many of the oils of the turpentine series are spread with great
energy by the adhesion of the surface.        Thus a drop of the es
sential oil of turpentine no sooner touches the surface than it
flashes out into a film which satisfies its adhesion.           now a    If
drop of creosote be placed on this film,      it simply slips through
and falls to the bottom of the vessel ; but if the drop be carefully
delivered to the water near the edge, it will form a convex lens,
and, slightly repelling the turpentine film, will make its way into
it, so as to be surrounded       by   it,
                                     with   clear intervening space.

408       Mr. C. Tomlinson        on some Phenomena connected with
   Oil of cajeput forms     a good film on the surface of water, nearly
 covering   it.  A  drop   of creosote at the side slowly made its way
 into the film,   which    retreated   from         it,
                                                  waving backwards and
 forwards as   ifreluctant to be displaced.         The creosote lens gra
 dually flattened down, and in ten minutes became active, sailing
 about and repelling the film, which gathered up into disks. The
 figure was very active, producing that flashing kind of motion
 on the surface already alluded to, and clearing            wide circuit of

 in the process. The figure     continued    active during eight minutes,
 thus making eighteen in all from the first putting on of the creo
 sote.   The cajeput disks now flattened out into films;             second

 formed    afilm which arrested the motions of the second creosote
 figure and as the film became thinner
       ;                                                  by
                                                       evaporation,     was it
 curious to notice the creosote gradually becoming active.             First
 the edge of the lens became uneasy with nervous twitchings,
 then it  became    alittle ragged, and suddenly the whole figure
 started into life.     A third film and       third figure went through

 their operations on the same surface, the duration of each being,
 of course, prolonged.
    The experiment was repeated with water at 75°; and the                       di
 minished adhesion was shown               the cajeput film now occupy
                                           by
 ing less than half the surface instead of the whole.           The creo
 sote formed   a lens as before, which made its way into the film
 and, gradually flattening, became active.
    The film produced        by
                              oil of Myristica also shows these effects
exceedingly well.
    Oil of savin, oil of juniper, and several others formed films
which permanently arrested the motions of the creosote figure                    ;
but on redistilling these oils so as to get rid of oxidized products,
smaller films were formed, showing how greatly they had improved
in cohesive force        being purified. When the savin film was
                        by
first on the surface, the creosote figure made             contract into

                                                                    a
shaped lens.
   Newly distilled oil of coriander forms    beautiful cohesion-
                                                          a
figure on  the surface of water.   The drop spreads rapidly out
into  a film of large size then the edge breaks into regular
                                  ;                                     a
and somewhat serrated character, and the film contracts rapidly,
leaving the serrations long and thin.   Some of the spaces be

                    the Adhesion        of Liquids   to   Liquids.            409
tween the teeth or rays run deeper in than others.       Each tooth
or ray as it contracts leaves dots of oil regularly placed behind
it. In this state it forms fig. 5, the formation of the dots being
shown in fig. 5 a.    Then the deep indentations run more deeply
and rapidly in, to branch out into rounded hollows within the
disk, as in fig. 6. These ramifications increase and deepen, until
they break up the central disk into a number of small disks,
which finally remain arranged somewhat symmetrically, as in
fig. 7.    Ifthe creosote be put first upon the surface, the corian
der instantly arrests its motions.     In a recent experiment the
creosote split, up into a number of active figures, which the co
riander rendered motionless.      But in the course of twenty mi
nutes the smallest of the creosote disks became active, cleared a
small space in the film for its operations, soon became wildly
active, and disappeared with frantic gesticulations.       Then the
large disks became active.      It seemed as if the coriander film
had at first closed in all round the creosote figures and stopped
them ; but as the creosote retained possession of the spots of
water on which they actually stood, they waited their time, and
as the coriander film became weakened by evaporation and solu
tion the creosote gradually repelled it and soon made a clear
space for its own exertions.     Having once secured this space, it
extended    it,and passed over the whole surface, carrying its own
clear surrounding space along with it. Indeed the manner in
which the creosote figure cuts through some films without touch
ing them    is  remarkable sight. As the figure advances, the film
                a
recedes, sometimes one, or two, or three tenths of an inch, or more
from the figure.        It at the edge of the figure that the chief
                             is
contest between cohesion and adhesion        going on, and here
                                                          is
is that solution takes place and the figure wastes away                   :   it   is it
always surrounded          solution which wells away outwards, and
                          by   a
which, though invisible, makes its presence felt by its repulsive
action.   The outward action      also evident by the globules of
                                            is
creosote which are discharged in radial lines from the figure.
   Oil of lavender, unless recently distilled, permanently arrests
the motions of the creosote figure      and even the fresh oil does
                                                 ;
so for a very long  time.     drop   of Athe oil on water makes its
beautiful cohesion-figure*, which terminates in          multitude ofa
small lenses connected         film which easily resinifies
                                   by   a                       expo     by
sure to the air.   But even in such       case the creosote in the
                                                     a
course of an hour or so became active, and repelled the film, its
duration being estimated by hours instead of minutes.
   If further proof were wanting of the remarkable force of ad
hesion that exists between creosote and the surface of water,                 it   is
to be found in the fact that creosote displaces many of the fatty

410      Mr. C. Tomlinson              on some Phenomena connected            with
oils.   For example, a drop of castor-oil nearly covered the sur
face  with its beautiful cohesion-figure.      In this case a larger
glass  was used,   4 inches in  diameter   instead   of 3. A drop of
creosote placed at the side instantly became active, causing the
oil to contract into a lens and chasing it about. When the creo
sote had disappeared, the oil flattened out into a film that occu
pied nearly the whole surface.     A second drop of creosote did
not shut it up again, but ploughed through                         it,
                                                     turning over and
thickening the edges of the severed portions. The film was now
in long trails, which were swept about                        by
                                                 the vibrating figure.
When this had disappeared, these trails flattened out and again
nearly covered the surface.     A third drop of creosote cleared                     a
wide space among the films, like open water in ice.             film of      A
castor-oil on warm water       spun  out
                                       is into  threads  by the  action
of the creosote that is, the film, instead of being cut through,
                         ;
is united        thread which spins off from one part of the nearly
                by   a
severed portion to the other, until the part which gives the
thread    is   exhausted.
   The creosote figure also repelled and cut up films of whale-oil,
fish-oil, nut-oil, and several other fatty oils.      pale seal-oil,     A
very pure and limpid, made       large film.a  The creosote figure
repelled    strongly, but did not shut up. As the figure moved
           it                                            it
about     made deep bays in the edge, which yielded as the figure
         it
travelled along.    The effect was as    a ship were invading the
                                                         if
land and carrying its own water, for many feet round         to sail         it,
in. The film formed               by
                           balsam of copaiba    at once invadedis                    by
the creosote figure, which continues active during twenty minutes
or more.
    In the preceding details creosote has been taken as the stand
ard, and the adhesive force of the water judged of with reference
to it.   Oils of the turpentine series and some other essential oils
arrest the motions of the creosote figure only for           short time. a
As the film of oil becomes thinner the creosote becomes active,
and completes its course.      Now the time occupied by the figure
in doing this may be taken as        sort of measure of the adhesion
                                                a
of the surface for the oil in question.                       If
                                                    film of turpentine
                                                                   a
extend the duration of the creosote figure to ten minutes, and                       a
film of oil of nutmegs to twenty minutes,            presumed that the
                                                              it   is
latter oil adheres twice as strongly to the surface as the former.
So, when the creosote displaces films, and its duration          scarcely    is
prolonged    at all, the adhesion   between   the  water    and  the  film
can   be but small. Where     the duration   of the    creosote,  without
losing its activity,     considerably extended, the adhesion of the
                             is
film must be considerable.     It     thought that in this way
                                                    is
Tables of the adhesive force of different liquids for each other
may be framed.

   But there are liquids which render creosote permanently in
active.    Such are the oleines of tallow, of fish-oil, of lard, of
horse-fat, and of palm-oil, as also oleic acid from beef-tallow.
Whether the creosote be first put on the surface, or the oleine,
the creosote remains permanently inactive.
   In such a case we may judge of the adhesive force of the
oleines by their power of displacing other films.         The following
experiments were tried in a shallow glass 4 inches in diameter,
instead of 3 as in nearly all the previous experiments.
   Castor-oil nearly covered the surface.          A drop of oleine of
fish-oil displaced it powerfully and occupied nearly the whole
surface, the castor-oil being shut up into a lens.        Oil of cajeput
was similarly displaced.      This oleine also displaced a film of pale
seal-oil which nearly covered the surface, while pale seal-oil in
its turn displaced a film of the essential oil of nutmegs ; so that
Carradori's observation that the essential oils are more strongly
attracted by the water-surface than the fixed oils is not correct.
Indeed films of oil of turpentine and of oil of rosemary were pow
erfully displaced by the oleine of tallow ; and oil of lavender,
which so powerfully arrests the activity of the creosote figure, is
displaced by the oleine of fish-oil.
   Without multiplying these and similar experiments,              I  will
conclude with three tabular statements, showing what liquids
permanently arrest the activity of creosote, what do so only tem
porarily, and, lastly, the liquids that creosote displaces.            It
should, however, be remarked that the essential oils which per
manently arrest creosote cease to do so when newly distilled.

    Taking the cohesion-figure of creosote as a kind of measure
or index of the adhesive force of the surface of water, it appears
from the foregoing details —
    1 . That the creosote may be rendered inactive by heat.
    2. That the adhesive force of the liquid surface declines as the
temperature is raised.      This is shown by the creosote figure being
either not formed at all, or having, when formed, its duration
considerably extended.
    3. That the duration of the figure is increased in a hydrogen,
and diminished in a carbonic acid atmosphere.
    4. That the adhesive force of the surface is diminished by the
 addition to the water of small portions of liquid and solid bodies
soluble therein.
    5. That the adhesive force of the surface is diminished or de
stroyed by placing on it a film of some other liquid.
    6. That the adhesive force of a film for the surface of water
may be estimated by the displacing-power of creosote, or by the
increased duration of the creosote figure.

LIV.      On the Influence of the Adhesion of Vapour in Experiments
            on the Absorption of Heat.    By G. Magnus*.
      ROFESSOR TYNDALL published in                    1861, simultane-
J-      ously with myself, an investigation of the transmission
of heat through various gases. Both investigations, made inde
pendently of each other and by different methods, yielded the
result that gases differ, in their capacity of transmitting heat, so
far, that certain of them enclosed in a tube a metre in length
transmit less than half the incident heat, while atmospheric air
under the same circumstances scarcely interferes with the trans
mission.     In this respect the results we obtained agree in gene
ral ; but as regards air saturated with aqueous vapour, they ex
hibit the greatest difference.        Professor Tyndall found that it
absorbs heat to an extraordinary degree, so that, as he expresses
itf,comparing a single atom of oxygen or of nitrogen with a single
atom of aqueous vapour, the latter absorbs 16,000 times as much
heat as one of the former.        He afterwards saysj that moist air
contained in a tube 4 feet in length absorbs 4-2 to 6 per cent,
of the total heat which enters the tube.          I, on the contrary, had
found that no difference can with certainty be established be
tween the absorptive power of air saturated with moisture, and
of perfectly dry air at the temperature of the room.
    Prof. Tyndall has since then drawn several conclusions, impor
tant for meteorology, from the great absorptive power of aqueous
vapour; and other physicists have followed him in this respect.
But it is not merely on account of these conclusions that the
question of absorption is important ; for they would still hold,
if, instead of transparent aqueous vapour, or aqueous vapour in
the proper sense of the word, they referred to aqueous vapour
partially deposited, or the nebulous vapour into which transparent
vapour changes on the least diminution of temperature.               It   is
in and for itself important to know whether the absorption of
heat   by  moist air is in fact so very much greater than that by
dry air. Moreover Prof. Tyndall has doubtless worked with the
greatest conscientiousness, which     I     also am conscious of having
done  ;  and    in spite of this, there are such extreme differences in
              if,
our results, the inference   i3  obvious, that circumstances hitherto
unknown or disregarded have operated in our experiments.
Hitherto we have both of us in vain endeavoured to find any.
We were therefore compelled to fortify the results found             by
                                                                      new
experiments, starting     from    a different   point  of view.  Thus   in
the beginning of the year 1866 published paper

fluenceof the Absorption of Heat on the                      Formation of Dew"*,
which contains a comparison between the radiating-powerof dry air
and of that saturated with aqueous vapour.      In this it was un
doubtedly found that,so long as the vapours present in airwere per
 fectly transparent (that         is,
                             were vapours               in
                                             the proper sense), there
 was no appreciable difference between the absorptive power of
 dry air and of air saturated with moisture, but that difference,       a
 both as regards absorption and radiation, was set up when the
 vapours began to deposit in the form of mist.        Prof. Tyndall
 thereupon again defended his statementf, while third physicist    a
 afterwards appeared as an arbiter in the matter.
    Professor Wild of Berne has made comprehensive experiments
 by  Tyndall's methods and found his statements thoroughly con
 firmed. Whoever reads Professor Wild's paperf will lay        down               it
 with the impression (as could not indeed but have been ex
 pected from so sound          physicist) that the statements are
                                    a
 completely reliable.      at least, confess that this was the case
                               I,
with myself — and that      could not see how those results could
                               I
be reconciled with my own observations, which            knew were   I
made with the greatest care, and without any preconceived opi
nion.   I   determined, therefore, once more to take up the sub
ject, and first of all to repeat Professor Wild's experiments.
This was easy, because Prof. Wild has accurately given the                                di
mensions of his apparatus, — gift which a      recognize with great
                                                         I
thankfulness for, as will afterwards be seen, very much depends
                ;
on these dimensions.      The arrangement of the apparatus was as
follows: —      .
  On each side of the thermopile, provided with its cones,                          a   brass
tube,  60 centims. long and         centims. in diameter, was fixed
                                         6
horizontally  in  such     manner
                             a     that  the axes of both tubes were
in the same line as that of the thermopile.        In the prolongation
of this line, and at right angles to              it,
                                           there was placed in front
of each tube       blackened metal cube, in which water was kept
                    a
boiling    by  lamp. Each of these cubes, which served as sources
                a
of heat, was at      distance of 10 centims. from the end of its
                      a
tube, and the other ends of the tubes were at the same distance
from the cones of the thermopile.       Between one of these tubes
and its cube    ascreen,  moveable      meansbyof screw, was placed,
                                                               a
by which part of the rays of this cube could be caught         so that       ;
the radiation and heating of the pile on both sides was always

to admit or lead away air.    The lateral apertures nearest the
thermopile  were connected  by caoutchouc tubes with two tubes,
one of which contained pieces of pumice soaked in sulphuric
acid, while the other contained pumice moistened with water.
These tubes were connected, by means of a forked tube, with a
small compression-pump     provided with a windbag, such as is
used for the blowpipe-table.   In this manner one of the tubes
received dry, and the other moist air.   In order to cause these
to spread in the tube and prevent them from escaping at the
nearest open ends, both the other lateral apertures were con
nected with an air-pump.     Professor Wild subsequently pre
ferred to connect the apertures most distant from the pile with
the compression-pump,   and those nearest it with the exhausting-
pump.
  Instead of     a caoutchouc force-pump       Iused a somewhat larger
double bellows, while instead of pumice            I
                                                   used pieces of glass
moistened with water ; in other respects the apparatus was the
same.     The air in my experiments, when not otherwise stated,
was blown in by the more distant lateral aperture.           I  obtained
the same results as Professor Wild — that            heating of the pile
                                                       is,
by blowing in dry air, cooling        by moist j the deflections of the
galvanometer, however,        were    somewhat   greater than he states,
probably because the instrument            I  used was more delicate.
Hence      was also not necessary to blow dry air into one tube
          it
and at the same time moist into the other, and then to change           ;
it  was sufficient to allow dry, and afterwards moist air to enter
the same tube.      I   soon found also that the exhausting-pump
was superfluous     ; for the deflections were the same, whether        it
was or was not used.         Thisis    not surprising, considering how
small     the
          is    quantity   of  air  which can be removed      by  such  a
pump, and how little must be the action             can exert on

open at both ends.
I     soon found, however, that the discrepancy between the pre
sent results and those       Ihad formerly observed depended on         a
circumstance which      I  had previously neglected.
     Ifno air  is blown into the two brass tubes, and the needle of
the galvanometer         at rest, both sides of the thermopile receive
                        is
the same amount of heat.          If, then, into both brass tubes either
moist air or dry air be simultaneously blown, the galvanometer
ought to remain at rest, provided both tubes are simultaneously
filled with the air.     When, however, the experiment was made
it  was seen that the galvanometer, which was at rest when dry
air was forced in, was no longer so on forcing in moist air — that,
therefore, both sides of the pile do not receive the same amount
of heat.    By interchanging the tubes, altering the connexions,
&c, was convinced that the cause of this difference did not
     I

416        Prof. Magnus   on the Influence   of the Adhesion of
depend on a difference in the mode in which the air was admitted,
or in its diffusion in the tube, but was due to a difference in the
condition of the sides of the tube.       For if one tube was slightly
blackened on the inside,    the   difference   on forcing in the two
kinds of air was greater than before.
    In order that the pile might receive as much heat through
the blackened as through the polished tube, the latter had to be
strongly deadened by the screen. When now the action of the
air in each tube was separately investigated, it was found that,
in the one polished internally, the heating effect by the dried
and the cooling by the moist air were very strong, but far smaller
than in that blackened internally.        This was the case although
the same quantity of air reached the pile through both tubes,
and far more heat entered that blackened on the inside than the
polished one deadened by the screen.         There could be no doubt,
after this experiment, that the inside of the tube had a consider
able influence on this phenomenon.
     That the screen only allowed heat to enter the polished tube
through a segment of a circle could not have caused the greater
action of moist air in this tube ; but in order to remove this ob
jection also, the screen was dispensed with, and by increasing
the distance of the cube (the source of heat) the incident quan
tity of heat was diminished. As was to be foreseen, the result
was the same.
     The magnitude of the action of which we speak, here and
 elsewhere, always refers to the total quantity of heat reaching
the pile in each case, and is not to be confounded with the de
 flection of the galvanometer.
     This total amount of heat was determined by deadening one
 side of the pile by a screen, while the deflection of the galvano
 meter was measured which was produced by the radiation of the
 other side.    For greater certainty the other side was also dead
 ened, and the mean taken of both values.           The deflection was
 in all cases so great that the scale was insufficient for the obser
 vation.    To provide for this case a shunt was interposed.        It3
 resistance was to that of the galvanometer in such a ratio that
 the deflection when the shunt was interposed amounted to only
 one-sixteenth of the deflection without it.         In what follows  I
 do not give the percentage values, because they are not reli
 able enough ; for in experiments which depend upon forcing
 air into a tube, the same values can never be obtained by repe
 tition. Therefore   I could only frequently repeat each experiment
 at different times and under different circumstances, so as to
 obtain the requisite certainty. But in the experiment mentioned,
 the cooling in the polished tube amounted to about 375 per
 cent., rthI in that blackened internally only to 1*4 per cent.

     I
    obtained with tubes of tinplate,            which   I frequently used,   the
same results as with brass ones.
     Iwill merely remark, further, that the actions mentioned
were not only observed with obscure heat, but also by using
sources of heat of very high temperature.      For if the cube placed
before the observing-tube was replaced by a platinum disk which
was kept at nearly a white heat by a Bunsen's burner, the phe
nomena observed were almost the same.
   How great is the influence of the inner surface of the tube is
evident also from the following observations.    When a metal tube
was very strongly coated inside with lampblack, the action of air
blown in was exactly the opposite of that which occurred in the
polished tube. In that case there was an increase of heating effect
by forcing in moist air, and a decrease by dry air.         The same
result was obtained when a tube was coated with cotton velvet
instead of with lampblack. The total quantity of heat which passes
through such a tube is altogether small ; hence the increase on
forcing in moist air is inconsiderable ; but it does exist.    do not  I
venture to give it in percentages, because it depends on acci
dental circumstances,     more even than the cooling in polished
tubes ; but it amounted to at least 1 per cent.
   With a cardboard tube quite smooth on the inside, there was
neither heating nor cooling. But when carbonic acid was admitted
into the tube, a cooling occurred which amounted to 7 per cent,
of the heat which reached the pile.   With another cardboard
tube, however, which was lined on the inside with coarse paper,
forcing in moist air produced a heating effect, as in the case of
the velvet-lined      tube.    But when the same cardboard tube was
lined internally with thin tinfoil, the action was quite the reverse
— that     is,
            just as with metal tubes.
   If accordingly there no doubt that the inner surface of the
                              is
tube occasions heating or cooling when moist air       forced in, the

question arises how this action          is
                                     produced.
I     have formerly observed* that solid bodies, both metallic
and non-metallic, attract aqueous vapours from the surrounding
air and condense them on their surface.        These condensed va
pours cannot,     it  true, be seen
                       is             but ;the heating which occurs
ifa  solid    placed in contact with moist air of the same tem
             is
perature, and the corresponding cooling               by
                                                dry air, admit of no
other explanation.      Such   condensation of the aqueous vapours
                                   a
obviously takes place on the insides of the tubes on forcing in
moist air and
           ;       it may be shown that the results observed by
Professor Wild, and before him             by
                                       Professor Tyndall, depend on
this.*-

   418        Prof. Magnus   on the Influence  of the Adhesion  of
   the tubes become coated with water in their entire length when
   moist air is forced in. When a line thermopile was placed on
   the outside of one of the metal tubes used, in such a manner that
   the line of contact was parallel with the axis of the tube, it be
   came heated whenever moist air was forced in, while it indicated
   cooling when dry air entered.        This heating did not take place
   only  when   the pile touched  the  outside of the tube opposite the
   aperture through which air entered the tube, but also when it was
   placed in any other position, provided it actually touched the tube.
       Considering how much more heat is absorbed by water than
   by a polished metallic surface, it is clear that the inside of the
  tube absorbs a far greater proportion of the ray's which are inci
   dent upon it when it is coated with water than when it is quite
  dry. The more heat the tube absorbs, the less does it reflect,
  and the less reaches the pile. The action of water in these tubes
  is probably greater owing to its not forming a continuous layer,
  but being deposited in individual small masses, which scatter in
  all directions the small quantity of heat which was not absorbed.
      The quantity of heat which reached the pile, owing exclusively
  to reflexion from the inside of the polished brass tube which was
  filled with dry air, was about six times as much as that which
  fell upon it when the tube was omitted.         But if six-sevenths of
  the heat which the pile receives be reflected, any diminution of
 reflexion must necessitate just as great a diminution of heating.
      The particles of carbon which coat the inside absorb like the
  condensed particles of water, but in a higher degree ; hence its
  absorption is increased but little, or not at all, by the deposited
 water.      For this reason no cooling is observed when moist air is
 forced into the blackened or the velvet-coated tube ; a heating,
 on the contrary, was observed.         This is manifestly due to the
 condensation of vapours on the inside of the tube.         For when no
 source of heat was used, and moist air was blown into one of
 these tubes, the pile was also heated.           With polished metal
 tubes this heating effect could seldom be perceived, doubtless
 because the heat as soon as it became free was conducted through
 out the entire mass of the metal. With badly conducting lamp
 black this could not occur, and still less with velvet ; hence by
 using the velvet tube the heating was even stronger than with
 the lampblack.
      This heating did not arise from a motion of the moist air to
the pile ; otherwise it must have been observed in all these
tubes, for they were all of the same dimensions.            Moreover it
must not be omitted that the heating which the moist air pro
duced in these tubes when the source of heat was wanting, was
greater than the increase of heating which ensued by forcing
in air when the heated cube was used.

         Vapour in Experiments on the Absorption      of Heat.     419
     Although, as I believe, the manner in which aqueous vapours
act has been sufficiently settled by the above-mentioned experi
ments, it appeared to me desirable to prove this action in some
other way. With this view         I arranged a tube in such a manner
that it could be conveniently kept at various temperatures.          A
tinplate    tube  of  the dimensions   in  question was  concentrically
surrounded by a wider metal tube.           The intervening space, 18
millims. in width, could be filled with water of various tempera
tures.     To prevent cooling as much as possible, the outside tube
was covered with several layers of a thick porous woollen cloth.
When the temperature of this double tube, which was quite
 bright on the inside, was exactly the same as that of the air forced
in, the effects observed were just those described above.
     But when the temperature of the inner side was only a few de
grees lower than that of the air forced in, the temperature of the
 pile diminished to such an extent that the indications of the gal
vanometer exceeded the limits of the scale. A longer time elapsed
 before this decrease of temperature attained its extreme limit
 than in the case in which the temperature of the tube was the
 same as that of the air forced in.       The tube was obviously filled
 in both cases within the same time; but the great quantity of
 vapour deposited on the cooler tube required a greater quantity
 of moist air, the entrance of which required a longer time. When
 the maximum cooling had been attained and dry air was forced
 in, evaporation of water again ensued : in consequence of this
  the decrease of temperature was somewhat more rapid than
  the decrease had previously been ; but it required much longer
  time than if the tube had had the same temperature as the air
 forced in, because again a great quantity of dry air was needed
 to take up the water formed.
      When the temperature of the double tube was higher than
  that of the air forced in, an action ensued of the kind mentioned
  by Prof. Wild, but it was less the higher the temperature of the
  double tube.       Even when this was 38°, and dry and moist air
  at the temperature of the room from 16° C. to 17° C. were
  alternately forced in, a cooling ensued on the entrance of moist,
  and heating when dry air entered.         As this result was very un
   expected,   I convinced myself by another method that there was in
   fact a condensation of vapours on the inside of the tube, even when
   the moisture forced in was still far from its point of saturation.
      For this purpose a thermopile was introduced into a space
   which had a constant temperature of 38° C. One side of this
   pile was closed by a tightly fitting cap. Hence a somewhat
   considerable time elapsed before it had acquired on both sides
   the temperature of the space and the galvanometer had come to
   rest.   Air which had the same temperature as the pile was blown

 420        Prof. Magnus on     the Influence     of   the Adhesion       of
   against it.   To give it this temperature, there was in the interior
   of the space which was heated to 38° C. a narrow brass tube of
   2 millims. diameter, which, being several times bent, had a length
   of 4 metres.     The air was forced in through this tube, and on
   its passage became warmed to the same temperature as the pile.
 If   before its entrance into the narrow tube the air had been satu
   rated only at 16° C. with aqueous vapours, the pile became
   heated, and was cooled when the air was dry.              This action oc
   curred both when the pile was covered with lampblack and when
   it was perfectly bright and metallic. Condensation of the va
   pours took place from air the temperature of which was 22° C.
   higher than its dew-point, and on a surface which was at the
   same temperature as this air.
      This effect was very surprising ; and I intend to devote myself
  to a fuller investigation of this deposition of vapours on solid
  surfaces, which I designate "adhesion of vapour" ( Vaporhmsion) .
      As the cooling which occurred when moist air was forced into
  one of the brass tubes mentioned depends on an altered reflexion
  on the side of the tube, it might be expected that if reflected
  heat exclusively reached the pile, this cooling would occur in still
  higher degree. By means of a plane or concave metal mirror
  it may be arranged that reflected heat alone reaches the pile.
  But, however the experiment was modified, no alteration could
  be observed in the heating effect, whether dry or moist air was
 forced against the pile.        The reason why reflexion from such a
  mirror acts differently from that from the inside of the tube                     is,
  primarily, that the condensation of vapours on the mirror against
 which the air       blown can never be so complete as in the tube
                    is
 filled with moist air but this difference depends more especially
                         ;
 on the circumstance that there     is   only one reflexion of ray from
                                                                    a
 the mirror, while in the tube each ray            is repeatedly reflected.
 Those rays whose direction passes through the axis of the
 tube undergo but        asmall number of reflexions       : for others the
 number   is   more  considerable, especially     if the angle which the
 plane of reflexion makes with the plane passing through the axis
 and the reflecting-point     is    somewhat large     ; for then every ray
 lying   in
          it   is so  often  reflected   thatit   forms    a kind of spiral,
 which    extends  over  the  entire  inner surface  of  the tube.     As the
 diminution of intensity which the rays undergo                byreflexion on
the surface covered with water increases on repeated reflexions,
according to increasing powers of the number of reflexions,                    it   is
clear that the water deposited in the tube         by  the adhesion of va
pour must act quite differently from that on the mirror.               When,
moreover, the temperature of this latter was only              afew degrees
lower than that of the air which was forced against                 it,
                                                                     even on
using   the  mirror   there  was    very definitely    a cooling        by
                                                                        moist

air ; but then also, almost every time, a precipitate of water upon
it could be observed.
   The only other vapour I have hitherto investigated has been
that of alcohol : as the vapours escaped from the tube into the
working-room, almost all others are excluded in this process.
But those of alcohol exhibit the phenomena of aqueous vapour
in a heightened degree. The cooling which ensued on forcing
air containing alcohol-vapour into one of the brass tubes was
so great that it could not be observed in the ordinary manner,
but the shunt had to be used.      In the blackened as well as in
the velvet tube the action was much stronger than on for
cing in air charged with aqueous vapour, though in this case the
shunt was not needed. In the pasteboard tube also, in which
there was little or no perceptible action on forcing in aqueous
vapour, cooling occurred when alcohol-vapours were forced in.
   In the double tube also the action of the vapour of alcohol was
much stronger than that of aqueous vapour.          When the tempe
rature of this tube was 20°25 C, while that of the air saturated
with vapour of alcohol was only 13°-5 C, the cooling was so
strong that the galvanometer went beyond the scale, and the
shunt had to be used for the observation ; the same was the case
when the temperature of the tube was 37° C. (that             230,5 C.
                                                            is,
above that at which the air was saturated with aqueous vapour).
   This great action of alcohol- vapours pointed to great adhe

into the tubes without the application of        source of heat
                                                  a                ;for
there was heating both in the brass tube and in the blackened
and the velvet one, and in all much stronger than             by

   Four, narrow brass tubes,   8 millims. in diameter and 66 cen-
tims. in length, lay horizontally at distances of 12 millims. from
each other.     Each of them contained forty fine holes in row,    a
ata   distance of 12 millims. from each other.       One end of these
tubes was closed, all four were joined at       the  other to     cross
                                                                   a
tube which was connected with      abellows.     As the fine holes of
this system were all turned upwards, on forcing air through,             a
number of very fine upward currents of air were obtained.          This
system of tubes was substituted    for  one  of  the  brass  tubes  be
 tween the pile and the cube, in such        manner that the heat-

pile assumed its previous temperature.        There was in this case
no reflecting body, the cooling could only have resulted from an
absorption of heat by the alcohol-vapour.
   The case was quite different with aqueous vapours ; for when
saturated and perfectly dry air were alternately forced through
this system of tubes, there was no alteration in the heating of
the pile.    This experiment has been frequently repeated, and
always   with  the same result.
   When carbonic acid was blown through instead of moist air,
there was a cooling each time.
    By this my former statement      is,
                                      I   think, entirely confirmed,
that between the absorptive power of moist and that of dry air
no difference can with certainty be established.
   If, as Messrs. Tyndall and Wild maintain, the great cooling
which they obtained when moist air was forced through the po
lished metal tubes they used depended on           corresponding ab
                                                    a
sorption  of  heat    by
                       aqueous vapours,    itmust   take place to the
same extent in all tubes, whatever be the condition of the inner
surface.    The path which the rays traverse on the internally
polished   tubes  is greater indeed than in the rest; but       consi
                                                                a
derable increase   of absorption could   not be  occasioned  thereby,
and, as compared with the total heat issuing from the tube, the
absorbed part must be very nearly the same.          In no case could
there be an increase instead of      a  decrease of temperature on
blowing in moist air, as was seen in the blackened and in the
velvet tube, and even in one of the pasteboard ones.
   The process taking place in the tubes        is,
                                                 as has been already
mentioned, tolerably complicated.       For, first of all, bythe con
densation of vapours, or the adhesion of vapours, heat becomes
free on the inside of the tube j  this Cannot indeed be perceived in
the polished metal tubes, on account of their conductivity, but
can in the badly conducting velvet tubes, or the strongly black
ened metal ones the deposited aqueous particles, moreover, di
                  ;
minish the reflexion of heat and, in addition, air reaches the
                               ;
pile and produces cooling or heating, according as       it    dry or
                                                              is
moist.
  Only in the    caseof special dimensions of the tubes, as those
which Messrs. Tyndall and Wild used, and which were also
used in this investigation, does no air reach the pile — and even
with these dimensions, only under certain conditions.
   In the second series of his experiments M. Wild states that
he always passed the air into the tube through the lateral aper
ture which was more distant from the pile, because the disturb
ing influence of air-currents against the pile was thereby avoided.
But even if it   ispassed through the more distant aperture, the
air still reaches the pile, ifthe tube     is little narrower at the
                                                a

         Vapour in Experiments on the Absorption      of Heat'    423
end nearest the pile, whether the narrowing be effected by in
troducing a ring or by a diaphragm fastened to the tube.          The
smaller the aperture of the latter, the greater the quantity of
air which reaches the pile.
   If  the diaphragm is at the end more distant from the pile,
less air reaches the pile than if it is fastened on the one nearest ;
and if there are diaphragms at both ends, no more air reaches
the pile than if only one is introduced at the end nearest the
pile.
   This may    seem surprising ; but it must be remembered that
by   the presence of diaphragms at the ends of the tubes the dif
fusion of air in the interior is not altered, as long as the aper
ture is large enough to allow the air to emerge as fast as it
enters.    The narrower this aperture the greater is the velocity
with which the air emerges, and the further does it continue its
path.
   With tubes of 60 centims.        diameter, provided with a dia
phragm    at the  end   turned towards the pile, air reached the pile
«ven when the current was very feeble, or when the conducting
tubes were half closed, provided the diameter of the diaphragm
was but little less than the cone of the pile, the aperture of which
was 56 millims. in diameter.         For when moist air was blown
into the tube thus arranged without using a source of heat,
heating ensued — not regularly, but almost every time.
   An attempt was made to render visible the motion of the air
in the tubes.     For this purpose the air passed, first, through a
vessel which contained concentrated hydrochloric acid, and then
through another with ammonia, and, thus charged with a cloud
of sal-ammoniac, was forced into a glass tube of the same di
mensions as the brass one, and under the same pressure.           The
cloud issued through the narrow apertures of the diaphragms
much further than from the wider one, by which the fact of the
action mentioned acquires a confirmation.        But the experiments
showed also that the motion of air in these tubes is very easily
disturbed, and that the entire method is quite unfitted for mea
surements.
   I  regret that in my earlier experiments      I did not use tubes
with a greater diameter than the cone of the pile ; for shouldI
then probably have obtained results analogous to those of
Messrs. Tyndall and Wild.        But as wider tubes are not so com
pletely filled with air a3 narrower ones, and as no particularly
wide tubes are necessary for observing absorption,       I did not see
any necessity    for  extending my  researches  to such  tubes.
                     I
   In conclusion must refer again to Professor Wild's paper.
Experiments have been made by him by a method which
he designates by my name.           In spite of manifold variations

he has not succeeded in obtaining certain results.               He con
cludes with the complimentary remark that it might perhaps in
my hands yield better results.         I am convinced that what is effi
cient in my hands would be equally so in his.                 But he also
would have obtained satisfactory results by that method if his
apparatus had not been different from mine in exactly the most
essential part.     If, in order to avoid the use of rock-salt or
other plates to close the tube, one end be used as a source of
heat for the pile as     I  arranged the apparatus, it is clear that
currents of air can only be avoided by holding the tube vertical
and heating it at the top.         But if with such a position of the
tube it be constructed of metal, the part of the inside nearest
the end soon becomes heated, and sends its rays towards the pile.
The air at the same time in contact with this surface becomes
heated, and currents are formed which affect the temperature of
the pile and render an observation impossible.              To avoid such
           I
currents used glass tubes, and the upper part to be heated
was blown as thin as it is possible for glass to be.           The use of
metal for the boiling-vessel was also avoided ; and for this pur
pose a thin glass vessel was so fused on the end of the tube to
be heated that its bottom closed the tube.            The section of the
bottom, moreover,      was only one-fourth that of the tube, so that
the heating might      be limited to as small a surface as possible.
    I  should have     thought that this arrangement was suffici
ently clear from      the drawing which         I  had given of the ap
paratus.     In  addition    to  this,   there   was  a delay after each
pumping     and admission     of air until    the tube  and the pile had
completely acquired the temperature of the atmosphere, for
which more than a quarter of an hour was needed; during this
time the glass near the boiling-vessel completely acquired the
temperature of the neighbourhood. When the boiling water was
again poured in, and kept boiling by steam, after a very short
time, within which the glass in the neighbourhood could only
become very slightly heated, the observation could be made by
opening the screen in the interior of the tube.           I  am convinced
that  with  an apparatus similarly arranged Professor Wild would
have obtained the same results as           I  have.   Although   I admit
that the use of this apparatus, owing to its fragility and
the lengthened delay between one observation and another, is
neither easy nor pleasant, and although the certainty which
it admits leaves much to be desired, it has so far succeeded
that it has enabled me to recognize with certainty the deport
ment of aqueous vapour.          The diaphragms in the interior have
probably played    the   most   important part in this; for they only
allow a few reflected rays to reach the pile.
   The origin of the difference between Professor Tyndall and

              Prof. Tyndall'     s  Note  on the preceding  Paper.          425
  myself appears to consist in the hitherto unknown alteration of
  reflexion produced by the aqueous vapour condensed on the sides
  of the tube, and which are not visible to the eye.                It is then
  intelligible  that   the  strong     cooling  of the pile observed   by Pro
  fessor Tyndall, and also by          Professor   Wild,  on  forcing in moist
  air was ascribed by them to a corresponding absorption by
  aqueous vapours.                 I
                           But am convinced that if Professor Tyndall
  and M. Wild now repeat the experiments with tubes strongly
  blackened on the inside or lined with velvet, they will share
  the view that aqueous vapours have no such great absorptive
  power.
      Professor Wild will then no longer adhere to the opinion that
  the science of meteorology may without hesitation utilize the
  great absorption of heat by aqueous vapour as a mode of expla
  nation.

         Dear Francis,
      It gives me pleasure to learn from you that a translation of
  Professor Magnus's last paper on the Action of Aqueous Va
  pour upon Radiant Heat will be published in the forthcoming
  Number of the Philosophical Magazine.                 In 1862, while walk
  ing with     Professor   Magnus through          the streets  of London, he
  drew my attention to the untransparent state of the atmosphere,
   and expressed the opinion that London smoke had much to do
,                              I
  with the results that had ascribed to aqueous vapour.                    That
   remark caused       me   to  make    a journey   to the  middle  of the  Isle
   of Wight, during the prevalence of a south-west wind, so as to
   obtain a quantity of air which should be free from the taint of
   the metropolis.       I cite this fact to illustrate the spirit in which
   I have met the objections which Professor Magnus has raised
   from time to time against my experiments.                 Those objections
   demand, have received, and will continue to receive the utmost
   consideration from me.            In all their forms (and these have been
   very various)     I  have   endeavoured     to meet them by the produc
   tion of clear and irrefragable facts.          This course it is my inten
   tion to pursue with reference to Professor Magnus's last paper.
                                        Yours very truly,

   may now be regarded as establishedf- And believe that there are
   fewf geologists who have given special attention to the matter who
   will not admit that we have evidence of the existence of ice-action
   during the Silurian, Old Red Sandstone, and Cretaceous periods.
   But what is most remarkable is the fact that during those very
   same periods we have evidence of the existence of a much warmer
   and more equable condition of climate than prevails at present.
   And we have also indisputable evidence that this warm and
   equable condition of climate was not confined to temperate re
   gions, but extended beyond the arctic circle, even up to the high
   est latitudes that man has yet been able to reach.              I  shall state
   briefly a few of the facts to which      I allude.
       In the arctic regions encrinites, corals, 'and mollusca be
   longing to the Silurian period have been found in abundance f,
   proving that a warm sea must have prevailed in those regions
   during at least a part of that age.         It is well known that all over
   the arctic regions, extending to the most northern limit that has
   yet been attained, coal and carboniferous limestone have been
  found in abundance.         And the existence of magnesian limestone
  in high latitudes seems to indicate that also during a part of the
   Permian period a warm sea must have reached to arctic regions.
      We have evidence of a warm condition of climate in North
   Greenland during the Oolitic period.              For example, in Prince
  Patrick's Island, at Wilkie Point, in lat. 76° 20' N. and long.
   117° 20' W., oolitic rocks containing an ammonite [Ammonites
  M'Clintocki, Haughton) like the Ammonites concavus and other
'
  shells of the oolitic species were found by Captain M'Clintock§.
  In Katmai Bay near Behring's Straits the following oolitic fos
  sils were found : — Ammonites Wossnessenskii, Ammonites biplex,

in Exmouth Island, lat. 77° 16' N. and long. 96° W., at an eleva
tion of 570 feet above the level of the sea, bones which were ex
amined by Professor Owen and pronounced to be those of the
Ichthyosaurus*.       Mr. Salter remarks that, at the time that these
fossils were deposited, "a condition of climate something like
that of our own shores was prevailing in latitudes not far short
of 80° N."f And Mr. Jukes says that during the oolitic period,
 " in latitudes where now sea and land are bound in ice and snow
throughout the year, there formerly flourished animals and plants
similar to those living in our own province at the time.               The
 questions thus raised," continues Mr. Jukes,
                                                       " as to the climate

 expect to find only in warm or temperate seas, could live in such
 high latitudes, are not easy to answer" J. When we come to ex
 amine the arctic flora of the Upper Miocene period, we find that
 North Greenland and the entire polar regions at that period en
joyed a condition     of climate as warm as that of England at the
present day.

                        know/5 says Sir Charles Lyell, that Green
 land was not always covered with snow and ice ; for when we
 examine the tertiary strata of Disco Island, we discover there a
 multitude of fossil plants which demonstrate that, like many
other parts of the arctic regions, it formerly enjoyed a mild and
genial climate §.
    At the Meeting of the British Association held at Nottingham
in August last, Professor Heer read a valuable paper on the
 Miocene Flora of North Greenland.            In this paper some remark
 able conclusions as to the probable temperature of Greenland
 during the Miocene period were given. Upwards of sixty differ
 ent species brought from Atanekerdluk, a place on the Waigat
 opposite Disco, in lat. 70° N., have been examined by him.
    A steep hill rises, he says, on the coast to a height of 1080
feet j and at this level the fossil plants are found.       Large quanti
ties of wood in a fossilized or carbonized condition lie about.
 Captain Inglefield observed one trunk thicker than a man's body,
 standing upright.      The leaves, however, are the most important
 portion of the deposit, and give a most valuable insight into the
 nature of the vegetation which formed this primeval forest.             In
regard to those fossilized plants, he concludes that they cannot
 have been drifted from any great distance.              They must have
grown on the spot where they are found. And they prove with
out a doubt that North Greenland in the Miocene epoch had a

  428    Mr. J. Croll   on the Change  in the Obliquity   of the Ecliptic,
 climate much warmer than its present one.           He states that it is
 quite impossible that the trees found at Atanekerdluk could ever
 have flourished there if the temperature were not far higher than
 at present.    The difference must have been at least 29° F. Nor
 were the trees found here all at the extreme northern limit of
 their growth ; for in the Miocene flora of Spitzbergen, lat. 78°
 N., we find the beech, plane, hazel-nut, and some other species
 identical with those from Greenland. And we may conclude, he
 thinks, that the firs and poplars which we meet at Atanekerdluk
 and Bell Sound, Spitzbergen, must have reached up to the North
  Pole if land existed there in the Tertiary period.
    The Sequoia Langsdorfii is the most abundant of the trees of
 Atanekerdluk.      The Sequoia sempervirens is its present repre
 sentative.   This tree has its extreme northern limit about lat.
 53° N.     For its existence it requires a summer temperature of
 59° or 61°.    Its fruit requires a temperature of 64° for ripen
 ing.   The  winter temperature must not fall below 34° ; and that
 of the whole year must be at least 49°. The temperatures of
 Atanekerdluk during the time that the Miocene flora grew could
 not have been less than the above-mentioned.            " These conclu-i
 sions," says Professor Heer, " are only links in the grand chain
 of evidence obtained from the examination of the Miocene flora of
 the whole of Europe.      They prove to us that we could not by any
 rearrangement    of  the relative positions of land and water produce
 for the northern hemisphere a climate which would explain the
 phenomena in a satisfactory manner.         We must," he continues,
 " admit that we are face to face with a problem whose solution
 in all probability must be attempted, and, we doubt not, com
 pleted by the astronomer."
    But, more singular still, at a period not anterior at least to
 that of the boulder-clay, a condition of climate prevailed in arctic
regions much warmer than at present ; for the remains of an
cient forests have been found in places where at present nothing
is to be seen but fields of snow and ice, and where the mean
annual temperature scarcely rises above the zero of the Fahren
heit thermometer.
    A trunk of a tree was discovered erect as it grew, by Captain
Sir E. Belcher, on the 12th of September 1853, to the north of
a narrow strait which opens into Wellington Sound, lat. 75° 32'
N., long. 92° W. The trunk was dug up and brought to Eng
land and examined by Dr. Hooker, who pronounced it to be a
species of white spruce, Pinus (Abies) alba*.           The remains of
an ancient forest were discovered by Captain M'Clure in Banks's
Land, in lat. 74° 48', extending along a range of hills varying
from 350 to 500 feet above the sea, and from half a mile up-

                        and its Influence on Climate.                    429
wards inland.         He found     a great accumulation   of fossil trees, as
well   as fragments      not fossilized     lying over the whole extent of
the    land.       "This     remarkable       phenomenon," says Captain
M'Clure, ''opens a vast field for conjecture ; and the imagination
becomes bewildered in trying to realize that period of the world's
history when the absence of ice and a milder climate allowed
forest trees to grow in a region where now the ground-willow
and dwarf birch have to struggle for existence"*.                Trunks of
trees, some of them 8 feet in circumference, have been found in
Prince Patrick's Island and Melville Island on the spot in which
they grew.        This place is perhaps at present the coldest spot in
the northern hemisphere.
     It is true that Sir Roderick Murchisont had at one time stated
 it to be his opinion that those vast quantities of wood found in
 arctic regions were drifted to their present positions at a period
 when those regions were submerged.                This opinion is now,     I
 believe, generally abandoned.
     But the most remarkable circumstance, and certainly the most
 unaccountable of all upon the ordinary theories of change of cli
 mate during geological epochs, is the fact that we have not only
 had a succession of cold and warm periods, but cold and warm
  periods occurring in the same epoch.             For example, during the
  Permian period we have not only evidence of a cold period when
  glaciers even in our own island reached to the sea-level {, but we
  have also evidence, as we have seen, of a warm condition of cli
  mate extending during that epoch even to the arctic regions.
  And during the Upper Miocene period we find a cold climate
  prevailing and glaciers descending to the sea-level in the latitude
  of Italy § ; while during another part of this period we know
  that the climate of the northern hemisphere was much warmer

  rich and luxuriant flora reaching up to perhaps the North Pole.
  Again, during the Pliocene period we have the well-known gla
  cial epoch with the northern hemisphere to considerably low la
  titudes enveloped in one general capping of ice. And recent
  discoveries in arctic regions show that at that very period, or
  perhaps at a period somewhat later, huge forests flourished in
  North Greenland and the regions about Melville Island, where
  at present not a shrub can grow, and where nothing is to be
  seen but interminable fields of snow and ice.

430     Mr.  J. Croll on   the Change in the  Obliquity of the Ecliptic,
counted for ? We require a cause not only of wide influence but
of great intensity of action — in short, a cause which can at one
time confer on Greenland, Siberia, and the entire arctic regions
the mild climate of England or Madeira, and at another time
bury England and nearly the entire temperate regions under per
petual snow and ice.       And it must be able not only to do this,
but to do it during the continuance of one epoch.            There are
few, I presume, who can seriously entertain the opinion that
these changes can be satisfactorily accounted for without having
reference to cosmical agency. When we view the matter from a
purely physical and cosmical standpoint, we at once perceive that
those changes, extreme as they no doubt appear, are in reality
what we ought a priori to conclude must have occurred.             I feel
persuaded that those very conclusions to which geologists have
been led regarding the changes of climate during past ages,
would ultimately have all been arrived at through purely cosmi
cal and physical considerations,       even although geology as a
science had not existed ; they follow so obviously from theory.
   It follows as a necessary conclusion, that when the excentri-
city of the earth's orbit reaches a very high value, the hemisphere
which has its winter occurring in aphelion will be under a gla
cial condition, while the other hemisphere having its winter in
perihelion will be enjoying a warm and equable climate.             And
the occurrence at times      of cold and  warm    conditions of climate
during the same geological epoch is in fact a necessary result of
the precession of the equinoxes combined with that of excen-
tricity.
   There is still another cause which      I feel convinced must to a
very considerable extent have affected climate during past geo
logical ages.   I refer to the change in the Obliquity of the Eclip
tic. This cause has long engaged the attention of geologists and
physicists; and the conclusion generally arrived at, like that
which had been arrived at in regard to excentricity, is that no
great effect can be attributed to it. After giving special attention
to the matter,    I have been led to the very opposite conclusion.
It is quite true, as has been urged, that the changes in the ob
liquity of the ecliptic cannot sensibly affect the climate of tem
perate regions.      But it will produce a slight change on the cli
mate of the tropical regions, and a very considerable effect on
that of the polar regions, especially at the poles themselves. We
shall now consider the matter briefly.
    It was found by Laplace that the obliquity of the ecliptic will
oscillate to the extent of 1° 22' 34" on each side of 23° 28', the
obliquity in the year 1801.       This change will but slightly affect
the climate of the temperate regions, but it will exercise a very
considerable influence on the climate of the polar regions.          Ac

cording to    Mr. Meech*, if 365-24           thermal days represent the
present total annual quantity of heat received at the equator from
the sun, 151 59 thermal days will represent the quantity re
ceived at the poles.       Adopting his method of calculation, it turns
out that when the obliquity of the ecliptic is at its maximum,
viz. at 24° 50' 34", the quantity received at the equator would
be 363-51 thermal days, and at the poles 160-04 thermal days.
The equator would therefore receive l-73 thermal days less heat,
and the poles 8'45 thermal days more heat than at present.

     When the obliquity was at a maximum, the poles would there
 fore be receiving 19 rays for every 18 they are receiving at pre
 sent.     The poles would then be receiving nearly as much heat
 as latitude 76° is receiving at present.
     The increase of obliquity would not sensibly affect the polar
 winter. It is true that it would slightly increase the breadth of
 the frigid zone ; but the length of the winter at the poles would
 remain unaffected.         After the sun disappears below the horizon
 his rays are completely cut off, so that a further descent of
 1° 22' 34" would make no material difference whatever in the
 climate.     In the temperate regions the sun's altitude at the
 winter solstice would be 1° 22' 34" less than at present.                This
 would slightly increase the cold of winter in those regions.              But
 the increase in the amount of heat received by the polar regions
 would materially affect the condition of the polar summer.
 What, then, is the rise of temperature at the poles which would
 result from the increase of 8'45 thermal days in the total amount
 received from the sun ?
     An increase of 8*45 thermal days, or                  of the total quan
  tity received   from   the  sun,   according   to the mode     of calculation
  adopted in a former paperf, would produce, all other things
  being equal, a rise in the mean annual temperature equal to 14°
  or 15°.

432     Mr.  J. Croll  on the Change in the Obliquity     of the Ecliptic,
   According to Professor Dove* there is a difference of 7°"6
between the mean annual temperature of lat. 76° and the pole, —
the temperature of the former being 9°-8, and that of the latter
20-2.    Since it follows that when the obliquity of the ecliptic is
at a maximum the poles would receive about as much heat per
annum as lat. 76° receives at present, it may be supposed that
the temperature of the poles at that period ought to be no higher
than that of lat. 76° at the present time.        A little consideration
will, however, show that this by no means ought to be the case.
Professor Dove's Tables represent correctly the mean annual
temperature corresponding to every tenth degree of latitude from
the equator to the pole.       But it must be observed that the rate
at which the temperature diminishes from the equator to the
pole is not proportionate to the decrease in the total quantity of
heat received from the sun as we pass from the equator to the
pole.   Were the mean annual temperature of the various lati
tudes proportionate to the amount of direct heat received, the
equator would be much warmer than it actually is at present,
and the poles much colder.        The reason of this is perfectly ob
vious.    There is a constant transference of heat from the equator
to the poles, and of cold from the poles to the equator.              The
warm water of the equator is constantly flowing towards the
poles, and the cold water at the poles is constantly flowing to
the equator.     The same is the case in regard to the aerial cur
rents.    Consequently a great portion of the direct heat of the
sun goes, not to raise the temperature of the equator, but to
heat the poles.     And, on the other hand, the cold materials at
the poles are transferred to the equator, and thus lower the tem
perature of that part of the globe to a great extent.            The pre
sent difference of temperature between lat. 76° and the pole,
determined according to the rate at which the temperature is
found to diminish between the equator and the pole, amounts
to only about 7° or 8°.       But were there no mutual transference
of warm and cold materials between the equatorial and polar
regions, .and the temperature of each latitude to depend solely
upon the direct rays of the sun, the difference would far exceed
that amount.
   Now, when the obliquity of the ecliptic was at its superior
limit and the poles receiving about ^ more direct heat from
the sun than at present, the increase of temperature due to this
increase of heat would be far more than 7° or 8°.                It would
probably be nearly double      that amount.
   The enormous effect that ocean-currents have in equalizing
the temperature of our globe, by diminishing the difference be
tween the temperature of the equator and the poles, has never

been duly estimated.          This will be seen if we merely consider
for a moment the effect produced by one current alone, viz. the
Gulf-stream. The total quantity of water conveyed by this stream
is probably equal to that of a stream 50 miles broad and 1000
feet deep, flowing at the rate of 4 miles an hour.          And the mean
temperature      of the   entire  mass    of moving   water  is not under
65° at the moment of leaving the Gulf *.             I think we are war
ranted to conclude that the Gulf-stream, before it returns from
its northern journey, is on an average cooled down at least 25°.
Each cubic foot of water, therefore, in this case carries from the
tropics upwards of 1500 units of heat, or 1,158,000 foot-pounds.
According to the above estimate of the size and velocity of the
stream, 5,575,680,000,000 cubic feet of water are conveyed
from the Gulf per hour, or 133,816,320,000,000 cubic feet
dailyf. Consequently the total quantity of heat transferred
from the equatorial regions per day by the stream amounts to
154,959,300,000,000,000,000 foot-pounds. From observations
made by Sir John Herschel and by M. Pouillet on the direct
heat of the sun, it is found that, were no heat absorbed by the
atmosphere, about 83 foot-pounds per second would fall upon a
square foot of surface placed at right angles to the sun's rays J.
Mr. Meech estimates that the quantity of heat cut off by the atmo
sphere is equal to about 22 per cent, of the total amount re
ceived from the sun.         M. Pouillet estimates the loss at 24 per
cent.     Taking the former estimate, 64-74 foot-pounds per se
cond will therefore be the quantity of heat falling on a square
foot of the earth's surface when the sun is in the zenith. And
were the sun to remain stationary in the zenith for twelve hours,
2,796,768 foot-pounds would fall upon the surface.
    It can be shown that the total amount of heat received upon
a unit-surface on the equator during the twelve hours from sun
rise till sunset at the time of the equinoxes is to the total amount
which would be received upon that surface, were the sun to re
main in the zenith during those twelve hours, as the diameter of
a circle to half its circumference, or as 1 to 1*5708.           It follows,
therefore, that a square foot of surface on the equator receives

 434     Mr. J. Croll on  the Change    in the Obliquity of the  Ecliptic,
 from the sun at the time of the equinoxes 1,780,474 foot-pounds
 daily, and a square mile 49,636,750,000,000 foot-pounds daily.
 But this amounts to only             1        part of the quantity of
                                 3 t
 heat daily conveyed from the tropics by the Gulf-stream.               In
 other words, the Gulf-stream conveys as much heat as is received
 from the sun by 3,121,870 square miles of surface at the equa
  tor.   The amount thus conveyed is equal to all the heat which
 falls within 63 miles on each side of the equator.       According to
 calculations made by Mr. Meech, the annual quantity of heat
 received by a unit-surface on the frigid zone, taking the mean
 of the whole zone, is         0f that received at the equator.      Con
                         S^t-L
  sequently the quantity of heat conveyed by the Gulf-stream in
  one year is equal to the heat which falls on an average on
  6,873,800 square miles of the arctic regions.         The frigid zone
  or arctic regions contain 8,130,000 square miles.             There is
  actually, therefore, nearly as much heat transferred          from   the
 tropical regions by the Gulf-stream as is received from the sun
 by the entire arctic regions, the quantity conveyed by the
 stream to that received from the sun by those regions being as
  15 to 18.
     But we have been assuming in our calculations that the per
 centage of heat absorbed by the atmosphere is no greater in
 polar regions than it is at the equator, which is not the case.
 If  we make due allowance for the extra amount absorbed in
 polar regions in consequence of the obliqueness of the sun's rays,
 the total quantity of heat conveyed by the Gulf- stream will pro
 bably nearly equal the amount received from the sun by the
 entire arctic regions.
     It may be stated, however, that the extra amount of heat ab
 sorbed in polar regions in consequence of the oblique direction
 in which the rays pass through the atmosphere is not nearly so
 great as is generally represented.          It is commonly assumed
 that the quantity of heat absorbed by the atmosphere is propor
 tionate to the number of aerial particles that the rays have to
 encounter before reaching the surface of the earth.         It is stated
 as a general rule that, if the tracks of the rays follow an arith
 metical progression, the diminished force with which the rays
reach the ground will form a decreasing geometrical progression.
But recent discoveries in regard to the absorption of radiant
heat by gases and vapours prove that Tables computed on this
principle must be wholly erroneous.          The researches of Tyndall
and Melloni show that, when a ray passes through any substance,
the absorption is rapid at first, but the ray is soon " sifted," as
it is called, and it then passes onwards with but little further ob
struction.

                       and its influence on Climate.               435
  where the calculations are made upon the foregoing principles,
  it is stated that the annual intensity of the sun's heat at the
  equator to that at the poles is as 115 to 14, or as 8 to 1 nearly.
 If   the quantity of heat received from the sun by polar regions
 were actually as small as the writer of this article states, it would
 follow that the quantity conveyed by the Gulf-stream from the
 equatorial regions is equal to about three times all that falls
 within the arctic circle.
     It is true that a very considerable part of the heat thus trans
 ferred by currents from the equator never reaches the arctic
 regions.     But it nevertheless goes to lower the temperature of
 the equator and raise the temperature of the higher latitudes.
 Let it be remembered that our calculations refer only to one
 single current, the Gulf-stream.         If we took into account all
 the currents which flow from the equatorial regions of our globe,
 we should find that their influence in reducing the difference
 between the temperature of equatorial and polar regions is
 enormous.
     A similar function is also performed by aerial currents.     The
 equatorial regions are cooled to a great extent by an aerial cur
rent continually flowing from the polar regions to the equator.
And the polar regions at least are warmed by an upper current
flowing from the torrid and temperate regions towards the poles.
The equator is also cooled to a very great extent by convection.
The hot surface of the ground at the equator transfers its heat
to the air, and an ascending current is generated which carries
the heat upwards and dissipates it into stellar space.
     It is very probable that were it not for the combined effect of
all those causes, the difference of temperature between the equa
tor and the poles would amount to at least 200° instead of about
80°, as at present.        Did the earth possess neither an atmo
sphere nor seas, and were the temperature of each place to de
pend entirely on the direct heat of the sun, the difference of
mean annual temperature between the equator and the poles,
according to theory, ought to amount to about 200°.
     We may therefore conclude that when the obliquity of the
ecliptic was at a maximum, and the pole receiving                more
heat than at present, the temperature of the poles ought to have
been about 14° or 15° warmer than at the present day, provided,
of   course, that this extra heat was employed wholly in raising the
temperature.      Were the polar regions free from snow and ice, the
greater portion of the. extra heat would go to raise the tempera-
rature.     But as those regions are covered with snow and ice, the
extra heat would have no effect in raising the temperature, it
would simply melt the snow and ice. The ice-covered surface
upon which the rays fell could never rise above 32°.           At the

436     Mr. J. Croll   on the Change   in the Obliquity of the Ecliptic,
period under consideration the total annual quantity of ice
melted at the poles would be fa more than at present.
    The general effect which the change in the obliquity of the
ecliptic would have upon the climate of the polar regions when
combined with the effects resulting from the excentricity of the
earth's orbit would be this : — When the excentricity was at a
very high value, the hemisphere whose winter occurred in
aphelion (for physical reasons which have already been discussed
 at considerable length*) would be under a condition of glacia
tion, while the other hemisphere, having its winter in perihelion,
would be enjoying a warm and equable climate.            When the ob
liquity of the ecliptic was at a maximum, and A- more heat
falling at the pole than at present, the effect would be to modify
to a great extent the rigour of the glaciation in the polar zone
of the hemisphere under a glacial condition, and, on the other
hand, to produce a more rapid melting of the ice on the other
hemisphere enjoying the equable climate.          The effects of excen
tricity  and   obliquity  thus  combined   would  probably completely
remove the polar ice-cap from off the latter hemisphere, and
forest-trees might then grow at the pole.         Again, when the ob
liquity  was  at its minimum     condition  and less heat reaching the
poles   than  at present, the glaciation of the    former   hemisphere
would be increased and the warmth of the latter diminished.
    One very remarkable effect which seems to result indirectly
from a variation of the obliquity, under certain conditions, is an
influence on the level of the sea.     As this probably may have had
something to do with those recent changes of sea-level which
the history of the submarine forests and raised beaches have
made us all so familiar with, it may be of interest to enter at
some length into this part of the subject.
    It appears almost certain that, at the time when the northern
winter solstice was in aphelion last, a rise of the sea on the
northern hemisphere to a considerable number of feet must have
taken place from the combined effect of excentricity and obliquity.
About 11,700 years ago the northern winter solstice was in the
aphelion.     The excentricity at that time was "0187, being some
what greater than it is now ; but the winters occurring in aphe
lion instead of perihelion, as at present, they would on this account
be probably 10° or 15° colder than they are at the present day.
It is probable also, for reasons formerly statedf, that the Gulf-
stream at that time would be considerably less than at present.
This would tend to lower the temperature to a still greater ex
tent.    As snow must have fallen during winter instead of rain,
this no doubt would have produced a slight increase in the quan
tity of ice on the northern hemisphere, had no other cause come

into operation.       But the condition of things, we have every rea
son to believe, must have been affected by the greater obliquity
of the ecliptic at that period.        We have no formula from which
we can determine with perfect accuracy the extent of the obli
quity at a period so remote as the one under consideration.            If
we adopt the formula given by Struve and Peters, we have the
obliquity at a maximum about the time that the solstice-point
was in aphelion.            The formula given by Leverrier places
the maximum somewhat later.              At all events we cannot be far
from the truth in assuming that at the time the northern winter
 solstice was in aphelion the obliquity of the ecliptic was
 about a maximum, and that since then it has been gradually
diminishing. It is evident, then, that the annual amount of
heat received by the arctic regions, and especially about the pole,
would be considerably greater than at present.               And as the
heat received on those regions is chiefly employed in melting
the ice, it is probable that the extra amount of ice which would
then be melted in the arctic regions would prevent that slight
increase of ice which would otherwise result in consequence
 of the winter occurring in aphelion.               The winters at that
 period    would   be colder    than they  are at present ; but the total
 quantity of ice on the northern hemisphere would not probably
 be greater.      Let us now turn to the southern hemisphere.         As
the southern winter would then occur in perihelion, it would
 tend to produce a slight decrease in the quantity of ice on the
 southern hemisphere.           But on this hemisphere the effects of ex-
 centricity    would   not,  as  on the northern hemisphere, be com
 pensated by those of obliquity; for both causes would here
 tend to produce the same effect, namely a melting of the ice in
 the antarctic regions.
    It is probable that at this time the quantity of warm water
 flowing from the equatorial regions into the Southern Ocean
 would be much greater than at present.              This would tend to
 raise the temperature of the air of the antarctic regions, and thus
 assist in melting the ice.          These causes, combined with the
 great increase of heat resulting from the change of obliquity,
 would tend to diminish to a considerable extent the quantity of
 ice on the southern hemisphere.               I think we may assume
 that the slight increase of excentricity at that period, the oc
 currence of the southern winter in perihelion, and the extra
 quantity of warm water flowing from the equatorial to the ant
 arctic regions would produce an effect on the south polar ice-cap
 equal to that produced by the increase in the obliquity of the
 ecliptic.     It would therefore follow that for every eighteen
 pounds     of ice melted annually at present at the south pole twenty
 pounds would then be melted.

 438      Mr.    J. Croll on   the Change   in the Obliquity of the Ecliptic,
      Let us now consider the effect that this condition of things
  would have upon the level of the sea. It would evidently tend
  to produce an elevation of the sea-level on the northern hemi
  sphere, in two ways.         1st. The addition to the sea occasioned by
  the melting of the ice from off the antarctic land would tend to
  raise the general level of the sea.           2ndly. The removal of the
  ice would also tend to shift the earth's centre of gravity to the
  north of its present position ; and as the sea must shift along
  with the centre, a rise of the sea on the northern hemisphere
 would necessarily take place.
      The question naturally suggests itself, Might not the last rise
 of the sea, relative to the land, have resulted from this cause ?
 We know that during the period of the 25-feet beach, the time
 when the estuarine mud which now forms the rich soil of the
  Carses of the Forth and Tay was deposited, the sea, in relation
 to the land, stood at least 20 or 30 feet higher than at present.
 But immediately prior to this period we have the age of the
 submarine forests and peat-beds, when the sea relative to
 the land stood lower than it does at present.                   We know
 also that these changes of level were not a mere local affair.
 There seems every reason to believe that our Carse clay, as
 Mr. Fisher states, is the equivalent of the marine mud with
 Scrobiculariai which covers the submarine forests of England*.
 And, on the other hand, those submarine forests are not con
 fined to one locality.        " They may be traced," says Mr. Jamie-
 son,
        " round the whole of Britain and Ireland, from Orkney to
 Cornwall, from Mayo to the shores of Fife, and even, it would
 seem, along a great part of the western seaboard of Europe, as
 if they bore witness to a period of wide-spread elevation, when
 Ireland and Britain, with all its numerous islands, formed one
mass of dry land, united to the continent, and stretching out
into the Atlantic "f. " These submarine forests," remarks De la
Beche also, " are to be found under the same general condition
from the shores of Scandinavia to those of Spain and Por
tugal, and around the British islands"^.              Those buried forests
are not confined to Europe, but are found in the valley of the
Mississippi and in Nova Scotia and other parts of North
America. And, again, the strata which underlie those forests
and peat-beds bear witness to the fact of a previous elevation of

the sea-level.        In short, we have evidence of a number of
oscillations of sea-level during post-Tertiary times*.
     Had there been but only one rise of the land relative to the
sea-level, or one depression, it might quite reasonably have
been attributed to an upheaval or a sinking of the ground,
occasioned by some volcanic, chemical, or other agency.                But
certainly those repeated oscillations of sea-level, extending as
they do over so wide an area, look more like a rising and sink
ing of the sea than of the land.         But be this as it may, since it
is now established,      I presume, beyond controversy that the old
notion that the general level of the sea remains permanent, and
that the changes must be all attributed to the land, is wholly
incorrect, and that the sea, as well as the land, is subject to
changes of level, it is certainly quite a legitimate subject" of
inquiry to consider whether the last elevation of the sea-level
relatively to the land may not have resulted from the rising of the
sea rather        than from the sinking of the land — in short,
whether it may not be attributed to the cause we are now con
sidering.       The fact that those raised beaches and terraces are
found at so many different heights, and also so discontinuous,
along our coasts, might be urged as an objection to the opinion
 that they were due to changes in the level of the sea itself.
 Space will not permit of us entering upon the discussion of this
 point at present ; but it may be stated that this objection is
more apparent than real.           It by no means follows that beaches
 of the same age must be at the same level.                 This has been
 shown very clearly by Mr. W. Pengelly in a paper on " Raised
 Beaches," read before the British Association at Nottingham
 last year.
                 I
     We have, presume, evidence amounting to almost absolute cer
 tainty that 11,700 years ago the general sea-level on the northern
 hemisphere must have been higher than at present.                   And in
 order to determine the question of the 25-feet beach, we
 have merely to consider whether a rise to something like this
 extent probably took place at the period in question.              We have
 at present no possible means of knowing with certainty the
 extent of the rise which must have taken place at that period ;
 for we have no means of ascertaining what was the quantity of
 ice which must have then been melted off the antarctic regions.
  But we have the means of making a very rough estimate,
 which, at least, may enable us to determine whether a rise of
  some 20 or 30 feet may not possibly have taken place.                 The
  principal difficulty which meets us is the uncertainty that still
  prevails regarding the amount of land within the antarctic

440        Mr. J. Croll   on the Change   in the Obliquity of the Ecliptic,
 circle.     As to the existence of an antarctic continent there are,
 I   presume, few well informed on the subject who entertain a
 doubt, whatever their views may be regarding its extent.            If  we
 examine the matter carefully, we shall find that we have every
 reason to believe that this continent extends, on an average,
 down to about latitude 70° S.            It is only at a very few points
 that voyagers have been able to penetrate the
                                                             " pack" and
 reach to anything like high latitudes.            But it has been found
 that wherever a high latitude was reached land was generally
 seen.      For example, lat. 66° 30' was reached by M. D'Urville
 in long. 140°, and Adelie Land was found.                 Lat. 65° was
reached by Balleny in long. 120° E., and Sabrina Land was
found. Lat. 67° was reached by Biscoe, in long. 60° and 50°
 E., and Kemp Land and Enderby Land were found.                   Lat. 63°
 and 68° were reached by Biscoe, between long. 60° and 70° W.,
 and Graham Land was found.               In the year 1774 Capt. Cook
reached lat. 71° 10', in long. 106° 54' W., and saw to the south
 a very extensive field of ice.         And he at the time expressed it
as his opinion that the ice covered a continent reaching to the
south pole*.        About long. 180° Victoria Land was discovered,
and the great ice-barrier attached to it traced by Sir James
Ross for several hundreds of miles. _ A perpendicular wall of ice,
 similar to that described by Sir James Ross, had been pre
 viously traced by the United States Exploring Expedition under
 Cant. Wilkes, from near the longitude of Victoria Land, in lat.
 65°, along in the direction of Enderby Land, for a distance of
upwards of 1500 miles. Along this extended coast-line nothing
in the shape of an open strait, or of a current in a northerly direc
tion, was found, which seems to show, as Capt. "Wilkes remarks,
that the ice-barrier must be attached to an unbroken tractof landf.
      It is extremely probable that these various tracts of land are
 but different parts of one great continent extending to the
 south pole. If they are islands, it is singular that none of them
have been circumnavigated.            Besides, were they merely islands,
it is difficult to conceive how there should be such prodigious
masses of icebergs on the southern hemisphere, extending
down in all directions to such comparatively low latitudes.               If
those various tracts of land are parts of one great continent, then
this continent will on an average extend down to lat. 70°.                 I
may mention that Sir Charles Lyell, who has given much atten
tion to this subject, has, in his late edition of the ' Principles/
represented the antarctic continent as extending down to about
lat. 70°.

   One thing, however, is certain, that this continent, whatever
its extent may be, is covered with a vast sheet of ice. This sheet
is known to be upwards of 1000 feet thick at its edges. And there
are reasons of a mechanical nature (which will come under our
notice perhaps on a future occasion) which prove that the thick
ness of the sheet in the centre of this continent must be
enormous.
   Assuming, then, that the southern ice-cap extends on an ave
rage down to lat. 70°,        it will therefore    be equal to        of the
entire surface of the globe.          The proportion of land to that of
water, taking into account the antarctic continent, according to
Mr. Saunders*, is as 526 to 1272. The southern ice-cap will
therefore   be   equal to    2~ of the area covered by water. The
density  of  ice  to that  of water being taken at '92 to 1, it follows
that 25 feet      6  inches of ice melted from off the face of the
antarctic continent would raise the level of the ocean 1 foot.
If 470 feet were melted off— and this is by no means an extra
vagant supposition, when we reflect, that for every 18 pounds
of ice presently melted an additional pound or two pounds,
or perhaps more, would then be melted, and that for many
ages in succession
                       — the water thus produced from the melted
ice would raise the level of the sea 18 feet 5 inches.                  The
removal of the 470 feet of solid ice (which must be but a very
small fraction of the total quantity of ice lying upon the ant
arctic continent) would shift the earth's centre of gravity about
7 feet to the north of its present position.             The shifting of the
centre of gravity would cause the sea to sink on the southern
hemisphere and rise on the northernf.                  And the quantity of
water thus transferred from the southern hemisphere to the north
ern would carry the centre of gravity abont 1 foot further, and
thus give a total displacement of the centre to the extent of
about 8 feet.       The sea would therefore rise about 8 feet at the
North Pole, and in the latitude of Glasgow about 6 feet 7 inches.
This, added to the rise of 18 feet 5 inches, occasioned by the
melting of the ice, would give 25 feet as the total rise in the
latitude of Scotland 11,700 years ago.
   Each square foot of surface at the poles 11,700 years ago
would be receiving 18,223,100 foot-pounds more of heat an
nually than at present.          If we deduct 22 per cent, as the
amount absorbed in passing through the atmosphere, we have
14,214,000 foot-pounds. This would be sufficient to melt 2-26
feet of ice.     But if 50 per cent, were cut off instead of 22 per
cent., 1*45 cubic foot would be melted.               In this case the 470

443      Mr.   J. Croll on the Change     in the  Obliquity of   the Ecliptic,
 feet of ice would be melted, independently of the effects of ex-
 centricity, in about 320 years. And supposing that only one-
 fourth part of the extra heat reached the ground, 470 feet of ice
 would be removed in about 640 years.
    As to the exact time that the obliquity was at a maximum
 previous to that of 11,700 years ago our uncertainty is still
 greater.    If we are permitted to assume that the ecliptic passes
from its maximum to its minimum state and back to its
maximum again with anything like uniformity, at the rate as
signed by Leverrier and others, the obliquity would not be far
from a maximum about 60,000 years ago.                   Taking the rate of
precession     at 50",21129,    and   assuming     it to be uniform (which
it probably is not), the winter solstice would have been in aphelion
about 61,300 years ago*.           In short, it seems not at all impro
bable that at the time the solstice-point was in the aphelion, the
obliquity of the ecliptic would be not far from its maximum
 state.    But at that time the value of the excentricity was 0 023,
instead of 0-0187, its value at the last period.              Consequently
the   rise  of  the  sea would probably        be   somewhat   greater than
it was 11,700 years ago. Might not this be the period of the
40-feet beach?        In this case 11,000 or 12,000 years would be
the age of the 25-feet beach, and 60,000 years the age of the
40-feet beach.
    About 22,000 years ago the winter solstice was in perihe
lion ; and as the excentricity was then somewhat greater than it
is at present, the winters would be a little warmer and the climate
 more equable than it is at the present day.                  This perhaps
might be the period of the submarine forests and lower peat-
beds which underlie the Carse clays, Scrobicularia mud, and
other deposits belonging to the age of the 25-feet beach.                   At
any rate, it is perfectly certain that a condition of climate at
this period prevailed exceedingly favourable to the growth of
peat.     It follows also that at this time, owing to a greater accu
mulation of ice on the southern hemisphere, the sea-level would
be a few feet lower than at present, and that forests and peat
may have then grown on places which are now under the sea-
level.
   * In  order to determine the position of the solstice-point in relation to
the aphelion, it will not do to assume, as is commonly done, that the point
makes a revolution from aphelion to aphelion in any regular given period,
such as 21,000 years ; for it is perfectly evident that, owing to the great ir
regularity in the motion of the aphelion, no two revolutions will probably
be performed in the same length of period.        For example, the winter sol
stice was in aphelion about the following dates : 11,700, 33,300, and
61,300 years ago. Here are two consecutive revolutions, the one performed
in 21,600 years, and the other in 28,000 years, the difference in the length
of the two periods amounting to no fewer than 6400 years.

                   and its Influence on Climate.
   For   a few thousand years before and after 11,700 years ago,
when     the winter solstice was evidently not far from aphe
lion, and the sea standing considerably above its present level,
would probably, as we have already stated, be the time when the
Carse clays, the stratified sand and mud which form our Glas
gow Green, and other recent deposits lying above the present
level of the river, were formed.    And it is also a singular fact
that the condition of things at this period must have been ex
ceedingly favourable to the formation of such estuarine de
posits ; for at this time the winter temperature of our island,
as has been already shown, would be a few degrees below the
freezing-point, and consequently during that season snow would
fall instead of rain. The melting of the winter's accumulation
of snow on the approach of summer would necessarily produce
great floods, similar to what occur in the northern parts of
Asia and America at the present day from this very same cause.
The loose upper soil would be carried down by those floods and
  deposited in the estuaries of our rivers.
     The foregoing is a rough and imperfect sketch of the history
  of the climate and physical conditions of our globe for the past
  60,000 years, so far as physical and cosmical considerations
  seem to afford us information on the subject ; and its striking
  agreement with that derived from geological sources is an ad
  ditional evidence in favour of the opinion that geological and
, cosmical phenomena are physically related by a bond of cau
  sation.
     We have assumed 1° 22' 34" greater than the present obli
  quity as the maximum.       But this limit assigned by Laplace
  does not hold true for all time past *.   And Sir John Herschel
  thinks that when millions of years are taken into account, the
  obliquity may even amount to 3° or 4° on each side of a mean
state   f.
   Suppose, then, that at some past geological epoch the in
crease of the obliquity reached 4°, the equator would then be
receiving. 5'64 thermal days less heat than at present, and the
poles upwards of 24 thermal days more heat than at present.
The total quantity of heat received by the poles would therefore
be nearly ^ more than at the present day.    For every 6 pounds
of ice now melted at the pole, 7 pounds would then be melted.
Were this condition of things to occur when the excentricity
was near its superior limit, the hemisphere which had its winter
occurring in perihelion at the time, would in all probability be
completely deprived of its ice-cap, and forest-trees might then
grow at the pole.

444        On the Change in the Obliquity   of the Ecliptic.
   Were the obliquity increased by 4°, each square foot of surface
at the poles would receive annually 51,802,000 foot-pounds more
heat than at present, assuming that all the extra heat reached
the ground.     But suppose one half of the rays to be absorbed
in passing through the atmosphere, 25,901,000 foot-pounds per
square foot would then represent the extra heat received by
the poles.    This would be sufficient to melt 4-12 cubic feet of
ice.   The additional heat resulting from the increase of 4° in
the obliquity of the ecliptic would consequently melt a sheet of
ice one mile in thickness in about 1300 years.       A mile of ice
removed from off the antarctic continent (and this is not an
extravagant quantity, as we hope to be able to show on a future
occasion) would raise the general level of the sea 206 feet. And
to this must be added the rise resulting from the displacement of
the earth's centre of gravity, which in the latitude of Scotland
would amount to about 74 feet. This would give 280 feet as
the total rise resulting from the melting of one mile of ice from
off the face of the continent.     It is quite conceivable that an
enormous amount of ice might be melted on the southern hemi
sphere, while the quantity on the northern hemisphere remained
undiminished. For if this extreme condition of obliquity were
to occur at the time that the excentricity was at a higher
value (a very likely event), and the winter solstice in aphe
lion, the effects of excentricity would neutralize those of obli
quity on the northern hemisphere, and consequently the quantity
of ice on this hemisphere might not be diminished.        But on the
southern hemisphere the obliquity and the excentricity would
conspire to produce the same effect, viz. a melting of the ice ;
and hence the effects that we have been considering, which
would result from the removal of the ice, would necessarily take
place to a greater or less extent.
   The enormous effect that an extreme condition of excen
tricity must have in raising the temperature of the polar regions
of the hemisphere which has its winter occurring in perihelion
at the time, has been shown on a former occasion *. When
such a state of things happens at the time when the obliquity
is also at its superior limit, the combined effect of both causes
would in all probability completely remove the polar ice-cap,
and a submergence of the land on the opposite hemisphere to
the extent of hundreds of feet would be the inevitable result.
   It has been a matter of surprise how forest-trees could have
flourished near the poles, seeing that they must have been
deprived of the sun's rays for several months in the year.      But
it must be observed that it is not necessary that trees should
grow during winter, when deprived of the sun's rays. All that

pREYER       has described   method of determining the amount of
                                     a
    colouring-matter in the blood bymeans of the spectrum*. But
few experiments have been made with       view of determining the

quantity of hajmoglobine (hsematocrystalline) in the blood, doubt
less owing to the want of an accurate and convenient method.
The determination has been made either                       by
                                                  incinerating the

length the inconveniences             and sources of error to which both
 these methods are liable.
    The method which he proposes as being more convenient and
 more accurate depends on the following principle : — Concen
trated solutions of haemoglobin e of a certain thickness, even
with a strong illumination, are opake for all rays with the excep
tion of the red; while less concentrated solutions of the same
thickness allow a portion of green to pass along with red and
orange.    Hence, if a measured quantity of blood placed in front
of the spectrum-apparatus    be diluted with water until green
appears  in  the  spectrum, and   if once for all the strength of
haemoglobine solution which under the same circumstances
transmits green be known, we can easily calculate the percent
age of hsemoglobine in any blood.             If
                                        k be the percentage in the
haemoglobine solution, w the water added, 6 the measured vo
lume of blood, x, the percentage of hsemoglobine in the blood, is

or,   if 6=0*500      cubic centim.,
     This method requires for its execution a spectrum-apparatus,
 a finely-graduated accurately-calibrated    burette, and also a pi
 pette by which        cubic centim. can be read off, and a constant
 source of light.   Besides this, k must once for all be determined
 experimentally.    This is effected by preparing a solution of hse
moglobine which, for a given spectrum-apparatus,          a given un
 changed thickness of liquid layer (1 centimetre), and a given fixed
 distance, from the slit in the spectrum, just allows green to pass —
and in such a manner that the slighest increase of strength ex
tinguishes      it,
                while the slightest diminution increases the inten
sity  and  then the breadth of the green layer.
    When    k has once been accurately determined             by
                                                           drying the
solution over sulphuric acid in vacuo at 100° and weigh

                           is

liquid, the width of the slit, the distance of the unaltered source
of light and of the hsematinometer from the slit, and the position
of the prism must be constant in each experiment.         To be inde
pendent of changes of weather,           highly uniform petroleum-

   The author describes the details of the mode of experimenting,
and the few precautions which require to be taken.     He adduces
also  along series of analyses made         by
                                        this method, and compares
the results with those which he obtained specially           by
                                                      determining
the amount of iron, and which show the accuracy of the method.

    In conclusion, he points out that this method is susceptible
of application to determining the colouring-matter in other sub
stances — such, for instance, as aniline-red, carmine, &c.
    Liebreich* obtained from an alcoholic extract of brain a new
substance which he calls protagon.         It can be obtained in micro
scopic crystals, and has the formula €116 H241 N4 P©22. Liebreich
considers it to be a primary constituent of the brain, and that it
is very widely distributed in the organism. When protagon is
boiled for some time with baryta-water, it is resolved into glyce
rine-phosphoric acid, several fatty acids, and a new basic sub
stance, neurine, which forms with bichloride of platinum a double
salt crystallizing from water in hexagonal plates.
    This substance has been investigated by Baeyerf.          The crude
hydrochlorate    of neurine    was precipitated   with   phosphotungstic
substance was evaporated to a syrup.           The best mode of further
purification consists    in  its conversion into the platinum double
salt.    A special investigation of this double salt has shown it to
be probable that crude neurine is a mixture of two bases, whose
platinum double salts have respectively the formulae
                          NG5H14 CIPtCl2
and
                          N€5H12Cl,PtCl2.
    When a strong alcoholic solution of hydrochlorate of neurine
was treated with strong hydriodic acid, there was obtained a con
siderable quantity of large colourless prismatic crystals, which
were found on analysis to have the formula N G5 H18 12.           Part of
 this iodine is present as a substitution-product ; the other is pre
 cipitated by an aqueous solution of nitrate of silver in the cold.
 Freshly precipitated chloride of silver also replaced one atom of
 iodine by chlorine ; and the solution filtered off from the iodide of
 silver gave with bichloride of platinum a crystalline compound
 of the formula N €5 H13 1 CI, PtCl2.
     The reactions here given agree completely with those of a
 compound which Hofmann obtained by treating trimethylamine
 with bromide of ethylene : a simple union of the two bodies takes
 place, resulting in the formation of a beautiful crystallized com
 pound, NG5H13Br2.           This corresponds to the compound of
 neurine which contains two atoms of iodine. When this bro
 mine-compound is treated with freshlyprecipitated oxide of silver,

all the bromine is removed, and a strongly alkaline solution is
obtained which has all the properties of neurinc.
    It is interesting in regard to the constitution of neurine, that
the group oxethyle which is present in it is also a constituent
of taurine.     Choline, in the gall, and sinkaline, which is present
in white mustard, are probably identical with neurine, which
thus plays an important and varied part in the organic kingdom.
    Baeyer and Scheibler have given a preliminary account* of a
research they have undertaken on the constitution of mellitic
acid.     According to them, this acid has the composition of ben
zole (G6 H6) in which six atoms of hydrogen are replaced by six of
carboxyle, G 02 H : G6 (GO2 H)6'. Heated with lime, it is com
pletely decomposed into carbonic acid and benzole ; but the six of
carbonic acid can also be successively removed.            Treated with
sodium-amalgam, mellitic acid takes up 6H            and   gives a new
 sixbasic acid, G6 H6 (G O2 H)s, which, heated with sulphuric acid,
is resolved into the quadribasic acid C8 H2 (G O2 H)4.         To these
four of hydrogen may be added; and the new acid again loses
 carbonic acid if treated with sulphuric acid, and thus benzoic
 acid is obtained as the last member of the chain.
     All these acids belong to the following two- series, in which
 those prepared from mellitic acid, and whose existence is di
 stinctly proved, are designated by an asterisk : —

     The still missing links will doubtless be prepared from melli
 tic acid; and as the further investigation will require large
 quantities of mellite, the authors address a request to the pos
  sessors of this rare substance to be furnished with some.
     Lieben has published a preliminary noticef of a research on
 which he has for some time been engaged.            The object of this
 was to seek a synthetical method for passing from the lower
  alcohols to the higher ones, and in such a manner as to give at
 the same time an insight into the constitution of the bodies ob
  tained.    The means used consisted of the zinc compounds of the
  alcohol radicals, which were acted upon by the chlorine substitu
  tion-products. The chlorinated ethers were the best fitted for

 the purpose, as it seemed likely that the action of the zinc com
 pound would extend only to the chlorine, and not to the oxygen
  (as it might be presupposed to do in the case of the chlorine deri
 vatives of the alcohols, fatty acids, aldehydes, &c.) .
      It was desirable to start with the lowest ethers and the first
 chlorine substitution-products. Unfortunately it was found that
the preparation of monochlorinated methylic ether was attended
 with such difficulties that it was advisable to start with mono-
 chlorinated ethylic ether*, and a lengthened and tedious investi
gation of this body was necessary in order to clear up its con
 stitution.
     This investigation showed that the chlorine is very probably
unsymmetrically divided between the ether radicals contained in
the ether; so that the formula
                                         Q2  jja   r 9 must   De assigned to
it.      Hence it will be necessary for the future to assign to this
body the name bichlorinated ether, while that of quadrichlorinated
ether     must  be   given   to the body       G4 H6' CI4 0,  discovered  by
Malaguti.
       In conjunction with Bauer f, Lieben had obtained a body
Q6    jji3 qi q Dy tne action of zincethyle on chlorinated ether ; and
to this body, which might be called ethylochhrinated ether, the
rational formula                               18       assigned.
                                     H5 f
     When concentrated hydriodic acid acts upon this body, the
chlorine is mainly replaced by hydrogen, and along with hydro
chloric acid, free iodine, and some secondary products there is
obtained a heavy oil containing iodide of ethyle, ethylated chlo
ride of ethyle, and iodised iodide of ethyle. This latter has not
only the composition, but it has also the boiling-point of Wurtz's
iodide of butyle.       It acts at ordinary temperatures on acetate of
silver,    and yields an extremely odoriferous ether, the ethylated
acetate    of ethyle, and, on the other hand, a gas which can be con
densed to a liquid by a freezing-mixture, and which in all proba
bility is butylene. Ethylated acetate of ethyle, treated with potash,
   ields ethylated ethylic alcohol, similar in its properties to the
   utylic alcohol which Wurtz obtained from the fusel-oil of beet
root.      Yet the new body is rather identical with the body called
hydrate of butylene, and is only isomeric with normal butylic
alcohol.
     In the previously cited investigation, Lieben and Bauer ob
tained a body in which both atoms of chlorine in chlorinated
ether were replaced by ethyle, and which they called biethylic

    According to Lieben, this body, when treated with strong hy-
 driodic acid, yields Methylated iodide of ethyle. From this it may
 be expected that the biethylated ethyiic alcohol will be obtained ;
 it will have the same composition as normal hexylic alcohol, but
 doubtless not be identical with it.
    In  a   series of memoirs Wohler described several new com
 pounds    of  silicon endowed with highly remarkable properties.
 Among these was one formed by the action of gaseous hydro
 chloric acid on crystallized silicon at a temperature below red
 ness.    It forms a very volatile liquid, the vapour of which burns
in the air, and which is decomposed by water with formation of
 a white substance, different from silicon, than which it contains
 less oxygen. Wohler provisionally assigned to this body the
 formula Si2Cl3 + 2HCl (Si=21), or Si6 CI10 H4 (Si = 14). The
 further investigation he called on others to undertake.
    Friedel and Ladenburg have taken up the subject from the
 point of view that the chloride in question was derived from
 chloride of silicon by the substitution of an atom of hydrogen
 for one of silicon. These anticipations have been realized. After
 preparing a considerable quantity of crude chloride, they have
 succeeded in preparing from it the chloride in a state of purity.
 By repeated fractional distillations they found its boiling-point
to be 34° instead of 42° C, which Wohler and Buff had found;
in other respects their observations of its properties confirmed
those which its discoverers had made.
    Analysis gave numbers which correspond to the formula
SiCl3 H, which is confirmed by the determination of the vapour-
density.
    When this body is caused to act upon absolute alcohol, it
yields an ethereal liquid of an agreeable odour resembling that
of silicic ether, some of which is formed at the same time.      This

This body is to the inflammable chloride what silicate of ethyle
is to the ordinary chloride of silicon.
    The body gives rise to a curious reaction.     When a fragment
of sodium is thrown upon it a gentle disengagement of gas com
mences, due probably to the action of sodium on the alcohol libe
rated from the ether by moisture ; when this has ceased, on the
application of a gentle heat there is a regular disengagement of

of gas thus disengaged, siliciuretted hydrogen was obtained in a
state of purity.      Some of this was collected over mercury, and
potash passed up to           it,
                              which by was decomposed into hydro

   The authors have also investigated the product formed by the
action of water on the chloride SiCl3 H.         From their analyses
and those of Wohler they deduce the composition Si2 H2 O3.
   Wohler had already thrown out the idea that the series of
bodies he had described might have constitutions analogous to
organic bodies, silicon playing the part of carbon.           This point

   Acetylene, G2H2, differs from oxalic acid, G2H204, only by
four atoms of oxygen.        Berthelot* has succeeded in directly
combining oxygen with free acetylene              shaking the gas by
with  a solution of permanganate of potash until the liquid       no                 is
longer  decolorized.   The  liquid then contains   large quantity of   a
oxalic acid, which may be separated                        by
                                             the ordinary methods.
At the same time some formic and carbonic acids are formed,
which may be regarded as arising from secondary decomposi   a
tion of the oxalic acid.
  It   isinteresting to observe that the synthesis of oxalic acid                         is
effected     by
             the successive addition of its constituent elements                          ;

 thus carbon and hydrogen unite directly to form acetylene, which
 forms oxalic acid with free oxygen.
    Ethylene is also oxidized to oxalic acid by permanganate, with
 elimination of hydrogen,
                   G2 H4 + O5  = G2 H2 G4 + H2 9.
    Allylene, C6 H4, in like manner, when treated with permanga
 nate, takes up oxygen and forms malonic acid,
                       GSH4 + ©4 = G3H4©4,
while at the same time some acetic and carbonic acids are formed
from a secondary decomposition of the malonic acid.
    Propylene is oxidized by permanganate with elimination of
hydrogen, forming the same products as allylene in even greater
 quantity.
    Berthelot has published some investigations in which he shows
that several compounds of the aromatic series are polymers of
acetylene*.     He had formerly shown that chloroform is decom
posed by   red-hot  copper with the formation of acetylene,
                  2GHCl3 + 3Gu=G2H2 + 3GuCl2;
and that by the same treatment        of bromoform      a certain quantity
of benzole is obtained, thus —
                6GHBr3     + 9Gu=G6H6+9GuBr2.
                Bromoform.           Benzole.
 He has now shown that when acetylene is heated alone to a tem
 perature near that of the melting-point of glass it is readily
 changed into polymers.      The yellow liquid obtained in this man
 ner was subjected to fractional distillation, and an entire series
 of hydrocarbons obtained, all of which are polymers of acetylene.
 Almost half the liquid consisted of benzole.            It was found to
 boil at 80° C., formed with chlorine in the sunlight G6 H6' Cle,
 and treated with fuming nitric acid yielded nitrobenzole, from
which aniline was obtained.       This formation of nitrobenzole and
aniline renders it possible to prove the change of acetylene into
benzole, even when so small a quantity of material as 10 cubic
centims. of acetylene was used.
    This reaction explains the occurrence of benzole in preparing
acetylene by heating organic matters to redness.               The author
compares the formation of benzole with the change of acetylene
into hydride of ethyle,

and assumes that in benzole the free affinities of the acetylene
are satisfied as readily by 2 (G2 Hs) as in hydride of ethyle by
2(H2).
    The crude product from which the benzole was obtained by frac
tional distillation began to boil even at 50° C, and furnished an
extremely mobile, very volatile liquid hydrocarbon of penetrating
alliaceous odour, which was absorbed by concentrated sulphuric
acid and immediately decomposed.       This body, which is probably
diacetylene, G4 H4, was not obtained in sufficient quantities for
closer investigation.
    After the benzole had passed over in the fractional distillation,
the temperature rose to 135° C., and at 160° C. a liquid passed
over which by its reactions was identified as styrole, or tetracety-
lene, G8H8=4G8H2.          About one-fifth of the entire quantity
consisted of this substance. When treated with solution of iodine
in iodide of potassium beautiful crystals of iodide of styrole were
formed, which in the course of an hour decomposed spontane
ously, with separation of iodine, into a polymer of styrole,
                                                                  —a
property not possessed by any other hydrocarbon.
    After separating the styrole, the thermometer rapidly rose to
210° C. ; and at 250° a product passed over which remained
liquid, but in a freezing- mixture deposited crystals of naphthaline.
The author prepared from it nitronaphthaline and the compound
with picric acid.     Naphthaline results from the condensation of
five molecules of acetylene under elimination of hydrogen,
                       G10H8=5(G2H2)-H2;
and the liquid in which it was dissolved consisted probably of
pentacetylene, G10 H10.     Naphthaline is also formed to a slight
extent when pure acetylene is passed through a red-hot tube.
 .  Between 250° and 310° C. various hydrocarbons pass over,
which exhibit in a high degree the fluorescence of the hydrocar
bons obtained by dry distillation of resins.      No crystals could
be obtained from these liquids, and they were not further inves
tigated; but the author believes that they contain six-, seven-,
and eight-times condensed acetylene.
    At the boiling-point of mercury there distils a considerable
quantity of a hydrocarbon crystallizing in brilliant laminae which
on investigation were found to have all the properties of Retene,
G18 H18, and, with picric acid, furnished the characteristic com
pound discovered by I'ritzsche.      It must hence be regarded as
acetylene nine times condensed.

    LIX.          On Grove's Gas Battery.               By M. J.-M. Gaugain*.

    physicists
         and with          the theory of it which he has given.
This theory is now generally admitted ; and probably few persons
remember the objections which from time to time have been
urged against            it,
                   especially     M. Schonbein. by    have been led    I
 by other investigations to return to the subject     and although      ;
I  was not acquaiuted beforehand with M. Schonbein's investi
gation, have arrived at almost the same conclusions.
         I
I     used     mode of investigation
                  a                    quite different from those
hitherto employed.      only worked with one element at

and instead of measuring the intensity of the current,         mea                 I
sured the electromotive force directly                       by
                                            the method of opposi
tion.   I  could thus numerically estimate the influence of the
modifications   which     have successively introduced into the
                                   I
arrangement of the couple.
   Mr. Grove thinks      indispensable that each of the platinum
                                   it

466          M. J.-M. Gaugain on Grove's Gas Battery.
with one of the gases and the liquid beneath.            In order to
ascertain if this really is so, I made the following determina
tions.    I first measured the electromotive force of a couple in
which each of the platinums touched at the same time the liquid
and the gas, as prescribed by Mr. Grove.          I then lowered the
platinum wires so as to immerse them completely and to keep
the liquid from contact with the gas ; and having again mea
sured the electromotive force,    I found that it was exactly the
 same as before.      It follows from this observation that the
action of the platinum only extends to the dissolved gas, and
that the jars containing gas have no other purpose than that of
 keeping the solutions they cover in a state of saturation.
     I imagine, moreover, that I can explain why Mr. Grove has
 arrived at an entirely different result.    By my method of ob
 servation, the couple   I used is only at work for a fraction of a
 second; in so short a time the gaseous solutions surrounding
the platinum wires cannot be appreciably altered.          This is no
longer the case when the current is allowed to circulate whole
days, as by Mr. Grove it was allowed to do : the liquid layers
which then surround the platinum wires are continually robbed
 of the gas they contain, and must take fresh quantities from the
reservoirs above ; the gases, which thus dissolve solely on the
upper surface of the liquid, must reach the platinum wires more
easily the nearer these are to the surface.
    The electromotive force of the gas- couple varies singularly
with the condition of the platinum wires used.          According to
 an old observation of Matteucci, the action of platinum wires is'
increased by heating them in a spirit-lamp-flame some moments
before using them as electrodes.       Under the most favourable
conditions the electromotive force of a gas-couple made with
unplatinized platinum wires scarcely exceeds 155.           I take as
unit the electromotive force of the couple                 —      's *°
                                                     xoo6'
 say, that of a bismuth and copper thermoelectric couple, one of
whose junctions is at zero and the other at 100°. , As         I have
 some time ago remarked, the electromotive force of the couple
  Bi— Cu
             vanes m different elements even using pure metals )
0°     100°
and therefore the numbers which      I shall cite are not comparable
with those which M. J. Regnauld obtained when using a differ
ent thermo-electric element from mine.
    I have found that the electromotive force of the gas-couple is
not modified when the oxygen bell-jar is replaced by one con
taining carbonic acid, or even by a jar which only contains
boiled water.     I have found that the couple formed by join
ing a platinum wire plunged in a solution of oxygen, and a

             M. J.-M. Gaugaiu           on Grove's                    Gas Battery.         467
platinum wire immersed in water deprived of gas, developes no
current. M. Schonbein had observed these latter facts in the
year 1843, and concluded therefrom that in Grove's gas-couple
the oxygen serves to depolarize the positive wire.        entirely                    I
assent to this explanation, and think that the function of oxygen
in the gas-battery is that of sulphate of copper in Daniell's
battery.   The electromotive force of Daniell's element,
              ——                        ,    is represented by 193                ;

                 water.   of copper-
        that of a Volta's couple,                    —   -        ¦         , by 178,
                                                 Acidulated water.
when the two couples are at rest ; but if they are set to work
by joining them by a conductor offering very small resistance,
it is found, after a few minutes, that the electromotive force
of the Volta's couple falls below 70, while the Daniell's retains
almost all its original force.     The explanation of these facts,
                                            is is,
almost universally admitted,        that the algebraic sum of the
electromotive forces at work        almost the same at starting in
each;   but, under the influence of the current, the polarization
of the copper developes in Volta's couple         considerable nega     a
tive force, which diminishes the algebraic sum of the forces of
the couple, while in Daniell's element the sulphate of copper
prevents the polarization in the same way, in Grove's element,
                               ;
 oxygen serves simply to depolarize the positive wire.
    It must, however, be remarked that the action of oxygen in
 the gas-couple     far from being as effective as that of sulphate
                    is
 of copper in Daniell's element.       When     Daniell's element     a                        is
 set to work       joining its poles

 couple is  arranged as Mr. Grove prescribes.          found in one         I
 experiment that this force fell in       few minutes from 152 to

 I   have tried to find in what proportion each electrode contri
buted to the enfeeblement which the couple undergoes under
the conditions mentioned.       found that the electromotive force

An Elementary          Treatise on Rational Mechanics.        By the Rev.
    John Kerr, M.A.          Glasgow : William Hamilton [1867], pp. 295.
rpHIS       work is designed for the use of those students of natural
                        " who have no time for the higher mathematics,"
         philosophy
the use of the higher mathematics heing avoided by a free employ
ment of limits and infinitesimals wherever required.             Such is the
author's account of the book ; and we may add that even when the
student has time and inclination to master the higher mathematics,
the best introduction to the Calculus is a work in which detached
 questions are treated by limits — such as the early sections of the
 '
   Principia,' &c.
    The present treatise contains a very comprehensive view of ele
mentary mechanics, and discusses several subjects not generally
contained in books of this class, such as vis viva, central forces, and
the motion of a rigid body round a fixed axis. The latter of these is a
very valuable addition to the usual course, though the subject cannot
be fully treated in an elementary work ; e. g. it is scarcely possible
to discuss the pressure on the axis of the revolving body by elemen
tary mathematics only.          The work is illustrated by a large number
of well-selected examples ; and a student who thoroughly masters
its contents will have an excellent knowledge of the subject.
    It is liable to what in the case of an elementary treatise is a some
what serious objection : it is abstruse ; by which we mean that the
inherent difficulty of the subject is increased by the order in which
the parts are arranged, and in some cases by the way in which they
are stated.      It would require a detailed examination of the book to
show this ; we will mention just one instance.            The learner is in
troduced to every combination of forces acting on a point before he
comes to the first example ; whereas in practical teaching it is far
the best method to familiarize the learner with the cases of three
forces in equilibrium before letting him go further.         This we believe
to be the most serious obstacle to the usefulness of the work ; and
this will be overcome by any learner who has sufficient energy to
avail himself of the author's caution : — " In using this treatise the
beginner will find it essential to secure his ground very carefully as
he proceeds."
    We would invite Mr. Kerr's attention to a point which in our
opinion he should reconsider in case a new edition of his work be
called for : we mean his use of the term " force of inertia," which
occurs several times, and which we suppose to be a translation of
the old term " vis inertise."        The objection to the term is that, force
being    defined   in   the  usual way (p. 1), "force of inertia" is not a
force at all.     Now, though Mr. Kerr must be well aware of this,
what he says on the subject is highly calculated to mislead the
learner on a fundamental point.          Thus, in the note headed " Illus
trations of   Force,"     we have apparently as different examples of force,
muscular     effort,  force of gravity, force of inertia, force of elasticity
(p. 287).      So, again, on page 183 we find that "when a train

                                  [    Royal Society.                                          469
    is made to ascend a gradient with increasing speed, there is work
    done against friction, the resistance of the air, gravity, and inertia"
    but not a hint is given that, if work can be properly said to be done
    against inertia in any sense, it must be in a very different sense from
    that in which it is said to be done against friction, and the rest.
    Again, on page 147 we find the following paragraph: — "We infer
    particularly from this law [i. e. Newton's Third Law of Motion],
    that when a free mass m is receiving an acceleration                 <j>,
                                                                  reacts with   it
    a force opposite to the moving force m<j>. When this reaction                               is
    considered as      resistance to acceleration, arising from the tendency
                       a
    of the free body to persevere in its actual state of rest or motion,
    it    called the force of inertia of the body."
         is                                              Now Newton's third
    law can only apply to the mutual action of at least two bodies. This
    is  plain from Newton's own statement of the law as well as'
    from his illustrations, which Mr. Kerr in part translates. Sup
    pose, then, that in the above extract the acceleration              origi             <p

                                               m

    " resistance to acceleration," nor with what                     can be          it

     ¦»¦  " On the Conversion of Dynamical into Electrical Force without
    the aid of Permanent Magnetism."           By C. W. Siemens, F.R.S.
       Since  the  great discovery    of  magnetic electricity             by
                                                                      Faraday in
     1830, electricians have    had   recourse    to  mechanical    force  for the
    production   of  their most    powerful    effects  ; hut  the  power of the
    magneto-electrical machine seems        to   depend    in  an  equal measure
    upon the force expended     on  the one  hand,    and  upon permanent mag
    netism on the other.
       An experiment, however, has been lately suggested to me by my
    brother, Dr. Werner Siemens of Berlin, which proves that permanent
    magnetism     isnot requisite in order to convert mechanical into elec
    trical force and the result obtained by this experiment

fact, but also because it provides a simple means of producing very
powerful electrical effects.
   The apparatus employed in this experiment is an electromagnetic
machine consisting of one or more horseshoes of soft iron surrounded
 with insulated wire in the usual manner, of a rotating keeper of
 soft iron surrounded also with an insulated wire, and of a commu
tator connecting the respective coils in the manner of a magneto-elec
trical machine.          If
                       a galvanic battery were connected with this ar
rangement,    rotation  of the keeper in a given direction would ensue.
If  the battery were excluded from the circuit and rotation imparted
to the keeper in the opposite direction to that resulting from the
galvanic current, there would be no electrical effect produced, sup
posing the electromagnets were absolutely free of magnetism ; but
 by inserting a battery of a single cell in the circuit, a certain magnetic
 condition would be set up, causing similar electromagnetic poles to
be forcibly approached to each other, and dissimilar poles to be
forcibly severed, alternately, the rotation being contrary in directioa
to that which would be produced by the exciting current.
    Each forcible approach of similar poles must augment the magnetic
tension and consequently increase the power of the circulating cur
rent ; the resistance of the keeper to the rotation must also increase
at every step until it reaches a maximum, imposed by the available
force and the conductivity of the wires employed.
    The cooperation of the battery is only necessary for a moment of
time after the rotation has commenced, in order to introduce the
magnetic action, which will thereupon continue to accumulate without
its aid.
   With the rotation the current ceases ; and                     if,
                                                        upon restarting the
machine, the battery          connected with the circuit for
                                  is                                moment       a
of time with its poles reversed, then the direction of the continuous
current produced         the machine will also be the reverse of what
                          by                                                         it
was before.
    Instead of employing          battery to commence the accumulative
                                       a
action of the macliine,      suffices to touch the soft-iron bars employed
                               ii
with permanent magnet, or to dip the former into
      a                                                         position pa  a
rallel to the magnetic axis of the earth, in order to produce the
same phenomenon as before.            Practically       not even necessary
                                                             it   is
to give any external impulse upon restarting the machine, the
residuary magnetism of the electromagnetic arrangements employed
being found sufficient for that purpose.
   The mechanical arrangement best suited for the production of these
currents  is that originally proposed by Dr. Werner Siemens in 1857*
consisting of cylindrical keeper hollowed at two sides for the recep
               a
tion of insulated wire wound longitudinally, which           made to rotate
                                                                        is
between the poles of series of permanent magnets, which latter are
                              a
at present replaced by electro-magnets.          On imparting rotation to
the armature of such an arrangement, the mechanical resistance                       is
found to increase rapidly, to such an extent that either the driving-

    " On the Augmentation of the Power of       a Magnet by the reaction
thereon of Currents       induced by the Magnet itself."      By Charles
Wheatstone, F.R.S.
   The magneto-electric machines which have heen hitherto described
are actuated either by a permanent magnet or by an electromagnet
deriving its power from a rheomotor placed in the circuit of its coil.
In the present note I intend to show that      an electromagnet, if it pos
sess at  the,commencement the slightest polarity, may become a pow
erful magnet by the gradually augmenting currents which itself origi
nates.
    The following is a description of the form and dimensions of the
                  I
electromagnet have employed. The construction, it will be seen, is
the same as that of the electromagnetic part of Mr. Wilde's machine.
    The core of the electromagnet is formed of a plate of soft iron 15
inches in length and ^ an inch in breadth, bent at the middle of its
length into a horseshoe .form.       Round it is coiled in the direction
of its breadth, 640 feet of insulated copper wire ^ of an inch in
diameter.     The armature, which is according to Siemens's ingenious
construction, consists of a rotating cylinder of soft iron 8g inches in
length, grooved at two opposite sides so as to allow the wire to be
coiled upon it longitudinally ; the length of the wire thus coiled is
80 feet, and its diameter is the same as that of the electromagnet
coil.
    When this electromagnet is excited by any rheomotor the current
from which is in a constant direction, during the rotation of the
armature currents are generated in its coil during each semirevolution
which are alternately in opposite directions ; these alternate currents
 may be transmitted unchanged to another part of the circuit, or by
means of a rheotrope be converted to the same direction.
    If now, while the circuit of the armature remains completed, the
rheomotor be removed from the electromagnet, on causing the arma
ture to revojve, however rapidly, it will be found, by the interposition
 of a galvanometer, or any other test, that but very slight effects
take place.     Though these effects become stronger in proportion to
the residual magnetism left in the electromagnet from the previous
action of a current, they never attain any considerable amount.
    But if the wires of the two circuits be so joined as to form a sin
gle circuit, in which the currents generated by the armature, after
being changed to the same direction, act so as to increase the existing
polarity of the electromagnet, very different results will be obtained.
 The force required to move the machine will be far greater, showing
 a great increase of magnetic power in the horseshoe ; and the exist
 ence of an energetic current in the wire is shown by its action on a

472      Royal Society   : — Mr. Wheatstone on the Augmentation
galvanometer, by its heating 4 inches of platinum wire "0067 in dia
meter, by its making a powerful electromagnet, by its decomposing
water, and by other tests.
    The explanation of these effects is as follows : — The electro
magnet always retains a slight residual magnetism, and is therefore
in the condition of a weak permanent magnet ; the motion of the ar
mature occasions feeble currents in alternate directions in the coils
thereof, which, after being reduced to the same direction, pass into
the coil of the electromagnet in such manner as to increase the
magnetism of the iron core ; the magnet having thus received an
accession of strength, produces in its turn more energetic currents
in the coil of the armature ; and these alternate actions continue until
a maximum is attained, depending on the rapidity of the motion
and the capacity of the electromagnet.
    If  the two coils be connected in such manner that the rectified
current from the coil of the armature passes into the coil of the elec
tromagnet in the direction which would impart a contrary mag
netism to the iron core, no current is produced, and consequently
there is no augmentation of magnetism.
    It is easy to prove that the residual magnetism of the electro
magnet is the determining cause of these powerful effects.            For
this purpose it is sufficient to pass a current from a voltaic battery,
a magneto-electric machine, or any other rheomotor, into the coil of
the electromagnet in either direction, and it will invariably be found
that the direction of the current, however powerful it may eventually
become,     is in accordance with the polarity of the magnetism im
pressed on the iron core.
    If, instead of the currents in the coil of the rotating armature
being reduced to the same uniform direction, they retain their alterna
tions, no effects, or at most very small differential ones, are produced,
as no accumulation of magnetism then takes place.
    I  will now call attention to the fact that stronger effects are pro
 duced at the first moment of completing the combined circuit
than afterwards.      The machine having been put in motion, at the
first moment of completing the circuit 4 inches of platinum wire were
made red-hot ; but immediately afterwards the glow disappeared, and
only about one inch of the wire could be permanently kept at a red
heat.     This diminution of effect was accompanied by a great increase
of the resistance of the machine.    The cause of the momentary strong
effect was, that the machine from its acquired momentum continued
its motion for a few seconds, though it required a stronger force
than could be applied to maintain that motion.        Each time the cir
cuit is broken and recompleted the same effect recurs.
    On bringing the primary "coil of an inductorium (RuhmkorfF s coil)
into the circuit formed by connecting the coils of the electromagnet
and rotating armature, no spark occurs in the secondary coil.          On
 account of the great resistance of the circuit, which now also includes
the primary coil of the inductorium, the current is not in sufficient
 quantity to produce any noticeable inductive effect.
 . A very remarkable increase of all the effects,      accompanied by a

               of   the    Power of   a   Magnet by reaction.          473
diminution in the resistance of the machine, is observed when a
cross wire is placed so as to divert a great portion of the current
from the electromagnet. The four inches of platinum wire, instead
of flashing into redness and then disappearing, remains permanently
ignited.   The inductorium, which before gave no spark, now gave
one a quarter of an inch in length ; water was more abundantly
decomposed ; and all the other effects were similarly increased.
   I account for this augmentation of the effects in the following
way : —
   Though so much of the. current is diverted from the electromag
net by the cross wire, the magnetic effect still continues to accu
mulate, though not to so high a degree ; but the current generated by
the armature, passing through the short circuit formed by the arma
ture-branch and cross wire, experiences a far less resistance than if it
had passed through the armature and electromagnet branches ; and
though the electromotive force is less, the resistance having been
rendered less in a much greater proportion, the resultant effect is
greater.
    Imust observe that a certain amount of resistance in the cross
wire is necessary to produce the maximum effect.           If the resistance
be too small, the electromagnet does not acquire sufficient magne
tism ; andifitbetoo great, though the magnetism becomes stronger,
the increase of resistance more than counterbalances its effect.
   But the effects already described are far inferior to those obtained
by causing them to take place in the cross wire itself.      With the same
application of force, 7 inches of platinum wire were made red-hot, and
sparks were elicited in the inductorium 2j inches in length.
   The force of two men was employed in these, as well as in the
other experiments.      When the interrupter of the primary coil was
fixed, the machine was much easier to move than when it acted.
For when the interrupter acted, at each moment of interruption tlie
cross wire being, as it were, removed, the whole of the current passed
through the electromagnet, and consequently a greater amount of
magnetic energy was excited, while in the intervals during which
the cross wire was complete the current passed mainly through
the primary coil.
   The effects are much less influenced by a resistance in the electro
magnet branch than in either of the other branches.

   The value of the time r depends on the nature of the coils. In
coils of similar outward form, r varies as the square of the linear
dimension, and inversely as the resistance of unit of length of a wire
whose section is the sum of the sections of the wires passing through
unit of section of the coil.
   In the large experimental coil used in determining the B.A. unit
of resistance in 18&4, r was about '01 second.                               In the coils of
electromagnets        r is   much      greater,      and  when     an  iron   core is inserted
there is a still greater increase.
   Let us next ascertain the effect of a sudden change of position in
the secondary coil, which alters the value of M from M, to M2 in a
time tt—tv during which the current changes from xx to xv                                 Inte

   This equation may           be interpreted in the language               of the dynamical
theory, by saying         that   the    electromagnetic          momentum        of the circuit
remains      the  same   after  a sudden       change     of  position.       To  ascertain the
effect of the     commutator,       -let  us suppose        that,   at a  given instant, cur
rents x and y exist         in the    two    coils,    that  the   two   coils are then made
into one circuit, and that x'            is  the     current    in  the   circuit  the instant
after completion ; then the same equation (1) gives
           ,    .
                  (L + 2M+N>'=(L + M>+(N+M)y.

    In  the first kind the circuit       of both coils remains uninterrupted         ;
and when the operation is complete, two equal currents in opposite
 directions are combined into one.              In this case, therefore, y=—x,
 and
                           (L+2M+N)*'=(L-N)*                                     (8)
    When there      are iron cores in the coils, or metallic circuits in which
independent       currents   can be excited, the electrical equations are
 much more complicated, and contain as many independent variables
as there can       be independent electromagnetic quantities.               I shall
 therefore, for the sake of preserving simplicity, avoid the consider
ation of the iron cores, except so far as they simply increase the
values of L, M, and N.
    I shall also suppose that the secondary coil is at first in a posi
tion in which H=0, and that it turns into a position in which
M=— M, which will increase the current in the ratio of L+N to
L-2H + N.
    The commutator is then         reversed.       This will diminish the current
in  a ratio depending on the kind of commutator.
    The secondary coil is then moved so that M changes                from M to 0,
which will increase      the  current    in  the  ratio  of L+2M+N to L+N.
    During the whole       motion     the   current    has  also been decaying at
a rate which varies according to the value of L + 2M + N ; but since
M varies from +M to — M, we may, in a rough theory, suppose
that in the expression for the decay of the current M=0.
    If the secondary coil makes a semirevolution in time T, then the
ratio of the current xv after a semirevolution, to the current x0 before
the semirevolution, will be

    By increasing the speed, T may be indefinitely diminished ; so that
the question of the maintenance of the current depends ultimately on
whether r is greater or less than unity.              When r is greater than 1 or
less than — I, the current may be maintained by giving a sufficient
speed to the machine ; it will be always in one direction               in the first
case, and it will be a reciprocating current in the second.
    When r lies between + 1 and — 1, no current can be maintained.
    Let there be p windings of wire in the first coil and q windings
in the second, then we may write
                     L=lpi, M.=mpq, N=tt<f,                                    (11)

pm is greater than qn ; and when

which is the maximum value of r.
   When the ratio of p to q lies between that of n to m and that of m
to I, r lies between +1 and — 1, and the current must decay; but
when pi is less than qm, a reciprocating current may be kept up,
and will increase most rapidly when
and
   When the commutator is of the        second kind, the first step is to close
both     circuits, so as to render the currents in them independent.
The second circuit is then broken, and the current in it is thus

 but as they are only true when the magnetism of the cores is consi
 dered wgidly connected with the currents in the coils, an elaborate
  discussion of them would be out of place in what professes to be
  only a rough explanation of the theory of the experiments.
     Such a rough explanation appears to me to be as follows : —
     Without the shunt, the current in the secondary coil is always in
  rigid connexion with that in the primary coil, except when the com
  mutator is changing.      With the shunt, the two currents are in some
  degree   independent ; and   the secondary coil, whose electric inertia is
  small eompare'd with that of the primary, can have its current reversed
  and varied without being clogged by the sluggish primary coil.
      On the other hand, the primary coil loses that part of the total
  current which passes through the shunt ; but we know that an iron
  core, when highly magnetized, requires a great increase of current to
  increase its magnetism, whereas its magnetism can be maintained at a
  considerable value by a current much less powerful.              In this way
  the diminution in resistance and self-induction due to the shunt may
  more than counterbalance the diminution of strength in the primary
  magnet.
     Also, since the self-induction of the shunt is very small, all instan
  taneous currents will run through it rather than through the electro
  magnetic coils, and therefore it will receive more of the heating effect
  of variable currents than a comparison of the resistances alone would
  lead us to expect.

   ON THE DISENGAGEMENT          OF GASES FROM     THEIR SATURATED
                       SOLUTIONS.    BY M. GERNEZ.
    'HE   researches I have for some years pursued on supersaturated
        saline solutions have led me to investigate the supersaturated
solutions of gases in certain liquids.   Solutions of this kind are easily
obtained.      The gas may be dissolved in water under a definite pres
sure, and the temperature then be gradually raised ; and if (as is ge
nerally the case) the gas is less soluble at a higher temperature, the
solution remains for some time supersaturated ; or the pressure may
be diminished without altering the temperature, and the liquid re
tains the gas dissolved for some time.       Under these circumstances,
if the solution is thrown into any vessel, a multitude of gas-bubbles
are seen to form on the sides, which increase there, then rise
through the liquid and burst on the surface. A solid body introduced
into the liquid is in like manner surrounded by gas-bubbles.        There
is no one who has not observed this phenomenon with solution of
carbonic acid, whether as Seltzer water, or in an alcoholic liquid in
the state of sparkling wine.      The formation of gas-bubbles is gene
rally attributed to the roughnesses of solid substances wetted by the
liquid, and the following explanation of it is given : — A molecule of
gas in the solution is equally acted on by all the liquid molecules
uniformly distributed about it, and there is no reason for its disen
gagement.       Near the side, on the contrary, it is on the one hand at
tracted by the liquid, and on the other by the solid molecules : these
latter, it is assumed, act less energetically than the others, and hence
the predominating action causes it to take the gaseous state ; it is
thus the layer in contact which will abandon the dissolved gas.
Solid bodies introduced into the liquid act in the same manner. The
attentive investigation of the phenomenon has led me to observe that
this view of it is contradicted by experiment.
    I. Solid substances round which are disengaged bubbles of gas
lose this property after some time.
    I bring any solid rod into a supersaturated solution ; and it becomes
covered with gas-bubbles. I stir it to facilitate their rising ; new
bubbles form, in less quantities. After several operations of this kind
all disengagement ceases ; the solid no longer acts ; but if the por
tion of the rod hitherto not immersed be plunged into the liquid, it
produces an effervescence.
    II. A lengthened immersion of a body in the water deprives it
of action.
    A body which has been for a long time in water becomes inactive,
while the part of the same substance which has remained outside the
liquid is immediately covered with gas-bubbles on immersion.
    III. Solids lose the property under the influence of heat.
    Heat produces the same effect as continued contact with water.
A metal rod passed for a few seconds through a spirit-lamp soon
becomes inactive ; thus, of a platinum wire which sets up a brisk
effervescence,    the part heated has no effect, and the gas only starts

 from the part which has not been heated.         I have made spongy pla
 tinum inactive by plunging it red-hot into boiling water which had
 been for some time kept boiling.
    IV. Solid bodies which have not been in contact with air are
 without action on supersaturated gaseous solutions.
    When a fragment of any salt, soluble or not, is immersed in a su
 persaturated gaseous solution (of alum, for instance, in Seltzer water),
 carbonic acid is disengaged.    Is this effect due to the presence of the
 solid body ? The following experiment shows that it is not.
    A supersaturated solution of alum is prepared and placed in a
 tube ; when it is cooled, Seltzer water is carefully poured on it,
 forming on its surface a distinct layer.     A fine rod is then taken, the
 end of which has touched a piece of alum, and it is dipped through
 the Seltzer water as far as the supersaturated solution of alum ; an
 octahedron of alum forms on the rod and rapidly increases ; on re
 moving it and placing it in Seltzer water, no disengagement of gas
is perceived on its circumference.
    V. Air and gases set up the disengagement of dissolved gases.
    The preceding experiments show that the disengagement of gas is
not to be ascribed to solids.    On the other hand, bodies which have
become inactive by a lengthened stay in water or by the action of
heat, and those which, like the crystal of alum, had not been in con
tact with air, resume the property when they have been in the air for
some time. This result led me to inquire what was the action of air on
the gaseous solution ; and with this view, in a supersaturated aqueous
solution of carbonic acid, I introduced an almost capillary tube, closed
at one end, and inverted like a gas-jar, and containing air.          I had
previously deprived    this tube of  the property    of setting up a disen
gagement of gas.      Immediately after immersion, gas adhered to the
column of air. which the tube contained, forming quickly a large
bubble, which was disengaged; then another was produced, and so
on. The gas formed, then, only at the point where the liquid touched
the column of air.      From this experiment, which I have varied in
several ways, it may be concluded that air sets up the disengagement
of carbonic acid. Now, in the case of supersaturated saline solutions
and of superposed solids, I have proved that a molecule of the sub
stance itself, or one isomorphous with    it,   necessary, in determinate
                                                is
conditions of temperature, for setting up the separation. Was there
here something analogous, and was       it  the carbonic acid of the air
which acted on the aqueous solution     ?   in other words, had the na
ture of the gas any influence on the phenomenon        ?   To clear up this
point varied the gaseous solutions, and used supersaturated so
      I                                              a
lution of nitric oxide along with atmospheric air. Experiment showed
that the phenomenon was still produced, although no trace of nitric
oxide can exist in air.     Hence the nature of the gas does not come
into play in these phenomena, and supersaturated solutions lose their
gas under the influence of any gas-bubbles whatever.
    Now, how   is    that solid bodies which have been exposed to the
                    it
air produce in gaseous solutions the effects they are known to pro.
duce  ?    may be accounted for
          It                      if we remember that solid, whatever
                                                           a

                  Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                    481
the degree of polish which it has received, is covered with roughnesses
forming a sort of network of capillary conduits into which the sur
rounding gases penetrate and condense in quantities which fre
quently are considerable ; and the gas-bubbles thus imprisoned become
the centres to which pass those which are dissolved.              It is observed
that effervescence is more brisk the more numerous the roughnesses
with which the body is covered. Yet this disengagement is not of
indefinite continuance ; for each bubble carries with it a portion of
the gas which has produced its formation : the effect first diminishes,
and then completely ceases.
    The effect of a prolonged contact is well explained by the slow
solution of the condensed gases ; as regards heat, it expels them by
expansion, and immersion in water completes the removal of the gas.
    This action of free gases on those in solution accounts for a certain
number of phenomena. It explains why a current of air rapidly
carries away from a solution all the gas it contains, how also a ga
seous solution exposed to the air gradually becomes impoverished, &c.
     May we not attach to these phenomena the remarkable decompo
sitions of unstable bodies which Th^nard has observed, and studied
 so completely ? The experiments I have made on acid solutions of
 oxygenated water appear to confirm this view.
     I. This solution Joses oxygen in contact with the air or with
 gases.      When it is shaken with air in closed tubes, there is at once
 produced an abundant disengagement of oxygen.                As in the case of
 supersaturated      solutions,  this gas adheres  to  the  air introduced into
 the liquid.
      II. Solids which under ordinary circumstances decompose it
 without themselves undergoing any change lose this property when
 they have been deprived of air by the methods above described. The
 experiment is very striking with platinum wires, which generally
 cause an abundant disengagement of gas ; whereas not a single
 bubble is seen on their surface when they have been heated and then
 plunged into water for some time.           The same effect is obtained with
 spongy platinum ; but the capillary cavities it contains retain the
 interposed gas with more force than platinum wires, and it is more
 difficult to expel the air. — Comptes Rendus, November 19, 1866.
               INDUCTION     EXPERIMENTS.        BY M. L. DANIEL.
      I replace the moveable armatures of Faraday's electromagnet by
  two thick plates of soft iron, which are vertical and so high that
  their ends, which are in the same horizontal plane, just project
  beyond the two coils.        On these two plates, adjusted at a suitable
  distance apart, I place a third, of the same thickness as the first, and
  fixed at the end of an iron bar a metre in length.                Through the
  electromagnet pass I      the current  of [a battery   of  four   Bunsen's   ele
  ments. In the circuit a platinum wire is interposed, the length of
  which is so arranged that it is raised to dull redness. Notwithstand
  ing this resistance the contact is strongly attracted.            If the contact
  be separated by pressing with sufficient force at the end of the lever

which supports it,         the platinum wire is raised to a white heat.
Undoubtedly, by using a greater number of elements and a longer
lever, the platinum wire would be melted. If the contact of the
poles of an electromagnet be suddenly made, the platinum wire be
comes dark again.
    Instead of such an electromagnet I use a coil, in which I introduce
an iron cylinder, or a cylindrical bundle of iron wire, which I then
rapidly remove.          The platinum wire, which had become cooled
while the core was being introduced, became red-hot upon its re
moval.
    A voltameter introduced into the circuit instead of the platinum
wire, shows a less copious disengagement of gas when the magnetiza
 tion is produced, a more copious one when it ceases.
    The explanation of these phenomena is very simple : — When the
 magnetization is produced there is developed in the exciting current
 of the electromagnet an induction current which is inverse ; when
 magnetization ceases, another induction current, a direct one, tra
 verses the same exciting current, which in both cases is closed.
     My object in publishing this note is to add a simple experiment,
 easy to reproduce, to the numerous ones by which it can be esta
 blished that all work consumes heat, and that, inversely, all work can
 be converted into heat.
    To break the contact of the electromagnet, or the iron cylinder
 of the coil, a resistance which is opposed to their motion must be
 overcome, a certain amount of work is then consumed ; the platinum
 wire becoming more strongly heated indicates a production of heat in
 the entire interpolar circuit.       If, on the contrary, I bring the cy
linder into the coil, if I bring near the armatures of the electro
 magnet the soft-iron contact, the current produces external work ;
 the wire joining the- poles is cooled. — Comptes Rendus, Feb. 25,

 TRANSPORT        OF A BODY     BY THE VOLTAIC CURRENT AND BY          IN
                   DUCTION CURRENTS.         BY M. DANIEL.
    This action of electricity and its direction may be shown by the
following experiment : —
    If water be electrolyzed in a vessel the bottom of which is to
lerably large and somewhat bulging in the centre, and into which a
globule of mercury has been allowed to fall, this globule is seen to
move away at the approach of the positive electrode ; by suitably
moving this, a continuous rotatory motion may be imparted to the
mercury.        This observation has led to the following simple experi
ments : —
    I  fill with very slightly acidulated water a tube more or less
long, bent twice at right angles, and with a diameter of 10 to 15
millims.      It resembles a water-level. In the liquid is placed a
globule     of  mercury 2 to 3 centims. in length, and in the vertical
branches of the tube the electrodes of a battery are immersed.         By

                  Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.           483
means of the globule of mercury the apparatus may be easily
levelled.
     As soon as the current passes, the globule elongates and begins
to move ; it goes from the positive to the negative pole.          If, by
means of a commutator, the direction of the current be inverted,
the globule stops, and immediately resumes its march, always,
however, from the positive to the negative pole. By suitably
manipulating the commutator, an oscillating motion may be im
parted to the entire mass of the mercury.
     The globule thus acted upon by the current differs in appearance
at the two ends : it is brilliant at the positive electrode, and tar
nished towards the negative one.           This arises from the circum
 stance that, like the whole liquid column, it is polarized, and has
 negative tension at one end and positive at the other.         Oxide of
 mercury, formed during the experiment, is carried to the negative
 end, and is reduced, at any rate partially, by the hydrogen which is
 produced at the same time.       If the liquid contains too much acid,
 a salt is formed, which diminishes the transparence of the column,
 and bubbles of hydrogen are disengaged. When the direction, of
 the current is changed, the kind of veil which covers one end of the
 globule changes its position and passes to the other end ; there is
 still a carriage of matter, indicating a mechanical action in the con
 trary direction to that which produces the motion of the mercury ;
 but on the globule this moves still from the positive towards the
 negative end.
     Four Bunsen's elements are sufficient for the experiment, if a
 tube of 40 to 50 centims. in length be used.          With twenty-four
 elements a long column of mercury can be moved in a tube a metre
 in length. A current of fifty elements imparts to this column too
 considerable a velocity ; it divides into globules, all of them moving
  in the same direction.
      The tube being inclined, the mercury may even move from the
 lower to the upper part of the tube. The weight of the mercury
 being known, a tolerably correct idea can be formed of the force of
  that portion of the current which traverses the globule.      If the in
  clination be gradually increased, a point is attained at which equili
  brium is established between the force of the current which tends
  to raise the mercury, and the action of gravity which tends to make
  it descend ; the globule does not move, but it remains elongated ; it
  has always an internal motion, and frequently turns upon itself,
  first in one direction, and then in another.
      The same experiment may be made by means of Ruhmkorff's
  coil ; but as its currents are alternately in opposite directions, an
  interruption must be made, so as to suppress the inverse current.
  The circuit traversed by the direct current consists then of me
  tallic wires, of a layer of air, and a column of liquid.     When the
  apparatus works, the globule of mercury begins to move ; it marches
  by starts, the more marked the less frequent the breaks, and it
   always goes from the positive towards the negative pole ; it is
   always brilliant at one end and tarnished at the other.

s 484            Intelligence and Miscellaneous    Articles.
      If the two currents of the bobbin are used, the globule does not
  stir ; it is merely agitated by a very energetic vibratory mo
  tion. The mercury is then brilliant at its two ends, and the tar
  nished part of it exists in the^ middle. This arises from the fact
  that each end is alternately positive and negative.        When oxide is
  formed by the direct current at the anterior part of the globule,
  the hydrogen, which the inverse current brings there, immediately
  reduces this oxide.
      It may happen that the globule is displaced even if traversed by
  alternate currents ; but this phenomenon is not frequent, and is not
  easily produced at will.      The motion in this case is due to the
  difference in the action of the two currents : the break working at
  its maximum speed, the direct current passes entirely ; but the
  inverse current, whose duration is longer, is only partially dis
  charged.
      With a powerful coil it is easy to put a mass of mercury even
  into rapid motion along the entire length of a tube 1 -50 metre in
  length.     If the spark which breaks in the air is too short, the mer
  cury vibrates without undergoing any motion of translation ; the
  inverse current has then sufficient tension to overcome the resist
  ance of the layer of air.
      It is important to observe that the transport of mercury is easier by
  induction-currents of high tension than by the voltaic current.     If we
   take a battery incapable of producing a motion of translation, but
  sufficient to polarize the mercury (which is easily recognized by the
  aspect of the mercury), the current of this battery sent into an in
   duction-coil transforms it into an induction-coil powerful enough
   to impart considerable velocity to the mercury.        A powerful mag
   neto-electrical machine arranged for effects of quantity may serve
   to illustrate the same phenomenon ; but the experiment only suc
   ceeds with a short tube, say of 30 to 40 centims.
       Conductivity of the matter carried is one of the conditions ne
   cessary for motion ; a globule of sulphuret of carbon introduced
   into the liquid column is insensible to the passage of the current.
       In this experiment it is a mechanical action exerted by the cur
   rent which produces the motion of translation (whether it emanates
   from the positive electrode, or is formed at the surface of separa
   tion of the water and the mercury, owing to their difference of con
   ductivity) ; the pressure of the hydrogen which may be disen
   gaged at the negative end of the globule is of no account in
   effecting the phenomenon : when the experiment is well made, an
   inappreciable amount of gas is disengaged ; and if there is much, the
   globule either does not move at all or moves very slowly.         More
   over, into the mercury at its negative extremity a knob of amalga
   mated copper may be introduced : the mercury sticks to it ; hydro
  gen is disengaged upon this knob, which remains at rest, but the
  lower part of the globule becomes detached and begins to move
   if the current is strong enough. — Comptes Rendus, March 18,

HITHERTO,
    the assumption has been           made that the components of
the velocity of each element of the fluid in three directions at
right angles to each other are the differential coefficients, with
reference to the coordinates, of a definite function which we shall
call the velocity-potential.   Lagrangef no doubt has shown that
this assumption is lawful if the motion of the fluid has been pro
duced by, and continued under, the action of forces which have a
potential ; and also that the influence of moving solids which are
in contact with the fluid does not affect the lawfulness of the
assumption.      And, since the greater number of natural forces
which can be denned with mathematical strictness can be ex
pressed as differential coefficients of a potential, by far the greater
number of mathematically investigable cases of fluid-motion
belong to the class in which a velocity-potential exists.
   Yet EulerJ has distinctly pointed out that there are cases of
fluid-motion in which no velocity-potential exists, — for instance,
the rotation of a fluid about an axis when every element has the
same angular velocity.      Among the forces which can produce
such motions may be named magnetic attractions acting upon a
fluid conducting electric currents, and particularly friction,
whether among the elements of the fluid or against fixed bodies.
The effect of fluid friction has not hitherto been mathematically
defined ; yet it is very great, and, except in the case of indefi
nitely small oscillations, produces most marked differences be
tween theory and fact.       The difficulty of defining this effect,
and of finding expressions for its measurement, mainly con-

sisted in the fact that no idea had been formed of the species of
motion which friction produces in fluids.      Hence it appeared to
me to be of importance to investigate the species of motion for
which there is no velocity-potential.
    The following investigation shows that when there is a velo
city-potential the elements of the fluid have no rotation, but
that there is at least a portion of the fluid elements in rotation
 when there is no velocity-potential.
    By vortex-lines (Wirbellinien) I denote lines drawn through
the fluid so as at every point to coincide with the instantaneous
axis of rotation of the corresponding fluid element.
                                               I
    By vortex-filaments (Wirbelfaden) denote portions of the fluid
bounded by vortex-lines drawn through every point of the boun
 dary of an infinitely small closed curve.
    The investigation shows that, if all the forces which act on the
fluid have a potential, —
    1. No element of the fluid which was not originally in rota
tion is made to rotate.
    2. The elements which at any time belong to one vortex-line,
however they may be translated, remain on one vortex-line.
    3. The product of the section and the angular velocity of an
infinitely thin vortex-filament is constant throughout its whole
length, and retains the same value during all displacements of the
filament.    Hence vortex-filaments must either be closed curves,
or must have their ends in the bounding surface of the fluid.
    This last theorem enables us to determine the angular velocity
when the form of the vortex- filament at different times is given.
Besides, there is given a solution of the problem of finding
the velocities of the fluid elements at any instant, if at that in
stant the angular velocities are given : an arbitrary function,
however, remains undetermined,      and is to be applied to satisfy
the boundary conditions.
   This last example leads to a remarkable analogy between the
vortex-motion of fluids and the electro-magnetic action of elec
tric currents.        If,

vortex-filament and the angular velocity.
    I   shall therefore frequently avail myself of the analogy of
magnetic masses or electric currents, simply to give a briefer and
more vivid representation of quantities which are just such func
tions of the coordinates as the attractive forces exerted by these
masses or currents on       a  magnetic  particle, or the corresponding
potential functions.
    By means of these theorems the various species of fluid-
motion which arc concealed in the yet unstudied integrals of
the hydrodynamical equations can at least be represented, even
although the complete integration is possible only in a few of
the simplest eases — as when we have one or two straight or cir
cular vortex-filaments in a mass of fluid which is either infinite in
all directions or bounded in one direction by an infinite plane.
    It can be shown that straight parallel vortex-filaments, in a fluid
mass which is limited only by planes perpendicular to the fila
ments, revolve about their common centre of gravity, if we deter
 mine this point by employing the angular velocity as we would the
 density of a mass.       The position of the centre of gravity remains
unaltered.        On the other hand, in the case of circular vortex-fila
 ments which are all perpendicular to a common axis, the centre
of gravity of their section moves on parallel to the axis.

     A.t a point x, y, z in a liquid let p be the pressure, u, v, w the
 rectangular components of the velocity, X, Y, Z the components
 of external forces acting on unit of mass, and h the density
  (whose variations will be supposed indefinitely small), all at
 time t.      Then we have the following known equations of motion
 for the interior particles of the fluid : —

conditions, we may consider the changes undergone              an inde                by
finitely small volume of the fluid during the time dt as com
pounded of three separate motions.          1st.    translation of the     A
whole in space. 2nd. An expansion or contraction of the whole
parallel to three dilatation-axes, so that any rectangular paral
lelepiped whose edges are parallel to these axes may remain
rectangular, while its edges alter their length but remain pa
rallel to their original directions.     3rd. A rotation about some
instantaneous    axis, which, as we know, may be considered as
the resultant of three rotations about the axes of coordinates.
    If the conditions         are fulfilled at

At the end of the time dt, the projections of the distance be
tween the two elements of fluid, which at the beginning of dt
limited the line qe, have values which by the aid of (3) may be
thus written  : —
                    «f+(«|-«)<ft««(f+          |^*),
                    ei) + (v1—v)dt=e(r)+ |^ dtj,
                    e^+(w1"w)dt=e(^+           || dt).
The left-hand sides of these equations give the projections of the
new position of the joining line qe, the right-hand the projec
tions of the new velocity of rotation, multiplied by the constant
factor e.   It follows from these equations that the joining line
between the elements, which at the commencement of dt limited
the portion qe of the instantaneous       axis, also after the lapse of
dt coincides with the altered axis of rotation.
   If we call vortex-line a line Whose direction coincides every
where with the instantaneous         axis of rotation of the there-
situated element of fluid as above described, we can enunciate
the above theorem in the following manner : —Each vortex-line
remains continually composed of the same elements of fluid, and
swims forward with them in the fluid.
   The rectangular components of the angular velocity vary di
rectly as the projections of the portion qe of the axis of rotation ;
it follows from this that the magnitude of the resultant angular
velocity in a defined element varies in the same proportion as the
distance between this and its neighbour along the axis of rotation.
    Conceive that vortex-lines are drawn through every point in
the circumference of any indefinitely small surface ; there will
thus be set apart in the fluid a filament of indefinitely small section
which we shall call vortex-filament.       The volume of a portion of
such a filament bounded by two given fluid elements, which (by
the preceding propositions) remains filled by the same element of
fluid, must in the motion remain constant, and its section must
therefore vary inversely as its length.        Hence the last theorem
may be stated as follows :   —  The product of the section and the an

    Thus in the vortex-motion of fluids, as in electromagnetic
effects, the velocities or forces external to the vortex-filaments (or
electric-current-penetrated    space) depend upon potential functions
with more values than one, which satisfy the general differential
equation of magnetic potential functions         while within tbe vor

                                           electric currents, velocities

                     those functions which appear in the equations

fluid-motion and magnetic forces we have to do with potential
functions with only one value, just as in the cases of gravitation,
electric attractions, and constant currents of heat and electricity.
    The latter integrals of the hydrodynamical equations, in which
a  single-valued velocity-potential exists, we may call integrals                  of
the first class   those, on the other hand, where there
                    ;                                          rotation  is

                             of            It may occur that in the
latter case only such portions of space are to be treated in the
example as contain no rotating elements,— for instance, the mo
tion of fluids iu ring-shaped vessels, where vortex-filament may a
be supposed to lie along the axis of the vessel, and where the pro

blem belongs to those which can be solved by the assumption of
a  velocity-potential.
    In the hydrodynamic integrals of the first class the velocities
of the fluid elements are in the direction of, and proportional to,
the forces which a determinate magnetic distribution outside the
fluid would exert on a magnetic particle in the places of the
elements.
    In the hydrodynamic integrals of the second class the veloci
ties of the fluid elements are in the direction of, and proportional
to, the forces which would act on a particle of magnetism if
closed electric currents passed through the vortex-filaments with a
density proportional to the angular velocity in these filaments,
combined with magnetic masses outside the fluid.         The electric
currents inside the fluid must move with their respective vortex-
filaments and have constant intensity. The assumed distribution
of magnetic matter outside or at the surface of the fluid must be
taken so as to satisfy the conditions at the surface.      Eacb mag
netic mass can also, as we know, be replaced by electric currents.
Thus, instead of using for the values of u, v, w the potential-
function P of an external mass k, we get quite as general a solu
tion if we give      r), and f outside of, or at the bounding surface
of, the fluid any values such that only closed current-filaments
exist; and then the integration in (5 a) must be extended to all
space in which £, rj, and    f are different from zero.
                                   §4,
    In hydrodynamic integrals of the first class it is sufficient, as
I  have shown above, to know the motion of the surface.       By this
the whole motion in the interior is determined.        In integrals of
the second class, on the other hand, the motion of the vortex-
filaments in the interior of the fluid must be found with reference
to their mutual action, and with attention to the conditions at the
surface, by which the problem becomes much more complicated.
Even this problem can be solved in certain simple cases — namely,
when rotation of the fluid elements takes place only in known
surfaces or lines, and the form of these surfaces or lines remains
unchanged during the motion.
    The properties of surfaces bounded by an indefinitely thin
sheet of rotating elements can be easily deduced from (5 a).        If
f, rj, % differ from zero only in an indefinitely thin sheet, their
potential functions L, M, N will, by known theorems, have equal
values on both sides of the sheet ; but their differential coeffi
cients, taken in the direction of the normal to the sheet, will be
different.     Suppose the coordinate axes so placed that at the
point of the vortex-sheet we are considering the axis of z is the
normal to the sheet, and that of x the axis of rotation of the

differential coefficients have the same value at both sides. Such
is also the case with

values, whose difference is 2fe, if e denote the thickness of the
sheet.    Consequently equations (4) show that u and w have
the same values on both sides of the vortex-surface,       but the
values of v differ by 2f e.  Hence the values of that component of
the velocity which is a tangent to the vortex-surface and at right
angles to the vortex-lines differ on opposite sides of the surface.
Within the sheet of revolving elements we must take this com
ponent of the velocity as gradually and equably varying from
one value to the other.     For if            f
                                      is here constant through the
whole thickness of the shell, and a represent a proper fraction,

distance ae from the first side, we saw that       — = 2fe, while

                             vx=2^eu
the above result.   As we must consider the revolving elements
as being themselves moved, and the change of their distribu
tion on the surface depends on their motion, we must assign as
their mean velocity along the surface for the whole thickness of
the sheet the arithmetical mean of     and vv     v'
   Such vortex-sheet will be produced
           a                                  two separate moving

masses of fluid come in contact.   At the surface of contact the
velocity perpendicular to this must be the same for both, but the
tangential velocities will   general be different in the two. Thus
                                   in
the surface of contact will have the properties of     vortex-sheet.

   Hence in general isolated vortex-filaments cannot be supposed
indefinitely thin, since otherwise the velocities at opposite sides
would be indefinitely great and in opposite directions, and the
proper velocity of the filament would remain undetermined.        To
obtain, therefore, certain general conclusions about the motion
of very fine filaments of any section, we must make use of the prin
ciple of the conservation    vis viva.

                Straight parallel Vortex-filaments.
    We shall first consider the case where only straight vortex-
filaments, parallel to the axis of z, exist, whether in an indefinitely
extended mass of fluid, or in a similar mass limited by two infi
nite planes perpendicular to the filaments, which comes to the
same thing. All the motions are then confined to planes perpendi
cular to the axis of z, and are exactly the same in all such planes.
    We put therefore

By the remark at the end of § 3 we put P=0.                                         The equation of
current lines is thus N= constant.
   N is in this case the potential function of indefinitely long
lines ; and is infinitely great, but its differential coefficients are
finite.   Let a and b be the coordinates of a vortex-filament
whose section is da db, we have
                                      rfN        tyladb           x—a

and so for other pairs in each sum.         But U is the velocity of
the centre of gravity of the masses m,, m2, ... in the direction
of x multiplied by the sum of these masses ; so of V in the di
rection of y.   Both velocities are thus zero, unless the sum of
the masses be zero, in which case there is no centre of gravity.
The centre of gravity of the vortex-filaments remains, therefore,
stationary during their motions about one another; and since
this is true for any distribution of vortex-filaments, it will also be
true of isolated ones of indefinitely small section.
   From this we derive the following consequences : —
   1. If there be a single rectilinear vortex-filament of indefinitely
small section in a fluid infinite in all directions perpendicular to
it it,
    the motion of an element of the fluid at finite distance from
   depends only on the product (i-dadb =            of the velocity of m)
rotation and the section, not on the form of that section.        The
elements of the fluid revolve about         with tangential velocity
                                                             it
 = —       >     where    r     is    the distance from the centre of gravity
                                                                      °       of the
         TIT                                                                          '
filament. The position of the centre of gravity, the angular velo
city, the area of the section, and therefore, of course, the magni
tude m remain unaltered, even          the form of the indefinitely
                                                        if
small section may alter.
    2. If there be two rectilinear vortex-filaments of indefinitely
small section in an unlimited fluid, each will cause the other to
move in       direction perpendicular to the line joining them.
                     a
Thus the length of this joining line will not be altered.        They
will thus turn about their common centre of gravity at constant
distances from it.     If the rotation be in the same direction for
both (that      of the same sign) their centre of gravity lies be
                         is,
tween them. If in opposite directions (that       of different signs), is,
their centre of gravity lies in the line joining them produced.
And      in addition, the product of the velocity and the section
               if,
be the same for both, so that the centre of gravity         at an infi           is

  Prof. Helmholtz      on    Integrals expressing Vortex-motion.           505
nite distance, they travel forwards with equal velocity, and in
parallel directions perpendicular to the line joining them.
    To this last case may also be referred that in which a vortex-
filament of indefinitely small section moves near an infinite plane
to which it is parallel.  The condition at the limits (viz. that
the fluid must move parallel to the plane) will be fulfilled if in
stead of the plane there be an infinite mass of fluid with another
vortex-filament the image (with respect to the plane) of the first.
From this it follows that the vortex-filament moves parallel to the
plane in the direction in which the elements of the fluid between
it and the plane move, and with one-fourth of the velocity which
the elements at the foot of a perpendicular from the filament on
the plane have.
   With rectilinear vortex-filaments the assumption of an indefi
nitely small section leads to no inadmissible consequences, since
each filament exerts upon itself no displacing action, and is only
displaced by the action of other filaments which may be present.
It is different with curved filaments.
                   § 6. Circular Vortex-filaments.
    Let there exist in an infinite mass of fluid only circular vortex -
fllaments whose planes are parallel to that of xy, and whose centres
are in the axis of z, so that all is symmetrical about that axis.
Let us change the coordinates by assuming

                                 the above assumption,       function

   510      Prof. Helmholtz on Integrals expressing Vortex-motion.
   the outer side of the ring is in the direction oiz positive, on the
   inner side in the direction of z negative ; K, h, and R are from
   their nature necessarily positive.
      Hence in a circular vortex-filament of very small section in an in
  definitely extended fluid, the centre of gravity of the section has, from
  the commencement, an approximately constant and very great velocity
 parallel to the axis of the vortex-ring , and this is directed towards the
  side to which the fluid flows through the ring.         Indefinitely thin
  vortex-filaments of finite radius would have indefinitely great velo
  city of translation.     But if the radius be indefinitely great, of the
  order  —
            , then R2 is indefinitely great compared with         K,  and  I
 becomes constant.         The vortex-filament, which has now become
 rectilinear, becomes stationary, as we have already proved for
  the case of such filaments.
     We can now see generally how two ring-formed vortex-filaments
 having the same axis would mutually affect each other, since
 each, in addition to its proper motion, has that of its elements
 of fluid as produced by the other.         If they have the same direc
 tion of rotation, they travel in the same direction ; the foremost
 widens and travels more slowly, the pursuer shrinks and travels
 faster, till finally, if their velocities are not too different, it over
 takes the first and penetrates it.        Then the same game goes on
 in the opposite order, so that the rings pass through each other
 alternately.
     If they have equal radii and equal and opposite angular velo
 cities, they will approach each other and widen one another;
 so that finally, when they are very near each other, their velo
 city of approach becomes smaller and smaller, and their rate of
widening faster and faster.          If they are perfectly symmetrical,
the velocity of fluid elements midway between them parallel
to [the axis is zero.         Here, then, we might imagine a rigid
plane     to  be inserted,   which   would not disturb the motion, and
so obtain the case of a vortex-ring which encounters a fixed
plane.
     In addition it    may be noticed that it is easy in nature to
study    these   motions   of circular vortex-rings, by drawing rapidly
for a short space along the surface of a fluid a half-immersed
circular disk, or the nearly semicircular point of a spoon, and
quickly withdrawing it. There remain in the fluid half vortex-
rings whose axis is in the free surface.         The free surface forms a
bounding plane       of the  fluid  through  the  axis, and thus there is
no essential change in the motion.             These vortex-rings travel
on, widen when they come to a wall, and are widened or con
tracted by other vortex-rings, exactly as we have deduced from
theory.

    The above version of one of the most important recent investiga
tions in mathematical physics was made long ago for my own use,
and does not pretend to be an exact translation.           Professor Helm
holtz has been kind enough to revise it ; and it may therefore be ac
cepted as representing the spirit of the original.         A portion of the
contents of the paper had been anticipated by Professor Stokes in
various excellent papers in the Cambridge Philosophical Transac
tions ; but the discovery of the nature and motions of vortex-fila
ments is entirely novel, and of great consequence. Sir W, Thomson
has recently propounded a very singular speculation as to the ulti
mate nature of matter, mainly founded on the properties of the Helm
holtz ring. I append an extract from a letter I have just received
from him, which fills an important gap towards the end of Professor
Helmholtz's work.— P. G. Tait.
    '*
       Following as nearly as may be Helmholtz's notation, let g be
the radius of the circular axis of a uniform vortex- ring, and a the
radius of the section of its core (which will be approximately circular
when a is small in comparison with g), the vortex motion being so
instituted that there is no molecular rotation in any part of the fluid
exterior to this core, and that in the core the angular velocity of
the molecular rotation is approximately w, or rigorously
                                      9
for any fluid particle at distance ^ from .the straight axis.
    " I find that the velocity of translation is approximately equal to
(quantities of the same order as this multiplied by —being neglected.)
    " The velocity of the liquid at the surface of the core is approxi
mately constant and equal to wa.         At the centre of the ring it is
  9
   " If  these be denoted   by Q and W respectively,       and  if T be the
velocity   of translation, we  therefore have
    " Hence   the velocity of translation is very large in comparison  with

 512        Prof. De la Rive on    the  Action of Magnetism upon
  the fluid velocity along the axis through the centre of the ring, when
 the section is so small that log          is large in comparison with 2jt.
                                       a
 But the velocity of translation     is always small in comparison with
 the velocity of the fluid at the surface of the core, and the more so
 the smaller is the diameter of the section in comparison with the
 diameter of the ring.
     " These results remove completely the difficulty which has hitherto
 heen felt with reference to the translation of infinitely thin vortex-
 filaments.     I have only succeeded in obtaining them since the com
 munication of my mathematical paper (April 29, 1867) to the Royal
  Society of Edinburgh, but hope to be allowed to add a proof of them
 to that paper should it be accepted for the Transactions."

 quent publication the investigation of the manner in which this
 propagation is modified by the action of magnetism.                 I demon
 strated the existence of this action as early as 1849, by showing
 that a magnetic pole causes jets of electricity which escape from
 it radially to rotate.     M. Pliicker subsequently proved by seve
 ral remarkable experiments that this action is general.                  The
 luminous veins which show themselves in rarefied gases traversed
 by the discharges of a Ruhmkorft's apparatus are in fact attracted
 and repelled in the same way as electric currents passing along
 metallic wires would be. In a word, this action is subject to
 the laws of electrodynamics, with the difference, however, that,
 all the parts of the moveable conductor being independent of
 each other instead of being connected together as they are in a
rigid wire, they obey perfectly the forces by which they are soli
 cited, and take up positions of equilibrium determined by these
forces.      It follows that each luminous vein assumes the form of
a magnetic curve, the only condition under which equilibrium
can be produced, since the action of the magnet upon an element
of the current is then nothing, the direction of this action be-

coming perpendicular to that of an element when the latter is          a
tangent to the magnetic curve.
    On the present occasion, my object is to investigate with
greater detail the influence exerted by magnetism on electricity
when traversing rarefied gases.        My researches comprise two
series of experiments : —  first, those in which the electromagnet,
which is the source of the magnetic action, is placed outside the
rarefied gas through which the electric discharge passes ; and
secondly, those in which the magnetized soft iron is situated
within the gas itself.
   § 1. Experiments in which     the electromagnet is placed outside
                           the rarefied gas.
    One of the simplest cases is when a glass tube containing the
rarefied gas through which the electric discharges are passing is
placed either axially or equatorially with regard to the poles of
a strong electromagnet.       When care has been taken to rarefy
highly   the gas which transmits   the electric discharge, the follow
ing appearances present themselves : — The portions of the dis
charge subject to the magnetic action are squeezed up against
the sides of the tube at the parts nearest or furthest from the
poles of the magnet, according to the direction of the discharge
and the position of the poles ; the stria? at the same time become
much narrower and more brilliant.       If the part of the tube near the
electromagnet is that containing the negative electrode, the dark
space immediately becomes luminous and presents narrow bright
striae, just as the constantly luminous part of the discharge,
which seems to advance, would do.             At the same time the
bluish photosphere surrounding the negative knob diminishes
in thickness by at least one-half and becomes more brilliant, and
the sort of bluish sheath which surrounded the metallic stem
at whose extremity the negative electrode is placed, disappears
entirely. The whole of this bluish atmosphere becomes con
centrated about the knob.       It seems that all the gaseous veins,
which may be regarded as so many conductors of the discharge,
instead of radiating from all points of the negative knob and
stem and spreading out through the whole gaseous mass as far
as the positive electrode, when the magnetic action is exerted
upon them radiate only from the negative knob and are con
densed against either one side of the tube or the other, until they
arrive at that part of their course where the action becomes in
sensible and they accordingly resume their normal position.
This condensation explains why the part of the discharge which
was dark, because the gas was there so greatly rarefied, becomes
luminous, and why the part which was already luminous becomes
narrower and more brilliant, while the stride which it exhibits
                                                                         y

514       Prof. De la Hive on      the  Action of Magnetism upon
approach closer together.          The action of the magnet produces
the same effect as would be caused by a local increase in the
density of the rarefied gaseous matter.                  It is not necessary,
however, that the action of the magnet should be exerted exactly
upon the dark part in order that it may become luminouB ; it
becomes so equally even when the magnetism acts upon a dif
ferent part of the discharge, provided that this is not too far
removed from the negative electrode.
    A consequence of the explanation that we have just given,
which is easily verified experimentally, is that the portion of the
gas which transmits the discharge must have a lower conductivity
when it is subject to the action of the magnet, and therefore
that the electric discharge must encounter a greater total resist
ance in its passage along the inside of the tube, when any part
of the tube is brought near the electromagnet, than it did before.
    Thus a tube, 1 metre long, filled with rarefied hydrogen, gave
the following results when the apparatus for producing a derived
current * was placed in the circuit : —

    The effects are more marked when the tubes are placed equa-
torially between two soft-iron armatures in immediate contact
   * It should not be forgotten that with this apparatus (a description of
which is given in my previous paper) the derived current is nearly propor
tional to the principal current ; so that its intensity may be taken as being
very approximately a measure of that of the discharge which traverses the
tube.

   the  Electric Discharge in highly Rarefied Gaseous Media.        515
with the sides of the tube, than when they are placed axially
upon the poles themselves.      It will be seen that there is a much
greater increase of resistance when the magnetism acts on the
part of the discharge near the negative electrode, than when it
acts on the part near the positive electrode.        This difference is
caused by the fact that, as was shown in my previous paper, the
former part has much the higher conductivity, and therefore
naturally undergoes a much greater diminution in conducting-
power by the condensation of the gaseous matter caused by the
action of the magnet, than it is possible for the second part,
where the gas is less rarefied, to undergo.       The inversion of the
poles of the magnet makes no difference in the foregoing results ;
its only effect is to cause an elevation or depression of the dis
charge, which is horizontal when the magnet is not in action.
   Among the experiments that       I have made upon the influence
of the external action of magnetism upon rarefied gases enclosed
in tubes,   I may still mention some in which the tube was coiled
up into a flat spiral terminated by two prolongations, perpendi
cular to the plane of the spiral, which serve for the introduction
and rarefaction of the gas, as well as for the passage of the elec
tric discharges.     The tube of the spiral, and its prolongations, is
a little less than a centimetre in diameter, and its entire length is
about 80 centims.      With nitrogen or atmospheric air, the rare
faction must be carried at least as far as 2 millims. in order that
the discharges may pass ; with hydrogen, the discharge passes
when the pressure is reduced to 5 or 6 millims.              Moreover,
whatever may be the nature of the gas or its degree of rarefac
tion, the discharge does not begin to pass until several minutes
after the gas is put into the circuit.     It evidently requires to be
charged for a long time with statical electricity before the resist
ance to the establishment of a continuous discharge can be over
come.      But when once this resistance has been overcome, the
passage of the discharge may be interrupted without its being
necessary to wait more than an instant before it begins again
when the circuit is completed a second time, provided that the in
terruption does not last for more than one or two hours.            The
luminous discharge through hydrogen under a pressure or 5 or
6 millims. exhibits very fine and sharp rose-coloured            striae ;
under a pressure of 2 millims. they become much broader and
less sharp, and the colour at . the same time becomes paler.        The
same thing happens with air and nitrogen ; but the effects are
most distinct with hydrogen.       A remarkable appearance is pre
sented by the discharge in the interior of the spiral ; it seems to
possess a very distinct rotatory motion, the direction of which
appears to change with the direction of the discharge : this
latter result, however, is not very constant ; so that I have been

516        Prof. De la Rive          on the   Action of Magnetism upon
led to conclude that the rotation is only apparent, and is the
effect of an optical delusion caused by the discontinuity of the
discharge.   This point is nevertheless worthy of further inves
tigation.
   In order to observe the action of magnetism on the spiral dis
charge, I place the glass spiral between the two poles of the
electromagnet, so that its plane is parallel to those of the two
polar surfaces, the two prolongations of the spiral being thus
vertical, one above and the other below this plane.            The mag
netization, according to its direction, either causes a condensa
tion of the discharge against the inside walls of the spiral tube,
or, on the other hand, repels it towards the outer walls and
makes it very diffuse.       In the former case the discharge is very
brilliant, and the stratifications are strongly marked; in the second
case they are hardly visible, and the discharge itself is much
broader and very dull.      It seems to undergo, even more distinctly
than before, the rotatory motion of which we have already spoken.
A rather curious fact          is,
                              that in the vertical branch of the tube
which   is  below the spiral, and which           consequently between
                                                          is
the two branches of the electromagnet, the discharge divides,
under the influence of the magnetism, into two veins, one of
which goes to one side of the tube, and the other to the other.
One of these veins        very narrow, and of very little brilliance
                          is
compared     with the other.     This separation      most likely due to
                                                               is
the fact that the induced current of            Ruhmkorff's apparatus
                                                         a
consists in reality, as we have already said, of two induced cur
rents successively in opposite directions, one of which has                      a
                                                                                     '
much greater tension than the other and passes almost alone
through the gas, whereas the other              transmitted with great

                                              in is of
tion, it    true) since the action
           is     ,                       the magnet separates     from     it
the principal discharge, which           in general the only one that
we are called upon to consider            phenomena of this kind, in
consequence of its much greater strength.
I     endeavoured to determine, in the case of the spiral tube, as
I  had done with the large straight tube, the influence of mag
netization upon the resistance of the gas to the passage of the
discharge   ; and the result that         obtained was rather curious.

reduced to 15° when the dischavge was repelled against the outside
walls of the tube, assuming an apparent rotatory motion ; while,
on the other hand, it rose to 25° when the discharge was con
densed against the inside walls of the spiral.  It requires further
investigation to decide whether this effect of the direction of the
current and of the magnetization depends on the particular
form given to the discharge, or on the small diameter of the
tube in comparison with its length.
§ 2. Experiments in which the electromagnet was placed in the
  middle of the rarefied gas, inside the vessel in which the latter
  was contained.
     I now pass on to the case in which the magnetic pole is within
the gas which transmits the discharge.       In my first experiments
I   used a glas3 globe, about 15 centims. in diameter, provided
with four tubulures situated respectively at the ends of two diame
ters of the globe perpendicular to each other.       Two cylindrical
rods of soft iron were fixed, by means of two of these tubulures,
inside the globe, and in the direction of the same diameter, so
that their inner ends were about 8 or 10 centims. apart, while
their outer ends projected nearly 2 centims. from the tubulure.
In order to convert the internal ends into two magnetic poles,
the outer ends were put in contact with the poles of a strong
electromagnet.       The other two tubulures served to introduce
into the inside of the globe two isolated metallic stems termi
nated by balls, placed at about 10 centims. from each other,
which acted as electrodes for the electric discharge, the direction
of which was thus equatorial, or perpendicular to the straight
line joining the magnetic poles.       As long as the soft-iron rods
 are not magnetized, the electric discharge remains perfectly rec
 tilinear ; but as soon as magnetization takes place the discharge,
 which we will suppose horizontal, takes the form of a semicircle,
 passing either above or below the line joining the magnetic
 poles, according to the direction of the magnetization        and to
 that of the current.     The form  of the luminous  arc  is that of a
 half ring, much flattened and widened; the stria? are very di
  stinctly marked in      more so than they were in the straight dis

                   a                                                    If
 the electric discharge, instead of being equatorial,   axial, that

   518    ¦ Prof. De la Rive on   the Action of Magnetism upon
   iron ball may be observed to be depressed or elevated at the
   moment of magnetization : this movement evidently depends on
   a change of direction on the part of the electric fibres which
   radiate from the ball.
       But the best way of studying the action of magnetism in the
   case of a magnetized bar placed inside the gas, is to use a bell-
   glass or cylindrical jar, 16 centims. in diameter by 20 centims.
   in height, in the axis of which is placed a soft-iron rod about 3
   centims. in diameter, terminated by a rounded end situated at
   the middle of the axis of the cylinder.     This rod is fixed into a
   round disk, which serves to close the jar.    A metallic ring, about
   12 centims. in diameter, made of wire about 3 or 4 millims. in
   thickness, is situated in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the
  jar, in such a position that the top of the soft-iron rod is at its
   centre ; this ring is soldered to a stem covered with an insula
  ting coating, through which it is put in communication with one
  of the poles of a Ruhmkorff's apparatus, the other pole of which
  is connected outside the jar with the end of the soft-iron rod. The
  whole of that portion of the rod which extends into the jar being
  covered with an insulating coating, except the extremity, the
  discharge passes between this extremity and the ring of which it
  is the centre.    In order to magnetize the soft-iron rod, it is only
  necessary to put it in contact, by its outside end, with one pole
  of the electromagnet, a thin sheet of india-rubber being put be
  tween, so that the whole apparatus may be well insulated.
      The cylindrical jar is closed at the other end also, where there
 is no iron rod, and is furnished with two stopcocks, one of which
  serves for introducing and rarefying the gas, while the other,
 being constructed in the way devised by Gay-Lussac, allows of
 the introduction into the jar of a greater or less quantity of any
 vapour.
     I  made a very large number of experiments with this jar, fill
 ing it successively with air, nitrogen, and hydrogen at various
 degrees of rarefaction, and employing these gases sometimes
 perfectly dry, and sometimes mixed with larger or smaller pro
 portions of water- or alcohol-vapour.
     Dry atmospheric air and nitrogen give almost identical results,
the only difference being that the light is brighter and more
 distinct with nitrogen.       If the soft iron is made the positive
electrode and the ring the negative electrode, at a certain degree
of rarefaction the luminous discharge is seen to form a sort of
peach-red envelope round the top of the soft iron, and a pale
violet sheath extends over a greater or less number of degrees
of the ring. At a very low pressure this sheath surrounds the
whole ring, while the top of the soft-iron rod is enveloped by a
rose-coloured     halo,  and a very short jet of the     same   colour,

    the Electric Discharge in highly Rarefied Gaseous Media.     519
shaped like a large comma, escapes from it.          When the soft
iron is magnetized, this comma is distinctly seen to revolve, to
gether with the halo from which it proceeds, in one direction or
the other, according to the direction of the magnetization.       At
the same time the violet sheath which surrounds the ring is seen
to revolve in the same direction as the rose-coloured          halo,
although they are separated by a perfectly dark space.           On
changing the direction of the discharge, a violet envelope appears
at the negative electrode, but does not completely cover the
summit of the soft-iron rod unless the gas is very much rare
fied ; while at the positive electrode brilliant points may be seen,
separated from each other by a rose-coloured glow which sur
rounds the whole of the ring, and from which there proceed a
few regular stratifications    concentric internally with the ring.
When the gas is not very much rarefied, a luminous jet appears
starting from the ring and extending to the top of the central
rod of soft iron (from which it is separated only by a narrow
dark space), and exhibiting a movement of rotation one way or
the other, like the hand of a watch, according to the direction
of the magnetization.      In this case only part of the top of the
soft-iron rod is covered by the violet sheath, and this luminous
segment turns with the brilliant jet.
    I made a very great many experiments, under the conditions
I have just described, with atmospheric air, nitrogen, and hy
drogen, both dry and more or less charged with vapour.        I will
now give a summary description of these experiments, remark
ing here, in the first place, that whatever was the nature of the
gas and its degree of elasticity, and whether it was dry or im
pregnated with vapour, the velocity of rotation was always much
greater when the ring was made the positive electrode than when
it was negative, and that this rotation, which became more and
more rapid as the tension diminished, ceased to be appreciable
under a much lower tension in the latter case than in the
former.
    In my first experiments I used a large globe 25 eentims. in
diameter, the diameter of the ring being 20 eentims., and that
o-f the central rod of soft iron 3 eentims.     This globe had two
tubuliires ; one of them served for the introduction of the soft-
iron rod, the top of which reached to the centre of the globe,
while the lower end projected from the tubulure, so that it could
be placed on the polar surface of the electromagnet; the other
tubulure was closed by a stopcock througli which the gas and
vapour could be introduced, and which carried an insulated con
ductor that supported the ring and allowed of its being put into
the electric circuit.   The discharge passed accordingly between
the summit of the soft-iron rod and the metallic rin<?.

520       Prof. De la Rive on     the  Action of Magnetism upon
    This globe was filled with air rarefied to 4 millims. ; the dis
 charge then took place in the form of a jet, which turned at the
 rate of sixty revolutions per minute when the ring was positive,
 and of twenty per minute when it was negative.                Under a pres
 sure of 6 millims. the velocity of rotation was only forty turns
 per minute in the former case, and twenty turns in the latter.
 Lastly, with alcohol-vapour, the pressure being 5 millims., the
 velocities of rotation were respectively twenty-two and eleven
 turns per minute.
    These first experiments having put me on the track of re
 searches of this kind,     I repeated this investigation, employing
the jar of 20 centims. by 16 that             I have described above.       I

air : —

   At 9 millims., the ring being the positive electrode, the discharge
no longer formed a jet, but was spread out into a sector of 30° to
45° j this sector obeyed the movement of rotation as the jet did
previously, but it increased in size in proportion as the pressure
diminished, and at 6 millims. it formed a complete circular
sheet : the rotation, which up to this point had gone on increas
ing in rapidity, was then no longer perceptible.             When the ring
forms the negative electrode, it becomes covered with a violet
sheath, the extent of which likewise increases as the pressure
diminishes, but it still occupies only half the circumference
of the ring under a pressure of 4 millims. At this pressure
it is seen to revolve very rapidly, but under a pressure of 2
millims. it occupies the whole circumference of the ring, and
the rotatory motion is no longer sensible.                At the top of the
magnetized rod of soft iron there is a rose-coloured halo whence
issues a very short point or jet in the shape of a comma, which
turns with the violet sheath, and is separated from it by a very
considerable dark space.
    It ought to be mentioned that, under a pressure of 6 or 4 mil
lims. and sometimes under a pressure of 3 millims., it generally
happens, when the ring is the positive electrode, that on first

    the Electric Discharge in highly Rarefied Gaseous Media.       521
completing the circuit, a luminous jet is formed which turns too
rapidly for its velocity of rotation to be measured, but which very
quickly spreads out so as to form at first for a few moments a
sector which continues to revolve, and soon afterwards a com
plete circular sheet which no longer exhibits any perceptible
motion.
   It must not be thought that the action of magnetism ceases
when the gas is too far rarefied for there to be any longer a vi
sible rotation.   The action then shows itself under another form,
as is proved by experiments made at pressures of 3 to 2 millims.
Thus if the ring is employed as negative electrode, the violet
sheath which surrounds it is seen to be depressed at the
moment of magnetizing the soft iron, and toTise at the moment
of demagnetizing it. If, on the other hand, the ring is made
the positive electrode, the rose-coloured sheet, which occupies the
space between the ring and the central iron rod, is raised, as well
as the violet sheet which issues from the summit of the rod, at
the moment of magnetization, and depressed at the moment of
demagnetization.
   The following more complete experiment with dry nitrogen
proves that the rotation begins to show itself at higher pressures
when the ring is positive than when it is negative : —

   At 4 millims.    pressure the rotation is too rapid to be counted,
and at 3 millims. it appears to cease completely.             The rose-
coloured halo is very bright when the top of the soft-iron rod is
positive.    Moreover, when there is no longer any rotation, a
depression or elevation may be observed under the influence of
the magnetization, just as with atmospheric air.
    The pressure of vapour modifies the results obtained with dry
 gases in some important respects.         In the following experiment
 with ordinary air reduced to a pressure of 2 millims., aqueous
vapour was introduced in successive quantities, so as to increase
 the pressure solely by the effect of the presence of the vapour.

     It will  be seen that at equal pressures the rotation is more
  rapid  in  presence of aqueous vapour than with dry air, — a fact
 which    is probably connected with the greater facility with which
  the discharge is transmitted. When the external air is of a me
  dium degree of humidity, we have at a pressure of 14 millims.
  72 turns instead of 80 with the ring positive, and 44 instead of
 48 when the ring is negative.
     But the most characteristic fact which the presence of aqueous
 vapour brought out was the division of a single electrical jet
 under the influence of magnetism into a series of small, distinct,
 equidistant jets which turn like the spokes of a wheel.                This
 division can be seen only when the ring serves as positive elec
 trode. At a pressure of 6 millims. the single jet begins to ro
 tate, and afterwards spreads out and the rotation is no longer
 sensible; but under pressures of 8, 10, and 12 millims. the jet di
 vides itself under the action of magnetism, as soon as the rotation
 begins, into five or six jets, which turn, as we have already said,
 like the spokes of a wheel ; whereas when the air is dry the jet
 never divides itself, but merely spreads out at low pressures into
 a sector or a circle, the whole of which is continuous throughout.
    When the ring is negative, it will be observed that, in pre
 sence of vapour, the jet which starts from the summit of the
 soft-iron rod exhibits at the part where it is in contact with the
 iron, at the moment when the iron is magnetized, instead of a
 continuous surface, a series of bright points which seem to be
the starting-points of an equal number of small jets not sepa
rated from each other far enough to be distinct.                 It is thus
 simply an expansion or spreading out which is undergone by
the part of the jet which is in contact with the iron, and the
jet does not divide itself into several veins.
    Alcohol-vapour produces exactly the same effect as aqueous
vapour.       The single jet is much more brilliant in this case than
it is with dry air or with aqueous vapour : it exhibits beautiful
stratifications which give to it exactly the appearance of a che
nille.    Magnetization causes it to spread out and to divide into

     the  Electric Discharge in highly Rarefied Gaseous Media.        523
  several jets of much greater width than what are seen with
  aqueous vapour.          Nevertheless, if the diameter of the ring is
  too great (more than 15 centims., for example), the subdivision of
  the jet cannot be obtained except with difficulty, unless the in
  tensity of the discharge and that of the magnetization are very
  considerable.
     In the following experiment the rarefied gas was hydrogen,
  and several successive quantities of alcohol-vapour were intro
  duced into it.      The pressure of the pure and dry gas at the be
  ginning was 5 millims.          At this pressure, as we shall see imme
  diately, hydrogen      transmits   the discharge solely under the form
  of a luminous sheet. The pressure was then augmented entirely
  by the alcohol-vapour, and the following results were obtained :
                                                                       —

     The division into a greater or less number of separate jet
 took place when the ring was made the positive electrode.
     When pure and dry hydrogen is the medium through which
 the discharges are passed, it is very difficult to obtain the phe
 nomena of rotation.          At comparatively high pressures, such as
 128 millims., jets are certainly obtained, but they are not suffi
 ciently continuous for a magnet to be capable of affecting them.
At 90 millims.       I  obtained a small jet in the form of a bluish-
white thread,     which,     when the ring was positive, revolved at the
rate of 35 turns in a minute ; but it soon broke up into a mul
titude of little irregular jets, and the rotation was then no longer
perceptible.      As far as 40 millims. the action of the magnet was
but slightly marked ; at 30 millims. the negative ring became
covered with small violet sheaths, separated by uniform intervals,
which, at the instant of making the magnet, seemed to exhibit a
tendency to motion in one direction or the other, according to
the direction of the magnetization.              The same thing happens
in the case of the small, uniformly but closely distributed bril
liant points wherewith the ring becomes covered when it is
positive,     At 5 millims., and still more at 3 and 3, the ring

524            Prof. De la Rive on   the   Action of Magnetism vpon
becomes completely covered, when it is negative, with a beautiful
violet sheath, which contracts under the influence of the magnet.
The top of the iron rod, which is then positive, is surrounded by
a beautiful halo of a somewhat rosy-white colour, 3 centims.
broad, and very distinctly stratified.     Magnetization causes
marked contraction in the halo, and causes the strife to approach
closer together without diminishing their number; it further
causes it to rise up, giving to it the shape of a pear resting with
its base upon the magnetic pole.      When this pole is the nega
tive electrode, a magnificent violet- coloured tuft, as we have
already seen, issues from        it,
                               and becomes erect when the mag
net      is   in action.
     All  the phenomena that we have here described prove in               a
striking manner the molecular differences presented by the
various elastic fluids, even when greatly rarefied.        Thus in the
 case of hydrogen, although this gas           very good conductor of
                                               is  a
 electricity, the electric jets obey with difficulty, and only to          a
 slight extent, the action of the magnet, probably on account of
 the low density of the gas.      With air and nitrogen the state of
 things      just the opposite, especially when these gases are moist.
              is
 The singular property possessed              by
                                           the electric jet of dividing
 into several distinct jets, instead of spreading out, under the in
 fluence of magnetization, when the medium which               traverses
                                                                 it
contains       greater or less quantity of vapour, would seem to in

                                                                    pos
 sessed by the gases properly so called,           be allowable to talk

is   also possible that this division into jets     nothing more than-
                                                            is
the result of an optical illusion due to very rapid succession of
                                                    a
jets starting from different points, but not simultaneous. This
is   a point for further examination.
     However this may be,       it evident that the study of the stra
                                     is
tification of the electric light, and of the action of magnetism on
the discharge in different gaseous media, reveals differences
among these media which can only be due to differences of mole
cular constitution.      Density, in particular, would seem to exert
a   great influence upon phenomena of this kind, since we find
them exhibited to such          asmall extent               by
                                                    hydrogen, whereas
aqueous vapour, and especially the vapours of alcohol and ether,
 exhibit themvin such       amarked manner.       The special nature of
the particular elastic fluids in reference to the greater or less
resistance they oppose to the transmission of electricity must
 doubtless also come into play.              It
                                             therefore not impossible
                                                  is

new ideas as to the physical constitution of these bodies, and as
to the manner in which electricity is transmitted by them.
             § 3. Supplement to the preceding Researches.
    The experiments described in §§ 1 and 2 had been already in
great part published in the MSmoires de la Socie'te de Physique
et d'Histoire Naturelle de Geneve (vol. xvii. part 1), when            I again
took up the subject and obtained results which have not hitherto
been published, and which appear to me to possess some interest
as throwing new light upon the nature of these phenomena.
    I began by taking two jars, exactly like the one with which              I
had made my first experiments and which                     I       '
                                                               have described
above (p. 518), and       I placed them so that the discharge of the
Ruhmkorff's coil could either be divided between them or be
made to traverse them in succession.              In the former case, even
when care was taken to reduce the air in each as nearly as pos
sible to the same degree of rarefaction, it was very difficult to
get the discharge to divide itself equally between them, at least
for any length of time. It would cease, after a short time, passing
through one of them, and pass wholly through the other ; if then
the passage of the discharge was interrupted for a moment and
 then reestablished, it would often happen that the jar which
had previously transmitted the discharge would transmit it no
longer, and vice versa. These alternations are very probably
 due to the difficulty that there is in producing, and in after
wards maintaining, perfect identity between the two gaseous
 media, notwitstanding all the pains bestowed upon this matter
at the beginning, differences of temperature and of molecular
 arrangement occurring very quickly.
     When the discharge traverses the two jars in succession in
 stead of dividing itself between them, the rotation takes place
with equal rapidity in each, provided that care has been taken
 to rarefy the air in both to exactly the same extent.                A slight
 difference is apparent only at very low pressures, in consequence
 of the imperfect identity being more sensible at these pressures.

    At 4 millims. pressure, the ring being positive, the number of
turns in 15 seconds was 36 in one jar and 38 in the other.
   Keeping the two jars in the circuit one after the other, and
varying the rarefaction in one of thein without changing it in
the other, the following results were obtained : —
   The pressure in one jar being kept constant at 14 millims.,
the rate of rotation was 14 turns in 15 seconds with the ring posi
tive and 12 with the ring negative.      This rate increased a little
when the air in the second jar was rarefied as far as 4 millims.,
but wao still only 16 and 13 turns in 15 seconds with the ring
respectively   positive and negative : this slight increase was evi
dently due to the greater intensity of the electric discharge con
sequent upon the diminution of resistance in the jar in which the
pressure of the air was varied.     As to this latter jar, the rate of
rotation increased in it considerably as the pressure was dimi
nished, as may be seen from the following Table :—

   These two jars being still used, the air in one of them was
rarefied as far as possible and aqueous vapour was then intro
duced into   it,   while the other was. filled with very dry air at 10,
12, or   14   millims.   pressure.    As long as the pressure of the
vapour   was   below   that of the  air, the rotation in      was the more
                                                                     it

4  millims., at which point     it     33 turns in 15 seconds with the
                                      is
ring positive, and 20 with the ring negative.               At      millims.  6
pressure    the rotations   were   respectively   26  and  15    at 12 mil;
lims. they were 16 and 12; and in the second jar, containing
air at 12 millims., they were likewise 16 and 12.         It seems to
follow from this that, when the elastic force      the same, the rate

of rotation is  the same in air and in aqueous vapour.
    In order to make quite sure that this was the case, replaced          I
both jars parallel to each other in the circuit, so that the discharge
was obliged to divide itself between them, and began             trying           by
to what degree of rarefaction      was needful to reduce air in order
                                      it
that its resistance might be equal to that of aqueous vapour of a
certain pressure.       thus found that air at
                         I                           millims. had the

 same electric conductivity as aqueous vapour at 13 millims.
 Nevertheless an electric discharge of the same intensity made in
 the former medium 49 turns (with the ring positive) and 25
  (ring negative) in 15 seconds, whereas in the latter it made only
 81 and 17 in the same time.           This result proves that the rate of
 rotation does not depend solely upon the intensity of the electric
 discharge, but also to a great extent upon the molecular consti
 tution of the gaseous medium.
     On the other hand, if without paying any attention to differ
 ences of conductivity, both jars are placed in succession in the
 same circuit, so that the same discharge necessarily traverses both,

     Each of these experiments was made three times, and gave the
 same result every time.
     It is therefore equality of elastic force, and not of electrical re
sistance, which determines the equality in the rate of rotation
in dry air and aqueous vapour of the same electrical discharge
under the influence of two electromagnets of the same strength.
 Some trials made with alcohol-vapour did not give quite such
conclusive results.         Thus, at a pressure of 10 millims., the rate of
rotation was 17 turns per minute in both media with the ring
negative, but with the ring positive the number of turns was 30
in air and 20 in the alcohol-vapour.             At 6 millims. pressure and
with the ring negative, the number of turns was 24 in a minute
in both air and alcohol-vapour, and with the ring positive it was
30 in both media alike.           It therefore seems that, as the pres
sure diminishes, the rates of rotation approach equality.
    In the foregoing experiments, the two jars, exactly similar as
to their dimensions and construction, were placed one on each
polar surface of a powerful electromagnet, so that it was certain
that the intensity of the magnetism of the soft-iron rods in the
interior of each was really the same. Subsequently the soft-iron
rod in one of the jars was replaced by a rod of brass of like shape
and size.      The jar thus modified was placed on one of the polar
surfaces pf the electromagnet ; and rotation took place as before.

before, were introduced into the circuit one after the other, one
being placed on each polar surface of the electromagnet, and

   In another set of experiments the jar with the brass rod gave
25 turns in 15 seconds at a pressure of 8 millims., whichever
way the current was sent, — whence we may conclude that the
rate of rotation is sensibly the same at this pressure when
the ring is negative as when it is positive.                      The same thing
may   be  said    of the  higher      pressures    also,     at which     the differ
ence, although always on the same side, is too small to be of
importance.        At lower pressures the rate of rotation is greater
when the ring is negative than when it is positive, contrary to
what takes place with the jar containing the iron rod; and the
difference becomes greater as the pressure diminishes.
   It may be observed that the absolute rate of rotation is always
greatest in the jar with the iron rod, in consequence of the mag
netic pole, which in this case is at the end of the iron rod, being
much nearer to the electric jet. Moreover the rate of rotation
in the jar with the brass rod increases when the iron rod in the
other jar is not magnetized                and there is consequently               no
rotation in this jar, notwithstanding that the same discharge
passes through it as before. These conditions are easily fulfilled

with the iron rod there were 46 turns in the same time when
the ring was positive, and 22 when           was negative.

with the iron rod having been removed from the electromagnet,
the numbers of turns in the other jar were 29 and 30 instead
of 25 as before, although the discharge still passed through the
jar with the iron rod; but the rod not being magnetized, there
was no rotation.
    This effect    sensible only when the pressure
                         is                                low, as from

and thus diminishes the intensity of the discharge*.

that this    just the contrary of what happens in the jar with
                   is
the magnetized iron rod.
   The effect of magnetization can likewise be rendered sensible
 by putting into the circuit, at the same time as the jar with the
brass rod, an electrical egg in place of the jar with the iron rod.
One of the rods between which the electric jet passes in the egg
is made of soft iron     and as soon as this

has been made the negative electrode, the rate of rotation is seen to

is due in this case also to the magnetization condensing the jet,
and so increasing the resistance, whereby the intensity of the
electric discharge is lessened.

  LXVI.      Note on Mr. C roll's Paper on     the Influence of the  Obli
     quity  of  the Ecliptic on Climate.    By John Carrick. Moore,
     F.R.S., V.P.G.S., %c*
         an elaborate    memoir    in the last Number of the Philoso
 IN phical Magazine, Mr.          Croll estimates the annual heat at the
 poles received from the sun, when the obliquity of the ecliptic
 was at its maximum (24° 50* 34"), to be greater than at present
 by        of the whole quantity ; and as this fraction            applies
 to all the subsequent computations,          any inaccuracy    in  it will
 affect all the numerical results.
     Mr. Croll deduces this quantity from a paper by Mr. Meech
  (Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge, vol. ix.), where Mr.
 Meech proves the annual amount of heat at the equator, with a
 maximum of obliquity, to be to that at the poles as 365'51 to
 160-04.       Mr. Meech, in his very meritorious paper, takes into
 consideration the variations of heat due to change of obliquity, of
 latitude, of the length of the day, and of the height of the sun
 above the horizon at each instant ; but he makes no allowance
for the effects of atmosphere ; and he expressly warns his readers
 (pages 21 and 44) that his results apply only to the outer limits
 of the atmosphere, and will not give the resulting terrestrial
temperatures.         The same warning may be found in Sir Charles
Lyell's    last  edition of his ' Principles of Geology.'
     The effects of the increased length of ray and of the increasing
density of the lower strata of the atmosphere are considered by
the authors of the article "Climate" in the Encyclopeedia Bri-
 tannica ; and their result is that the heat received at the equator
is to that at the poles as more than 8 to 1, instead of less than
   \
2 to 1, as Mr. Croll computes.             Mr. Croll does indeed allude
to the article " Climate," but dismisses it rather summarily by
saying that the results are " wholly erroneous." " The researches
of Melloni and Tyndall," he says, " show that when a ray passes
through any substance, the absorption is rapid at first, but the
ray is soon sifted, as it is called, and it then passes onwards with
but little further obstruction."
    But the experiments in the place cited are quite beside this
question.       They show indeed that if a ray is made to pass through
a number of transparent plates of the same substance and thick
ness, the proportion of the rays transmitted through the first
plate is greater than the proportion of those which, having
emerged through the first plate, can pass through the second.
But they do not show that, if the successive plates had increased
in thickness or in density, the ray (or rather all that remains of

proved     bybeautiful set of experiments by Prof. Tyndall, that the
               a
absorption of heat in passing through        gas varies within certain
                                                                     a

which the authors of " Climate " assumed as their data and,                                           ;
for the correctness of their mathematical results,          immaterial               it    is
whether the assumption be that the absorption            due to the at               is
mosphere, or to the aqueous vapour suspended in the atmosphere.
I    conclude, therefore, that Mr. Meech's memoir will not give
us the annual terrestrial temperatures, and that        cannot believe              I

LXVIII.       On a   Theory proposed by Fresnel, and on a mode of
    measuring the average size of very fine Particles.       By Ogden
    N. Rood, Professor of Physics in Columbia College*.
IF
       the light from a candle-flame be received on a ground glass
       surface so obliquely that the incident ray makes only a very
small angle with the glass surface, the light will be copiously
reflected, and a bright uncoloured image of the flame will be seen
by reflexion.      As the angle made by the incident ray is increased,
the  reflected   image becomes first yellow, then red, and finally
disappears altogether.
                                          f
    Fresnel has attempted to account for this fact on the ground
that the more refrangible rays, having shorter wave-lengths, are
caused to interfere by a difference of path, which is still too small
to effect complete interference in the case of the longer waves of
red light — the difference in path depending on the depth of the
minute scratches on the surface of the glass, and on the angle
which the ray makes with this surface.
    As it is not difficult to measure approximately the angle at
which the red ray ceases to be reflected, it would be easy to put
this theory to the test of experiment if the average depth of the
scratches on the ground surface were known.
    The impossibility of obtaining such measurements has hitherto
prevented this theory of the action of finely roughened surfaces
 on light from being either confirmed or overthrown.
    Some time ago, while experimenting on a plane polished sur
face of glass which had been smoked with lampblack to complete
 opacity,   I was surprised to find that the lampblack surface at
 a great obliquity reflected all the rays of light with much bril
 liancy, so that it resembled in appearance a polished surface of
 metal or glass. With less degrees of obliquity the reflected light
 was yellow, red, and finally disappeared altogether.
    The lampblack surface in this experiment was obtained from
 burning paraffiue, and it was found that the red ray ceased to
 be reflected at an angle of 18°, reckoning from the glass surface.
 The source of light was a small gas-flame; and the experiments
 were made in a darkened room at night, the glass plate with its
 lampblack surface being attached to the axis of a graduated cir
 cle, the lampblack having been removed from the upper half of
 the plate so as to allow the proper adjustments to be made with
 the aid of the naked glass surface.          I then attempted to mea
 sure with the microscope the average size of the smaller and
 more numerous particles of lampblack ; the result obtained was

Prof. Rood on measuring   the average size     of very fine Particles. 541
that they varied in size from '000018 to "000012 of an inch.
Several months afterwards      I  made a calculation to ascertain
what the difference in the path of the interfering rays would be,
using these data, and what relation this difference bore to the
length of a wave of red light.
   Assuming the dimensions of the particles of lampblack to be
the same in all directions, we have the annexed construction. BD

will represent the diameter of a particle of lampblack, the ray
A B is reflected from its surface, the ray C B from the layer
next below; X is the angle made by the light with the plate;
and the difference in path of the two rays will evidently be equal
to CB— AB, a quantity readily found by calculation.
   Taking the size of the lampblack particles to be equal to
•000018 of an inch, the difference in path of the two rays for an
angle of incidence of 18° is "000011, while the wave-length of
the line C in the red space is nearly -000026 of an inch.     This
shows that the difference in the path is not far from half a wave
length of red light, if the larger of the two estimates of the size
of the particles of lampblack is employed.
   I then made a new set of experiments relative to the angle at
which the red ray disappears, using, as before, lampblack from
paraffine.   This was found to vary somewhat in different por
tions of the same plate, as is seen in the Table below : —
       21°,   20°-75,     18°-75,     20°,        20°; mean 20°'l.
    New microscopic measurements on the size of the lampblack
 particles were made with a different microscope, the value of the
 micrometer not being known ; it was estimated that the size of
 the smaller and more numerous particles varied from 45^00 to
 90000" °f an i'lcnJ but that there were more particles approach
 ing the first number than the second — a circumstance of which          I
 have not taken any advantage in the following calculation.
    Taking the mean of these determinations and combining it
 with the mean of the first determinations, we obtain for the mean
 size of the particles         = '0000146 of an inch.
    The average angle of disappearance of the red ray being 20°,
 there results a difference of path ='0000098; that         the dif
                                                                 is,
 ference of path  is  to the wave-length of red light nearly as 10
 to 26.

542 Prof. Hood on measuring              the average        she of very fine Particles.
    When the difficulty of obtaining an approximate, measurement
of the size of the particles of lampblack is considered, it is sur
prising to see how nearly the calculated difference in path ap
proximates to half a wave-length of the light in question.
    I found that a surface of magnesia, produced by smoking a
glass ¦plate to opacity with burning magnesium wire, also re
flected light in the same way at very oblique incidences.                         It was
ascertained      that   the  final   tint   was       red,   and  that   the  red   rays
themselves disappeared at 11°.                  The size of the particles of mag
nesia was estimated at "000036.                    Long after the measurements
had been obtained           I  calculated       the difference of path for the
interfering rays      ;  this was found to be

wave-length of C                       -000026,
giving a still nearer approximation to                  a difference   of half  a wave
length.
    These experiments, then, seem to point out the correctness of
                                                  I
Fresnel's theory ; and we should, think, be justified in revers
ing the process, and using the angle of disappearance of the red
ray in connexion with the known wave-length of this ray, for
the purpose of calculating the average size of small particles or
the average depth of fine scratches or furrows.

 -*•     " On    certain Points in the Theory of the Magneto-electric Ma
chines of Wilde, Wheatstone, and Siemens."             By C. F. Varley, Esq.
In'a Letter to Professor Stokes, Sec. R.S.
                                             Fleetwood House, Beckenham,    S.E.
                                                       February  23, 1867.
     My dear Sir, — Professor Wheatstone showed that a shunt put
into the circuit of the electromagnet increased (he power greatly, but
the explanation that it increased the power by equalizing the resist
ance of the armature and that of the electromagnet is either wholly
incorrect, or very nearly so.
     Yesterday I had an opportunity afforded me by Mr. C. Siemens of
experimenting with his machine, in which the electromagnets have
each a resistance of about 250 Ohms = 500 Ohms, the armature 400
Ohms.
     On adding a shunt to the electromagnet the flame was greatly in
creased.
     The two electromagnets when connected in series had a resist
ance      of about 500 Ohms.       I then connected them in a double cir
cuit, the resistance in this case being about 1 25 Ohms. By this means
the same result as regards resistance could be obtained as by a shunt,
with the      difference that the power expended in the shunt is lost in
heat ; while reducing the resistance by the double circuit caused
 the whole force to be expended on the electromagnet.
     The results of the experiment were —
      1st. The shunt invariably increased the power.
     2ndly. When the magnets were joined in double circuit the power
 was greatly reduced.
     The explanation is to me obvious. In a Ruhmkorff's coil, where
 the iron core is divided into fine wire, so that the dying magnetism
 cannot set up currents in the iron core to prolong its existence, the
 magnetism is very rapidly lost, and the make-and-break hammer works
 very rapidly, sometimes as fast as sixty beats per second.
     If the secondary circuit be closed so that the currents can flow, the
 make-and-break hammer works very slowly, indeed one or two beats
 per second ; and in 1856 I published a description of electromagnets
 whose action was very slow, and which were rendered sluggish by a
 copper cylinder around them.
      Wilde's armature, when revolving, sends intermittent currents
 around the electromagnet, whose circuit is broken at every half re
 volution of the armature.
     Were the magnets composed of fine iron wire, the magnetism would
 die away rapidly, producing a violent current by its efforts to main

544                          Royal Society   : —'
tain itself, as in the RuhmkorfT's       coils.   (This current is called
by foreigners   the  extra-current.)
    The shunt which Wheatstone inserted carries this current across,
and so maintains the magnetism of the electromagnets until the arma
ture gives a second impulse.       The current in this shunt will be found
to travel in alternate directions ; not so that on the electromagnet.
    When the armature is discharging its current into the electro
magnets, the current in the shunt is in the direction it would have
if the shunt were in circuit solely with the armature.
    When the armature is changing poles and is disconnected, the se
condary current is in full play, and the current in the shunt is in the
direction of the current prolonged in the electromagnet, that is, of
the extra current.
    The force expended in the shunt is wasted in heat ; but a secondary
wire on the electromagnet or a copper cylinder would very greatly
add to the power by maintaining the magnetism, and not consume
uselessly the force now wasted in the shunt.
    The overlapping of the armature and the solid mass of the elec
tromagnets tends to maintain imperfectly the magnetism during the
intervals of no current from the armature ; and but for this the ma
chines, whether they be Wilde's, Wheatstone' s, or Siemens' s, would
 none of them work.
    In 1860   I  published a description of two machines        I  had con
 structed, and in 1862, at the Universal Exhibition, I exhibited a ma
 chine for adding mechanical force to static electricity without fric
tion.    A machine similar in principle, but a little different in construc
tion, has been exhibited recently under the name of Holtz.
    One of my machines bears to the other precisely the same relation
that Siemens's or Wheatstone's does to Wilde's.
    If these be of sufficient interest to the Royal Society,      I shall be
 happy to exhibit them.
                             I am, my dear Sir,
                                            Very truly yours,

    " On  a Magneto-electric   Machine."     By William Ladd, F.R.M.S.
    In June  1864   I received  from Mr. Wilde a small magneto-electric
machine, consisting of a Siemens's armature and six magnets.            This
I endeavoured to improve upon, my object being to get a cheap ma
chine for blasting with Abel's fusees.      This was done by making one
of circular magnets, and a Siemens's armature revolving directly be
tween the poles, the armature forming the circles ; with this I could
send a very considerable power into an electro-magnet, &c.            It was
then suggested to me by my assistant, that if the armature had two
wires instead of one, the current from one being sent through a wire
surrounding the magnets, their power would be augmented, and a
considerable current might be obtained from the other wire available
for external work ; or there might be two armatures, one to exalt the
power of the magnets, and the other made available for blasting or
other purposes.       Want of time prevented me carrying this out

            Mr. F. A. Abel     on the  Stability of Gun-cotton.              545
until now    ; but since    the interesting papers of C. W. Siemens
and    Professor Wheatstone were read last month,             I  have carried
out the idea as follows : — Two bars of soft iron, measuring
7 j  in. X 2i in. X | in., are each wound, round the centre portions,
with about thirty yards of No. 10 copper wire ; and shoes of soft iron
are so attached at each end, that when the bars are placed one above
the other there will be a space left between the opposite shoes in
which a Siemens's armature can rotate : on each of the armatures is
wound about ten yards of No. 14 copper wire cotton-covered.                  The
current generated in one of the armatures is always in connexion with
the electro-magnets ; and the current from the second armature,
being perfectly free, can be used for any purpose for which it may be
required.     The machine is altogether rudely constructed, and is only
intended to illustrate the principle ; but with this small machine three
inches of platinum wire -01 can be made incandescent.

    " Researches   on Gun-cotton. — Second Memoir.           On the Stability

    The results of the many observations which had been instituted
prior to 1860 upon the behaviour of gun-cotton when exposed to
 diffused or strong daylight, or to heat, although they agree gene
rally with those of the most recent investigations on the subject, as
                                                                                    '
far as relates to the nature of the products obtained at different stages
 of its decomposition, cannot be regarded as having a direct bearing
 upon the question of the stability of gun-cotton produced by strictly
 pursuing the system of manufacture prescribed by Von Lenk, inas
 much as it has been shown that the products formerly experimented
 upon by different chemists varied very considerably in composition.
    The investigations recently published by Pelouzeand Maury*, into
 the composition of gun-cotton, and the influence exerted by light
 and heat upon its stability, are described as having been conducted
 with gun-cotton prepared according to Von Lenk's system. The gene
 ral conclusion arrived at by those chemists with reference to the latter
 branch of the subject was to the effect that the material is susceptible
 of spontaneous decomposition, under conditions which may possibly
 be fulfilled in its storage and application to technical and warlike
 purposes ; and the inference is drawn, partly from the results of earlier
 investigators, and partly from the exceptional behaviour of one or two
 specimens, that gun-cotton is liable to explode spontaneously at very
 low temperatures when stored in considerable quantities.
     It has been shown, in the memoir on the Manufacture and Com
 position of Gun-cotton, published last yearf, that modifications in
 the processes of conversion and purification, which appear at first
 sight of very trifling nature, exert most important influences upon
 the composition and purity of the product.           Gun-cotton of quite ex
 ceptional character has been discovered, in several instances, among
 samples received from Hirtenberg and among the first supplies ob-

tained from Stowmarket ; other exceptional products have also been
produced by purposely modifying, in several ways, the system of
manufacture as pursued at Waltham Abbey.              The very consider
able difference   exhibited between some of these and the ordinary
products in their behaviour under equal conditions of exposure to
heat and light, affords good grounds for the belief that the attain
ment of certain exceptional results, upon which the conclusions of
Pelouze and Maury's report condemnatory of gun-cotton, have been
principally founded, are to be ascribed to such variations in the nature
of the material operated upon.
   Very numerous and extensive experiments and observations have
been carried on during the last four years at Woolwich, both with
small and large quantities of gun-cotton, for the purpose of completely
investigating the conditions by which the stability of this substance,
when under the influence of light and heat, may be modified, and
with the view of ascertaining whether results recently arrived at in
France apply to gun-cotton as manufactured in this country.
   The principal points which have been established by the results
arrived at in these investigations may be summed up as follows : —
    1. Gun-cotton produced from properly purified cotton, according
to the directions given by Von Lenk, may be exposed to diffused day
light, either in the open air or in closed vessels, for very long periods
without undergoing any-change.          The preservation of the material
for 3^- years under those conditions has been perfect.
    2. Long-continued     exposure of the substance in a condition of
ordinary dryness to strong daylight and sunlight produces a very
gradual change in gun-cotton of the description defined above ; and
therefore the statements which have been published regarding the
very rapid decomposition of gun-cotton when exposed to the sun
light do not apply to the nearly pure trinitrocellulose obtained by
strictly following the system of manufacture now adopted.
    3. If gun-cotton in closed vessels is left for protracted periods
exposed to strong daylight or sunlight in a damp or moist condition,
it is affected to a somewhat greater extent ; but even under these
circumstances the change produced in the gun-cotton by several
months' exposure is of a very trifling nature.
   4. Gun-cotton which is exposed to sunlight until a faint acid
reaction has become developed, and is then immediately afterwards
packed into boxes which are tightly closed, does not undergo any
change during subsequent storage for long periods.         (The present
experience on this head extends over 3| years.)
    5. Gun-cotton prepared and purified according to the prescribed
system, and stored in the ordinary dry condition, does not furnish any
indication of alteration, beyond the development, shortly after it is first
packed, of a slight peculiar odour and the power of gradually impart
ing to litmus, when packed with     it,
                                      a   pinkish tinge.
   6. The influence exercised upon the stability of gun-cotton of
average quality, as obtained   by strict adherence to Von Lenk's system
of manufacture, by prolonged exposure to temperatures considerably
exceeding those which are experienced in tropical climates        is  very

trifling in comparison with the results recently published by Conti
nental experimenters relating to the effects of heat upon gun-cotton ;
and it may be so perfectly counteracted by very simple means which in
no way interfere with the essential qualities of the material, that the
storage and transport of gun-cotton presents no greater danger, and
is, under some circumstances, attended with much less risk of acci
dent than     the case with gunpowder.
                       is
      7.Perfectly pure gun-cotton, or trinitrocellulose, resists to           rea
markable extent the destructive effects of prolonged exposure to tem
peratures even approaching 100° C.               and the lower nitro-products
                                                      ;
of cellulose (soluble gun-cotton) «re at any rate not more prone to
alteration when pure.          The incomplete conversion of cotton into
the most explosive products does, therefore, not of necessity result
in the production of         less perfectly permanent compound than that
                                a
obtained by the most perfect action of the acid mixture.
    8. But all ordinary products of manufacture contain small propor
tions of organic (nitrogenized) impurities of comparatively unstable
properties which have been formed                     by
                                                the action of nitric acid upon
foreign    matters  retained   by the   cotton  fibre, and which are not com
pletely separated by     the  ordinary,   or even    more  searching process of
                                                                a
purification.
    It the presence of this class of impurity in gun-cotton which first
           is
gives rise to the development of free acid when the substance                 exis
posed    to  the action of heat    and    ;   the   acid
                                                   it
                                                   is    thus  generated   which
eventually exerts         destructive action upon the cellulose-products,
                            a
and thus establishes decomposition which heat materially accelerates.
If this small quantity of acid developed from the impurity in ques
tion be neutralized as          becomes nascent, no injurious action upon
                                 it

portion of a'carbonate, — the sodic carbonate, applied in the form of
 solution, being best adapted to this purpose*.

sodic carbonate affords to the material the power of resisting any
serious change, even when exposed to such elevated temperatures
as would induce some decomposition in the perfectly pure cellulose-
 products. That proportion affords, therefore, security to gun-cotton
against any destructive effects of the highest temperatures to which
it    likely to be exposed even under very exceptional climatic condi
      is
 tions.     The only influences which the addition of that amount of
 carbonate to gun-cotton might exert upon its properties as an ex
 plosive would consist in         trifling addition to the small amount of

      * The deposition of calcic and raagnesian carbonates upon the fibre of gun-

a similar protective effect, which, however,        necessarily very variable in its

 when it is exposed for long periods to sunlight), even under ex
 tremely severe conditions of exposure to heat.           An atmosphere
 saturated with aqueous vapour suffices to protect it from change at
 elevated temperatures ; and wet or damp gun-cotton may be exposed
for long periods in confined spaces to 100° C. without sustaining any
 change.
    Actual immersion in water is not necessary for the most perfect
preservation of gun-cotton ; the material, if only damp to the touch,
 sustains not the smallest change, even if closely packed in large quan
tities.   The organic impurities which doubtless give rise to the very
slight development of acid observed when gun-cotton is closely
packed in the dry condition, appear to be equally protected by the
water ; for damp or wet gun-cotton, which has been preserved for
 three years, has not exhibited the faintest acidity.   If as much water
as possible be expelled from wet gun-cotton       by the centrifugal ex
tractor, it is obtained in a condition in which, though only damp to
the touch, it is perfectly non-explosive ; the water thus left in the
material is sufficient to act as a perfect protection, and conse
 quently also to guard against all risk of accident.       It is therefore
in this condition that all reserved stores of the substance should be
preserved, or that it should be transported in large quantities to very
 distant places.    If  the proper proportion of sodic carbonate be dis
 solved in the water with which the gun-cotton is originally saturated
for the purpose of obtaining it in this non-explosive           form, the
material, whenever it is dried for conversion into cartridges, or em
ployment in other ways, will contain the alkaline matter required for
its safe storage and use in the dry condition, in all climates.
    Although some experiments, bearing upon the different branches
of inquiry included in this memoir, are still in progress with a
view to the attainment of additional knowledge of the conditions
which regulate the stability of gun-cotton, it is confidently believed
that the results arrived at amply demonstrate that the objections
which have been of late revived, especially in France, against the
employment of gun-cotton, on the ground of its instability, apply only
in a comparatively slight degree to the material produced by strictly
pursuing the system of manufacture perfected by Von Lenk — that, as
far as they do exist, they have been definitely traced to certain difficul
ties in the manufacture of pure gun-cotton which further experi
mental research may, and most probably will, overcome — but that,
in the meantime, these objections are entirely set aside by the adop
tion of two very simple measures, against the employment of which
no practical difficulties can be raised, and which there is every reason
to believe must secure for this material the perfect confidence of those
who desire to avail themselves of the special advantages which it
presents as an explosive agent.

     The nature of the decomposition of gun-cotton when exploded
 under different conditions is now under investigation by me ; and
 the results arrived at will,   I trust, be communicated before long to
  the Royal Society.
    April  11. — Lieut. -General Sabine, President, in the Chair.
     The following communication        was read : —
     "A   new   fact relating  to Binocular Vision."     By A. Claudet,
  F.R.S.                           .
    The persistence of the impression made by light on the retina is
 demonstrated by many experiments ; but one of the most convincing,
 which is also very easy to try, is that which is known under the name
 of the thaumatrope.
    Let us write the letters composing a word of eight letters, say " Vic
 toria," on the two sides of a small card, in such a manner that one
 surface shall contain the 1st, 3rd, 5 th, and 7th letters, and the other
 surface the 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 8th, with a space between them suffi
 cient to complete the word on each surface, which blank spaces are
 in fact to appear filled up during the experiment by an artificial
 means to be explained.
    Fig. 1 shows the arrangement on the two sides of the card (section
 view)  .
                                     Fig.  1.

    Fig.  2 shows the plan of the card.       The white letters are those
 written on one surface, and the dotted lines those written on the
 other.
                                     Fig. 2.
    Now by     means of two strings fixed on the two sides A, B the card
may    be  made   to revolve on its axis by turning the string between
the thumb and finger of each hand.            By this means a very rapid
motion may be communicated to the card, -and while it is revolving
both surfaces are alternately seen in quick succession, and the percep
tion of the two is so simultaneous that the two sets of letters appear
as one, and the whole word is read as distinctly as if it were written
on one surface only.
    This is easily explained. It is known that the persisting action of
light on the retina has a duration of about one-eighth of a second ;
so that if the card makes at least eight revolutions in a second (it

may make considerably more), before one impression has vanished
another produces its effect on the next part of the retina, in such a
way that they are intermixed and simultaneously visible, producing
an uninterrupted sensation.
   The means by -which this illusion is produced has been called the
" thaumatrope," from two Greek words meaning " wonder " and
" turn." It is difficult to trace the history of this discovery ; but
it is certain that it has been the result of a very old, simple, and well-
known experiment.
   From time immemorial schoolboys have amused themselves by
holding a coin between two pins and making it revolve rapidly by-
blowing upon        it,
                    when to their surprise the coin showed the head
mixed with the device on the other side.         have been told that as Sir
                                                   I
John Herschel was one day making this experiment to amuse his
children, in the presence of the late Dr. Paris, this gentleman was
struck with the idea that           if,
                                  instead of coin, a   white card was em
                                                                a
ployed on each side of which one part of          design was properly ar
                                                       a
ranged, the two might complete the subject during the revolution.
Accordingly he made the experiment, which succeeded perfectly well
If
                                                                                   .
    the story  istrue, certainly Dr. Paris may be regarded as the in
ventor of the thaumatrope, which he has so well and so fully elu
cidated in his very interesting and instructive work entitled 'Philo
sophy in Sport made Science in earnest.'
    This philosophical toy may be employed to show another effect
of the persistence of the retinal image.               If
                                                   complementary colours
are fixed on the two opposite sides of the card, they will become su
perposed during the revolution, and white light will be the result.
By the same means, other curious effects of the mixture of various
colours might be tried.
   All these experiments present no difference, whether they are made
looking with the two eyes or only with        single eye
                                                   a        the effect

same in both cases.      Therefore the illusion     equally monocular
                                                           is            and
binocular.
   But was not
      I                little surprised to find that the thaumatrope
                          a                                                        is
capable of producing another phenomenon, elucidating very forcibly
the principles      by
                     which binocular vision     the only real and effective
                                                   is
means of showing the distances of objects, which are determined by
the degree of the angle of convergence of the optic axes and by one
of its corollaries, the sensation of double images for all the points
which are not exactly on the plane of vision.
   The thaumatrope         capable of showing that binocular vision can
                              is
detect to  a  degree hardly conceivable the most minute difference in
the distances of objects, such as the distance between the planes of
the two surfaces of card, which distance

                                                       is
thickness of the card. Therefore, supposing that the thickness of the
card  is     of an inch and the distance from the eyes 15 in., there               is
not   adifference greater than the-y^ part of the whole distance from
the eyes to the two planes of the card and still the difference of the

tect that infinitesimal difference in their distances.    But that such
an effect of binocular vision could possibly he displayed while looking
at two planes so nearly intermixed as the surfaces of a card revolving
upon its axis with such a wonderful velocity is the very extraordinary
phenomenon      I have discovered, and which I am about to describe and
endeavour to explain.

brought together and turned between the thumb and finger, the card
 will whirl exactly on its axis, and during the revolution the two sur
faces A and B will be at the same distance from the eyes.
    But if the two strings are drawnso that one of their knots is as in
fig. 4, the surface B will revolve round the plane of the surface A

every time that it is made visible to the eyes it will appear as if it
were nearer than the surface A.

 surface B revolving round the plane of A, it will be A that will re
volve round the plane of B.
    These three different positions of the strings will produce three
 different effects.
    In the position of fig. 3 the effect will be normal ; that is to say,
 the two surfaces coming alternately at the same distance, we shall
 see the whole word as if the letters were on the same surface.
    In the position of figs. 4 and 5 we have a very strange illusion.
 One half of the letters composing the word will appear hefore or
 behind the other half, according to the surface upon which they are
 written and the position of the knots upon that or the other surface.
     In fig..4 the letters written on the surface B will appear before the
 letters on the surface A ; and in fig. 5 the letters on the surface A
 will appear before the letters on the surface B.

552                         Royal Society : —
    The cause of the anomaly resulting from the two different experi
 ments is entirely and positively due to a sensation of binocular
 vision ; and we may easily satisfy ourselves that it is so ; for, looking
 with a single eye in both cases, all the letters appear on the same
 plane, notwithstanding the different distances of the two surfaces
 given by the position of the knots : and we may add another con
 vincing proof, which is that the pseudoscope inverts the distances of
 the surfaces.
    At first it is rather difficult to understand how the phenomenon can
 take place ; for as the perception of the two surfaces is simultaneous,
 how is it possible that during such a rapid revolution the optic axes
 can be made to converge alternately on each surface while it is pass
 ing so quickly, and that they should be made suddenly to converge
 on the other in its turn ?
    However, there cannot be any question that in reality the pheno
 menon takes place, and that it is decidedly an effect of binocular
 vision ; therefore it only remains to be explained how it can be pro
 duced.     In endeavouring to arrive at the true cause of the pheno
 menon, we shall have to bring to mind various physiological sensa
tions which concur in producing the effect.          One is the effort we
 make to obtain distinct vision, and the other the effort we make
 to obtain single vision.       These two efforts act in unison; for it is
 impossible not to admit that the two muscular processes by which
 both the angle of convergence is directed to the object and the focus
 of the eyes is adapted to its distance, for the double purpose of
 having at once single and distinct vision of every object, are two
 actions necessarily simultaneous and inseparably connected.           They
 are therefore both, each in its way, criteria of the distances of ob
jects ; but they give rise to certain indirect and additional criteria
for other distances, in two ways: one, the most important is the
 double images of the objects situated before and behind the point of
 convergence ; and the other, but only in a subsidiary way, the
degree of confusion of the objects situated before and behind the
point of convergence and which are not in focus.
   The comparison of two points, one of which is in focus and well de
fined, and the other out of focus and confused, helps considerably in
forming a judgment that they are on different planes. But in a ques
tion of binocular vision, perhaps we ought not strictly to take into
account this last criterion, which belongs equally to monocular and
binocular vision ; and if we allude to    it,   it  only because, although
                                                     is
it does not produce the real stereoscopic effect, still   it  contributes to
give that sort of illusion of relief which by various means may be
evinced by monocular vision. Therefore     it   isparticularly the sensation
of double images, the degree of their separation, and their respective
positions either outside or inside from the centres of the two retinae,
which indicate more powerfully the exact distance of the object from
the point of single vision either before or behind.
   When we look fixedly on point of one surface of the revolving,
                              a
card, that point appears single, and we see at the same time another
point on the other surface which appears double, although we hardly

                  Mr. A. Claudet on Binocular Vision.                 553
feel that we notice its doubleness    ; and from the position or distri
bution of the double images, either on the right or on the left of the
 central point, we have at the same glance the perception of the re
 spective distances.    Therefore, to judge of the distances of certain
 objects in the direction of the line of vision, we are not absolutely
 obliged to alter constantly the angle of convergence.     This is proved
by our perception of the two distances of the surfaces of the card
 while it is revolving ; for it would be impossible that we should alter
the angle of convergence to adapt it alternately to the two surfaces
while they are turning so rapidly.
    The same angle of convergence kept on one or the other surface
is no impediment to our seeing both in a sufficiently distinct manner.
    The whole phenomenon may be better understood by the illus
tration given in fig. 6.
    When we converge the optic axes on B,
this point, being represented on the centre
 of both retinae at B' B", is single, but A
being nearer is represented on the left of
the centre of the left retina at A', and on
the right of the centre of the right retina
at A"; therefore it appears double.
    For the same reason, converging on A,
this point is single, but B is double, with
this difference — that one image is on the
right of the left retina, and the other on
the left of the right retina ; so that the
double images of nearer objects situated at
A are represented outside the centres of
the two retinae, and those of further ob
jects situated at B are represented inside
the centres of the retinas, and each of these two different sensations
 brings to our mind the perception of the distance which has produced
it. During the revolution of the card we may adapt the convergence
either to one or to the other surface and keep it so ; but in every
case the letters on that surface will appear single and a little better
 defined ; and this, with the sensation of double images of the letters
 on the other surface, will be an indication of their respective dis
tances.
    As  I am not aware that the illusion   I have described in this paper
 has ever been noticed before, it has appeared to me that its publica
 tion would excite the interest of all those who look for any new fact
 capable of illustrating the principles of binocular vision, and showing
the wonderful property of the angle of convergence, by which the
 most minute differences in the distances of objects and the slightest
 relief on their surfaces can be detected, and by which also in the
 abnormal conversion introduced in its action by the pseudoscope all
 our sensations are reversed.    Therefore the pseudoscope is the great
 test of the phenomena of binocular vision ; for by reversing certain
 sensations which by constant habit we may hardly notice, it ren
 ders them more conspicuous by the comparison of the abnormal state

brought out by its action, and proves the theory of binocular vision
in the most effective manner.
    A truth is never better established than when it can be shown
that the same principles are capable of producing contrary effects
 when they are applied in a contrary way.
     Professor Wheatstonc, by adding the pseudoscope to the stereo
 scope, has thus in the most scientific and ingenious manner com
 pleted his splendid discovery, and left very little (we might almost
 venture to say that he has left nothing) for further investigations in
 the physiology of binocular vision.

  Owen.     By W. Boyd     Dawkins,   Esq.,  M.A.   (Oxon.),    F.G.S.
     The author analyzed    the  characteristics  usually   assigned to Bos
  longifrons, and concluded that    there  were   none   of  specific value to
  separate it from the smaller     varieties  of  Bos  taurus.      The large
  series of skulls in the Dublin and    Oxford    Museums     show    that Bos
 froniosus of Nilsson is a mere variation      from  the   more    usual  type.
  Professor Owen, on the faith of its occurrence on the Essex shore,
  along with the remains of extinct animals also washed up by the
  waves, ascribes to this species a Pleistocene age.          This inference,
  on a rigid examination of the premises, turns out       to  be faulty ; and
  there is no evidence anywhere in Europe that it coexisted with any
  of the extinct mammals, the Irish elk being excepted.             It is very
  commonly associated with the remains of man, of a date anterior
  to' the Saxon invasion.       It was kept in great herds during the
  Roman occupation, and supplied the Legionaries with beefT On
  the Continent, as in Britain, it is found around the dwellings and in
  the tombs of the Bronze and Stone folk. Nowhere is there evidence
  of its having a higher antiquity than the Neolithic age of Sir John
  Lubbock.     It, along with its Keltic masters, disappeared before the
  Saxon invaders, from the more fertile portions of Britain, and took
  refuge in the Highlands of Scotland and Wales, where it still
  survives in the smaller domestic races.         In no case has it been
  found in association with Saxon remains.           The inferences to be
  drawn about it are : —first, that it has not yet been proved to have
  existed before the Prehistoric age ; and second, that it is the
  ancestor of the small Highland and Welsh breeds.            It is essentially
  the animal with which Archaeologists have to deal, and its only
  claim for insertion in Geological catalogues is the fact of its occur
  rence in the most modern of all the stratified deposits.

Teign, Devonshire."       By G. Wareing Ormerod, Esq., M.A., F.G.S.
   The district noticed in this paper lies to the north of Bovey
Trace}'. The author described the courses of the Teign and its
feeders,  and the strata traversed by those streams — namely, Granite
and Carboniferous Limestone.         Gravels- are occasionally found,
 which the author regarded as having been deposited before the
reexcavation of the valley, and he showed that these had been
transported by a current from north-west to south-east.        From the
absence of these gravels in the gorge of the Carboniferous rocks
between Hunts Tor, near Chagford, and Clifford Bridge, he con
sidered that that valley had been opened since the time when the
boulders and gravels were deposited, and then showed that the
stream from the valley of the Teign prior to the opening of that
valley would have passed by Moreton Hampstead to Bovey Tracey.
The paper contained notices of the Minerals found in the district,
and of the Granite veins in the Carboniferous rocks.

at least 30 feet in thickness, with a dip of about 30°, composing
many of the islets supported by the coral reefs of the Mauritius,
which have been generally regarded as forming an integral part of
the islets, but which the author considered to be of greater anti
quity.    A soft sandstone was stated to cover in many places the
calcareous rock, and to contain imbedded remains of roots, and bases
of trunks of trees.

ON    THE RELATIONS         EXISTING BETWEEN       THE    COMPOSITION,
   DENSITY,     AND    REFRACTING-POWER       OF   SALINE SOLUTIONS.
   BY M. FOUQUE.

 ¦*¦
      made at the Imperial Observatory of Paris by the aid of instru
ments belonging to that establishment, the use of which was kindly
granted to me by the Director.
   The object of the research was (1) to ascertain whether Biot and
Arago's law for gaseous mixtures also held good for saline solutions,
and (2) to study the variation of the refractive index, and of the
refracting-power, with the temperature.
   These investigations required the following operations : — (1) esti

 heat, fused or simply dried at 100° C. before weighing them.           The
 densities were taken by means of a specific-gravity        bottle, at tem
 peratures between 0° and 100° C, in an apparatus resembling that
 for determining the boiling-point of thermometers.        The determina
  tion of the densities was made twice for each solution, at intervals
  of about six months.        The measurement of the refractive indices
 was effected by receiving a pencil of parallel rays on a prism con
 taining the liquid investigated, and determining in each -case the
 two minima of deviation.         The prisms employed were constructed
 of angular flasks, each provided with a ^lateral aperture, on which
  plane glass was hermetically fixed.
      Two series of experiments were made, thus : — one at the ordinary
 temperature, the principal object of which was to see if Biot and
 Arago's law was applicable to solutions ; the second at temperatures
 increasing from 10° to 95° C, the object of which was to determine
 the variations of the index and of the refracting-power           with the
 temperatures.
      In the first series, the necessity of working at constant tempera
 tures led me to fit up the apparatus in a cellar at the observatory,
 where the daily variations are very small, and to avoid as much as
 possible the other ordinary sources of heat.        Hence it was that I
 used as principal source of light, in determining the indices, the
 light of a Geissler's hydrogen-tube ; and I used similar tubes, fur
 nishing a bright light and a very feeble heat, to read the ther
 mometer and the graduated circle.
      In the second series of experiments, the prism containing the
 solutions was placed in an oven closed laterally with parallel glass
 plates, forming a jacket in which circulated the vapour of water,
 of alcohol or ether, or vapours of mixtures of these liquids in various
 proportions.       The condensed liquids returned to the boiler in such
 a manner as to keep up a continual circulation of liquid and vapour,
 and thus preserve a constant temperature.
      One hundred and twenty-three         solutions of different salts in
water, and moreover some simple liquids, such as water, ether,
 alcohol, benzole, sulphide of carbon, were thus investigated.         The
 numerical results obtained lead to the following conclusions : —
      (1) The refractive index varies considerably with the temperature.
 In the interval from 10° to 95° C, the variation of the index for
 saline solutions always amounts to hundredths.
     (2) The variation is greater the more concentrated the liquid.
      (3) The refractive power of saline solutions diminishes as the
temperature rises.        This diminution is about O'OO I for all the solu
tions I have examined between 10° and 95° C. The mean coeffi
cient which represents this variation of the refracting-power          most
frequently diminishes         as the concentration   of the solution in
creases ; sometimes it remains stationary ; at others, on the contrary,
it also increases ; but in all cases it varies much less than the index
with the concentration of the liquid.
     (4) The dispersion diminishes when the temperature increases :
the difference between the indices of the rays of a and b of the

               Intelligence  and Miscellaneous     Articles.          557
hydrogen spectrum diminishes by about 0'0003 between the limits
of 10° and 95° C. for water and aqueous solutions.
    (5) At the same temperature tlie refracting-power of solutions of
the same salt is less the more concentrated the solutions.       For each
salt dissolved the maximum of the refracting-power is equal to that
of distilled water, which is 07812 at 4° C.        Solutions equally con
centrated of different salts are far from having the same refracting-
power.      Thus a solution of chloride of calcium the standard of
which is 0-326 has a refracting-power higher than that of a solution
of nitrate of lime one-seventeenth as strong. There is, however, a
singular exception to this rule : solutions of chloride of lithium have
a higher refracting-power     than that of distilled water ; and the more
concentrated the solution, the higher it is.      These solutions are also
remarkable for their coefficient of expansion, which is less than that
of distilled water, and changes very little for considerable variations
in the standard of the liquid.
    Biot and Arago's law does not apply rigorously to saline solu
tions ; yet in most cases it is sufficiently close, and furnishes for
each solution a characteristic number representing its refracting-
power.     Of a hundred and twenty-three solutions which I investi
gated, there are only sixteen where the observed error exceeds the
probable limit of error, and of these sixteen there are fourteen where
it is exceeded by only a small quantity.      Only in the case of two
solutions of chloride of zinc is the discrepance between the calcu
lated and the observed results too great to be attributed to accidental
errors : the great affinity of chloride of zinc for water, and the
formation of different hydrates in the solution, explain sufficiently this
apparent anomaly.       Among the salts I have investigated, the solu
tions of two only (chloride and carbonate of lithium) have a refract
ing-power higher than the refracting-power of distilled water. —

               ON THE ESTIMATION       OF STAR-COLOURS.
                       BY SIDNEY   B. KINCAID,    ESQ.
    The author remarks that, with the exception of the two isolated
instances of Sirius and 95 Herculis, the latter of them due to the
researches of the late Admiral Smyth and the Astronomer Royal for
 Scotland, no crucial example of the change of the colour of a star
 has been determined, although there is every reason to believe that
 such objects vary as well, in their hues as in their apparent brillian
 cies.   That physical astronomy, which has made such strides in
 relation to the "variables," has done so little in the matter of side
 real chromatics is certainly not owing to any lack of interest on the
 part of the latter subject of inquiry, but is owing to the difficulties
 that beset any attempt at accurate chromatic observation.           Until
 the publication of the late Admiral's last work, which was specially
devoted to the " Colours of Double Stars," no general system for
 reducing such observations to permanent record in connexion with

  558            Intelligence  and Miscellaneous     Articles.
  perpetual standards of comparison had been introduced; and although
  a great step was taken by the suggestion to use a universally recog
  nized scale of colours as a point of reference (for which aim was
  given a chromic plate in the book), coupled with the mentioned use
  by Mr. Huggins of chemical solutions as such standards, many hin
  drances were left remaining; and in the great loss by Admiral
  Smyth's death shortly afterwards was probably included much fur
  ther progress towards their removal.
     The only instrumental means described by him, the photometrical
  measurement of the spectrum of the star so as to determine the
 lucidity of its different sections, is objectionable, as well by reason
  of its exceeding dependence on the occurrence of opportunities of
  weather not only " fine," but
                                      " superlatively fine," as by reason of
 the great and numerous difficulties which render the application of
 it almost impracticable.       The object of the author is to describe an
 apparatus   for  the   purpose of determining star-colours, by which the
 tints of the fixed stars may be exactly recorded relatively to standards
 easily reproducible by any observer, with any kind of telescope, any
 number of years hence, and that by a contrivance the manipulation
 and reading of which is as easy as the plans now usually adopted for
 photometric estimations.        But he first recapitulates the causes of
 error which particularly belong to this kind of research. These are : —
     1st. Personal Equation,       including therein three heads, which,
 although properly so described as belonging entirely to the persona
 lity of the observer, are actually distinct, viz.: —(A)That insensibility
 of the eye to the varieties of colour which in its most extreme form
 is colour-blindness.      (B) Inability of the memory to retain exactly
 the impression produced by a certain tint, so as to be capable of re
 producing and identifying it at a subsequent period.          (C) Personal
 difference in the habit of describing the impression of a particular
colour.
     2nd. Atmospheric equation.
     3rd. Instrumental Equation.         Good achromatic refracting tele
scopes are open to little imputation of deceit as regards the exhibi
 tion of the colours of celestial objects ; but the case is far otherwise
 with reflectors. The prevalence of excessive redness among Sir W.
 Herschel's chronicles of sidereal chromatics has long given rise to the
 opinion that the speculum-metal misled him in this respect ; and in
the same way silvered glass mirrors are not (without due correction)
reliable in any case where the colour of an object is to be accurately
depicted.
    4th. Standard of comparison.         The requisites in such are that it
shall afford the exact shade of colour of the star in connexion with
which it is to be used, so that such tint shall be easily reproducible
with precision by any observer at a future time from the information
transferred by the ordinary use of language, and that it shall be suit
able for comparison with telescopic images.            A painted scale like
that given in ' Sidereal Chromatics,' by Admiral Smyth, is, on ac
count of its opacity of colour, objectionable, and can scarcely claim
to be considered sufficiently reproducible.        Precious stones, though

                   Intelligence and Miscellaneous   Articles.          559
  in many    respects  suitable, are plainly beyond the reach of most ob
  servers  ;  and the only system which appears to possess the requisite
  qualification is that of chemical solutions, before referred to.
     The " Metrochrome," which it is the author's object to describe,
 is shown in side-section and by a face-view in two figures given in
 the original paper. It consists essentially of three parts : (1) a lan
 tern for the production of a constant light ; (2) a contrivance for
 imparting to that light the necessary colour, and so arranged that,
 the proper tinge once produced, a record of it can be obtained so as
 to enable it to be reproduced at any time ; (3) apparatus to throw that
 coloured light into the field of the telescope as an artificial star
 which can thus be viewed side by side with the image of the real one.
 The source of light is a very fine platinum wire, rendered incan
 descent by a current of electricity transmitted through it from a
 Smee's battery of two cells.       The platinum wire is brought into the
 focus of a lens, so that the rays of light from the lantern issue parallel,
 and therefore come to a focus, after passing through the object-glass
 of the telescope, at the same distance from it as those emitted by a
 star. The chromographic part of the apparatus consists of a drum
 rotating about an axis. The drum has in it six equidistant radial
 openings — the alternate three of them transmitting the normal light
 of the lantern, the other three constructed so as to admit flat-sided
 stoppered bottles coritaining chemical solutions of different colours.
The outer edge of each of the last-mentioned apertures is graduated
into ten parts, and each of them can be wholly or partially closed by
means of a radial shutter ; the other three apertures can be simulta
neously closed, wholly or partially, by a triune radial shutter: the
edge of one of them is divided into ten parts ; and as all are equally
affected by the movement of the shutter, the reading applies to the
three openings.        The drum is made to rotate so as to bring succes
sively the different apertures in front of the lantern ; and when the
rotation is sufficiently rapid, the impression of colour produced on
the retina of the eye will be that of a colour compounded of the co
lours of the solutions in the three alternate apertures, diluted by the
white light transmitted through the other three alternate apertures.
By a proper selection of the solutions, and adjustment of the magni
tude of the several apertures by means of the shutters, it will be pos
sible to produce the exact colour of a particular star ; and then the
record of the solutions employed, and of the dimensions of the several
apertures, will enable the exact reproduction of such colour at any
future period for comparison with the then colour of the star in
question.      The remaining part of the apparatus is a contrivance for
throwing the beam of coloured light into the telescope so as to pro
duce, as already mentioned, the image of an artificial coloured star.
