 I.  On the Construction    of certain new forms of Thermo-Barome-
                      ters.   By T. Tate, Esq.*
              instruments are highly useful on account of being
THESE     more  sensitive than the mercurial barometers.        The
thermo-barometer now commonly used is called a Sympieso-
meter by the instrument makers ; it consists of an upright tube
having a globe at the top bent downwards, and a cup at the
lower extremity bent upwards ; the globe is filled with hydrogen
gas ; and a liquid, usually strong sulphuric acid, stands in the
tube and cup.      The variations of the pressure of the atmosphere
are indicated by the elevation of the liquid in the tube, a cor
rection being made for the change of temperature.           For this
purpose there are two scales, one. moveable, called the barome
trical scale, the other fixed, called the thermometrical scale ;
the latter is graduated into degrees of temperature, and the
former into equal divisions representing inches and tenths of a
mercurial column.        Now the construction of this instrument
is not correct in principle ; for it is constructed on the assump
tion that the variations of atmospheric pressure are in pro
portion to the changes in the height of the column of liquid.
The globe is bent downwards to facilitate the graduation of the
thermometrical scale, which is used for giving the correction
for temperature : the globe being plunged into a water-bath,
brought to different degrees of heat, corresponding marks are
then made on the scale on a level with the liquid in the tube.
Now it will be observed that, in this process, the gas occupying
the tube is not brought to the temperature of the water-bath ;
whereas to have a correct scale of temperature, the whole volume
of gas, as well as the column of liquid, should be equally heated ;

2                 Mr. T. Tate on    the Construction  of
but to effect this with a sufficient degree of precision, in such a
position of the globe, would not only involve considerable prac
tical difficulties, but would also require the aid of a catheto-
meter.      This constitutes a serious defect in the instrument, for
the points in this scale should be determined with the greatest
possible precision.
                                                                 I
    In order to avoid these difficulties and sources of error, have
constructed a simple instrument of this kind in the following
manner    : —
    The instrument consists of a glass tube, A B, in-          „<-,
                                                                 1
serted in a light half-pint flask     A, the  connexion  at
e v being made air-tight ; a thermometrical scale mn
                                                               B
attached to the tube ; a moveable barometrical scale
CD; Qa piece of very thin india-rubber tied over
the top of the tube A B, to keep the external air from
 coming in contact with the strong sulphuric acid
occupying a portion of the tube and flask.             The
tube A B is about 24 inches long, and about |ths
 of an inch internal diameter; it is secured to the
flask in the following manner : — Two perforated
corks, e and v, fitting the neck of the flask, are
 placed on the tube; the lower one, e, is coated with
 a solution of india-rubber to render it impervious to
 air ; the upper cork, v, being raised a little, the cork
 e with the tube is pressed down to its proper depth ;
 some pieces of chemical cement, fusible at a gentle
 heat, are now placed above the cork e, and a gentle
 heat is applied until the cement melts; the upper
 cork v is then brought down to its place upon the melted cement ;
 when the cement has cooled, the tube will be found firmly fixed
 in the flask and perfectly air-tight.        Strong sulphuric acid of
 commerce is introduced through the tube by means of a pipette,
 the tube being held in an inclined position.
     N.B. All this process of cementing maybe obviated by having
 a globe and tube bent in the manner shown in the succeeding
 diagram ; but I preferred showing how the instrument may be
 constructed cheaply, and with materials which may be readily
 obtained.
     To form the scale    m n, a narrow strip of paper, about 10 inches
 long, may be attached     to the middle portion of the tube by means
 of a cement of liquid glue.       The scale D C may be formed of a
 thin lath covered with paper, about 10 inches in length ; it may
 be simply applied by the hand, or it may be made to slide against
  an upright board placed at the back of the tube.          These scales
  are graduated in the following manner : —
     The scale mn must be graduated at a time when the weather

                  certain new forms          of Thermo-Bawmeters.                             3
is settled, and when the mercury in the barometer indicates mean
pressure, or nearly mean pressure, that       about (p), or 29'5is,
inches. The liquid must be made to stand about the middle of
the stem at mean temperature (t), or 62°.      The flask      then                  is
placed   in  water-bath,
              a          which   brought   to different
                                             is         degrees of
temperature (^), say to 42°, 62°, and 82°, and marks are made
on the paper m n coincident with the level of the liquid in the
stem at these different temperatures   the spaces between these
                                                      ;
marks are respectively divided into twenty equal parts, thereby
forming intervals of degree. These divisions maybe extended,
                            1
if desirable, as the intervals are very nearly uniform (see for
mula 6).
  The lower part of the barometrical scale           must be gra      D
                                                                      C

the barometer stands at low column.

    This formula enables us to determine approximately the range
of the thermometrical scale, having given the capacity of the
flask, &c.  ; thus let
          v=m'        s=7'5> p=Z9'5>       h=u> <=62° 'i=92°
then we find ^ = 5 "8 ; again, for f1=32°, the other quantities
being as before, we find j,= — 5*8; therefore the range =11*6
inches.
    In like  manner formula (3) enables us to determine approxi
mately the range of the barometrical scale, having given the
range of the mercurial barometer; thus letp2=31 for the lower
part of the scale, and p2 = 28 for the upper part, the other quan
tities being as before, then we find the entire range = 10 inches
nearly.     Hence the length of the tube should not be less than
21"6 inches.      The range of this instrument, indicating atmo
spheric change of pressure, is about three times that of the
common barometer.
    The instrument which       I shall now describe has a range of 7£
times that of the common barometer, and is at the same time
strictly mathematical as regards the principle of construction,

an empirical principle of construction, such as that adopted in
the construction of the foregoing instrument.     have used this    I
new instrument for some time, and find that its indications
closely agree with those of the common barometer, excepting
when the atmosphere is in an unsettled state, and then the want
of agreement is clearly due to the resistances or sluggishness of
the mercurial column.

    The scales are graduated as follows : — The scale e r is formed
in exactly the same way as the thermometrical scale of the in
strument before described, — with this difference, that the gra
duations in this case are made when the tube S P is placed at an
angle of 45° to the horizon. The globe being placed in the
frame with its tube inclined at an angle of 45°, these marks of
temperature    are transferred  to the blade G K of the sliding
square and   numbered   accordingly, thus forming the thermome
trical scale m n. The specific gravity of mercury being taken at
7-5 times that of the sulphuric acid, a unit of 7*5 inches is taken
on each side of the central point p of the sliding scale D C,
and divided into 100 equal parts; then each of those parts,
or -075 of an inch, will read '01 of an inch of mercury ; and if
29-5 be the mean pressure at which the scale e r is made, the
point p will be numbered 29'5; and the point coinciding with
fifty of these divisions below the point     will correspond to 30
inches of mercury, and so on.
    The indications of this instrument are independent of the
volume of the globe, as well as of the section of the tube : the
        V
ratio   —
              only affects the range of the scales of temperature                    e   r
and m n, which are determined by direct experiment.         The su
periority of this instrument in point of accuracy over the one
previously described, depends on this circumstance, as well as
upon the great extent of its range.
   It will be readily seen that the level of the liquid in the globe
is not at all affected by any change of position. The adjust
ments for any pressure and temperature of the air being made,
it is obvious that the gas in the globe, having the same volume,
must also have the same pressure that it had at the same tempe
rature when the tube was in its normal position ; hence it follows
that the difference in the vertical column of liquid must exactly
indicate the change that has taken place in the pressure of the
atmosphere.     Thus let    be the vertical column of liquid at tl
temperature, and Pj pressure of gas in the globe when the tube
was in its normal position, that      when the atmospheric pres

and we are for the most part uncertain as to their real causes.
The importance, for the theory of electricity, of correctly under
standing these phaenomena, which are often very remarkable,
has induced me for some years past to submit them to a spe
cial examination.        Today  I   have the honour to lay before the
Physico-Mathematical Class          of the Royal Society of Sciences a
fifth memoir    f  of my electrical researches, containing the results
I  have obtained with respect to the flame of alcohol.           I  purpose
reserving   for   a  later  communication     the discussion   of the  phae
nomena which take place with other flames and with merely
glimmering bodies.
    The present memoir divides itself into two principal parts.
The first comprises the researches on the electric tensions and
currents observed in the flame of alcohol ; the second treats of
the conduction of flames, and more particularly of the so-called
unipolar conduction discovered by P. Erman.                I believe   I am
justified in saying that in both respects           I  have succeeded in
tracing back the phaenomena to their true cause ; and by means
of the simplicity thereby given to the results           I  have obtained,
it will be possible to give a brief and intelligible representation
of them.
    In order to observe and measure the electrical tensions,               I
made use of my electrometer          J ; and for the currents,     I used a
very sensitive galvanometer with 9960 coils, and an astatic system
 of two magnetic bars provided with a reflecting apparatus §.
    When the flame of an alcohol lamp is put in communication
with the earth by means of a wire dipped into the lamp, and a
metal is placed in, over, or near the flame, the latter generally
becomes electric.       When, on the other hand, the metal situated
in or above the flame is connected with the earth, and the lamp
insulated, the opposite electricity of the same tension is observed
on the wire immersed in the lamp.

 10        M. W. G. Hankel      on the Electric Deportment
     The nature and intensity of the electrical tension varies with
 the nature of the metal placed in the lamp, as well as with that
 of the metal above it.
    But the nature and intensity of the electrical tension varies
 also with the position of the metal above or in the flame.
 When a thin plate of metal, standing at a considerable height
 above the lamp, is made to approach the latter, so that it gra
 dually becomes more , deeply immersed in the flame and more
intensely heated, the electricity first observed varies with this
change of position and becomes more negative; or if at first
positive, approaches the negative condition more and more.       This
change may     amount   to  more than  the  electromotive force of an
element formed of zinc, platinum, and alcohol.
    No change of electric tension, however, takes place with the
change of position when the metal, on approaching or becoming
immersed in the flame, is prevented from taking a high tempe
rature by ice being placed upon it; or when, instead of a
metal, a jet of water is passed through the flame.
                           I
    Now in my memoir give positive proof, by means of mea
surements, that the electric tensions depend upon the act of
combustion only in so far as the gases and vapours of which the
flame consists form a conductor, which, like an ordinary liquid
conductor, is interposed between the metal situated in or above
the flame and the alcohol of the lamp.        The mere act of com
bustion does not produce electricity.
    The electricity observed on the metals situated in or above
the flame, is nothing more than the tension at the end or pole
of a galvanic element having the selected metals for the solid,
and the alcohol together with the heated gases of the flame for
the liquid conductor.
    The variations in the tensions as the metal gradually ap
proaches the flame, are due solely to the increased temperature
of the metal, and to the consequent change of its position in
the so-called tension-series.
    All metals by heating are moved towards the positive end of
the tension- series ; and when the metals are intensely heated, this
change in place may amount to more than the distance between
cold zinc and cold platinum, alcohol being employed as a liquid
conductor. For equal degrees of temperature, the amount of
this change is in all probability not very different in different
metals.
    If the ends or poles of the galvanic element, formed with
alcohol and flame as liquid conductors, upon which we formerly
observed free tensions, are joined together, an electric current is
produced in consequence of the electromotive power within the
circuit, whose direction is determined by the above tensions, and

                        of the Flame of Alcohol.                     11
whose intensity depends       also upon the resistance of the whole
circuit.
                                          I
    In the second part of my memoir determine by exact mea
surements the actions involved in the so-called unipolar conduc
tion. The surfaces of contact of both poles of an element with
the flame in connexion with the earth being equal, a small por
tion of positive electricity remains on the positive pole, whilst
the negative pole possesses the whole tension of the element
diminished by this small part.
    Neither the electricity produced in the pole-surfaces by con
ducting the flame to the earth, nor the tension conveyed to the
flame from one or more galvanic elements intentionally inter
polated between it and the earth, change the previous results.
The electrical tensions which appear at both poles are equal to
the sum of these electricities conveyed to the flame, and of the
tensions which would otherwise have existed there.
    If  the surface of one of the poles is increased, the tension of
this pole diminishes, whilst the tension of the opposite pole is
increased by the same amount.         Exactly the reverse of this takes
place    when   the surface  of  one of the poles is gradually with
drawn from the lamp.
     The case in which an electrical opposition already exists be
tween the metallic plates which serve as poles, required a special
explanation.       This led to an examination of the tensions at the
poles of an unclosed galvanic element, when one metal stands in
 a liquid opposite to two others which are of different electricities
 and joined by a conductor. The tension of such an element
 does not depend merely upon the position of the selected metals
 in the tension-series, but also upon the resistance of the liquid
 between the metals, or, to speak more correctly, upon the elec
 trical tension at the point of the tension-curve belonging to the
 current between the connected metals, where the third metal is
 immersed.
     An elevation of the temperature of the pole-surfaces exer
 cises just as little influence upon the above-mentioned phseno-
 mena as does their chemical nature.        Jets of water may be sub
 stituted for the metallic plates without producing any essential
 difference.     With certain modifications, therefore, the pheeno-
 mena of unipolar conduction also occur when the poles of a gal
 vanic element are connected, one by means of a metal, and the
 other by being led to the alcohol of the lamp, with the flame
 before it is put in communication with the earth.
     If, after introducing two equal pole-surfaces of a galvanic
 element into an insulated flame, the positive one is placed in
 communication with the earth, the flame receives a negative ten
 sion equal to the above-mentioned residue. When the negative

  12      On  the  Electric Deportment    of the Flame of Alcohol.
  pole is led to the earth, the flame receives a positive electricity
  equal in amount to the whole tension of the element dimi
 nished by the small residue in question.
     From what has already been said, it is easy to see in what
 manner the tensions imparted to the flame vary with the size of
 the conducting surfaces.
     All the phsenomena of unipolar conduction may be simply
 and completely explained by considering the tension-curve of the
 closed circuit in question.      In constructing this tension-curve,
 it will be remarked that the curve on the metallic conductors,
 on account of their comparatively small resistance, may be con
 sidered as running parallel to the abscissa-axis.        The same holds
 good approximately      for the principal  part of  the  flame. On the
 other hand, owing to the diminution of the cross section, a
 considerable resistance exists at the pole-surfaces in contact with
 the flame, and consequently the ordinates of the above curve are
 there perceptibly altered.      Another remarkable result, however,
 is that a peculiar and very considerable hinderance is opposed to
 the passage of negative electricity from solid or liquid conductors
 into the flame, or to the entry of positive from the latter into
 the conductors, which hinderance is diminished by enlarging the
 surface of the negative pole. Whilst, then, the tension-curve is
 nearly parallel to the abscissa-axis along the metallic conductors
 and the principal part of the flame, it sinks somewhat at the
positive pole, and at the negative through the whole remaining
 portion of the tension of the element.
    If, now, the flame is put in connexion with the earth, the metal
 of the positive pole must receive a positive tension equal to the
previous small depression, and the metal of the negative pole a
negative tension equal to the depression at this pole.
    If the positive pole is joined with the earth, a negative ten
sion is produced in the flame equal to the small depression at
the positive pole.      Lastly, if the negative pole is joined with the
earth, the flame shows a positive tension equal to the greater
depression at the negative pole.
    The greater resistance which my experiments establish when
negative electricity passes into the hot rarefied gases of the flame,
also occurs, according to Ed. Becquerel, when an electric current
passes through very intensely heated air.          I  further show how
the fact leads to an explanation of the peculiar phenomena ob
served by Gaugain, when the two opposite currents of an induc
tion apparatus pass through rarefied air.
    The greater resistance at the negative pole explains too, lastly,
why a current ascends and descends the flame with different
degrees   of facility.
    When Andrews placed        a spiral of platinum over the flame of

           Mr. R. P. Greg         on several New            British Minerals.          13
a gas-lamp and joined it to one of the poles of a voltaic battery,
and the metallic tube of the lamp to the other, the current
passed more easily from the spiral through the flame to the lamp
than in the opposite direction. When a thin plate of platinum
is placed above the flame of an alcohol lamp, and one pole of
one or more elements is joined to                     it,
                                             and the other to      wire            a
immersed in the alcohol of the lamp, the effects are more pre
cisely the following —     :      If
                              the thin plate of platinum       situated       is
high  above  the  flame,  the current  passes more   easily downwards
through the flame than upwards            the thiu plate of platinum
                                                 ;   if
is made to approach the flame,        position will be found in which
                                             a
the current passes equally well in both directions at               still ;        a
greater proximity, the flame passes, on the contrary, more easily
upwards than downwards.          The ratio of the intensities of the
currents conducted in opposite directions varies according to the
strength of the current.
   The explanation of the effects just described must be sought
in the peculiar resistance, before mentioned, at the negative pole.
At higher positions of the plate above the lamp, the conduction
of the flame    ismore perfect on the side of the wire at lower            ;
positions this conduction         more perfect on the side of the
                                       is
plate;  and   the current   which passes through the flame between
the plate and the lamp must always possess greater intensity
when the negative pole acquires         relatively better conduction,
                                                  a
since its resistance      is
                         thereby  diminished.

the best which afford the least. Upon this hypothesis, increased
transverse sectional area in the same metal diminishes resistance
by allowing the transmission of a larger quantity in a given time.
The practical determination of the relative conducting capabili
ties of different metals, or of different samples of the same metal,
has generally been accomplished by the comparison of galvano-
 metric or electro-magnetic effects ; but    I am not aware of any
 course of experiments which have been undertaken with a view
 to trace any connexion, or institute any comparison, between the
 thermal effects of the voltaic current on metals and their con
 ducting powers as thus indicated, or to work out any scale of
 the conducting powers of metals, based simply upon the thermal
 effects of the voltaic current upon them.
     In 1826 Sir W. S. Harris communicated to the Royal Society
 the result of a series of experiments with his thermo-electrometer
 for determining the relative conducting power of metals for the
 Leyden discharge.         His experiments were based upon the
 assumption     that metals    are heated by equal discharges of elec
 tricity through them, from an electrical jar or battery, in pro
 portion to the resistance which they offer to its passage ; hence
 their relative conducting powers in the scale were considered to
 be inversely as their thermometric indications.         Thus in passing
 a carefully measured shock through wires of various metals, all
  of precisely the same diameter and length, stretched through
 the bulb of an air-thermometer, the relative degrees of heat in
  dicated upon the scale are shown in the following Table, extracted
 from the Philosophical Transactions of 1827 : —

      In the year 1827 thought of using this thermo-electrometer
  for determining the relative conducting powers of metals for
  voltaic electricity, and was pleased, on applying a single pair of
  plates to it for the first time, to find its indications extremely
  regular, the fluid rising constantly to the same point at each
  successive contact, and remaining almost permanent as long as
  contact was maintained.        The instrument, however, appeared to
  require some few modifications to adapt it more particularly to

16          Mr.  J. N. Hearder on Electrical Conductivity.
voltaic purposes; and after various trials I adopted the form
which   I have described in the Philosophical Magazine for May
1857. The metals were all drawn into wires of the same size,
and the same lengths were used in each experiment.
                                   I
   The voltaic batteries which used were formed upon the prin
ciple of Dr. Hare's calorimotor and coil batteries.        One modifi
cation consisted of a plate of zinc 6 inches wide and 6 feet in
length, coiled with a similar plate of copper between its convolu
tions so as to maintain a sphere of half an inch between the cop
per and zinc, the last coil of copper being made entirely to
enclose the end of the zinc, so that the copper plate was about
six inches longer than the zinc.        Both surfaces of each metal
were thus opposed to the action of the others.         A second form
consisted of   a similar area of zinc and copper cut into plates of
6 inches square, and fastened alternately in grooves in a wooden
frame at a distance of half an inch from each other, the two end
plates being copper.       All the zinc plates were united on one side,
and all the copper plates on the other, thus forming a single
pair equal in surface and, as ascertained by experiment, equal in
effect to the coil just described.     These batteries were suspended
over a wooden trough by counterbalancing weights, which ad
mitted of their being immersed either wholly or to any depth in
the acid.
   The exciting fluid consisted, by measure, of sulphuric acid 1
part, nitric acid 1 part, and water 120.           Stout flexible wires
proceeded from the battery to the thermo-electrometer,          and the
battery was plunged in the acid at each experiment           and  raised
again as soon as it was concluded.           The results which   I shall
have to detail are rather incomplete in their character, as they
are merely the remains of some scattered memoranda, a great
number of which were mislaid owing to the accident which some
two or three years after deprived me of sight.           I am induced,
however, to publish such as        I have, since I cannot discover in
my intercourse with electricians that the facts are even now
generally known.       I  briefly alluded to these experiments on a
former occasion (see paper " On Induction Coil
                                                       " in the Philo
sophical Magazine, May 1857, p. 332, note).
   I  shall forbear to enter into the rationale of the phsenomena,
but allow the simple facts to be taken for as much as they are
worth.
   In my first series of experiments I was met by the curious fact,
that the order in which the metals were heated by the voltaic
arrangements which       I employed, was the reverse of that which
took place with the Leyden discharge ; that is to say, the best
conductors    were the most heated, and the worst the least, as will
be seen    by the following Table, in which the length of wire

employed in each experiment was 3-5 inches, and its size about
No. 26 wire-gauge.         The numbers given are the mean of six
experiments, the variation in them not exceeding more than 2
or 3 degrees : —

    These experiments were repeated at different times with the
 same wires and with the same-relative results.
    Since the best conductors were the most heated in these ex
 periments, it seemed to follow that, with any single metal, larger
 wires would be heated more than small ones ; and this              I found
 to be the case up to the largest size that could be inserted into
 the electrometer, viz. No. 15 wire-gauge.            I  regret that a scale
 of these results with copper wires from No. 15 to No. 36 has
 been lost, but it showed a curious coincidence between the tem
  perature and the mass of metal.          This remarkable inversion of
 their relative order as compared with the results obtained by the
  Leyden discharge, whilst it showed a consistency with itself
  which left no room to attribute it to any error in manipulation,
  yet seemed to exhibit such an inconsistency with preconceived
  notions of the laws of electrical conduction, that         I  was induced
  to vary the experiments in the following manner.
     Instead of introducing the several metallic wires in succession
  into the bulb of the thermo-electrometer,        I used them externally,
  causing them to form part of the circuit between it and the bat
  tery, and employing in the electrometer simply a copper wire
  much stouter than those under examination. The following
  Table gives the results, the same wires being used as before : —

    Note. — The battery being applied to the electrometer without
 any of the wires in circuit, the fluid in the stem rose to 176°.
    These experiments were repeated at various intervals with
 wires made indiscriminately from such samples as were at hand,
 though not with any idea of testing variations in the conducting
 power of different samples of the same metal ; hence the relation
 between the order of the results was not always the same, as will
 be seen by the following set of experiments, in which a different
 set of wires were employed : —

    The discrepancy in these results, though perplexing at the
time, is now easily accounted for, when it is considered that even
samples of copper wire vary as much in their conducting power
as 50 to 120.
    On employing two electrometers in consecutive circuit, in
one of which was inserted a stout copper wire, and in the other
 the various metals in succession, it was curious to observe the
fluid stand highest in both when the best conductors were used,
 and lowest with the worst; whilst on employing a similar
arrangement for transmitting the charge of an electrical batteiy
the order was reversed, each electrometer giving the highest
when the other gave the lowest results.
    Whilst experimenting on one occasion with the various wires
externally to the electrometer, I had the curiosity to bring my
finger in contact with the wire to ascertain its temperature.         I

On      the   Motions and Collisions of Perfectly Elastic Spheres.                    19
remarked that every time I touched it the fluid in the electro
meter rose, indicating an increase of temperature, and implying
also an increase of conducting power in the metal thus touched.
I  found that this was owing to a reduction of its temperature ;
for on subsequently moistening it with ether, water, &c, or by
blowing upon                it,
                    the fluid rose in the electrometer as the tem
perature was reduced, whilst the application of spirit-lamp to               a
increase the temperature of the wire produced          corresponding     a
fall in the thermometer.      Two electrometers were subsequently
employed in circuit, the same current passing consecutively
through them.       To one of the electrometers       second battery     a
 was applied.    The result was an increase of temperature of the
 included wire and discovered that,
                        ;         I                           by
                                             raising or lowering the
 second battery so as to gradually increase or diminish the tem
 perature of one of the wires, the fluid as     rose and fell in that
                                                                   it

 oth,er, so that as one rose the other fell, and vice versd.
    Although these experiments were made more than thirty
 years since,    am induced to believe that they may still appear
                       I
 novel to some, since, in      conversation  a short time since with
                                                               a
 one of the first electricians of the day, he would scarcely credit
 them, alleging that they were contrary to all our experience                         ;
 they must, however, be taken as indicating only the results due
 to the peculiar arrangements and conditions herein described.

CO     many of the properties of matter, especially when in the
^     gaseous form, can be deduced from the hypothesis that
their minute parts are in rapid motion, the velocity increasing
with the temperature, that the precise nature of this motion
becomes    subject of rational curiosity. Daniel Bernouilli, Hera-
                   a
path, Joule, Kronig, Clausius, &c. have shown that the relations
between pressure, temperature, and density in       perfect gas can      a
be explained      supposingby the  particles to move with uniform
velocity in straight lines, striking against the sides of the con
taining vessel and thus producing pressure.          not necessary      It   is
to suppose each particle to travel to any great distance in the
same straight line    for the effect in producing pressure will be
                                  ;

    20           Prof. Maxwell on    the Motions and Collisions
    of the particles, and the distance between the centres of two par
   ticles when collision takes place. We have at present no means
   of ascertaining either of these distances ; but certain phenomena,
    such as the internal friction of gases, the conduction of heat
   through a gas, and the diffusion of one gas through another,
   seem to indicate the possibility of determining accurately the
   mean length of path which a particle describes between two suc
   cessive collisions.     In order to lay the foundation of such inves
                                                   I
   tigations on strict mechanical principles, shall demonstrate the
   laws of motion of an indefinite number of small, hard, and per
   fectly elastic spheres acting on one another only during impact.
       If  the properties of such a system of bodies are found to cor
   respond to those of gases, an important physical analogy will be
   established, which may lead to more accurate knowledge of the
  properties of matter.       If experiments on gases are inconsistent
  with the hypothesis of these propositions, then our theory,
  though consistent with itself, is proved to be incapable of ex
  plaining the phsenomena of gases.          In either case it is necessary
  to follow out the consequences of the hypothesis.
      Instead of saying that the particles are hard, spherical, and
  elastic, we may if we please say that the particles are centres of
  force, of which the action is insensible except at a certain small
  distance, when it suddenly appears as a repulsive force of very
  great intensity.      It is evident that either assumption will lead
  to the same results.       For the sake of avoiding the repetition of
 a long phrase about these repulsive forces,         I shall proceed upon
 the assumption of perfectly elastic spherical bodies.           If we sup
 pose     those  aggregate   molecules   which  move   together   to have a
 bounding surface which is not spherical, then the rotatory mo
 tion of the system will store up a certain proportion of the whole
 vis viva, as has been shown by Clausius, and in this way we may
 account for the value of the specific heat being greater than on
 the more simple hypothesis.
        On   the Motion and Collision of Perfectly Elastic Spheres.
     Prop. I. Two spheres moving in opposite directions with velo
 cities inversely as their masses strike one another ; to determine
their motions after impact.
     Let P and Q be the position
of the centres at impact; AP,
B Q the directions and magni
tudes of the velocities before
impact ; P a, Q b the same after
impact; then, resolving the ve
locities parallel and perpendi
cular to P Q the line of cen
tres, we find that the velocities parallel to the line of centres are

                                  of Perfectly Elastic Splieres.                                         21
exactly reversed, while those perpendicular to that line are un
changed.      Compounding these velocities again, we find that the
velocity   of each ball is the same before and after impact, and
that the directions before and after impact lie in the same plane
with the line of centres, and make equal angles with it.
    Prop.        II.
                To find the probability of the direction of the velo
city  after impact lying between given limits.
    In order that a collision may take place, the line of motion of
one of the balls must pass the centre of the other at a distance
less than the sum of their radii ; that           must pass through      is,   it
a  circle whose centre     that of the other ball, and radius
                                       is                         the                              (s)
sum of the radii of the balls. Within this circle every position
is equally probable, and therefore the probability of the distance
from the centre being between        and     dr  r               r    +           is
                                                 2rdr
Now let     be the angle APa between the original direction and
                 <f>
the direction after impact, then APN = ^<£, and r=ssin^<£, and
the probability becomes
                                            |  sin     <f>   d<f>.
The    area       of spherical zone between the angles of polar distance

     and   <f>   + d<f>     is      a-
                                             27r sin     (j>   d(f>
                                                                     ;
therefore     be any small area on the surface of
                 if    co                          sphere, radius                       a
unity, the  probability of   the  direction  of rebound   passing
through this area                 is
                                                 co
so  that the probability       independent of
                                        is      that   all directions      <f>,         is,
of rebound are equally likely.
   Prop.         III.
                  Given the direction and magnitude of the veloci
ties  of  two  spheres before impact, and the line of centres at im
pact  ;  to find the velocities after impact.
     Let   O     A,    0    B    re
present          the veloci
ties before impact,
so that   there had
           if
been no action be
tween the bodies
they would have
been at   andBattheendof second. Join
           A                                 a     and let   be their     A        B,         G
centre of gravity, the position of  which      not affected     their    is                       by
mutual action.    Draw        parallel to the line of centres at im
                                        G
                                        N
pact (not necessarily in the plane     OB). Draw aGb in the  A

 22           Prof. Maxwell     on the Motions and Collisions
 plane AGN, making N G a=N GA, and G a = G A and Gb= GB,
 then by Prop. I. G a and G b will be the velocities relative to G ;
 and compounding these with O G, we have 0 a and 0 b for the
 true velocities after impact.
     By Prop. II. all directions of the line a G b are equally pro
 bable.     It appears therefore that the velocity after impact is
 compounded of the velocity of the centre of gravity, and of a
 velocity equal to the velocity of the sphere relative to the centre of
 gravity, which may with equal probability be in any direction
 whatever.
     If a great many equal spherical particles were in motion in
 a perfectly elastic vessel, collisions would take place among the
 particles, and their velocities would be altered at every collision ;
 so that after a certain time the vis viva will be divided among the
 particles according to some regular law, the average number of
 particles whose velocity lies between certain limits being ascer
 tainable, though the velocity of each particle changes at every
 collision.
     Prop. IV. To find the average number of particles whose velo
 cities lie between given limits, after a great number of collisions
 among a great number of equal particles.
     Let N be the whole number of particles.           Let x, y, z be the
 components     of the  velocity  of each particle  in three rectangular
 directions,   and  let the  number    of particles for which x lies be
 tween x and x + dx be Nf{x)dx, where f(x) is a function of x to
 be determined.
    The number of particles for which y lies between y and y + dy
 will be Nf{y)dy ; and the number for which z lies between z and

     Now the existence of the velocity x does not in any way affect
 that of the velocities y or z, since these are all at right angles to
 each other and independent, so that the number of particles
 whose velocity lies between x and x + dx, and also between y and
y + dy, and also between z and z + dz, is
                         KfWMMdxdydz.                .
If we   suppose the N particles to start from the origin at the
same instant, then this will be the number in the element of
volume (dxdydz) after unit of time, and the number referred to
unit of volume will be
But the directions of the coordinates are perfectly arbitrary, and
therefore this number must depend on the distance               from the
origin alone, that is

      If we make A positive, the number of particles will increase
 with the velocity, and we should find the whole number of par
 ticles infinite.      We therefore make A negative and equal to
        5, so that the number between x and x + dx is

Whence we may draw the following conclusions : —
      1st. The number of particles whose velocity, resolved in            a cer
tain direction, lies between x and x + dx is

     3rd. To find the mean value of v, add the velocities of all the
particles together and divide by the number of particles; the
result is
                          mean velocity       = -^L                          (3)

     This is greater than the square of the mean velocity, as it
ought to be.
     It appears from this proposition that the velocities are distri
buted among the particles according to the same law as the
errors are distributed among the observations in the theory of
the " method of least squares."             The velocities range from 0 to
co , but the number of those having great velocities is compara
tively small. In addition to these velocities, which are in all
directions equally, there may be a general motion of translation

call the one the motion of translation, and the other the motion
of agitation.
    Prop. V. Two systems of particles move each according to the

    Let there be N particles of the first system, and N' of the
second, then NN' is the whole number of such pairs.               Let us
consider the velocities in the direction of x only; then by
Prop. IV. the number of the first kind, whose velocities are be
tween x and x + dx, is

The number of the second kind, whose velocity is between x + y

Now    x  may have any value from — oo to +oo consistently with
the difference of velocities being between y and y + dy; therefore
integrating between these limits, we find
                            V/irrm

    This expression, which is of the same form with (1) if we put
NN' for N, aa+/32 for a2, and y for x, shows that the distribu
tion of relative velocities is regulated by the same law as that of
the velocities themselves, and that the mean relative velocity is
the square root of the sum of the squares of the mean velocities
of the two systems.
    Since the direction of motion of every particle in one of the
systems may be reversed without changing the distribution of
velocities, it follows that the velocities compounded of the velo
cities of two particles, one in each system, are distributed accord
ing to the same formula (5) as the relative velocities.

Multiplying together (19), (20), and (21), and M,               we   find the
momentum     at impact
                        MN^(n2/*-*V"/fed».
Integrating with respect to z from 0 to nl, we get
                            £MNt;4   ne~n dn.
Integrating with respect to n from 0 to         oo ,   we get
                        £MNi>*
for the momentum     in the direction of z of the striking particles ;
the momentum of the particles after impact is the same, but in
the opposite direction; so that the whole pressure on unit of area
is twice this quantity, or
                         p=±MNv*                                           (22)
  This value of p is independent of / the length of path.  In
applying this result to the theory of gases, we put MN=p, and
v*=3k, and then
                         p=kp,
which is Boyle and Mariotte's law.           By (4) we have
                            i>2=fa2,     .-. a*=2k                 (23)
   We have     seen   that, on the hypothesis of elastic particles
 moving in straight lines, the pressure of a gas can be explained
 by the assumption that the square of the velocity is proportional
 directly to the absolute temperature, and inversely to the specific
 gravity of the gas at constant temperature, so that at the same
pressure and temperature the value of NMi>2 is the same for all
 gases.    But we found in Prop. VI. that when two sets of par
ticles communicate agitation to one another, the value of Mv* is
 the same in each.      From this it appears that N, the number of
particles  in unit of  volume, is the same for all gases at the same
pressure and temperature.         This result agrees with the chemical
law, that equal volumes of gases are chemically equivalent.
    We have next to determine the value of /, the mean length of
the path of a particle between consecutive collisions.       The most
direct method of doing this depends upon the fact, that when
different strata of a gas slide upon one another with different ve
locities, they act upon one another with a tangential force tend
ing to prevent this sliding, and similar in its results to the fric
tion between two solid surfaces sliding over each other in the
same way.      The explanation of gaseous friction, according to
our hypothesis,   is,  that particles having the mean velocity of
translation belonging to one layer of the gas, pass out of        intoit
                                                                            it by
another layer having    a  different velocity of translation   and
                                                                 ;
striking against the particles of the second layer, exert upon

                      of Perfectly Elastic    Spheres.                31
a tangential force which constitutes the internal friction of the
gas.     The whole friction between two portions of gas separated
by a plane surface, depends upon the total action between all the
layers on the one side of that surface upon all the layers on the
other side.
    Prop.    XIII.  To find the internal friction in a system of moving
particles.
     Let the system be divided into layers parallel to the plane of
xy, and let the motion of translation of each layer be u in the
direction of x, and let u=A + Bz. We have to consider the
 mutual action between the layers on the positive and negative
 sides of the plane xy.      Let us first determine the action between
two layers dz and dz1, at distances z and — z' on opposite sides
 of this plane, each unit of area. The number of particles which,
 starting from dz in unit of time, reach a distance between nl and
 (n + dn)l is by (19),
                              N  j e~n dz dn.
 The number of these which have the ends of their paths in the
 layer dz1 is
                             N -^5    e~n dz dz1 dn.
 The mean velocity in the direction of x which each of these has
 before impact is A + Bz, and after impact A + Bz'; and its mass
 is M, so that a mean momentum =MB(^-^) is communicated
 by each particle. The whole action due to these collisions is
 therefore
                      NMB ~p {z-z,)e-n         dz dz1 dn.
     We must first integrate with respect to z' between z*=0 and
 z,=z—nl; this       gives
                      £NMB       ~ {nH*-z*)e-ndzdn
 for the action between the layer dz and all the layers below the
 plane xy.       Then integrate from z=0 to z=nl,
                            |MNBk*e-"&.
  Integrate from n=0 to w = oo, and we find the whole            friction
 between unit of area above and below the plane to be

therefore the mean velocity i>=1505 feet per second, then the
value of I, the mean distance travelled over by a particle between
consecutive collisions, = ^-/(joo^ of an inch, and each particle
makes 8,077,200,000 collisions per second.
    A remarkable result here presented to us in equation (24), is
that if this explanation of gaseous friction be true, the coefficient
of friction is independent of the density. Such a consequence of
a mathematical theory is very startling, and the only experiment
I  have met with on the subject does not seem to confirm it. We
must next compare our theory with what is known of the diffusion
of gases, and the conduction of heat through a gas.

  VI.    On  the different States    of Silicic Acid.   By M. H. Rose *.
                        determinations of the density of silicic acid,
 NUMEROUS and especially    those of Count Schaffgotsch, prove that
 there exist two distinct modifications of this acid, one of which
 has a density of 2 6, whilst in the other the density rises to 2 2,
 or 2-3. The first is always crystallized, or more or less crystal
 line, the second always amorphous.
     Crystallized silica is found not only in rock-crystal, quartz,
 amethyst, sandstone, and quartzose sand, but also in a great
 number of the varieties of silica, in appearance compact, but
 really formed of an aggregation of crystalline particles, as their
 property of polarizing light proves — such are chalcedony, chryso-
 prase, jasper, flint, and certain siliceous woods.          Some of these
 varieties may contain traces of water or foreign matter, which
 make their density vary a little, without, however, causing the
 same to fall below 2"6.
     The chemical and physical properties of all these substances
 are exactly the same.       If crystallized   quartz seems to resist some-

what more the action of chemical agents, such as hydrofluoric acid
or caustic potash, it is easy to see that this slight difference depends
only upon the great cohesion which a more perfect crystallization
determines.       In fact, rock-crystal and silica, Doth reduced to an
extremely    fine   powder, do not present any difference.          It is
almost beyond doubt that the varieties of compact and crystal
line silica, such as flint, agate, and siliceous woods, have been
formed in the humid way. The preservation of the ligneous
structure in these last, the presence of infusoria in flint, signal
ized by Ehrenberg, the transformation of a great number of
fossils into flint, are sufficient proofs.     A great number of facts
also prove that rock-crystal and ordinary quartz, which have the
same density, can only have been formed in the humid way,
or at least by the influence of water.
     We have succeeded by various modes of treatment, but only
in the humid way, in obtaining crystallized silicic acid in the
form of quartz. M. de Senarmont has obtained this result by
heating, in a closed vessel at 200° or 300°, a solution of silicic
acid in water acidulated by carbonic or hydrochloric acid.
     M. Daubree has obtained silica in a crystalline state by the
action of the vapour of water on chloride or fluoride of silicium at
a red heat ; afterwards he obtained it in distinct crystals by the
action of water upon glass, under the influence of an elevated
temperature and high pressure.
     The frequent association, in several formations, of crystallized
quartz with silica in a compact crystalline state, also shows that
it must have been formed in the humid way.
     On the contrary, notwithstanding several attempts, we have
never succeeded in obtaining by means of heat crystallized or
compact crystalline silica.
     But the strongest argument against the supposition that quartz
 has passed through the state of igneous fusion before its crystal
 lization, is found in the fact that quartz passes by fusion into
 the amorphous condition whose density is 2-2.
     The fusion of quartz has often been effected, by Davy, Clarke,
 Stromeyer, and Marcet, more recently also by Gaudin and De-
 ville. In every case, after this fusion, silica is completely amor
 phous and vitreous, its density being 2*2. If the objection is
 raised, that fused quartz might have passed into a crystalline
 state by an extremely slow cooling, one may reply that it is im
 possible that a granitic mass can have cooled with the same slow
 ness throughout its whole extent ; there must necessarily have
 heen portions exposed to a more rapid cooling ; so that here and
 there the amorphous modification of quartz ought to be found.
 But its presence has never been detected in rocks. It has some
  times been supposed that the crystallization might have been

  34       Prof. H. Hose   on the different States of Silicic Acid,
  produced by the action of a very elevated temperature below
  the point of fusion, as occurs sometimes in the devitrification
  and crystallization of glass.      Some experiments of Prof. Rose
  show the equal impossibility of sustaining this view.        These ex
 periments     were  made in a porcelain kiln, where the temperature
  rises to and remains during eighteen hours at about 2000° Centi
  grade (according to M. Eisner), after which the substances thus
 heated cool very slowly.
      A crystal of quartz perfectly transparent did not undergo any
 alteration by this test; its density of 2 "651 was afterwards found
 to be 2 650.       A crystal of the same quartz, the angularity of
 which was intact, but the inferior extremity of which was cracked,
  did not sustain any alteration in the intact portion, but became
 whitish and brittle in the part which was already fissured. Those
 portions which had become opaline, possessed a density of 2'613,
 which indicated the passage of the quartz to a modification less
 dense.     Lastly, a crystal of very pure quartz was submitted to
 the same test, after having been previously reduced to a very fine
 powder.       This powder subsided considerably, without however
 cohering, and its density fell to 2394. It was exposed a second
 time in the furnace, and the density became 2"329.
     A fragment of blackish flint, density 2-591, was submitted to
the same process.       Without changing its form, it became white
 and capable of very easy pulverization. The density of an entire
fragment was found to be 2"218 ; that of the fine powder
2237.
     It results from these experiments that crystallized silica passes
gradually into the amorphous modification when it is exposed to
an elevated temperature below its point of fusion.           They prove
also that a more perfect crystalline state opposes a greater
resistance to this transformation, as it does to the action of
solvents.
     The amorphous modification is not produced merely by the
action of great heat upon crystallized silica ; it is obtained also on
fusing the same with an alkali and afterwards decomposing the
alkaline silicate by an acid, and generally whenever a natural or
artificial silicate is decomposed by an acid.
     Here the author signalizes various phsenomena which are ob
served during this decomposition.        Sometimes the silica remains
in solution, sometimes it becomes separated in the pulverulent
state, sometimes it determines the coagulation of the liquor into
a gelatinous mass.       He also signalizes the influence of calcina
tion on certain silicates, — sometimes rendering undecomposable
by acids those which were previously decomposed with facility,
sometimes, on the contrary, facilitating their decomposition.
These facts have led certain chemists to suppose the existence of

                     and on the Origin   of Granites.                   3j
two distinct modifications of silicic acid in silicates.      Whatever
the value of this hypothesis may be, it results from the experi
ments of M. Rose, that, whatever may be the condition in which
silica presents itself at the time of the decomposition of the sili
cates by acids, it possesses always the same properties.               Its
density is about 2-2, and rises to 2"3 by a somewhat prolonged
calcination.
    The silica produced by the action of water on the gaseous
fluoride of silicium, presents the same characters.
    The shells of infusoria are also formed of amorphous silica of a
density of 2-2, rising to 2"3 by calcination in a porcelain kiln.
    The two modifications of silica are not merely distinguished
by their density ; they differ very much in the resistance which
they oppose to solvents.      Solutions of caustic alkalies and alka
line carbonates, as well as hydrofluoric acid, dissolve the amorphous
silica with very great facility when compared with crystalline
silica ; this remark applies also to quartz rendered amorphous by
fusion, as well as to amorphous silica obtained in the humid way.
    Amorphous silica is found in nature in the form of opal and
hyalite.     These minerals possess a density of about 2-14 to
2-16. But these rather low numbers depend upon the fissured
structure of the minerals ; for when their density is determined
after having reduced them to a very fine powder, it is found to
be about    22.
    Although opal is frequently found in plutonic rocks, as in
basalts, it has probably not been formed there in a fused mass,
but rather been produced by the prolonged action of water on
the rocks. Besides, it is also found in rocks which certainly
have not had an igneous origin —in the interior of fossils for
instance.     It is very often associated with the variety of silica
whose density is 2'6.     It has probably been formed by the soli
dification of a deposit of gelatinous silica, whilst the crystalline
variety might have resulted from the slow deposit of silica in
actual solution.
    That which is sometimes found in the crevices of crucibles of
blast furnaces, may be signalized as a particular variety of silica.
M. Rose having examined some specimens, remarks that they
all disengaged traces of ammonia when fused with caustic
potash, whilst they disengaged nothing by simple calcination.
This fact proves that this silica contains a little nitruret of silicium,
and indicates that it must have been formed by the combustion
of silica mixed with some of the nitruret.         According to this it
was very unlikely that it belonged to the crystalline variety.         In
fact M. Rose found its density only equal to 1*842 ; though it is
true that this determination was made only upon a very small
mass.

 36     Prof. H. Rose    on the different States  of Silicic Acid,
    Thus, en resume, we are obliged to admit the existence of two
 distinct modifications of silica, — one amorphous, the density of
 which varies from 2-2 to 2*3 ; the other crystallized, the density
 of which is 2"6.    This last is formed in the humid way alone,
 or at least in presence of water ; the first is produced either in
 the humid way or by fusion.           Crystallized silica is the only
 kind found in granite.
    It is impossible not to be struck with the importance of these
 facts for the discussion of the theories proposed to account for
 the origin of granites.    Accordingly the author treats this im
 portant question   in detail.
    It is known that the theory of Werner on the Neptunian
 origin of granite was afterwards completely abandoned by geo
 logists, and replaced by the Plutonic theory. The latter, however,
 has always met with adversaries, especially among chemists, and
 seems to have been shaken more and more during the last few
 years. MM. Fuchs, G. Bischoff, and more recently M. Delesse,
 particularly deserve to be mentioned as having most contributed
 to raise doubts as to the tenability of this theory.
    Fuchs especially bases his objections upon the simultaneous
 presence in granite of minerals the points of fusion of which are
 extremely different, and upon their reciprocal penetration, which
 does not permit one to doubt their simultaneous formation. He
 attributes also considerable weight to the absence, in granite and
 analogous rocks, of vitreous matter which ought to be found in
  the productions of an igneous fusion.
    Bischoff was in like manner led to reject the hypothesis of the
 igneous origin of granite by the fact that in this rock felspar, an
 element rather fusible, is generally encrusted in mineral quartz,
 almost infusible ; the felspar, consequently, solidified first, which
is inexplicable on the hypothesis of a crystallization produced by
the cooling of a melted mass.        But he forms his opinion also on
the considerations drawn from the study of all the elements of
 granite.
    One of the elements of granite, felspar, can be artificially ob
tained either in the humid or dry way.       Daubree has succeeded in
producing a crystallized felspar similar to that of the trachytes by
the action of water on obsidian or clay in the presence of an alkali,
under the influence of a high temperature and great pressure.
With respect to its production by means of ignition, it was
accidentally   observed in the remains of a copper furnace at
Sangershausen, but we have not yet succeeded in obtaining it at
will ; by the fusion of felspar or its elements and by a slow cool
ing, only vitreous matters have been obtained.           This formation
of felspar is therefore possible, but it seems to require a com
bination of circumstances difficult to realize.

                      qnd on the Origin   of Granites.                 37
    The numerous pseudomorphous felspars in the forms of anal-
 cime and Laumonite, described by Scacchi, Haidinger, Bischoff,
 and Rammelsberg, prove moreover that this mineral is easily
 formed in nature in the humid way.
    Mica can also be produced in both ways. The pseudomor
 phous micas, in the forms of scapolite, felspar, and Andalusite,
 show the possibility of its formation under the influence of water.
 On the other hand, its presence in the lava of Vesuvius proves
 that it can also be formed in the igneous way.        But there seems
to be an essential difference in the composition of mica, corre
 sponding to these two opposite origins.
    Most of the micas, and particularly that of granite, contain
 small quantities of water and fluorine which are dissipated by
calcination, so that the crystals become opake and lose their
brightness.     On the contrary this does not occur with the vol
canic micas, which contain neither water nor fluorine.              This
observation seems to establish the fact that the mica of granites
must have been formed under the influence of water, and not of
heat.
    But it is the examination      of the quartzose elements which
especially  forces us  to reject the  hypothesis of the igneous origin
of granite. It is recognized that quartz in. granite generally
moulds itself on crystals of felspar, and consequently has crystal
lized last of all, which fact is inexplicable on the hypothesis of a
previous fusion.      The attempt has been made to reply to this
objection, by supposing that fused quartz might remain liquid
at a temperature inferior to its point of fusion ; hence the theory
of surfusion of    M. Fournet.       But, as M. Durocher remarked,
the phsenomena      of surfusion are manifested only between very
narrow limits of temperature, whilst it must here be admitted
 that the quartz had preserved its liquidity at least a thousand
 degrees below its point of fusion, which appears inadmissible.
    The quartz of veins often contain water or other volatile
liquids, hydrated oxide of iron, carbonate of iron, and other
minerals decomposable by heat, which facts, as M. de Senarmont
justly remarked, evidently prove its aqueous origin. With re
spect to the quartz of granites, it is often found in the form of
smoky quartz, its colour arising from a volatile or combustible sub
stance, probably carbonaceous, which is expelled by calcination.
It is impossible to explain the separation, in a fusible mass, of a
very basic silicate, such as mica, from free silicic acid in the form of
quartz, which, at an elevated temperature, plays the part of an
energetic acid.      Their formation in the humid way implies, on
 the contrary, nothing contradictory; for we know that at a low
 temperature silica scarcely plays the part of an acid, carbonic
acid and even water surpassing it in energy in this respect.

       The remarkable purity of the quartz of granites is also in op
   position to this theory, which would make of this element, in a
    state of surfusion, a mother-liquor from which the other cry
    stallized minerals of granites had by degrees separated them
    selves.
        If  the external appearance of granites is not that of a fused
   mass which has crystallized by slow cooling, like that of devitri-
   fied glass, neither have we ever succeeded in producing, by the
    slow cooling of a mass of fused granite, a mass of crystalline
    structure. In this manner vitreous masses similar to obsidian
   have alone been obtained.
        The author mentions on this subject an interesting experi
   ment by his brother, M. G. Rose.                When a granite rich in
    quartz    is subjected to  fusion,  felspar  and  mica fuse and gradu
    ally dissolve a part of the quartz, but a portion of the latter
    remains in the form of grains or nuclei in the middle of the
    vitreous mass. A granite very rich in quartz, from Warmbrunn
    in Silesia, having been subjected to the heat of a porcelain fur
    nace, was transformed in this manner into a mass of obsidian, still
   containing white nuclei of quartz.           These nuclei were carefully
    separated    from  the obsidian,   when   they were found to be formed
   of amorphous silica, whose density was from 2'34 to '2*35, and
   which was acted on by hydrofluoric acid with the energy peculiar
   to this variety.
       Lastly, M. Rose regards as a strong objection against the
   igneous origin of granite, the presence of minerals, such as
    Gadolinite, Allanite, &c., which at a temperature more or less
   elevated, suddenly present the phsenomenon of incandescence, at
   the end of which they experience a permanent modification of
   their properties, and become less capable, or even incapable of
   being acted upon by acids. These minerals are found exclusively
   in granite rocks ; and their presence proves that these rocks have
   not been exposed to a temperature sufficient to determine their
   metamorphosis, which nevertheless generally requires only a dark
   red heat.
       M. Scheerer having remarked in some of these minerals an
   increase of density after their iguition, endeavoured to explain
   their presence in granite rocks, to which he attributes an
  igneous origin, by supposing that during the very slow cooling
   of these rocks, giving rise to a contraction to which the mass
   did not completely yield, the elements of these minerals assumed
   a peculiar state of separation          and tension.    This explanation
   falls before the fact verified by M. Rose, that all these minerals
   do not present this increase of density ; samarskite, for example,
  has a less density after its ignition.          In order to meet the ob
  jection which geologists might raise, that pressure might oppose

                 Dr. Woods on     a New Aclinometer.               3'J
the metamorphosis of these minerals in granite, the author en
deavoured to heat them in closed glass tubes full of air, the
expansion of the air by the heat giving rise in this case to a con
siderable pressure.      He proved that incandescence took place
quite as well in this case — in fact, that it was even facilitated by
pressure.
   One might, it is true, suppose that these minerals, especially
Gadolinite, were formed at the same time as the granite and by
fusion, but that afterwards, under the prolonged influence of
the atmosphere, water, an elevated temperature          and perhaps
other causes, they had undergone a metamorphosis accompanied
by a fixation of caloric, and that thus they had passed into another,
isomeric state in which they are capable of disengaging their
latent heat by calcination and of presenting the phaenomenon of
incandescence.
   Prof. Rose observes that this hypothesis contains nothing con
trary to the views which he advances. Certainly no one imagines
that the elements of granite have been in a complete state of
aqueous solution, from which, by degrees, they have been sepa
rated by crystallization.       It is possible that these elements
proceed from an anterior rock which had an igneous origin,
and which had assumed the crystalline state under the in
fluence of water, heat, and pressure, as in the experiments by
which M. Daubree succeeded in obtaining several crystallized
minerals. A similar hypothesis has often been published, par
ticularly by Mr. Sterry Hunt.        It has the advantage of explain
ing  the  absence of  organic remains in granite, although this rock
might have been formed after the appearance of organized beings.
   It is clear that these observations apply, not only to granites,
but to all crystalline rocks containing quartz, especially to
quartzose porphyries and trachytes.           The hypothesis of the
igneous origin of these rocks is incompatible with the actual
state of our chemical knowledge.
               VII.   Description of a new Actinometer.
                    By Thomas Woods, M.D*
                     DRAPER, of New York, published        a paper in
PROFESSOR
     this Magazine    for September 1857, in which he showed that
a solution of peroxalate of iron is decomposed by light, protox-
alate of iron being formed with evolution of carbonic acid — ¦
                Fe* 0s, 3C203=2FeO, C203 + 2C0*.
   In  order to find the amount of actinism which had caused the
change, the quantity of protoxalate produced, or of the carbonic
                     * Communicated   by the Author.

40              Dr. Woods on   a     New Actinometer.
acid which had been given off, was to be measured : but herein
lay the difficulty ; it was required to find the amount of gold
precipitated from its chloride by the proto-salt in the solution of
peroxalate which had been exposed to the light, or to mea
sure by weight or volume the carbonic acid which had been
evolved during the same exposure.      Now, as Mr. H. C. Draper
says   in a paper published in the Photographic Journal for last
September, "even an enthusiast would soon tire of daily following
out these details."    Indeed the labour would be too great, even
if the results were rigidly exact. The latter gentleman, Mr.
H. C. Draper, suggests the weighing of the apparatus in which
the peroxalate is exposed, both before and after the exposure,
taking the precaution to expel the dissolved carbonic acid by
means of a stream of hydrogen, and thus to find the amount of
fixed air generated by the loss of weight the apparatus sustains.
This idea is ingenious ; but the process would be very little if at
all less troublesome than the others.
   An easy and expeditious plan for the measurement of the
actinic effect of light is a great desideratum.    It would relieve
the art of photography of half its failures, and would be of still
greater advantage to its science.     In order to give a helping
hand towards its attainment,     Ihave endeavoured to render the
use of the peroxalate of iron as a photometric agent, both ma
nageable and simple.
   If after exposure any process is required to define the quantity
of change effected by the light, especially any process involving
knowledge of chemistry or nicety of manipulation, no doubt it
will  be neglected, except perhaps by the few "en-        Fig. 1.
thusiasts," whose results would therefore be of limited
value.                   I
          For this reason have endeavoured to find a
method of measuring the photometric changes at
once, and by the eye only, in the following manner : —        j {
having nearly filled a phial with a solution of peroxa-       j [ c
late of iron, I passed through its cork a glass tube          I j
into the bottle, both tube and cork fitting air-tight in      j |
their places. This tube, open at both ends, dipped by
one of them under the surface of the solution, so          B|\
that when the bottle was exposed to light, any car-          j |
bonic acid evolved should collect over the fluid,           ;;¦
pressing   itinto the tube
                        ;   and scale applied to the
                                   a
latter would show at once the amount of action going
on.    A reference to fig.
                         1  will explain the construc
tion of the Actinometer.     A   is    low- sized square
                                       a
phial, capable of holding about two ounces.      B   the
                                                     is
tube passing through the cork into the solution of
peroxalate of iron.    The carbonic acid collects in the space over

                   Dr. Woods on   a  New Actinometer.               41
  the solution, and the fluid is raised correspondingly in the tube,
  and read off on the scale C.
     This is the principle of the actinometer ; and for taking an
 occasional observation the above answers pretty well ; but there
 are other circumstances to be taken into account in the construc
 tion of a more perfect instrument. For instance, if the tempera
 ture varies, the indications are interfered with, and that to an
 extent the greater the more sensitive the apparatus is.      For it is
 obvious that the sensibility of the actinometer may be carried
  to any extent by making the tube proportion-        Fig- 2.
 ally small   in the bore ; but then for the same
 reason any change of temperature will corre
 spondingly affect the rising of the fluid. There
 fore for accurate measurements it will be neces
 sary to have a thermometer dipping into the
 solution, and a preliminary experiment made in
 order to find to what extent the change of
 temperature affects the instrument.        It will
 also be convenient to have a second tube pass
 ing through the cork, but not into the fluid,
 closed of course by a cork or stopcock when
 the instrument is in use.        This tube is for
 the purpose of allowing the carbonic acid to
 escape when desirable, or for filling the vessel
 or emptying it when the solution is exhausted
 of peroxalate.    The apparatus    I would there
 fore recommend, and which      I have tried (only,
 however, for a few days) with apparent success
 in determining the actinic action of light, may
 be seen in fig 2.    It shows half the real size of
the instrument    I used.
    A is the phial, B the tube dipping under
the surface of the solution. C a thermometer,
also dipping into the solution, whose graduated
scale serves too as a scale for reading off the
height to which the fluid ascends in the tube.
D is the smaller glass tube passing through the
cork, but not into the solution. When the
fluid is raised nearly to the top of the tube
B by the pressure of the carbonic acid, it may
be drawn down again and set to any mark
by opening partially the tube D until suffi
cient fixed air escapes to allow it to descend.
    I give in the following page a representation of the heights
to which the fluid rose during different parts of two days.

    The marks indicate the successive heights of the fluid at the
different hours mentioned.     The cock D was turned two or three
times to allow the fluid to descend, as otherwise it would have
overrun the tube.
    The thermometer is not registered in these trials, as the tem
perature did not vary more than one or two degrees.          The acti
nometer was at a closed window ; the weather was dull and rainy,
except occasionally, as at 12 o'clock December 7th, and 2 o'clock
December 8th. In the sunshine, in the open air, the rise of the
fluid was about three times as great as the largest space in the
same period of time.     The bore of the tube I used was ^th of an
inch in diameter, and the solution in the bottle exposed a surface
of about three square inches.       I mention these particulars, as
on them depends the sensibility of the instrument.         The larger
the surface of fluid exposed, of course the greater will be the
action of the light ; and the smaller the bore of the tube the
greater will be the rise for a given evolution of carbonic acid.      I
tried a thermometer tube of about ^jyth of an inch in diameter,
and the fluid rose rapidly, perhaps a couple of inches in a minute,
but in jerks and irregularly ; and I cannot yet say how far the
bore may be diminished with utility.
    When the fluid is first exposed it shows no evolution of car
bonic acid, although the action of the light produces it. The
gas is dissolved, to a certain extent, in the fluid, and until the
latter is saturated no rise in the tube occurs.        The point of
saturation is reached after a greater or less time, according to
the light, generally in about fifteen minutes.       This is only a
small inconvenience ; and    I got  rid even of this loss  of time by
having a slight excess of oxalic acid in the fluid, and by adding
a couple of grains of carbonate of potash, so that saturation was
at once accomplished.     But there is a more serious annoyance ;
the fluid having been saturated with the carbonic acid, gives it
out again even in the dark, so that until it all nearly disappears
the fluid continues to rise ; the removal, therefore, of the actino
meter from the light does not immediately stop the rising.        This
would not affect the indications if the height of the fluid in the
tube was marked immediately before removing it ; but there is a
danger that the carbonic acid of saturation may be partially
escaping into the space above the fluid, even during the conti
nuance of an observation, so that we may have two sources of
evolution, one the action of the actinism at the moment, and the
other the saturated state of the fluid.    For instance, if a strong
light fell on the instrument, the gas would be generated quickly ;
if the light then diminished, the carbonic acid which would then
be given out, might be due both to the action of the diminished
light and to the saturated state of the fluid.         I  cannot say

44                      Dr. Woods on            a    New Actinometer            .
positively whether such a double action does take place ; it ap
pears probable ; but it might be, that as long as the light con
tinues to fall on the solution, the saturated state is kept up, and
consequently none comes off, except what is at the moment pro
duced.     This point will require some trials to decide. The extent
to which the rise occurs                  is,
                                 however, not great, as may be seen
 by referring to      42, and might have been due in this case to
                          p.

 seconds, will not always give the same amount of actinic force,
as the light may vary considerably between two experiments, and
yet not affect the eye.      If, however, good picture be obtaineda
 during the rise of, say two degrees on the actinometer, the same
amount of actinism must always be present during the same rise,
be the time of rising longer or shorter.        To science also    ought                      it

known extent of surface may be always acted on. The tube will
also require to be covered in delicate experiments, as the light
acts on the fluid in       as well as on that in the bottle.

the stopper of the bottle to be air-tight, and also the apertures

                  Dr. Woods on   a   New Actinometer.              45
   P.S. Since the above was written I have made some experi
ments with the actinometer, and it has answered my expectations.
I believe it is a reliable register of the amount of action of light.
The most important precaution to be taken in its use is to guard
against change of temperature, or to have a previous knowledge
of the extent to which the change will affect the instrument.
Increase of temperature seems to act on it in three different
ways.    It expands the liquid and confined air, causing the liquid
to rise in proportion to the relative bulk of the vessel and tube,
as in a thermometer.     It expels the carbonic acid from the satu
rated solution in addition to that produced by the light : the
amount of carbonic acid a fluid can dissolve depends on the tem
perature ; the higher the latter, the less gas the fluid can con
tain ; so that if during a lengthened observation the tempera
ture increases, carbonic acid is expelled independent of actinic
action.    And thirdly, the higher the stationary temperature       is,
the greater seems to be the power of the light.        In this, as in
all chemical processes, heat increases the action.       For instance,
during  a   day's exposure, when the thermometer was at 36° F.,
the fluid of the actinometer rose about           3inches, whereas in
the same period of time, when the thermometer was at 60° F.,        it
rose about three times as high. Whether this increase was alto
gether due to the light acting more energetically on the warmer
fluid, or partly to the higher temperature expelling some carbonic
acid,
    I     cannot at present decide.
 I    have used   a solution of peroxalate of iron, 35 grains to the
ounce ;    and as it may facilitate matters for others who may wish
to try the instrument,     I will describe in detail howI     obtained
the solution.
I      dissolved in    6oz. of water 1043 grs. of protosulphate of
iron; added 180 grs. of sulphuric acid of l-84 spec, grav., and
    I
boiled;     while boiling  I threw in 140 grs. of nitric acid of 1*42
spec. grav. This caused an effervescence of nitrous acid, for which
the operator should be prepared by having the vessel of sufficient
capacity and under     a flue. The protosalt was thus converted into
the persalt.     Red prussiate of potash should now produce no
blue colour.  I    then precipitated the peroxide of iron with am
 monia and washed with warm water.          I   had thus 300 grs. of
 anhydrous peroxide of iron;     I   diffused this in 20 oz. of water,
 and added 720 grs. of crystallized oxalic acid — an excess of
 about 10 grs. of acid.      This dissolved the iron and gave me     a
 solution of 712 grs. of the peroxalate — about 35 grs. to the ounce.
 The bottle of the actinometer holds about        2 ounces, and
                                                              I    used
 this quantity of fluid without renewing     it for some weeks. How
 longit   may retain its power I    cannot say.

 VIII.    On  the possibility of finding a Root, real or imaginary,    of
              every  Equation.      By Professor Challis*.
          the proof of the proposition that every equation has a
 AS      root is at this time attracting the attention of mathema
 ticians,  I am desirous of adding a few considerations to those
 contained in two articles on this subject, which 1 communicated
 to the Numbers of the Philosophical Magazine for February and
 April 1859.
     1. The proposition belongs to a branch of pure calculation,
 which is antecedent to, and altogether independent of, the rela
 tions of space ; and consequently the proof of it does not neces
 sarily involve the consideration of either lines or angles.         The
 use that has been made of geometry of two and of three dimen
 sions in proofs that have been recently proposed, can only be
 regarded as an auxiliary means of exhibiting the variations of
 the value of a function corresponding to variations of its vari
 ables, and not by any means as essential to the demonstration
 of the proposition.
    2. In all the proofs that I am acquainted with, as in that
 which I have given in the articles above referred to, the unknown
quantity x is assumed to be represented by a function of the
form    z+ y V —    1, z and y being real quantities, positive or ne
gative.     The reasons for this assumption, which are not usually
much dwelt upon, appear to be such as follow. An equation
may always be supposed to be formed according to the conditions
of a proposed question ; and its object is to discover some un
known quantity which is the answer to the question.               In the
formation of the equation, the unknown quantity is brought into
relation with certain known quantities by operations conducted
in accordance with the given conditions, and by algebraic rules.
The operations are necessarily algebraic, because the relative
magnitudes of the given quantities and the quantity sought for
are unknown ; and it is the essential principle of abstract algebra
to furnish rules and symbols of operation which are proper for
calculating independently of the knowledge of relative magni
tudes.     On account of this necessary generality in algebraic
operations, the final equation involves conditions not contained
in the proposed question, and its dimensions are determined
accordingly. When the equation is formed, the unknown quan
tity becomes an algebraic function of the given quantities, the
exact form of which in certain cases may be actually found.           In
all other cases   such   a function  can  be  obtained in the form  of a
series, by the following, or some equivalent method.
    Let the equation be of five dimensions ; and if any terms be
                    * Communicated
                                      by the Author.

         On the Proposition that every Equation has a Root.         47
 wanting, let it be transformed, by adding a given quantity to its
 roots, into an equation in which no coefficient is zero, as
                    x5 +px* + qx3 + rx* + sx + 1 = 0.
 Then supposing that x=At + 'Btt + CP+ &c, it may be readily
 shown by the method of the reversion of series, that

If it be supposed   that x=a + bs + csi + ds3 + &c, the same method
 gives, b, c, d, &c. by means of simple equations as functions of
 a ; but a itself is given by the equation
                      a5 +pa4 + qa3 + ra* + 1 = 0.
 From this equation a value of a may be obtained by the process
just indicated, and thus x will be expressed in a series proceed
ing according to the powers of s.        Similar reasoning applies to
the other coefficients.
    These different series for x might be proper for finding real
roots of equations; but as they are not necessarily convergent,
they do not prove that a root can always be found.        They show,
however, that x is an algebraic function of the coefficients ; and
as every algebraic function reduced to numbers is of the form
z + y V — 1, it may consequently be assumed that x is of that
form.
    3. Hence z + y V — 1 may be substituted for x in the given
equation /(#) =0; and as after this substitution it does not cease
to be an equation, we shall have
                             f(z + yx/=T)=0,
or
                             P+Q
P and Q being real functions of z and y.         I am aware that ma
thematicians who have given especial attention to this question,
have not thought themselves            at liberty, after substituting
z + y v7  —  1 for a?, to equate the result to zero, but have endea
voured to prove by independent considerations that there are
values of z and y which will make P and Q vanish simulta
neously. I confess that I am unable to see the necessity for
this course of reasoning, which has the disadvantage of requiring
a peculiar and complicated analysis, of the validity of which it is
difficult to judge.        It being once admitted, on the grounds
above indicated, that the unknown quantity of an equation may
have the form z + y */ — 1, it must surely be also admitted that
this expression may be put in the place of x without destroying
the equation.      According to the view that 1 take, the resulting

  48                  M. Hlasiwetz   on  Querdtrine.
  equation P + Q^ — 1 = 0, being equivalent to P = 0 and Q = 0,
 proves that there are values of z and y which make P and Q
  vanish simultaneously ; and it only remains to show that they
  can be found, which may be simply done as follows.             From the
  equations  P=0    and  Q=0,   one  of the  unknown      quantities z and
  y may be eliminated by a direct process ;         and   as it has a real
  value, the resulting equation has a real root.        Consequently, the
  original equation being given with numerical coefficients, this
 root and the corresponding value of the other unknown quantity
 may be found by approximate methods.             Thus the possibility of
 finding a root, real or imaginary, of any proposed numerical
 equation is demonstrated.

 QUERCITRINE,
        Chevreul in quercitron     bark, has since been found to be
 contained in a great number of plants of different orders j among
 others Rochleder has found it in the horse-chestnut.              Rigaud
 found that it belonged to the class of glucosides, and was capable
 of being decomposed into grape-sugar and quercetine.
    Hlasiwetz* has now found that quercetine itself can be re
 solved into two substances, one of which is a saccharoid matter,
and the other is a weak acid.           Quercetine is boiled with a
concentrated solution of potash for some time, the mass then
diluted with water, and filtered off from a flocculent substance
which forms, the nature of which from its small quantity could
not be determined.       The solution is then evaporated to dryness,
extracted with alcohol, the alcoholic solution distilled off, and
the residue dissolved in water. To the solution, sugar of lead is
added, which causes a copious precipitate.
    The solution filtered off from the lead precipitate, and evapo
rated, deposited after some time crystals which, by analysis and
from their properties, were identified with phloroglucine, the
saccharoid substance formed as a product of decomposition                of
phloretine f.

 liquid filtered from the sulphide of lead formed.                This filtrate
 yielded,  on   careful  evaporation,     a substance   crystallizing in fine
 silky needles, which possessed a feebly acid reaction, and in
 appearance and properties greatly resembled gallic acid.                  This
 substance Hlasiwetz has named quercetic acid.                 Its most cha
 racteristic property is its relation to oxygen.            When a drop of
 alkali is added to a very dilute solution of the acid, it imme
 diately turns yellow, and when agitated in the air gradually
 becomes of a brilliant red.         The formula of the acid was found
 to be C34 H12016.
    From its general resemblance in appearance and properties it
 appears to stand closest to ellagic acid, with which it is homo
 logous.

    If this be the formula of quercetic acid, that of quercetine
 must be altered.         Hlasiwetz considers that it has the formula
 Q46jji6Q2o^     an(j   expresses its decomposition by the following

    Hence the original formula for quercitrine must be altered.
 Quercitrine contains the elements of sugar, of phloroglucine, and
 of quercetic acid.

    This formula would require that quercitrine should yield in its
decomposition       46 3 per cent, sugar.         Rigaud found 44-9 per
cent.    Other experiments, however, by Hlasiwetz and by Roch
leder, with specimens of various preparation, yielded quantities
of sugar which correspond to I and to 3 equivalents of sugar.
It seems therefore probable that different kinds of quercitrine
may exist containing different proportions of sugar, analogous
consequently      to the natural oils and fats with their varying
quantities of fatty acids.

    Hlasiwetz* has published the result of some researches by
himself and Von Gilm on chinovine, a bitter principle, supposed
to be an alkaloid, extracted from China nova. These investiga
tions have shown that it belongs to the class of glucosides.
Chinovine was dissolved in alcohol, and the solution saturated
with hydrochloric acid gas.        The liquid soon became heated,
and deposited     a  crystalline powder which was purified by re-
crystallization from alcohol, in which it is difficultly soluble.
Chinovic acid, as Hlasiwetz names this substance, forms when pure
a brilliant white, crystalline powder ; it is distinguished by its
insolubility, its best solvent being boiling alcohol.    Its solutions
are very bitter.      The alkaline chinovates are formed on the
addition of the alkalies to a solution of the acid, as voluminous
gelatinous precipitates.       The salts of the alkaline earths are
similar.      Chinovic acid has the formula C48 H38 O8, and is bi-
basic ; it is a weak but very permanent acid.      It is not attacked
by hydrochloric     or by boiling  nitric acid.  Sulphuric acid dis
solves    it,and deposits     unchanged on the addition of water.

When distilled, odoriferous vapours are evolved, which condense
to   a thick, amber-yellow, resinous liquid.    In its properties chi
novic acid agi'ees most closely with Hofmann's insolinic acid,
C18H808, and moreover, from its formula, C^H^O8,                   it   is
homologous with it.
    The acid alcoholic solution from which chinovic acid has been
filtered, contains      saccharoid substance, which has the formula

    Athaipantine, a crystalline substance found by Winckler in the

acid into valerianic acid and oreoselone.           Winckler and Schne-
dermann assigned to it the formula C24 H15 O7 :

               Athamantine.     Valerianic acid.     Oreoselone.
    Gerhardt doubled its formula, and therewith the formula of
oreoselone.     Geyger has recently made some analyses which lead
to the same formula ; and the analysis of the nitro-compound,
C48 H27 (N04)3014, an amorphous substance prepared by adding
athamantine to cold fuming nitric acid, confirmed Gerhardt's
view. By the action of chlorine on athamantine, a yellow resi
nous substance is formed, which has the formula C48 H29 CIO14.
    In an investigation of Kino, Eissfeldt was led to the conclusion
that all plants whose aqueous extracts give a green colour with
solutions of ferrous salts, yield pyrocatechine when submitted to
dry distillation, and that all plants which give a blue or bluish-
black precipitate with ferrous salts yield pyrogallic acid by that
treatment. Eissfeldt also established the formula of pyrocatechine,
which differs from that of pyrogallic acid by containing less
oxygen : —
                       C12H604               C12H606.
                   Pyrocatechine.          Pyrogallic acid.
    Uloth* has investigated the plant of the bilberry, and several
allied plants which are distinguished by containing a large quan
tity of a substance which turns iron solutions green, and has con
firmed the truth of Eissfeldt' s generalization. All the plants which
Uloth examined belong to the natural order of the Ericinese, and
were all found to contain, besides pyrocatechine, a crystallizable
indifferent substance which he calls Ericinone.             It was obtained
as follows : —After the pyrocatechine had been precipitated from
the aqueous extract of the plant by sugar of lead, the filtrate was
saturated with sulphuretted hydrogen, the sulphide of lead filtered
off, and the filtrate evaporated to dryness.             On subjecting the
mass to dry distillation, the ericinone sublimed over and con
 densed to white silky needles, which under the microscope are
 seen to consist of quadratic prisms.
    It is a neutral substance, but its aqueous solution gradually
 de composes, assuming an acid reaction.          Even the crystals decom-

guished    from  pyrocatechine.    In its chemical relations it is indiffer

again differs from pyrocatechine.          It reduces the oxides of the
noble metals with great facility, and is completely decomposed

by the action of chlorine it is converted into chloranile, C12 CI4 O4.

           following communications were read : —
       " On the Intimate Structure, and the Distribution of the Blood
vessels of the Human Lung."           By A. T. H. Waters, Esq.

    " On   Lesions of the Nervous System producing Diabetes."             By
Frederick W. Pavy, M.D. Lond. &c.
    The author commenced his paper by stating, that all the experiments
he had performed since his communication on the " Alleged Sugar-
                                     " had been
forming Function of the Liver                     placed in the possession
of the Royal Society, had confirmed the conclusions he had there
 arrived at.    As far as his knowledge extended, it might be said that
in the healthy liver during life there is a substance which he had
 spoken of under the term of hepatine, and which possesses the che
 mical property of being most rapidly transformed into sugar wheu
 in contact with nitrogenized animal materials.           In the liver after
 death this transformation takes place, but in the liver during life
 there seems a force or a condition capable of overcoming the che
 mical tendency to a saccharine metamorphosis.
    Experiments are mentioned to show that when the medulla oblon
 gata is destroyed, and the circulation is maintained by the performance
 of artificial respiration, the sugar formed in the liver as a post
 mortem occurrence is distributed through the system, and occasions
 the secretion of urine possessing a strongly saccharine character.
    Although the destruction of the medullaoblougataleads to this effect,
 yet division of the spinal cord, which has been practised as high as
 between the second and third cervical vertebrae, has not been attended
with a similar result. The brain (cerebrum) has also been separated
from the medulla oblongata by section through the crura cerebri, and
from the results of the experiments in which this operation has been

       On Lesions     of the  Nervous System producing Diabetes.         53
 performed, Dr. Pavy believed that the functions of the brain may be
 completely destroyed, without placing the liver in the condition no
 ticeable after actual death, or after lesion of the medulla oblongata.
 On account of the accidental disturbances, — such as implication of the
 medulla oblongata, possibly by concussion, obstruction of the respi
 ration, and the effects of the great loss of blood sometimes attending
 division of the crura cerebri,— the interpretation of the result is ren
 dered a little difficult.    In an experiment, which proved most con
clusive, performed to corroborate the author's previous observations
whilst his communication was being written, there were none of these
 disturbing circumstances. In a healthy dog, during a period of diges
tion, the crura cerebri were completely divided.           The animal was
thereby thrown into a state of unconsciousness, but breathed efficiently
of its own accord. The urine in an hour and a quarter's time was
found perfectly free from sugar.
    After poisoning by strychnine, the effect is the same as after de
struction of the medulla oblongata. The circulation being maintained
by artificial respiration, the urine becomes strongly saccharine.
    Looking to these facts, and to the effect of Bernard's puncture of
the fourth ventricle in producing diabetes, the author is led to regard
the medulla oblongata as a centre, either directly presiding over the
functional activity of the liver, or indirectly affecting it by altering
through the medium of another or other organs the condition of the
blood going to it ; and he has endeavoured to establish upon positive
grounds the channel by which the propagation of the nervous influ
ence may take place.         It was this line of research that conducted to
the discovery of the strongly diabetic effect produced by dividing
certain parts of the sympathetic.
    The medulla oblongata being thus presumed to form a centre
giving to the liver a force which prevents the saccharine metamor
phosis of its hepatine, experiment had already shown that it cannot be
through the spinal cord or the pneumogastrics separately, that the
transmission of nervous influence takes place. But an experiment was
performed to determine the effect of dividing both the spinal cord and
the two pneumogastrics together. The cord was crushed between the
third and fourth cervical vertebra, and about half an inch of each
pneumogastric was cut away from the centre of the neck. Artificial
respiration was performed to keep up the circulation.            The urine
remained entirely free from sugar, and the liver was           found in an
exsaccharine state at the moment of discontinuing the respiration,
and became strongly saccharine afterwards.
    On next dividing all the nerves in the neck, an operation effected
by performing decapitation, the result that followed after three
quarters of an hour's artificial respiration was strongly saccharine
urine. After this experiment, and that of division of the spinal cord and
pneumogastrics, reason was afforded for looking to the sympathetic;
and from the experiments that have been made and are described,
the following conclusions have been arrived at. The animal selected
for observation has been the dog, subsisting upon an animal diet, and
operated upon at a period of full digestion.

54                           Royal Society  .-—
    " Division,  on both sides of the neck, of the ascending branches of
the superior thoracic ganglion which run up towards the canal
formed by the foramina in the transverse processes of the vertebrae,
for the vertebral artery, occasions an intensely marked diabetes. The
urine has been found most strongly saccharine within even half an
hour after the operation. The diabetic condition is only of a temporary
character, passing off by the next day, and fatal pleurisy is always
induced.
    " Division of the ascending branches of the superior thoracic
ganglion on one side of the neck only, has occasioned merely the
presence of a trace of sugar in the urine in an hour and a half's time.
The same operation then performed on the other side has produced
in half an hour's time an intensely saccharine urine.
    " Carefully ligaturing the two vertebral and the two carotid arte
ries does not lead to saccharine urine ; but when the carotids have
been tied, and the tissue in connexion with the vertebrals before their
entrance into the canals is a little roughly treated, without however
dividing the larger sympathetic filament ascending from the superior
thoracic ganglion, the urine is rendered rapidly and strongly saccha
rine.
    " Division of the sympathetic filaments that have entered the
 canals does not alone produce diabetes ; but if the contents of
 these canals be divided, and the carotid arteries at the same time
 ligatured, saccharine urine is the result.
    " This result is produced when the contents of the osseous canals
 are divided as high as the second cervical vertebra. It has also arisen
 after destroying the structures in the neighbourhood of the vertebral
 foramen on the posterior surface of the transverse process of the atlas,
 but has not yet been noticed after a similar operation on the anterior
 surface of the process.
    " Dividing the contents of the canals and the tissue in immediate
 contact with the carotid vessels has not produced diabetes ; but when
 the carotids have been afterwards tied, strongly saccharine urine has
 resulted.
    " Of all the operations on the sympathetic of the dog that have
                                                                      yet
 been performed, removal of the superior cervical ganglion the most
 rapidly and strongly produces diabetes.        After the removal of one
 ganglion,   the urine has  been found  intensely saccharine in an hour's
 time, and the saccharine character has remained during the following
 day, but has disappeared by the next.         Subsequent removal of the
 other ganglion a few days later has been followed in half an hour's
 time with a strongly marked diabetic effect, which, however, has
 been again only of a temporary nature.
    " Division of the sympathetic in the chest has been several times
 succeeded by saccharine urine.       In one case after division on one
side only, the urine was intensely saccharine in half an hour's time.
On the other hand, many experiments have been made where both
sides have been operated on, and only a merely traceable, or in a
few instances, even no effect, has been noticeable.
    "In the rabbit, removal of the superior cervical ganglia, when

  On the Electrical Condition of    the Egg of the Common Fowl.        55
 the animal is in a strong and healthy state, is followed by diabetes;
 but the effect is not so rapidly produced as in the dog. It has been

     " Excision of the superior cervical ganglia in the rabbit with a
 division of the pneumogastrics above their gangliform enlargement
close to their exit from the skull, has been attended with the produc
 tion of saccharine urine in a shorter space of time than when the
 ganglia alone have been removed, notwithstanding that division of
 the pneumogastrics in the situation referred to, has not been seen by
 itself to cause any positive effect."
    Such is a simple statement of the principal 'conclusions derivable
 from the author's experiments, which are given in detail in his com
munication.      As to the interpretation of the results that have been
 obtained, this he leaves for further investigation, in which he is now
engaged, if possible, to disclose. The experiments on the sympathetic
were commenced under the notion that it might form the medium of
transmission of nervous force from the medulla oblongata to the liver.
From this supposition certain facts have been discovered which are
left for the present, without discussing whether the notion that led
to them is right or wrong.
    "On   the Electrical Condition of the Egg of the Common        Fowl."
By John Davy, M.D., F.R.SS. L. & E. &c.
    The structure of the    egg suggested to the author the idea of its
exerting electrical action.    This was confirmed on trial. Using a
delicate galvanometer and a suitable apparatus, on plunging one wire
into the white, and the other, insulated, except at the point of con
tact, into the yolk, the needle was deflected to the extent of 5° ; and
on changing the wires, the course of the needle was reversed. When
the white and yolk were taken out of the shell, the yolk immersed
in the white, the effects on trial were similar ; but not so when the
two were well-mixed ; then no distinct effect was perceptible.
    Indications also of chemical action were obtained on substituting for
the galvanometer a mixture consisting of water, a little gelatinous
starch, and a small quantity of iodide of potassium, especially when
rendered very sensitive of change by the addition of a few drops of
muriatic acid.     In the instance of newly-laid eggs, the iodine libe
rated appeared at the pole connected with the white ; on the con
trary, in that of eggs which had been kept some time, it appeared at
the pole connected with the yolk, answering in both to the copper
in a single voltaic combination formed of copper and zinc.
    The author, after describing the results obtained, declines specu
lating on them at present, merely remarking, that in the economy of
the egg, and the changes to which it is subject, it can hardly be
doubted that electro-chemical action must perform an important
part, and that in the instance of the ovum generally, i. e. when com
posed of a white and of a yolk, or of substances in contact, of hete
rogeneous natures;

    " On  the Mode in which Sonorous Undulations are conducted from
the Membrana Tympani to the Labyrinth, in the Human Ear." By
Joseph Toynbee, Esq., F.R.S. &c.
   The opinion usually entertained by physiologists is that two
channels are requisite for the transmission of sonorous undulations
from the membrana tympani to the labyrinth, viz. the air in the
tympanic cavity which transmits the undulations to the membrane
of the fenestra rotunda and the cochlea ; and secondly, tbe chain of
ossicles which conduct them to the vestibule.
   This opinion is, however, far from being universally received ;
thus, one writer on the Physiology of Heaving contends that
                                                                            " the
integrity of one fenestra may suffice for the exercise of hearing*;"
another expresses his conviction that
                                                " the transmission of sound
cannot take place through the ossiculaf ;" while Sir John Herschel,
in speaking of the ossicles, says " they are so far from being essential
to hearing, that when the tympanum is destroyed and the chain in
consequence hangs loose, deafness does not follow J."
   The object of this paper is to decide by experiment how far
the ossicles are requisite for the performance of the function of
hearing.
    The subject is considered under two heads, viz.—
    1. Whether sonorous undulations from the external meatus can
reach the labyrinth without having the ossicles for a medium.
    2. Whether any peculiarity in the conformation of the chain of
ossicles precludes the passage of sonorous undulations through it.
    1. Can sonorous        undulations reach the labyrinth from the
external meatus without the aid of the ossicles ?
   This question has often been answered in the affirmative, appa
rently because it has been ascertained that in cases where two bones
of the chain of ossicles have been removed by disease, the hearing
power is but slightly diminished.            In opposition to this view, it
must, however, be remembered, that the absence of the stapes, or
even its fixed condition (anchylosis), is always followed by total or
nearly total deafness ; and the following experiments, which demon
strate the great facility with which sonorous undulations pass from
the air to a solid body, indicate that the stapes, even when isolated
from the other bones of the chain, may still be a medium for the
transmission of sound.
    Experiment 1. — Both ears having been closed, a piece of wood,
5 inches long and half an inch in diameter, was held between the
teeth, and a vibrating tuning-fork C having been brought within
the eighth of an inch of its free extremity, tbe sound was heard
distinctly, and it continued to be heard between five and six seconds.
    Experiment 2. — One end of the piece of wood used in the pre
vious experiment being pressed against the tragus of the onter ear, so
as to close the external meatus without compressing the air con-

tained within    it,   avibrating tuning-fork C placed within       a quarter
of an inch of     its free  extremity, was heard very distinctly at first,
and it  did not cease to be heard for fifteen seconds.
   Experiment 3. — Three portions of wood, of the same length and
thickness as that used in the previous experiments, were glued
together so as to form         a triangle somewhat of the shape of the
stapes the base of this triangle being placed against the outer
       ;
surface of the tragus, as in the previous experiment, the tuning-fork
C   vibrating within       quarter of an inch from its apex was heard for
                           a
twelve seconds.
   Considering, as shown by the above experiments, the great facility
with which sonorous undulations pass from the air to solid body,
                                                               a               it
may,I    think, be assumed that the undulations in the tympanic cavity
may be conveyed to the stapes even when this bone              isolated from
                                                               is
the rest of the chain, and conducted by          it  to the vestibule     and
                                                                          ;
when   it    also considered that the absence of all the ossicles, or even
            is
a fixed condition of the stapes,       is  productive of deafness, there       is
strong evidence in favour of the opinion that sounds from the
extei-nal meatus cannot reach the labyrinth without the medium of
the ossicles.
   2. Is there any peculiarity in the conformation of the chain of ossi
cles which precludes the passage of sonorous undulations through              it
                                                                               1
   This question has also been answered in the affirmative, on account
of the various planes existing in the chain and secondly, on account of
                                            ;
the joints existing between the several bones composing this chain.
   The following experiments refer to the influence of the varying
plane of the bones forming the chain, and of its articulations, on the
progress of sonorous undulations through        it
                                                 :  —
  I.  Experiments illustrative of the influence       of
                                                       the variety of planes
in the chain.
   Experiment     1
                  .   — Three pieces of wood, each         inches in length
                                                           5
and half an inch thick, were glued together thus               ^    ,   so as to
represent the planes in which the malleus, incus, and stapes are
arranged in the chain of ossicles, while three similar portions were
glued end to end so as to form     straight rod.
                                   a                      A
                                                     watch was placed
in contact with one end of the straight rod, while the other was
pressed gently against the tragus so as to shut the external meatus.
The result was that the watch was heard nearly as distinctly as
when in contact with the ear.     When similar experiment was per
                                            a
formed with the angular portion of wood representing the chain of
bones, the watch was also heard, but less distinctly than through the
straight portion.
   Experiment 2. —         A
                       tuning-fork   C, being made to vibrate, was
placed in contact with one extremity of the angular piece of wood,
the other being placed against the tragus of the ear and as soon as
                                                               ;
the sound ceased to be heard, the straight portion was substituted,
when the tuning-fork was again heard, and        continued to be heard
                                                     it
for about three seconds.

 58                            Royal Society   :¦—
    Experiment 3. —A vibrating tuning-fork C was placed at one ex
 tremity of the angular piece of wood, the other extremity being held
 between the teeth ; the fork was at first heard very distinctly, and
 when its sound could no longer be distinguished, the straight piece
 was substituted, and it was again heard for the space of two
 seconds.
    Experiment 4. — Instead of the horizontal portion of wood repre
 senting the stapes, three portions of the same size were made into
 a triangle, and this was glued to the anterior surface of the inferior
extremity of the piece representing the incus, thus               •   The
previous experiment was then repeated with the substitution of this
 apparatus for the angular one, and with nearly the same result, viz.
 the fork was heard through the straight piece about three seconds
after it had ceased to be heard by the apparatus representing the
 chain of bones.
    Experiment 5. — A piece of very thin paper was gummed over the
end of a glass tube 6 inches in diameter ; to the outer surface of
this paper was glued a model of the chain of ossicles similar to the
one used in the previous experiment ; a vibrating tuning-fork C
being placed in the interior of the tube and within a quarter of an
inch of the paper, the sound was heard through the free end of the
chain placed between the teeth for ten seconds ; when the sound
ceased to be heard, a straight piece of wood was substituted, and the
 sound was not heard through it.
    II. Experiments illustrative of the influence of the articulations
 in the chain.
    Experiment     1. — Three   pieces of wood, each about 5 inches
long   and  half an inch  in thickness,  were separated from each other
by pieces of india-rubber    as thick as ordinary writing-paper, and they
were then fastened together so as to assume the angular form pos
sessed by the chain of ossicles. The tuning-fork C being placed at the
free extremity of the chain, the other extremity being held between
the teeth, it was found that the sound was heard as distinctly and
for the same length of time, as when it passed through the chain
formed of three portions glued together.
    Experiment 2. — When eight layers of the india-rubber were placed
between each piece of wood, there was still very little difference in
the intensity of the sound from that observed when it passed through
the portions glued together.
    Experiment 3. — One, two, or three fingers having been placed
between the first and second pieces of wood, and eight layers of
india-rubber between the second and third, a very slight diminution
in the intensity and duration of the sound was observed as compared
with its passage through similar pieces when glued together.
    Experiment 4. — The back of the hand was placed in contact with
the teeth, and the end of the vibrating fork C was pressed against
the palm ; the sound was heard very distinctly for several seconds ;
and when it ceased to be heard, a piece of solid wood 3 inches

         On the   Electrical Discharge of the Voltaic Battery.              59
long   was substituted, through which the sound of the fork was again
heard faintly for four seconds.
    The inference from the two series of experiments above detailed          is,
that neither the variation of the plane existing in the chain of
ossicles, nor the presence of the articulations,     sufficient to prevent
                                                     is
the progress of sonorous undulations through this chain to the
vestibule.
    The experiments and observations detailed above lead to the
following conclusions —  :
  1
  .     That the commonly received opinion in favour of the sonorous
 undulations passing to the vestibule through the chain of ossicles          is
correct.
    2. That the stapes, when disconnected from the incus, can still
 conduct sonorous undulations to the vestibule from the air.
    3. So far as our present experience extends,      appears that in the
                                                      it
human ear sound always travels to the labyrinth through two media,
 viz. through the air in the tympanic cavity to the cochlea, and through
 one or more of the ossicles to the vestibule.
      " Onthe Electrical Discharge in vacuo with an extended Series of
the Voltaic Battery." By John P. Gassiot, Esq., V.P.R.S.
   In    a recent communication, since ordered for publication in the
Philosophical Transactions,       I  described some experiments on the
electrical discharge in      a  vacuum obtained by the absorption of
carbonic acid with caustic potassa, and     I   showed that, when the dis
charge from an induction coil was passed through such vacuum, the
                                                               a
stratifications became altered in character and appearance              as the
potassa was more or less heated.         I    have also in   a  former paper
 (Phil. Trans. 1858, p.      1)  shown that the stratified discharge can
be obtained from the electrical machine.
   A   description of an extended series of      a  water-battery was com
 municated by me as far back as December 1843 (Phil. Trans. 1844,
 p. 39).    This battery consists of 3520 insulated cells: some years
 had elapsed since     it was last charged, and  I    found the zincs were
 very  much    oxidated ;  on  again charging   it with   rain-water,  I ascer
 tained that there was sufficient tension to give     a   constant succession
 of minute sparks between two copper discs attached to the terminals
 of the battery, and placed about ^th of an inch apart. On at
 taching the terminals of the battery to the wires in a carbonic acid
 vacuum-tube inserted about       2  inches apart,   I   obtained  a  stratified
 discharge   similar  to that from  an  induction  coil.
    The experiment was repeated with 400 series of Grove's nitric
 acid battery. In this case distinct sparks between two copper discs
 were obtained, and the luminous layers were shown in          a  peculiar and
 striking   manner,  thus proving   that  the induction   coil
                                                             is not  necessary
 for the production of the striae, as in most of the experiments the
 only interruption of the battery circuit was through the vacuum-
 tube.
  I   had another tube prepared, substituting for metallic points balls
 of gas-carbon. At first the stratified discharge was obtained as before,

60                                     Royal Society:—
while little or no chemical action took place in the battery; on heating
the potassa, the character of the stratifications gradually changed, and
suddenly a remarkably brilliant white discharge, also stratified, was
observed ; intense chemical action was at the same time perceptibly
taking place in the battery, and on breaking the circuit, the usual vivid
electrical flame-discharge was developed at the point of disruption.
   The continuation of these experiments will necessarily occupy much
time, involving, as they do, the charging of so extended a series of
the nitric acid battery, and with the requisite care necessary for
the proper insulation of each cell. Other phenomena were observed
which require further verification; but I hope that after the recess the
                  I
result which hope to obtain may be of sufficient interest to form the
 subject of a future communication.                         -
     “Note on the Transmission of Radiant Heat through Gaseous
Bodies.”    By John Tyndall, Ph.D., F.R.S. &c.
   Before the Royal Society terminates its present session,        am                           I
anxious to state the nature and some of the results of an investiga
tion in which         I
                am now engaged.
   With the exception of the celebrated memoir of M. Pouillet on Solar
Radiation through the atmosphere, nothing, so far as       am aware,                  I
has been published on the transmission of radiant heat through
gaseous bodies.    We know nothing of the effect even of air upon
heat radiated from terrestrial sources.
   The law of inverse squares has been proved by Melloni to be
true for radiant heat passing through air, whence that eminent
experimenter inferred that the absorption of such heat by the atmo
sphere, in a distance of 18 or 20 feet, is totally inappreciable.
With regard to the action of other gases upon heat, we are not, so
        I
far as am aware, possessed of a single experiment.
   Wishing to add to our knowledge in this important particular, I
had a tube constructed, 4 feet long and 3 inches in diameter, and
by  means of brass terminations and suitable washers,               closed per        I

diminution of the current would be necessary ; far larger, indeed, than
the absorption of the air, if any, could produce : while if I used a
feeble source, and permitted the needle to point to the lower degrees
of the galvanometer, the total quantity of heat in action was so
small, that the fraction of it absorbed, if any, might well be insensible.
    My object then was to use powerful currents, and still keep the
needle in a sensitive position ; this was effected in the following
manner : — The galvanometer made use of possessed two wires coiled
side by side round the needle ; and the two extremities of each wire
were connected with a separate thermo-electric pile, in such a manner
that the currents excited by heat falling upon the faces of the two piles
passed in opposite directions round the galvanometer.         A source of
heat of considerable intensity was permitted to send its rays through
the tube to the pile at its opposite extremity ; the deflection of the
needle was very energetic. The second pile was now caused to ap
proach the source of heat until its current exactly neutralized that of
the other pile, and the needle descended to zero.
   Here then we had two powerful forces in perfect equilibrium ; and
inasmuch as the quantity of heat in action was very considerable, the
absorption of a small fraction of it might be expected to produce a
sensible effect upon the galvanometer-needle in its present position.
When the tube was exhausted, the balance between the equal forces
was destroyed, and the current from the pile placed at the end of the
tube predominated.       Hence the removal of the air had permitted a
greater amount of heat to pass.        On readmitting the air, the needle
again descended to zero, indicating that a portion of the radiant heat
was intercepted.     Very large effects were thus obtained.
   I have applied the same mode of experiment to several gases and
vapours, and have, in all cases, obtained abundant proof of calorific
absorption.     Gases vary considerably in their absorptive power — pro
bably as much as liquids and solids.         Some of them allow the heat
to pass through them with comparative facility, while other gases
bear the same relation to the latter that alum does to other diather-
manous bodies.
   Different gases are thus shown to intercept radiant heat in different
degrees.    I have made other experiments, which prove that the self
same gas exercises a different action upon different qualities of radiant
heat. The investigation of the subject referred to in this Note is
now in progress, and I hope at some future day to lay a full descrip
tion of it before the Royal Society.

Chemistry in Owens College, Manchester.
   In the three communications* which they have already made to the
Royal Society upon the subject of photochemistry, the authors showed
that they have constructed a most delicate and trustworthy instrument
by which to measure the chemical action of light, and by help of which
they have been able to investigate the laws regulating this action.

In the present memoir, the authors     proceed, in the first place, trt
establish a general and absolute standard of comparison for the
chemical action of light ; and in the second place, to consider
the quantitative relations of the chemical action effected by direct
and diffuse sunlight.   They would endeavour, in this part of their
research, to lay the foundation of a new and important branch of
meteorological science, by investigating the laws which regulate the
distribution, on the earth's surface, of the chemical activity ema
nating from the sun.
   The subject-matter of the present communication is divided under
five heads       :   —
     1.   The comparative and absolute measurement of the chemical
rays.
   2. Chemical action of diffuse daylight.
   3. Chemical action of direct sunlight.
   4. Photochemical action of the sun, compared with that of a
terrestrial source of light.
   5. Chemical action of the constituent parts of solar light.
   The first essential for the measurement of photochemical actions,
is the possession of a source of constant light. This the authors
secured with a greater amount of accuracy than by the method de
scribed in their former communications, by employing a flame of pure
carbonic oxide gas, burning from a platinum jet of 7 millims. in dia
meter, and issuing at a given rate, and under a pressure very slightly
different from that of the atmosphere.        The action which such a
standard flame produces in a given time on the sensitive mixture of
chlorine and hydrogen, placed at a given distance, is taken as the
arbitrary unit of photochemical illumination.        This action    how       is,
ever, not that which      directly observed on the scale of the instru
                                is
ment. The true action          only obtained by taking account of the
                                     is
absorption and extinction which the light undergoes in passing
through the various glass-, water-, and mica-screens placed between
the flame and the sensitive gas. These reductions can be made by help
of the determinations given in Part            III.
                                            of these Researches, as well
as by experiments detailed in the present Part.       When these sources
of error are eliminated,          possible, by means of this standard
                                     it   is
flame, to reduce the indications of different instruments to the same
unit of luminous intensity, and thus to render them comparable.
For this purpose, the authors define the photometric unit for the
chemically active rays, as the amount of action produced in one
minute, by       standard flame placed at
                     a                           distance of one metre
                                                          a
from the normal mixture of chlorine and hydrogen                and they ;
determine experimentally for each instrument the number of such
units which correspond to one division on the scale of the instru
ment.    By multiplying the observed number of divisions by the
number of photometric units equal to one division, the observations
are reduced to      comparable standard.
                          a                         proposed to call this

mination of a surface, that   is,  the amount of chemically active light
which falls perpendicularly on the plane surface, can be obtained.
It has thus been found that the distance to which two flames of
coal-gas and carbonic oxide, each fed with gas at the rate of 4*105
cubic cent, per second, must be removed from plane surface, in order
                                                        a
to effect upon   it  an amount of chemical action represented by one
degree of light, was, in the case of the coal-gas flame, 0*929 metre,
in that of carbonic oxide 0-561 metre. The chemical illuminating
power, or chemical intensity, of various sources of light, measured
by the chemical action effected by these sources at equal distances
and in equal times, can also be expressed in terms of this unit of
light and these chemical intensities may be compared with the
     ;
visible light-giving intensities.     In like manner, the authors define
 chemical brightness as the amount of light, measured photochemi-
 cally, which falls perpendicularly from         luminous surface upon
                                                   a                        a
 physical point,   divided by  the   apparent magnitude of the surface      ;
 and this chemical brightness of circles of zenith-sky of different sizes
 has been determined.      Experiment shows that the chemical bright
 ness of various sized portions of zenith- sky, not exceeding 0'00009
 of the total heavens,   is   the same    ; or, that the chemical action
 effected   is
             directly proportional     to the apparent magnitude of the
 illuminating surface of zenith-sky.
     It
      is,  however, important to express the photochemical actions
 not only according to an arbitrary standard, but in absolute measure,
 in units of time and space.        This has been done by determining
 the absolute volume of hydrochloric acid formed by the action of           a
 given source of light during   a    given space of time.   For this pur
 pose, we require to know —
   »=the  volume of hydrochloric acid formed by the unit of light.
   A=the  thickness of sensitive gas through which the light passed.
   5=the  surface-area of the insulated gas.
   a=the  coefficient of extinction of the chlorine and hydrogen for
        the light employed.
   i=the number of observed units of light in the time           t.
  When these values are known, the volume of hydrochloric acid
which would be formed in the time                  by

 of dry chlorine and hydrogen,   found from the expression
                                    is
    In this way the chemical illumination of any        surface may be ex
 pressed by   the   height   of the  column   of  hydrochloric   acid which
 the light falling upon that surface would produce,              if   it

of a place, and points the way to relations for the chemical actions
 of the solar rays, which in the thermic actions are already repre
 sented by isothermals, isotherals, &c.
     In order to determine the chemical action exerted by the whole
 diffuse daylight upon a given point on the earth's surface, the
 authors were obliged to have recourse to an indirect method of ex
 perimenting, owing to the impossibility of measuring the whole
 action directly, by means of the sensitive mixture of chlorine and
 hydrogen.       For the purpose of obtaining the wished-for result, the
 chemical action proceeding from a portion of sky at the zenith, of
 known magnitude, was determined in absolute measure, and then,
 by means of a photometer, whose peculiar construction can only be
 understood by a long description, the relation between the visible
 illuminating power of the same portion of zenith sky and that of
 the total heavens was determined. As, in the case of lights from
 the same source but of different degrees of intensity, the chemical
 actions are proportional to the visible illuminating effects, it was
 only necessary, in order to obtain the chemical action produced by
 the total diffuse light, to multiply the chemical action of the zenith
 portion of sky by the number representing the relation between the
 visible illumination of the total sky and that of the same zenith
 portion.
     The laws according to which the chemical rays are dispersed by
 the atmosphere can only be ascertained from experiments made
 when the sky is perfectly cloudless.       In the determinations made
 with this specially-arranged photometer, care was therefore taken
 that the slightest trace of cloud or mist was absent, and the relation
 between the visible illuminating effect of a portion of sky at the
 zenith and that of the whole visible heavens, was determined for
 every half-hour from sunrise to sunset ; the observations being made
 at the summit of a hill near Heidelberg, from which the horizon was
perfectly free.
     The amount of chemical illumination which a point on the earth's
 surface receives from the whole heavens, depends on the height of
 the sun above the horizon and on the transparency of the atmo
 sphere.      If the atmospheric transparency undergoes much change
 when the sky is cloudless, a long series of experiments must be made
 before the true relations of atmospheric extinction of the chemical
 rays can be arrived at.       The authors believe, however, founding
 their opinion on the statement of Seidel in his classical research on
 the luminosity of the fixed stars, that the alterations in the air's
 transparency with a cloudless sky are very slight ; and they there
 fore think themselves justified in considering the chemical illumi
nation of the earth's surface, on cloudless days, to be represented
 simply as a function of the sun's zenith distance. Although, from the
comparatively small number of experiments which have been made,
owing to the difficulty of securing perfectly cloudless weather, the
constants contained in the formulae cannot lay claim to any very
great degree of accuracy, the authors believe that the numbers ob
tained are sufficient to enable them to determine the relation accord

    From a series of observations made on June 6, 1858, the relation
between the amount of light optically measured falling from the
whole sky, and the amount (taken as unity) which, at the same
time, falls from a portion of zenith sky equal to y,nnjth of the whole
visible heavens, has been calculated for every degree of sun's zenith
distance from 20° to 90°; the results being tabulated, and also
represented graphically.       These numbers, multiplied by the che
mical light proceeding from the same portion of zenith sky for the
same zenith distances, must give the chemical action effected by the
whole diffuse daylight.      The amount of chemical light which falls
from the zenith portion of sky        is,
                                        however, the chemical brightness
of that portion of sky. This chemical brightness has been deter
mined,       by
             the chlorine and hydrogen photometer, on various days,
and at different hours, when the sky was perfectly cloudless.             A
table contains the chemical action, expressed in degrees of light,

senting the relation between the action and the height of the sun,
shows that although the single observations were made on different
years and at different times of the year and day, they all agree
closely amongst themselves, and hence another proof           gained of the

corresponding numbers of the former table, in order to give the
chemical action effected by the total diffuse light of day for zenith

these numbers     is given.    Knowing the relation between the sun's
altitude and the chemical action, the chemical illumination effected
each minute at any given locality at        given time may be calculated

    Experiment has shown that clouds exert the most powerful
ence in reflecting        the   chemical      rays  ;  when      the   sky  is  partially
covered by light white clouds, the chemical illumination is more than
four times as intense as when the sky is clear.                       Dark clouds and
mists, on the other          hand,   absorb     almost     all  the   chemically   active

allowing a known fractional portion of the solar rays to fall perpen
 dicularly on the insolation vessel of the chemical photometer.

solar rays reflected from the mirror                       a   Silbermann's
were passed through a fine opening of known area into the dark
 room, and a large number of reductions and corrections had to be
made in order to obtain, from the direct observations, the action,
 expressed in degrees of light, which
                                                   the sun shining directly upon
 the apparatus would have produced if no disturbing influences had
 interfered.     This action of direct sunshine was determined on three
 different cloudless days for various altitudes of the sun. As the sun
                                                                                      thus
 approached the zenith the observed action rapidly increased ;
 at 7b    9'  a.m.,    on    September       15,   1858,    when     the   sun's   zenith
  distance was 76° 30', the reduced action amounted to 5-5 degrees of
 light, whilst at 9h 14' a.m. on the same day, the zenith distance
 being 58° 11', the action reached 67'6.                  This increase in the sun's
 illuminating power          is  owing    to   the    diminution      in length of the
  column of     air   through     which     the   rays    pass.     If  we suppose the

      From these experiments it is           seen, that if the sun's rays were not
   weakened     by passage through the atmosphere, they would produce
   an illumination represented by 318 degrees of light ; or they would
   effect a combination in one minute on a surface on which they fell

height, assuming that the rays are extinguished by passing through
an infinitely extended atmosphere of chlorine and hydrogen.        By
help of the above formula, it is also found that the sun's rays, after
they have passed in a perpendicular direction through the atmo
sphere to the sea's level, under a mean pressure of 0-76 metre, only
effect an action of 14*4 light-metres, or that under these conditions
nearly two-thirds of their chemical activity have been lost by extinc
tion and dispersion in the atmosphere. The total chemical action
emanating from the sun during each minute is therefore represented
by a column of hydrochloric acid 35 metres in height, and having
an area equal to the surface of a sphere whose diameter is the mean
distance of the earth to the sun. Or the light which the sun
radiates into space during each minute of time represents a chemical
energy, by means of which more than 25 billions of cubic miles of
chlorine and hydrogen may be combined to form hydrochloric acid.
In like manner the amounts of chemical action have been calculated,
which the sun's rays, undiminished by atmospheric extinction, pro
duce at the surface of the chief planets.    The first column of num
bers gives the mean distances of the planets from the sun, the second

   By aid of the formula already given, the authors have been enabled
to calculate the chemical' action effected each minute by the direct
sunlight, not only at different points on the earth's surface, but at
various heights above the sea's level.     Both these series of relations
are tabulated, and graphically      represented.    On comparing the
numbers and curves giving the action of the total diffuse light with
those of the direct solar light, the singular fact becomes apparent,
that from the North Pole to latitudes below that of Petersburg,
the chemical action proceeding from the diffuse light     is,throughout
the day on the vernal equinox, greater than that effected by the
direct sunlight ; and that in lower latitudes, down to the Equator,
the same phenomenon      is observed, if  not for the whole, still for a
portion of the day.     It further seen, that for all places, and on
                          is
every day when the sun rises to   a   certain height above the horizon,
there  is  moment at which the chemical action of the diffused light
            a
is exactly equal to that of the direct sunlight.     The times at which
these phases of equal chemical illumination occur can be calculated    ;
 they can also be actually determined, by allowing the direct sunlight
alone, and the whole diffuse daylight alone, to fall at the same time
upon two pieces of the same sensitized photographic paper; the
period at which both papers become equally blackened, gives the

 68                          Royal Society   :¦
 time of the phase of equal chemical intensity.      Experiment proved
 not only that these points of equality which the theory requires
 actually occur, hut also that the agreement between the calculated
 and observed times of occurrence of the phases is very close, giving
 proof that the data upon which the theory is founded are substan
 tially correct.
    The formula, by help of which the chemical action of the direct
 sunlight effected at any place during any given time can be calcu
 lated, is next developed, and the direct solar action at the following

    The authors next proceed to examine the chemical brightness of
the sun compared with a terrestrial source of light.         For this pur
pose the intensely bright light produced by a wire         of  magnesium
burning in the air was employed.          Experiment showed that the
chemical intensity of the sunlight, undiminished by atmospheric
extinction, is 128 times greater than that from a surface of incan
descent magnesium of like apparent magnitude ; or that burning
magnesium effects the same chemical illumination as the sun when
 9° 53' above the horizon, supposing of course that both luminous
sources present to the illuminated surface the same apparent magni
tude.     A totally different relation was found to exist between the
visible illuminating power, i. e. the effect produced on the eye, of
the two sources in question.      Thus, when the sun's zenith distance
was 67° 22', the chemical brightness of that source was 36 ¦6 times,
but the visible brightness 525 times as large as that of the terrestrial
source   of light.
    In the last section of this communication the chemical action of
the constituent parts of the solar spectrum is investigated.          The
sun's rays were reflected from a Silbermann's heliostat, and after
passing through a narrow slit, they were decomposed by two quartz
prisms.     The spectrum thus produced was allowed to fall upon a
white screen covered with a solution of quinine, and any desired por
tion of the rays could be measured by a finely-divided scale, and the
position noted by observation of the distances from the fixed lines.
For the purpose of identifying the fixed lines in the lavender rays,
the authors were, by the kindness of Mr. Stokes, allowed the use of
an unpublished map of the most refrangible portion of the spectrum,
prepared by that gentleman.        As the various components of white

 light  are unequally      absorbed by the atmosphere, it was obviously
 necessary     to   conduct   all the measurements         so quickly after one
another, that no appreciable difference in the thickness of the column
 of air passed through should occur.
    This has been accomplished, and a series of exact measurements
of the chemical actions of the spectrum for one particular zenith-
 distance of the sun obtained.          The action on the sensitive gas shows
the existence of several maxima of chemical intensity in the spectrum.
Between the lines G in the indigo and H in the violet the greatest
action was observed, whilst another maximum was found to lie near
the line    I in the ultra-violet rays. Towards the red or least refran
gible end of the spectrum, the action became imperceptible about the
line D in the orange, but at the other end of the spectrum the action
was found to extend as far as Stokes's line U, or to a distance from
the line H greater than the total length of the ordinary visible spec
trum. Tables and curves representing the action are given.
    " On    the Action of Acids         on Glycol."     (Second Notice).    By
Dr. Maxwell Simpson.
    Since my last communication (Phil. Mag. Dec. 1859) *, I have dis
covered a more convenient process for the preparation of chloracetine
of glycol. I have ascertained that the monoacetateof glycol is as readily
converted into this substance by the action of hydrochloric acid, as a
mixture of acetic acid and glycol.            As the monoacetate is easily ob
tained, and for this purpose need not be quite pure, it is possible by
this method to prepare the body in question on a large scale and
¦with great facility.       It is simply necessary to conduct a stream^ of
dry hydrochloric        acid  gas into the monoacetate, maintained at the
temperature        of 100°C,     till the quantity of oil precipitated on the
addition of water ceases to increase.           The whole is then well washed
with    water,    dried  by  means     of  chloride of calcium, and distilled.
Almost the entire quantity passes over between 144° and 146° C.
A portion of liquid prepared in this manner gave the following
numbers on analysis, which leave no doubt as to its identity : —

   Equivalent quantities of chloracetine and butyrate of silver were
exposed in a balloon with a long neck to a temperature ranging be
tween 100° and 200° C, till all the silver salt had been converted into
chloride.     The product was then digested with ether, filtered, and
the filtered liquor submitted to distillation.             As soon as all the ether
had been driven off", the thermometer rose rapidly to 180°, and be
tween that temperature and 215° almost the entire quantity passed
over. This was fractioned, and the portion distilling between 208°
and 215° was set apart for analysis.               The numbers obtained lead to
the formula C4 H3 02            \     as  will be   seen from    the following per-

   I  also   made a determination of the acids by heating a weighed
quantity of the ether with hydrate of baryta in the usual manner.
The quantity of sulphate of baryta obtained indicated 2-2 equivalents
of acid for one equivalent of the substance analysed. The excess of
acid was probably owing to the presence in the ether of a trace of
free butyric acid.          The following equation will explain the reaction

    In many reactions chlorine           replaces, and is replaced by, H+02 ; in
this it is replaced by the group C8 H7 02 (equivalent to one atom of

    This ether, which          I  may call butyroacetate of glycol, has a bitter
 pungent    taste.     It  is  insoluble  in water, but soluble in alcohol. It is
 specifically  heavier      than   water. It is a very stable body, — solution of
potash,    even  when      boiling, effecting its decomposition with difficulty.

  Action of Hydrochloric and Benzoic Acids                 on Glycol. — Formation
                            of Chlorbenzoate of Glycol.
    A mixture of equivalent quantities of glycol and benzoic acid, pre
 viously fused and powdered, was exposed to the action of dry hydro
 chloric acid gas for several hours, the mixture being maintained at
the temperature of 100° during the action of the acid, as in the case
of the former compounds. The product thus formed presented the
appearance of a soft white solid, and contained a considerable quan
tity of uncombined benzoic acid. This was removed by agitating it
with hot water, till, on cooling, it no longer became solid, but re
mained perfectly fluid.          Finally it was dissolved in alcohol, and pre
 cipitated by     water.     The   body thus prepared, and without being
distilled, was analysed, having been previously dried in vacuo over
sulphuric acid.         Another specimen, prepared in the same manner,
at a different time, was also analysed, having, however, been previ
ously distilled.       During the distillation it was observed that not a
drop of   fluid   passed over till the mercury had risen to 254°, and be
tween    that    temperature and 270° the entire liquid distilled over.
What passed over between 260° and 270° was collected separately ;
this was the portion analysed.                 The numbers obtained on analysis

    Action of Hydriodic Acid                        — Formation

                      Ethylene and Iodhydrine           of Glycol.
    Hydriodic acid gas is absorbed with great energy by glycol. A
considerable quantity of heat is evolved during the passage of the
gas, and the liquor becomes black and thick from the separation of
free iodine.       On removing the iodine by means of dilute potash, a
mass of small white crystals is brought to light, which                        I at once
suspected     to  be  iodide    of    ethylene.     To  remove     all   doubt   on this
point,   I  submitted   the  crystals     to  analysis, having previously purified
them by recrystallizing from boiling alcohol.                    The numbers ob
 tained agree with the      formula       of iodide of ethylene : —

    That the action of hydriodic acid on glycol should be different
 from that of hydrochloric acid is doubtless owing to the bond of
 union between hydrogen and iodine being much weaker than that
 between hydrogen and chlorine.
    If, on the other hand, the temperature of the glycol be prevented
 from rising during the passage of the hydriodic acid gas, by sur
 rounding the vessel containing it with cold water, a liquid product is
 obtained, which is coloured dark-brown by free iodine. This                      I  have
 not as yet been able to discover any means of purifying, it being
 soluble in water, and decomposed by distillation.                     I  believe, how
 ever, it is the compound corresponding to chlorhydrine                        of glycol
                  discovered           M. Wurtz.        A   portion    of this liquid,

   all, an analysis is not necessary to enable us to arrive at the composi
  tion of this body.     The products formed by the action of potash on
  it furnish us with almost as convincing a proof of its composition as
  any analysis could do.        They are iodide of potassium and oxide of
  ethylene.
      Iodhydrine of glycol is soluble in water and alcohol, but insoluble
  in ether. It has no taste at first ; after a time, however, it almost
  burns the tongue, it is so pungent.           It is decomposed by heat into
  iodide of ethylene, and probably glycol.            It acts with great energy
  on the salts of silver.
    Action of Hydriodic and Acetic Acids on Glycol. —Formation of
                              Iodacetine of Glycol.
      A stream of hydriodic acid gas was conducted into a mixture of
 equivalent quantities of glacial acetic acid and glycol, the tempera
 ture of which was prevented from rising during the action of the gas.
 As soon as a portion of the liquid gave a considerable quantity of an
 oily precipitate on the addition of water, the passage of the gas
 was interrupted ; for the prolonged action of the gas is apt to give
 rise to the formation of iodide of ethylene. The liquid thus obtained
 was well washed with very dilute potash, dried in vacuo, and ana-

    Iodacetine has a sweetish pungent taste.            It is insoluble in water,
but soluble in alcohol and ether.        Its specific gravity is greater than
that of water. It crystallizes in tables when exposed to cold. Heated
with potash, it gives iodide of potassium, acetate of potash, and oxide
of ethylene. It is readily decomposed by the salts of silver.
    This compound can also be prepared with great facility by ex
posing monoacetate of glycol to the action of hydriodic acid gas.
The liquid must be kept cold during the action of the gas, which
should be interrupted as soon as the addition of water to a portion
of it causes an abundant oily precipitate. The whole is then washed
with dilute potash, and dried in vacuo.              A specimen prepared in
this manner gave, on analysis, 22-62 per cent, carbon and 3-43 hy
drogen, instead of 22-42 carbon and 3-27 hydrogen.

pounds more particularly.

     During    the author's stay at the gold-mine on the River Shargan,
 in Siberia     (Lat, 59° 30' N. and Long. 96° 10' E.) in August 1851,
  some fragments of worked bronze were dug up by the workmen, at
  a depth of 14 feet 8 inches below the surface, from a bed of sand in
  which gold-nuggets occur. This sand rests on the rock, and is
  covered by beds of gravel and sand, overlain by 2 feet of vegetable
  soil.    The fragments appear to have belonged either to a bracelet
  or to some horse-trappings.

          " On the Volcanic Country of Auckland, New Zealand."          By
  Charles Heaphy, Esq.        Communicated by the President.
     The isthmus-like district of Auckland and its neighbourhood,
  described by Mr. Heaphy as a basin of Tertiary deposits, is bordered

  76                       Geological  Society : —
  by clay-slate, igneous rocks, and at one spot on the south by creta
  ceous strata ; and it is dotted by upwards of sixty extinct volcanos,
  often closely situated, and showing in nearly every instance a well-
  defined point of eruption, generally a cup-like crater, on a hill about
  300 feet high.    Interesting instances of successive volcanic eruption
  are numerous all over this district, 60 miles round Auckland ; and
  there seems to have been four distinct epochs of eruption, thus
  classified by Mr. Heaphy : — 1. The first was that which raised the
  trachytic mountains and the black boulder-like           igneous rock.
  2. Then came the eruptions in the Tertiary period, the ashes
 of which form beds in the Tertiary rock. 3. Then the eruptions on
 the upheaval of the Tertiary cliffs : these appear as cones above
 faults on the Tertiary beds and on the edges of cliffs.        4. Lastly
 the eruptions that have broken through the Tertiary beds, and the
 lava-streams of which follow the natural valleys of the country.
 The volcanic phenomena were illustrated by maps and numerous
 sketches by the author.        Some Tertiary Terebratulce,    some few
 fossil plants, and some Cretaceous fossils (Inoceramus and Belem-
 nitella) accompanied this memoir.
     3.  " On the Geology of a part of South Australia."     By T. Burr,
 Esq. From the Colonial Office. 1848.
     The lowlands about Adelaide on the west, and along the River
 Murray on the east, consist of horizontal beds of limestone and cal-
 careo-siliceous deposits, yellowish and reddish in colour, full of
 marine fossils, and of the Tertiary age.        Sometimes gypsum and
 ferruginous sand replace the limestone.          These plains are arid,
 except where granite protrudes from the surface, presenting cavities
 in which rain-water collects. The author observed a similar Tertiary
formation on Yorke's Peninsula, at Port Lincoln, and to the S.E. to
beyond Rivoli Bay ; and it probably forms vast tracts in New South
 Wales and Western Australia.          None of these tertiary districts
  appear to exceed an elevation of 300 feet above the sea.
     In describing two volcanos in South Australia, Mount Gambier
 and Mount Schauck, Mr. Burr remarked that, coming from the west
or north-west, at about 20 miles from these hills a white coral-lime
stone (Bryozoan limestone) containing flint or chert, takes the place
of the limestones and calcareous sandstones, with recent sand-forma
tion, previously passed over.      This white limestone is remarkable
for the numerous deep well-like water-holes in it, within about 12
miles of the volcanic mountains and about east or west of them.
    Mount Gambier has a height of 900 feet above the sea (600 feet
above the plain), and has three craters, lying nearly east and west,
and occupied with lakes of fresh water. Mount Schauck, at a distance
of about 9 miles, magnetic south, is circular, and has one large, and
two small lateral craters.
    The author next described the granite, gneiss, and slaty rocks
along a section extending from the River Murray and Kangaroo
Range, across Mount Barker and Mount Lofty, towards Adelaide ;
and noticed the mode of occurrence of the ores of copper, iron, lead,
&c. in these rocks.     Lastly he noticed and explained the occurrence

     4.  " On some Tertiary deposits in South Australia." By the Rev.
Julian Edmund Woods.           Communicated by the President.
     The author, in the first place, described the geographical features
of that part of the colony of South Australia to which his observa
tions refer.     It lies between the River Murray on the west, and the
colony of Victoria on the east ; and includes an area 156 miles long,
N. and S., and 70 broad from E. to W. Some trap-dykes and four
volcanic hills are almost the only interruptions to the horizontality
 of these plains, which rise gradually from the sea, and are occupied
by the Tertiary beds to be noticed ; they extend into Victoria for
 some seventy miles, as far as Port Fairy.
     In some places on the plains a white compact unfossiliferous lime
 stone lies under the surface-soil; and is sometimes 30 feet thick.
 Under this is a fossiliferous limestone. The passage between the
 two is gradual. This latter rock is made up of Bryozoa — perfect and
 in fragments — with some Pectens, Terebratulx, Echinoderms, &c.
     Sometimes this rock appears like friable chalk, without distinct
 fossils.   A large natural pit, originating from the infalling of a cave,
 occurs near the extinct volcano Mount Gambier, and is 90 feet
 deep — showing a considerable thickness of this Bryozoan deposit in
 several beds of 14 ft., 10 ft., 12 ft. thickness.      Similar pits show
 the deposit in the same way at the Mosquito Plains, 70 miles north.
     Regular layers of flints, usually black, rarely white, occur in these
 beds, from 14 to 20 feet apart.        These, with its colour, and with
 the superficial sand-pipes, perforating the rock to a great depth, give
  it a great resemblance to chalk.
     The whole district is honeycombed with caves — always, however,
 in the higher grounds in the undulations of the plains.
     One of the caves, in a ridge on the northern side of the Mosquito
  Plains, is 200 feet long, is divided into three great halls, and has
  extensive side- chambers.     The caves have a north and south direc
 tion, like that of the ridge.    The large cave has a great stalactite
  in it ; and many bones of Marsupialia are heaped up against this
  on the side facing the entrance ; possibly they may have been
  washed up against this barrier by an inflowing stream. The dried
  corpse of a native lies in this cave.    It has been partially entangled
  in the stalactite ; but this man was known to have crept into the
  cave when he had been wounded, some fourteen years ago.            Many
  of the caves have great pits for their external apertures, and contain
  much water.
      Some shallow caves contain bones of existing Marsupialia, which
  have evidently been the relics of animals that fell into the grass-
  hidden aperture at top.
      The caves appear in many cases to be connected with a subterra
  nean system of drainage ; currents and periodical oscillations being
   occasionally observed in the waters contained in them. There is but
  little superficial drainage. One overflowing swamp was found by

 of limestone.
    Patches of shelly    sand occur here and there over the 10,980 square
 miles of country occupied by the white limestones ; but near the
 coast this shelly sand thickens to 200 feet.
    A coarse limestone forms a ridge along the coast-line, and it con
 tains existing species of shells.    This indicates an elevation of the
 coast of late date, and which probably is still taking place.

              ON A NEW      MINERAL CONTAINING NIOBIUM.
                           BY DR. JULIUS POTYKA.
    'HE author was induced by H. Rose, to undertake the investiga-
       tion of a mineral received by Dr. Krantz, of Bonn, from Norway
under the name of tyrite, and sent by him to Rose.            The analyses
 of this mineral showed that it is probably a new species.         Its com
 position is different both from that of Fergusonite (Weber), and from
 that of tyrite (Forbes).     From these two minerals it is distinguished
 especially by its great amount of potash, and from tyrite also by its
 containing zirconia, whilst alumina has been found in tyrite.          As,
however, the locality where it occurs is still unknown, and its cry
stalline form has not yet been observed, the author has not given it
a name.
   The mineral received by the author forms small specimens of irre
gular outline about 4 lines in diameter, included in red felspar.         It
is not cleavable, has an uneven fracture, a black colour, and an im
perfect metallic lustre ; the fragments exhibit a reddish brown
translucence at their edges.      Its streak is reddish brown.    Its hard
ness is equal to that of apatite.
    When heated before the blowpipe with borax, it furnishes a glo
bule which is reddish yellow while hot, yellowish when cold ; in
phosphorus salt it dissolves readily, forming a clear globule, which is
greenish yellow while hot, greenish on cooling.          When fused with
carbonate of soda and nitrate of potash, it gives no reaction of man
ganese.     The specific gravity of the coarse powder is 5m 124 at
63°-68 F. If hot water be poured over the mineral, it crackles ;
and on boiling it afterwards, air-bubbles escape — at the same time
the colour becomes pale liver-brown, but on drying it again becomes

     By means of this instrument              an aperture transmitting    light is
 made to produce on one eye an isolated impression, while the other
 eye is directed to an opake body, such as the hand held before it.
 The image of      the aperture is then found to be transposed, and its
 perception ceases to be assigned to the eye by which it is really seen,
 — the effect being that a perforation appears in the opake body,
 through which the light seems to shine upon the eye by which this
 is viewed.     The principle        illustrated by this instrument, according
 to the author's     view,   is the essentially goniometrical and deductive
 nature of the visual act, whenever the distances of bodies are per
 ceived, and their relative positions in space assigned.— Proc. Lit.

   ON   THE OCCURRENCE           OF    UREA IN THE ORGANS OF THE PLAGI-
                  OSTOMOUS        FISHES.      BY G. STADELER.
      In an investigation made last year by Frerichs and Stadeler, these
  observers found that the Plagiostomi are distinguished from all other
  fishes by their containing large quantities of urea in all their organs.
  The organs and the blood of Scyllium canicula, the kidneys and
  muscles of Spinax acanthias, and different organs of the Rays, con

tained urea in abundance, whilst in bony fishes, as also in the Stur
geon and Lamprey, which make the nearest approach to the Plagio
stomi, no urea could be detected. . From this it appeared that the
metamorphosis of materials in the Plagiostomi is quite different from
that in all other fishes, and the subject was of sufficient importance
to call for further investigation.
    Last winter the author saw upon a table a large specimen of Raia
clavata, which had been taken at Marseilles, and sent to Zurich
during very cold weather.         The author was able to procure the salt
water in which the fish was boiled, and succeeded in preparing pure
urea therefrom.
    The gills, heart, liver, spleen, kidneys, pancreas, testes, the hu
mours of the eye, the lenses and the muscles of a large specimen of
Raia Batis, which the author subsequently obtained from Havre,
contained very large quantities of urea, accompanied by the sub
stances formerly mentioned.        No trace of uric acid could be detected.
 Creatine was found not only in the muscles, but also in the heart
and the branchiae ; in the muscles it was accompanied by another,
difficultly soluble body, which was precipitated in white flakes by
 pernitrate of mercury, and also formed a compound with silver when
 ammonia was carefully added. This body was therefore possibly
 allantoine.    The quantity of scyllite which the author obtained,
 principally from the liver, was not sufficient for an elementary
 analysis.
    The author obtained two Torpedos from Professor Lessona of
 Genoa, T. ocellata and marmorata. They were young specimens
 of about 3 inches in breadth and from 4 to 5 inches long, preserved in
 spirit.   The alcohol had penetrated all the organs ; and therefore, as
 a separate examination of these could lead to no result, the objects
.were pounded with powdered glass and extracted with alcohol.
 The alcoholic extract was treated as already described. Urea was
 present in abundance.        Thus the occurrence of urea is proved with
 regard to six fishes of the order Plagiostomi (viz. Scyllium canicula,
 Spinax acanthias, Raia Batis, R. clavata, Torpedo marmorata, and
 T. ocellata).     As regards the formation of urea in these animals, the
 author indicates that, as no trace of uric acid occurs in the Rays, it
 appears to be most probable that the urea is formed by the further
 decomposition of creatine, the latter taking up water and splitting
 into urea and sarcosine : —
               Cs H9 N3 O4 +   2HO = C2  H4 N2 O2 + C6 H7 NO4
                 Creatine.               Urea.       Sarcosine.
    If the above-mentioned body, precipitable by mercury and silver,
be actually allantoine, the urea might certainly be derived from this,
by its taking up water and oxygen and becoming decomposed into
carbonic acid and urea. — Journ.fur Prakt, Chemie, lxxvi. p. 58.

A MUSICAL            note is produced by a periodical motion of the
         air repeated in the same manner at equal and sufficiently
small intervals of time.       The motion during each period of
oscillation may be quite arbitrary, provided that the same motion
which took place during the first period be repeated in like man
ner in all subsequent ones.
    If, in each period of oscillation, the small particles of air move
to and fro exactly in the same manner as the centre of gravity
of a pendulum when its amplitude is very small, we hear only a
simple and single note, whose pitch is determined by the number
of equal periods contained in a second.       In this case the velocity
as well as the pressure of the air at any point of the mass of air
in motion, may be represented mathematically by a simple ex
pression of the form A sin (2irnt +           In former memoir on

 by  means of which simple pendulum-like oscillations of molecules
of air (or, as proposed to call them, simple aerial waves) may be
               I

struck, do not communicate perceptible oscillations to the mass
of air in which they are held.       But when they are held at the
mouth of resonant tube whose deepest note

nicated forcibly to the air.    Even when the tuning-fork can give
 still higher notes,      may be easily so arranged that these, its
                          it
 higher notes, shall not be in unison with the higher notes of

shall remain inaudible.
    But when the motion of the air during a period of oscilla
tion does not follow the simple law of the pendulum, but any
other whatever, we may in general by due attention discover
various notes, even when the motion of the air is produced by a
single sounding body. Now, according to the well-known theorem
of Fourier, every periodical motion of the air may be expressed
mathematically by a sum of terms, each of which has the form
A sin (2irmt +             c),
                     and therefore corresponds to simple pendulum
                                                          a
like oscillation of the particles of air. In this expression,        and   A
c  are dependent upon the value of m, and m assumes successively
the values n, 2n, 3n, 4n, &c, where n, as before, denotes the
number of simple periods in         second.a
    Now in all cases where the nature of the motion of the
sounding body can be theoretically found and mathematically
represented as      sum of such sines, the ear, when due attention
                           a
is  paid, can really distinguish notes of n, 2», 3ra, &c. oscillations,
although, in all cases in which such          motion of the air
                                                    a                not   is
actually   produced   by different sounding  bodies, the coexistence   of
a  number of simple pendulum-like oscillations of the particles of
air  is   pure mathematical fiction.
          a
    The universality of this perception of distinct notes induced
a  celebrated member of this Academy, the late G. S. Ohm, to
propose as      definition of simple note that which
                   a                   a                       produced

              by   a
from that of simple pendulum oscillation.

and must therefore return to the subject on another occasion.                   I
will only remark that his objections are founded essentially on
the difficulties which we often experience in distinguishing the
higher notes.      In fact, in all observations made             by
                                                             the senses
two things must be kept distinct, viz. the immediate sensation
or effect upon the auditory nerves, and the conception which
arises therefrom by        psychical process, and which leads us to
                                 a
the conviction of the presence of        certain sounding body.
                                                a                     In
the immediate sensation the several simple notes may certainly
be distinguished from one another when sufficient attention                     is
given ;   whilst in the mental image they become blended together
into the impression produced upon the ear                  by
                                                       the tone of the
sounding body in question.          The attention, indeed, generally
requires artificial assistance             in
                                     order to distinguish the several

                 Prof. Helmholtz on Vowel Sounds.                  83
elements of the compound sensation, — just as, for example, spe
cial methods of observation are requisite in order to convince
ourselves that the apparent solidity of any object at which we
look arises from the coalescence of different pictures presented
to our two eyes.
    On this account  I formerly proposed to designate by the name
sound {Klang) the whole compound sensation produced by the
motion of the air proceeding from a single sounding body, and
to limit the name note {Ton) to the simple sensation produced
by a simple pendulum- like motion of the air.         Accordingly the
sensation of a sound is generally composed of the sensations
of several simple notes. If we limit to sounds all that Seebeck
said in his discussion with Ohm, and to notes the assertions of
Ohm, both these distinguished acousticians are right, and the
assertions of both may remain undisturbed side by side.
    We will retain this designation throughout, and at the same
time agree to understand by the pitch of a sound the pitch of
the gravest simple note of n oscillations contained therein, i. e.
the pitch of its fundamental or primary note ; all others will be
called incidental or higher notes.     I call the note of 2n oscilla
tions, the octave of the foregoing, the second note ; that of 3»
oscillations the third note, and so on.
    The generosity of His Majesty the King of Bavaria having
enabled me to procure the apparatus necessary for my research,
I  proposed to examine the consequences of the proposition of
Ohm on the theory of tones {Klanyfarbe).          In a physical point
of view, it has long been known that the different forms of the
aerial waves within each single period of oscillation correspond
to what our ear distinguishes as different tones or qualities of
sound.     But this hypothesis rested solely upon the fact that
 there was no other possible way of explaining such differences
 of tone.   An experimental verification was requisite, and this   is,
perhaps,   now  supplied  by my researches.
    In a   physiological point of view,     a   further consequence
could be drawn from the proposition of Ohm.            Since all oscil
lations which do not correspond to the simple motion of             a
pendulum produce sensations in which            a certain number of
simple notes are distinguishable, sounds of different qualities
whose primary notes have equal pitch, must, to the ear, be
rendered different   by  the different intensities of the harmonic
incidental notes.    Let us leave out of consideration the different
ways in which sounds of different instruments and voices com
mence and cease, as also the manifold shouting, grating, jarring,
irregular noises which accompany many of them, and which,
properly speaking, ought not to be considered as constituting the
 musical part of the sounds, and let us call the part of the tone
                                G2

 84                Prof. Heluiholtz on Vowel Sounds.
 which does not depend upon the above-named accidental circum
 stances, the musical tone or quality of the sound ; the question
 then arises, Do musical tones differ only in consequence of the
 different intensities of the incidental notes contained therein ?
     But in conceiving the form of a wave composed of several
 simple waves, it is of importance to consider not only the am
 plitudes of oscillation of the latter, but also the differences of
phase between them and the primary note.              We obtain very
 different wave-forms when we combine the wave of a primary
 note and its first higher octave, according as we allow the maxi
 mum condensation of the primary to coincide with that of the
 octave, or with the minimum condensation of the octave, or with
 any other intermediate phase.        The former question, therefore,
 becomes included in the following more special form : Does the
 distinction of musical tones depend only upon the perception of
 higher notes of different intensities, or does the ear also distinguish
 differences of phase ?
    This question would be most directly answered by endeavour
ing at once to produce sounds of different qualities by direct
 combinations of simple notes, such as can be obtained with
tuning-forks.      The several vowels of the German language ap
peared most appropriate as objects for imitation, for they may
be produced as uniformly continuous musical sounds, and at the
same time be kept nearly, though not quite, free from unmusical
noises.
    My apparatus consists of a series of eight tuning-forks, which
correspond to B (in the deepest octave of a bass voice), and to
its harmonic higher notes as far as 64 (in the highest octave of a
soprano), namely to the notes B, b,fx, bv d2, f2, as2, and bv Each
tuning-fork is fastened between the ends of a horseshoe electro
magnet and joined to a properly tuned resonant tube. The mouths
of the resonant tubes are provided with moveable covers, which
may be removed by means of threads whose ends are fastened to
a set of pianoforte keys.      The tuning-forks are set in motion by
means of intermittent electric currents, which are produced ac
cording to the principle of Neef's hammer, and whose number per
second is equal to 112, the number of the oscillations per second
of the deepest-toned fork.       After overcoming several difficulties,
I  succeeded in so arranging the apparatus that, when put into
action, the low humming of the forks could scarcely be heard so
long as all the resonant tubes remained closed; but as soon as
one or more of the resonant tubes were opened by means of the
pianoforte keys, the respective notes became distinctly audible.
The intensity of any note could be easily regulated by opening
the corresponding tube more or less completely.
    I combined in the first place the two deepest notes alone, to

                 Prof. Helmholtz on Vowel Sounds.                 85
these  I  then added the third, and gradually several others, and
endeavoured to imitate with the voice the sounds thus pro
duced. Thus      I learnt by degrees to imitate the different sounds
of the vowels more or less completely; U, 0, Oe, E were pretty
good and distinct; I, Ue somewhat less so, for here the whit
tling of the air through the mouth, to whose different characters
Donder called attention, is comparatively loudest ; A and Ae
were still worse, because here we require the combination of a
great number of notes, the intensity of each of which cannot be
so completely regulated ; for A, in fact, a series of higher notes,
            I
for which had no forks, were requisite.
    It may be remarked that, in general, the vowel-sounds com
posed by means of tuning-forks are more similar to those of the
human voice when singing than when speaking.              In the dry
sound of our ordinary speech another kind of intonation is
chosen, in which the primary note is much less prominent than
the higher incidental notes and noises ; by this means, in fact,
the differences of tone become more evident than they do in sing
 ing, where the primary note becomes more intense, and thus
 hides the incidental notes more completely. The artificially pro
 duced vowels bear the strongest resemblance to those which are
 heard when we sing those vowels loudly into the interior of a
 pianoforte. The following are the particulars of my results : —
    The simple primary note, compared with the compound sounds,
 had the tone of U. The vowel is somewhat more distinct when
 the primary note is weakly accompanied by the third note.
    0 is imitated when the primary note is powerfully accompa
 nied by its higher octave. A very weak accompaniment of the
 third and fourth notes is advantageous, though not necessary.
    E is especially characterized by the third note, the second
 being moderately strong.       The fourth and fifth may also be
 weakly sounded.
    The transition from 0 to E, therefore, follows from diminish
 ing the second and increasing the third note.
    Oe ensues when both these secondary notes are loud.
    Ue arises when the primary note is accompanied by a third
 note of moderate strength.
    For I, the primary note must be weakened, the second, in
 comparison with the primary note, must be strong, the third
 very weak, the fourth, which is characteristic of this vowel,
 must be loud, and the fifth moderately strong. The weak notes,
 such as the third and fifth, may be omitted without causing
 any essential change of quality.
    For A and Ae, on the contrary, the higher incidental notes
 are characteristic ; the second note may be quite omitted, the
 third may be weakly given, but the higher notes must be

made as prominent as possible, for by the method here em
ployed the intensity of the highest is but small.           For Ae, the
fourth and fifth notes are specially important ; for A, the notes
from the fifth to the seventh.          When the third note is com
 pletely omitted, A has a nasal sound.
    I must, however, remark that the above-mentioned             relations
 between the primary and the higher notes refer only to the pitch
 of my tuning-forks. The primary note B corresponds nearly to the
pitch of moderately deep male voices when speaking.            I have not
yet   had time  to conclude    my   researches   on  vowels at   a  higher
pitch,  for  I was    not  able  to   pursue   the  investigation much
further with my incomplete set of tuning-forks.           When     I made
the former second note b my primary,          I  had only three appro
priate higher notes. With these        I was able to imitate U, O, Oe,
             I
E, Ue, and according to the given rule ; but the absence of the
higher notes rendered my imitation of A and Ae imperfect ; so
that here, as at a lower pitch, the same relation of upper notes
to the primary one appeared to be essential in the imitation of
the vowel.     This higher pitch corresponds nearly to that in
which high voices generally speak.
    On the other hand,      I  carried the investigation further by
direct observations on the human voice by means of a special
contrivance, which renders the most inexperienced capable of
distinguishing the incidental notes of every musical sound, — a
problem which formerly could be solved only by long practice
and great attention.      I  made use of peculiar resonant vessels,
which were applied to the ear itself. The best vessels of this
kind are glass globes with two openings, one of which termi
nates in a funnel-shaped neck whose end fits into the ear.              If
one ear is provided with such a resonant globe whilst the other
is closed, most external notes are very much deadened ; those,
however, which correspond to the proper note of the glass globe
(in combination with the hollow of the ear) are heard with ex
traordinary distinctness. The upper notes of any external sound
which correspond to the note of the glass globe, are now also
increased in intensity.     If, for example, a globe is placed to the
ear whose note is fv and the vowels are sung on B, whose third
note is fv it will be found that with U, I, Ue, A, and Ae, the
note of the globe is only feebly heard, whilst it becomes very pro
minent with 0 and Oe, and extremely intense with E. By the
help of such resonant globes a number of acoustical phsenomena,
such as objective resultant notes, the incidental notes and their
beats, which were formerly difficult to investigate, are rendered
easily accessible.    The investigation of the human voice, so con
ducted, confirmed the results which         I   had obtained with the
tuning-forks when B was the key-note sung upon ; for keys of

                  Prof. Helmholtz     on Vowel Sounds.                 87
higher pitch there were slight deviations.           It was found that
for the incidental notes of several vowels, certain parts of the
musical scale are peculiarly favourable, so that these notes, fall
ing in this part of the scale, become stronger than when they
fall in other parts. Thus, for 0, the upper half of the octave above
the lines constitutes such a favourable part of the scale. The third
and fourth higher notes, which are heard distinctly at a low pitch
of the vowel, lie in this part, and are not so prominent when 0
is sung on a higher key. For A, the upper half of the second
octave above the lines is favourable. The second, third, and fourth
notes, which are weak at the low pitch of the vowel, are very pro
minent when A is sung between b and bv              Moreover,     I found
by  means   of the  above-described    resonant  globes  that, especially
for A, there are feeble but audible notes higher than any to
which my tuning-forks reach. When the vowel A was sung on
F, another globe, which was tuned to eSg, corresponding to four
teen times as many oscillations as F, resounded considerably.
   With respect to differences of phase, no effect of the kind
manifested itself in my experiments.         I  was able to control the
phases  of oscillation according   to  the  optical method of Lissajou.
In the first place, by reversing the electrical currents in the
electro-magnet of every single tuning-fork, the oscillation of
the latter can be changed by half an undulation, so that the
maximum and minimum deflections change places with each
other.    Further, by fixing a little wax to them, the tuning-forks
can be slightly untuned ; their oscillations then become weaker,
and thus, up to a quarter of an undulation, the phases can be the
more displaced the greater the discordance of the tuning-forks.
The change of phase in the weaker notes may be still more
easily effected.     To do so, they may either be weakened by
removing the forks further from the resonaut tubes, whereby
the phases of the oscillations of the air are not changed, or the
resonant tubes may be only partially opened ; in the latter case
a change of phase takes place, as        I have shown in a theoretical
memoir on Acoustic Oscillations, which is now being printed in
Crelle's Journal (vol. lvii.).    The changes of phase produced in
any one of these ways, however, cause no change in the tone,
provided the intensities of the notes remain the same ; so that the
former question may in general be answered thus : The musical
tone depends only upon the presence and intensity       of the incidental
notes in the sound, and not upon their differences      of phase.
   I must,   however, remark that there are apparent exceptions to
this rule.     When the notes are sufficiently strong, resultant
notes may become intermixed, which, according to the differences
of phase, may partly weaken and partly strengthen the primary
notes, so as to give rise to differences of tone.        Here, however,

88              Prof. Challis     on a Theory        of Molecular       Forces.
amongst other experimental results,      believe       I
                                                   may venture to   I
assert that the differences of sound depend only upon the differ
ences in the intensities of the notes ; but that the latter, under
the above-mentioned circumstances, depend upon differences of
phase.
    For the present, however,                I
                                  would prefer to limit the above
assertion to the lower incidental notes, which, lying far apart in
the scale, reach a3 far as the sixth and seventh.       The higher
incidental notes give discords and beats with each other; and
when a number of such pairs of notes which give rise to beats
are heard together, it is probably not indifferent, as far as per
ception is concerned, whether the pauses of all these beats fall
together or not.    The latter, however, depend upon the differ
ences of the phase.     Moreover,                I
                                     hold it to be probable that all
these higher dissonant incidental notes form what the ear recog
nizes as accompanying noises, which latter we have already ex
cluded from our consideration of musical tones.
      I
     have in another place been led to the hypothesis, that each
nervous fibre of the auditory nerve is destined for the perception
of notes of a particular pitch, and is excited when the note which
strikes the ear corresponds in pitch to that of the elastic forma
tion* in connexion with the fibre. According to this, the percep
tion of different tones would reduce itself to the simultaneous
excitation of the fibre which corresponds to the primary note,
and of certain others corresponding to the incidental notes.
This simple explanation could not have been given had the dif
ferences of phase of the lower incidental notes entered into con
sideration.
                    XIII. A        Theory     of Molecular Forces.
                          By Professor Challis f-
               general Theory of Physical Forces, the principles       of which
THEI have indicated in previous                       communications, must, if it
have a real foundation, include a theory of molecular forces ; that
is, of the forces       by
                        which the constituent atoms of bodies are
held in different states of aggregation — as the solid, the fluid, and
the gaseous.     The inquiry into the laws and modes of action of
this class of forces has long engaged the attention of physicists,
and has given rise to great variety of special hypotheses, mostly
                              a
of an arbitrary kind, and not referable to any general principle.
The theory am about to explain differs from all that have pre
                I
ceded     in this respect, that
          it                      admits of no other kind of action
                                           it

no law of force which is not a mathematical deduction, by means
of hydrodynamical equations, from the assumed dynamical pro
perty of the medium that its pressure is proportional to its den
sity.   The history of physical science seems to show that theo
retical investigation proceeds in but one course, that of deducing
quantitative laws, by means of solutions of equations, from
known or hypothetical principles.            For example, by the solu
tions of the first order of differential equations, the law of vis
viva is deduced from dynamical principles known by experiment,
and from D'Alemberfs principle.            By the same class of equa
tions, Kepler's laws are readily deduced from certain hypotheses
respecting the force of gravity. In the latter instance, one of the
hypotheses      is,that gravity varies inversely as the square of the
distance from the centre of emanation.            As this hypothesis may
 also be called  a quantitative law,     may, according to these views,
                                                it
be presumed to be itself deducible from ulterior principles                             by
means of    a    higher order of equations.         This     what     have
                                                                     is            I
 attempted    to do   in    communication
                               a             to the  Philosophical Maga
 zine for December 1859.
     Ifthis course of investigation applies to one kind of force,                       it
is  reasonable to suppose that         applies to all.
                                           it                    matter of
                                                                  It      is   a
 demonstration      that     theory
                               a    of molecular forces cannot be con
 structed on the hypothesis that the forces vary according to some
 law of the distance from individual material particles, unless the
 law be such that the force changes sign with the distance, so as
 to become attractive after being repulsive.            But     force be  if            a
 virtue resident in the particle,          must at its origin be either
                                                 it
 attractive or repulsive, and         seems impossible to conceive how
                                        it it
 by emanation to         distance
                           a         can change its quality.     This diffi
 culty, as will be shown,         not encountered in
                                   is                      theory of mole
                                                                 a
 cular forces, which deduces their laws from the dynamical action
of an elastic medium.
   Again, on the same principles          not permitted to ascribe to
                                                 it   is
the ultimate atoms of matter any variable quantitative proper
ties.   Accordingly     assume in the following theory, as
                           I                                     have              I
done heretofore, that, while different atoms may be of different
magnitudes, their magnitudes and forms are constant, and that
all have the same intrinsic inertia. The property of constancy
of form might be otherwise expressed                       by
                                               saying that the atoms
are infinitely hard.    Further,    make the more particular hypo
                                           I
thesis, that all atoms have the form of         sphere.    awould be       It
contrary to these principles     to ascribe to  an atom the property
of elasticity, because, from what we know of this property                              by
 experience,  it   quantitative, and, being most probably depend
                      is
 ent on  an  aggregation of atoms, may admit of explanation                            by   a
 complete theory of molecular forces.
                                                                                                s

      To these preliminary remarks       I  beg to add the expression of
  my conviction, that theoretical physics can advance only in such
  a course as that above indicated, and that progress will be made
  in proportion as the difficulties which attend the application of
  partial differential equations to physical questions are overcome.
 I   do not consider the following theory to be free from such
  difficulties.
      1. It is an evident consequence of the hypothesis that sub
 stances consist of discrete atoms, that neighbouring atoms are
 mutually repellent, for they could not otherwise remain in posi
 tions of equilibrium.       This action is the repulsion of heat. It
 will not be necessary to show here in what manner such repul
 sion results from the dynamical action of undulations of the
 aether, because I have discussed this question in the Mathema
 tical Theory of Heat contained in the Philosophical Magazine for
 March 1859, and at present          I have nothing better to offer on
 this part of the subject.      There are, however, some mathematical
 considerations, relating equally to repulsive and attractive action,
 which may now be appropriately introduced.
     In an article on Attractive Forces, contained in the Philoso
 phical Magazine for last November, I have investigated the pres
 sure at any point of the surface of a given atom, due to the
 incidence of a given series of waves, on the assumption that, for
the case in which the excursions of the particles of the aether are
large compared to the diameter of the atom, the velocity V along
the surface of the hemisphere on which the waves are incident is
W sin 6, and along the surface of the other hemisphere,
                         W sin 6— q .       sin 6   cos 9.
In this    expression,   W is put for m sin
                                               \
                                                                 the velocity

of the setherial particles ; 6 is the angle which the radius to the
point considered makes with the radius drawn in the direction
contrary to that of incidence ; and q is a certain constant. These
values of the velocity were deduced in the Philosophical Maga
zine for December, from a particular solution of the general par
tial differential equation to terms of the first order, of which P,
or Nap. log p, is the principal variable, viz.
                     d*V     ,8   (d*V +, d*F +, d*?\

solution :

fi and   q, and by consequence v, being in general functions of m
as well as X, and depending also on the magnitude of the atom.
If  the last expression be applied to the velocity along the first
hemispherical surface, v=0, the velocity impressed by the waves
incident on that surface being W sin 6. For waves having large
values of   \  and large excursions of the particles, such as those
which came under consideration in the Theory of Gravity, the
factor /i = 0, because, on account of the small size of the atom,
there is no sensible difference between the velocities along the
surfaces of the first and second hemispheres, excepting that
                                            dW
which was shown to be proportional to       —z- , and to be due to the
                                              at
varying momentum of the fluid which passes the plane separating
the two hemispheres.       On the other hand, for waves whose par
ticles perform excursions very small compared to the diameter of
an atom, q must be very small, because the fluid in contact with
the second hemisphere is disturbed but to a small extent, and the
varying momentum just spoken of has very little effect. In this
case we have very nearly
                        V=Wsin0(l+/iCos0).
Now it is evident that V and W must have the same sign, and
consequently that 1 + fi cos 6 does not change sign.            Hence the
limiting value of d is the arc whose cosine is — -, which, if         /a be
a  very large positive quantity, exceeds but little       —.     Thus the
conditions assumed in the mathematical theory of heat are
satisfied by supposing fi to be very large and q to be very small ;
and the fulfilment of these conditions accounts for the great
energy of calorific repulsion.       For as the fluid in contact with
the second hemispherical surface is nearly undisturbed, the
pressure on the other is not counteracted by opposite pressure ;
and as the total effective pressure on the first surface varies nearly
as the square of the radius of the atom, while the quantity of
inert matter of the atom varies as the cube of its radius, it follows
that the expression for the acceleration contains the radius of the
atom in the denominator.         Hence atoms of very small size, act
ing upon each other by the intervention of waves of which the
excursions are very small, mutually repel with a very great force ;
and at the same time, as was shown in the Theory of Heat, the

92          Prof. Challis on a Theory  of Molecular Forces.
force varies very rapidly with the distance. We have now to con
sider how this repulsion is controlled by attraction.
    2. Conceive the atoms contained in a spherical surface of
radius R to be centres of undulations propagated from them
equally in all directions, and take any point at a distance D from
the centre of the sphere, such that the straight lines drawn to it
                                                      R
from the atoms are quam proxime parallel.       Then  jj being a very
small but fixed ratio, let the number of atoms included within
the spherical surface of radius R be a very large given number N.
It is conceivable that this number may be so large that the
resultant consecutive values of the condensation at the given
distance D, which must be as often plus as minus, may be ex
 pressed by one or more circular functions, in which the values
of X are very much larger than those for the component undula
tions. In fact, as the components may be supposed to have
values of X very nearly consecutive, there will be epochs of
 coincidence, or greatest proximity, of their maximum condensa
tions, and equidistant epochs of coincidence, or greatest proximity,
 of their maximum rarefactions.       The fixed number N is deter
 mined by the condition, that the resultant of the different series
 of waves of the first order propagated from the individual atoms,
becomes at the distance D a series of waves of another order,
 analytically expressible like the first by periodic functions.    As
the waves    of the  second  order cannot,  any more   than  those  of
 the first, be regarded as due to a specific disturbance, but as re
sulting from the mutual action of the parts of the fluid, both
ought, according to the hydrodynamieal principles which              I
have adopted, to be equally expressed by periodic circular func
tions.
    The effect above described is analogous to what takes place at
the surface of water disturbed within a limited space, it being
 observable that, whatever be the mode of disturbance, at a short
 distance from it are formed and propagated concentric rings
 of alternate depression and elevation, which to all appearance
have continuous boundaries, and are probably the resultant of
 subordinate series of waves, which have their origins at innume
 rable points at the place of disturbance.
    3. For the sake of distinction, the portion of any given sub
 stance which consists of the fixed number of atoms N, will be
 called a molecule, whether the space containing them be cubical
 or spherical.    If the molecule be of the form of a cube, the
 quantity represented by R must be understood             to be the
radius of the sphere which has the same solid content as the
 cube.    First, let the substance be in the state of aggregation
of a solid.    Then, the mean interval between the atoms being

             Prof. Challis on  a Theory  of Molecular Forces.         93
small, the radius      B of   a molecule   will be small, and   as
                                                                   g is a
fixed ratio, D will also be comparatively small.          Hence, as the
condensation propagated from each atom varies inversely as the
distance, it may be supposed that the resultant condensation and
corresponding velocity of the a^therial particles at the distance D
from the centre of the molecule, are so large that the excursions
are large compared to the diameter of an atom. Thus the dynamic
effect of the new order of waves will be an attraction towards the
centre of the molecule.        The mathematical investigation of the
                                                            I
amount of this attraction will be the same as that have given
in the Theory of the Force of Gravity (Numbers of the Phil. Mag.
for November and December 1859) ; and the expression for the
acceleration of any atom will consequently be
                                  Zir^qarr?
at a position where the maximum velocity of the waves is m. It
 is here to be remarked that, as the value of X is much smaller
 for this class of waves than for those which were supposed to
 account for the force of gravity, this molecular attraction will be
 much more energetic, for the same value of m, than the attraction
 of gravity.
     It follows from this i"easoning that the waves propagated from
 the atoms of a given molecule have no repulsive action at the
 distance D, their dynamic action having merged into that of the
 second order of waves.        The atomic repulsion due to the part of
 the velocity which is unaccompanied by condensation, must vanish
  at a much less distance than D, on account of its varying in
  versely as the fourth power of the distance.         That due to the
 part    of the velocity accompanied by     condensation   vanishes more
  slowly, but is at its origin comparatively feeble.      In this manner
 the theory accounts for the small sphere of activity of the atomic
  repulsion.
     If  we consider apart the dynamic action of the same molecule
 at distances much greater than D, the condition that the excur
  sions of the particles of the medium are very large compared to
  the diameter of an atom, must at a certain distance cease to be
  satisfied ; the factor q will continually diminish, and the factor /*
 become significant, till the molecular attraction will be changed
  to molecular repulsion. But the amount of this repulsion, which
  will depend on the relative magnitudes of fi and q, may be very
 much less than the atomic repulsion, and vary much less rapidly
 with the distance.       Also if we take a spherical space of radius R ,
 containing     N   molecules of N atoms, N being the same fixed
 number as before, and suppose the molecules to be of the form

 94         Prof. Challis    on a Theory   of Molecular Forces.
 of  a cube  in order that they may fill the space, then by the same
 reasoning as before, at a distance D' from the centre of the sphere
              R' R
 such that        = jj, the waves of the second order will merge into
              jj,
 waves of the third order.        It is to waves of this order that the
 force of gravity may be attributed.         Also the absorption of the
 second order of waves into the third, puts a limit to the sphere
 of activity of the second order of repulsion.
    As an illustration of the formation of the waves of the second
 order was drawn from what is observed to take place at the
 surface of water in consequence of its being disturbed through
 a limited extent, so the third order of waves are analogous to the
 ocean-swell, or series of long waves, which have been observed
 on shores at great distances from parts of the ocean which have
 been agitated by a violent storm.
    I  have elsewhere made the remark, that even the attraction of
 gravitation may, according to these views, be changed by distance
 into repulsion, so that neighbouring stars may be repulsive to
 each other, while at the same time this repulsion is counteracted
 by an attraction resulting in the manner above described from
the composition of the waves propagated from all the other more
 distant stars.     Thus the final waves may be said to be of the
fourth   order,   and  the masses of stars and planets may be regarded
 as molecules relatively to the material system of the universe.
    4. The above considerations respecting molecular forces apply
equally to a mass in a fluid state, the number of atoms in a given
 space being not so different in the fluid and solid states of the
 same substance as to render any difference in the reasoning
 necessary.      But experience shows that the molecular attraction
of a fluid mass is much less powerful than that of the same mass
when solid.       This difference, which theoretically corresponds to
a difference in the relative magnitudes of fi and q, is chiefly ex
hibited in the different circumstances of the equilibrium of the
atoms at the boundary of the mass, on which, in fact, the differ
ence between the solid and fluid states essentially depends.         If
we take an atom in the interior of a uniform mass, and regard
only the action of forces having very small spheres of activity,
it is evident that whether the mass be solid or fluid, the repulsions
to which the atom is subject will counteract each other, as will
also the attractions.      But the case will be different if the atom
be situated at the boundary of the mass ; for there, to maintain
its equilibrium, the resultant of the attractions must be just equal
and opposite to the resultant of the repulsions.          This point  I
                                              "
have considered at length in an article On Capillary Attraction
and the Molecular Forces of Fluids," communicated               to the
Philosophical Magazine for February 1836, on the suppositions

           Prof. Challis on  a  Theory  of Molecular Forces.        95
 that the atoms are isolated, and that the sphere of activity of
 attraction is much larger than that of repulsion. These suppo
 sitions are in accordance with the views now expounded; and the
 explanation there given of the conditions of equilibrium of an
 atom at the boundary applies in the present theory.         The prin
 cipal hypothesis of that explanation is one first admitted by
 Poisson, viz. that, within a distance from the bounding surface
very small compared to the radius of activity of the molecular
 attraction, there is a rapid increase of density from the surface
towards the interior.      The effect of such change of density will
be to diminish very much the atomic repulsion on an atom at
 the surface, while the molecular attraction, on account of its far
greater sphere of activity, will be unaffected by it. The change
 of density must be such that the atomic repulsion at the surface
is reduced to an equality with the molecular attraction, the latter
prevailing beyond the surface.
    The conditions of the equilibrium of the atoms situated at and
near the surfaces of bodies, bring this molecular theory into
relation with electricity.
    The difference between the circumstances of the equilibrium
of the superficial atoms of solids and fluids, on which, as said
above, the difference between the solid and fluid states depends,
consists, according to these views, in the different amounts of the
resultant molecular attractions acting in directions parallel to and
very near the surface, and tending to prevent the separation of
the atoms in those directions. In fluids, as experience teaches,
this is a very feeble force ; in solids it is overcome by cutting, or
by fracture, resuming its sway in the new surfaces which these
operations produce.      Atomic arrangement seems to have much
to do with the energy of this force.
    Both solids and fluids offer great resistance to compression
within a smaller space. This resistance is due to the atomic
repulsion, and its energy depends both on the great amount of
this force, and on its rapid variation with distance.
    It is also a matter of experience that, when the parts of a
substance (not fluid) are separated, in general they strongly
resist being joined together again so as to form a single mass.
This fact may be accounted for if we suppose that the molecular
attraction which acts on the atoms situated at the boundary of
the solid, passes through a phase of repulsion before the waves
to which it is due merge themselves in those that give rise to the
attraction of gravitation.     But independently of such repulsion,
it is evident that the gradation of density at the boundaries, being
due to the cause assigned above, must be destroyed before sepa
rate portions of the same substance can be perfectly united.       In
cases in which the union is opposed by no energetic molecular

96           Prof. Challis on a Theory of Molecular Forces.
repulsion, extending, as above stated, to small distances from the
surface, it is conceivable that mere mechanical compression of
fragments together, by acting in aid of the molecular attraction,
may suffice entirely to get rid of the gradation of density, and
thus to effect a perfect union. The very important and instruct
ive experiments of Professors Tyndall and Huxley, detailed in
the Transactions of the Royal Society (vol. cxlvii. pp. 329–331),
are actual instances of the production of this effect by crushing
together fragments of ice.

 and variety of the explanations of physical phaenomena which it
 gives, I   take this opportunity of remarking that the foregoing
 molecular theory, taken in conjunction with the experiments just

the Himalaya range      a large  solid mass is plunged into molten
liquid of greater specific gravity, is liable to objection, unless it can
be shown that the distinction between the solid and fluid states,
and any difference of density, can exist under the pressure of
the mountain mass, at the depth which the explanation requires.
I  have suggested a different explanation of the anomaly in the
article on the Force of Gravity.
    If this theory of the internal molecular condition of solids be
true, there must be limits to the heights and acclivities of moun
tains, and to the depths of ocean-basins, depending on the
energy of the superficial molecular attraction. The separation
of large masses into parts by faults and fissures, by increasing
the quantity of containing surfaces, probably renders a greater
amount of superficial irregularity possible.          If these irregu
larities and the effect of centrifugal force be disregarded, large
bodies, like the sun and planets, would, according to the theory,
take the form of a sphere.        The form of a very thin plate, like
that of Saturn's Rings, is also consistent with the theory : but
it does not appear that any form very unlike these two would be
possible.
    5. Passing now to the consideration of the gaseous state of a
substance, the first remark to make             is,
                                                  that since the mean
interval between the atoms        is much larger than in solids and
fluids, the atomic repulsion, which varies very rapidly with di
stance, may be supposed to be of insensible magnitude.              Also
the condensations and rarefactions      of  the waves  propagated   from
a  single atom, so far as they are dependent on the number of
atoms in given space, will be much diminished in the aeriform
          a
state.    At the same time the radius         Rof the spherical surface
which includes the fixed number of atoms N, must be much
greater, and the distance    D   at which the waves from the atoms
merge    into  waves    of the  second   order be proportionally in
creased.     Hence    the  condensation and velocity in, the waves of
this order originating in the molecule of radius R, may never
rise to such   a  magnitude as to satisfy the condition of producing
excursions of the setherial particles large compared to the dia
meter of an atom. Consequently they will be throughout waves
of repulsion, until they merge into those which act as gravity.
The tendency of aeriform substances to expand            in this manner
                                                           is
accounted    for   bythe theory.
   By the aid of this theory,     it  also conceivable that
                                       is                        gas,a       by
being greatly compressed, so that its atoms are brought into
such proximity that molecular attraction begins to act, may be
converted into     aliquid. Another property of gases        also simply
                                                                is
explained     by the theory, viz. the facility with which the atoms
of one gas permeate another. The comparatively large intervals

 between the atoms of a gas, would allow any diffusive action
 operating on the atoms of another gas, to take effect in the
 space occupied by the former, and all collision between the two
 sets of atoms would be prevented by the proper repulsions of
 the individual atoms.     It is evident that the force by which the
 atoms in motion are diffused, must act on the atoms of the
 medium in which the diffusion takes place ; but this action only
 produces a slight alteration of the density of the latter, without
 affecting its state of equilibrium.
    In applying the general expression for the velocity (V) of the
 aether along the surface of an atom, to account for the repulsive
force of gases, it must in general be supposed that each of the
constants fi and q has a sensible value, and consequently that
both the hemispherical surfaces of the atom are pressed by the
incident series of waves, the pressure on that which directly
receives the waves predominating.         This may account for the
comparatively small repulsive action of a gaseous body which is
at no part extremely rare, such as the earth's atmosphere, at the
upper boundary of which the force of the earth's gravity im
poses a limit on its rarefaction.     But the repulsion will assume
a different character in a gaseous substance of very large extent
and great tenuity, such as was the coma of Donati's comet,
which produced no sensible refraction of the light from stars,
whatever were the direction and length of the path of the light
through it. In this case the dimensions of R and D are greatly
extended ; fi becomes large and q very small for waves of the
second order, and their action on any atom approximates to that
of the repulsion of the first order, extending but little beyond
the hemispherical surface on which they are directly incident,
while at the same time the action varies but slowly with distance.
This will account for the enormous development of repulsive
action in the extremely attenuated tails of comets.
    6. The foregoing theory of molecular forces admits also of
application to the following physical problems.
    Problem I. To account for the difference of elasticity of
different simple gases.
    The theory allows of no other difference between simple gases
than a difference in the magnitudes of the component atoms.
Take a portion of one gas bounded by a spherical surface, and
containing a certain number         of atoms, and
                                  (»)                 portion of the
                                                        a
other gas, bounded     byan equal spherical surface, and containing
the same number of atoms similarly arranged.           Let    be the
                                                              R
radius of an atom of the former, and     r the radius of an atom of
the other, and suppose      R to be greater than r.     Now by the
theory, the elasticities of the gases depend on the waves accom
panied  by  condensations which are reflected from the atoms and  ;

            Prof. Challis on a Theory     of Molecular  Forces.        99
by hydrodynamics, the reflected condensations, the incident
waves being the same, vary as the radii of the atoms.              Hence
the condensations at the same distances from the centres of the
atoms are proportional to the squares of the radii.           Hence also
the resultant condensations from all the atoms at points F simi
larly situated with respect to the two spherical spaces, vary as
the squares of the radii.        Let now the number of atoms in that
space    which    contains  the smaller atoms be increased till it con
tains   the  same    quantity of matter  as the other space.    Then the
number of the smaller atoms will be — 5-         , and the resultant con-
densation at P of the waves propagated from them will be in
creased in the same ratio.        Hence the ratio of the resultant con
densations due to the smaller atoms to the resultant condensations
                                                   R3    r*     R
similarly due to the larger atoms will be             x
                                                         gg,
                                                             or — • And
as,   according to the theory, the forces which tend to produce
motions of translation of the atoms, to which the pressures
which counteract the expansions of the gases may be assumed to
be proportional, vary as the squares of the condensations or velo
 cities of the incident waves, it follows that the pressures of equal
 weights of two simple gases contained in equal spaces vary inversely
 as the squares of the radii of their atoms.         Hence the elasticity
 of a simple gas is greater the smaller its atoms.
     Problem II. To find the relation between pressure and density
 in different substances.
     This question, which is tbe special subject of a communication
 to the Philosophical Magazine for June 1859, is introduced here
 for the purpose of answering it more completely by the applica
 tion of the theory of molecular forces contained m the present
 communication.         I  see no reason to modify the argument by
 which the effective acceleration of an atom, due to the action of
 the surrounding atoms, may be expressed by the function
                                    H   ^
  A/a being the increment of density corresponding
                                                             to the linear
 increment          in the direction perpendicular to a surface of equal
  density, and therefore in the direction of the molecular accelera
 tion.     But it is to be observed that the factor H was obtained
  on the hypothesis that the sphere of molecular activity is not
  altered by change of density.          According to the theory now
  advanced,    it  appears that,  while upon an increase of density the
  action of the atoms in a given elementary space upon an atom
  at a given distance is increased in the same proportion, the sphere
  of molecular activity is diminished in that proportion, the linear
                                     H2

quantities on which the law of molecular action depends retain
ing the same ratios.  It follows that the number of the given
elementary spaces containing effective atoms is diminished in
proportion as the density is increased, and consequently that the
factor   H    is of the form — , the quantity           ~      being given.          It    is
here supposed that atoms situated in parts of the fluid which
                                                                                  is is,
have different densities have the same specific heat, that    are
centres of waves of equal condensation.   But though this     ap
proximately true in aeriform bodies,      cannot be exactly true,
                                                      it
because, while the waves reflected from    given atom are chiefly

due to incident waves from extraneous sources, they are partly
due to secondary incident waves originating at the surrounding
atoms, and therefore partly depend on the density.    Hence, the
reflected waves from extraneous sources being supposed to be the
same throughout the fluid mass, we ought in the place of
                                                                                  G K

put   K(l +a./(p)), a being very small.                     Consequently     if be

   Exactly the same kind of reasoning applies to fluids and solids,
excepting that in these the condensations of the waves propa
gated from     given atom appear to be determined as to quantity

by the reflexions of successive orders of secondary waves from
the surrounding atoms.        It would be in accordance with hydro-
dynamical    principles  to  say that the dynamic effect of waves
coming originally    from   extraneous  sources (as the sun, the pla
nets, and stars)    is   by
                        these reflexions multiplied in   certain pro a
portion to the density of the substance. Also among the primary
waves to which the secondary waves are owing may be reckoned
the waves of the second order previously considered, the conden
sations of which are proportional to the same density.      Without
at present discussing this point at greater length,     shall assume
                                                                   I

    Problem    III.  To find  the  law of density in   the interior of the
earth.
    This question is here considered for the purpose of testing the
formula just obtained for the relation between the pressure and
the density in solids and fluids, which is in a great degree hypo
thetical. To adapt the formula to the circumstances of the earth,
supposed to be of homogeneous material throughout its interior,
let
8 being the density of primitive rock, as granite, at the surface.
Then, as is well known, this equation gives for the law of den
sity in the earth's interior, the form being supposed spherical,
                           p  _   sin Qr
p being the density at the distance r from the centre, D the
density at the centre, and Q a certain constant.             If c be the
earth's radius, M its mass, and g the usual measure of gravity
at the surface, the value of the constant Q is given by the
equation
Now since the assumed relation between p and p takes into
account the effect of heat in the earth's interior, the constant A4
has the same value for the whole of the mass, supposed to be of
 uniform material.     Hence its value may be found experimentally
 by determining the compressibility of primitive rock at the
 earth's surface, or, what is equivalent, ascertaining the velocity
 with which it transmits sound.          (See on this subject an article
 " On the Ellipticity of the Planets,"        which  I  communicated to
 the Philosophical Magazine for September 1831, p. 200.)                 If
 this velocity be called V, by    a  known process we shall have
                           v   -    s
                                       •
 Hence supposing the mean density of the earth to be nS, we
 obtain for calculating Qc the equation
 The value of n deduced from the law of density is 2'42.             I am
 not acquainted with any experimental determination of the value
 of V for primitive rock. In art. 114 of the " Treatise on Sound"
 in the Encyclopedia Metropolitana, experiments which appear to
 be trustworthy are adduced which give for the velocity of sound

mination for want of one more appropriate to the problem, and
taking c=3956 miles, it will be found that Qc = 2,602. This
                                                  5*7r
result comes very close to the value -g- or 2,618, which has                been
assumed in the Theory of the Earth's Figure solely on the a pos
teriori ground that it gives results in accordance with the observed
values of the earth's ellipticity and the precession of the equi
noxes.     Ihave gone through the above investigation chiefly for
the purpose of making the remark, that the assumed relation
between the density and pressure, and the consequent law of the
earth's density, will in a great degree be shown to be physical
facts, if they bear the test of at once satisfying the observed
values of the ellipticity, the precession of the equinoxes, and the
rate of transmission of vibrations through the substance of the
earth's crust.   In the same degree, a theory of molecular forces
from which that relation may be antecedently deduced receives
confirmation.
   If it may be concluded from the foregoing arguments and ap
plications of the results, that the theory of molecular forces here
proposed has a real foundation, what will be chiefly required to
complete it is to ascertain by analysis the precise composition of
the functions    and

earth-waves in a clearer light to unmathematical readers than is

phenomena of shock, obtained in my observation of the earth
quake regions of the Two Sicilies early in 1858.

      January 12, 1860.
    Physical science, and geology especially, have long sought for
a seismometer      which should record the shocks and convulsions
to which the surface of our globe is subject.      The various theories
which have been formed on the origin of earthquakes, and the
nature of the strata beneath us, are founded on the various
anomalies and particular effects which earthquakes produce in
different localities. With the increase of data we have ascertained
many things relating to physics and geology, many ideas have
been rectified, and many new ones introduced. We have, indeed,
several recent works which show a real advance and true scien
tific conquest.      From the researches of Professor Alfonso Favre,
made known to us in his two recent works on a hundred earth
quakes which occurred in various parts of the world during the
years 1855 and 1856, not to enumerate other works on the earth
quakes of Calabria and Tuscany, it is evident that much light
has been thrown on the nature of the waves of the terrestrial
crust when agitated by earthquakes, on their variable rapidity
and intensity according to the difference of the ground, on their
refraction and interferences, on their inclination to extend along
valleys, and in the direction of mountain chains rather than
across them,      and on many other      questions  no less new than
interesting.      But these ideas and views need much diligent in
vestigation    before  any theory can be formed; and instruments of
measurement       are indispensable.
    Although seismometers        may afford us some facility for the
advancement of science, and may aid in the investigation of these
difficult questions, yet many, despairing of their success, have
affirmed that the direct study of the phsenomena of the earth

104            Prof. Cavalleri  on a  New Seismometer.
quake, as exhibited in the effects which it has produced, is a far
superior method.       But besides the difficulty of giving, among a
mass of effects apparently contradictory, the due value to each,
we should remember that frequently the earthquake leaves no
distinct trace of direction, origin, or intensity, and still more
frequently no trace whatever.       And yet these weak and disre
garded perturbations might afford precious data to science.          The
study of seismometers appears to me very useful,       if it  be possible
to add anything to what we have already done.                  A perfect
seismometer should record the traces of the various motions
which affect the surface of the earth, at once marking their com
mencement, duration, and relative intensity.         The formation of
one seismometer which should embrace these complex phseno-
mena being almost impossible,        I perceived at the beginning of
my work that it was necessary to divide them into their com
ponent parts.      Such a division being made, the iuvention of an
instrument which should record these components, or we might
say elements of the complex motion, became much easier.             I  am
not unacquainted with the many seismometers made and pro
posed by others, and have endeavoured to profit by their designs ;
but, none appearing to me satisfactory,      I have changed and added
to their plans.     I subjoin a description of the apparatus which       I
have constructed and recently tried.
    A brass ball, weighing 3 kilogrammes, is vertically suspended
by a wire 1 millim. in diameter; this wire, in length 1*25 metre,
is fastened at the point of suspension to the end of a strong
iron plate by means of a screw ; the plate is secured in the wall,
 and projects horizontally from it 5*3 decimetres.           A needle is
 firmly attached to the lower part of the ball with the point turned
 down and finely sharpened ; in length it is 9 centimetres.           The
 apparatus is in fact a pendulum. The extreme point of the needle
 is inserted a millimetre or a little more into an extremely small
 cylinder or square prism (viera), but so as to be quite free. This
 cylinder rests lightly on the summit of a small support or vertical
 column fixed in the centre of an iron pan which is firmly attached
 to the wall. The pan is filled with finely-sifted ashes or brickdust
 to the level of the needle's point, or a little higher, as may be seen
 in the accompanying Plate (PI. I.). The apparatus being arranged
 in this manner, it is evident that if a shock occurs, let us sup
 pose from the south, the ball of the pendulum, owing to its own
 inertia and the time necessary to transmit the motion from the
 top of the wire to the ball itself, will remain unmoved ; while the
 wall, the fixed plate which holds the pendulum, the pan, and
 the support of the small cylinder will be pushed at the same
 instant towards the north. By the simultaneous motion of all
 the rigid parts of the apparatus, the support of the vertical

 column is withdrawn from beneath the small cylinder, which is
 retained in its position by the point of the needle ; wanting the
 support, it will immediately fall into the soft ashes, precisely in
 the direction from which the first shock came, that                it is,
                                                                from the
 south. This    is the first effect of the seismometer,        will indi
 cate the point from which the first shock came.             The shock
 might occasion  a  very small movement       yet as we have the power
                                                      ;
 of making the point extremely fine, and the cylinder and its sup
 port extremely small in diameter,           evident that the slightest
                                             it   is
 shocks would affect them, even those of two millimetres or less.
 From the experience of others, and from what has come under
 my own observation,    it    certain that the shocks, although very
                             is
 weak, would cause    a   greater deviation than two or three milli
 metres.    It may also be urged that the percussion occasioned
 by  the passing of cars, or by thunder, might be capable of
 shaking the walls, and thus giving         fallacious indication of an
                                                a
 earthquake.     To this objection beg leave to reply, that

 erected on the ground floor, these extraneous percussions can
have no sensible influence on the walls, but are limited to the
 air, the window-panes, and such elastic and moveable objects
 as are placed between compressed and compressing air. Although
passing wheels may communicate            motion to walls to which we

                                                                I
believe that the instrument will not be in the least affected by
passing cars, and will sufficiently answer our purpose.
I     shall venture to dwell little longer on this point, and allude
                                  a
to everything which may possibly influence our seismometer.
 Shocks of earthquake, however complicated, and as yet not sub
mitted to measurement, may be distinguished, as            usually done,

into undulatory and horizontal, subsultatory and vertical, and
mixed shocks, the last being           by
                                    far the most frequent. The appa
ratus which shall attempt to describewill enable us to distinguish
           I
these three kinds of earth-waves.       But there still question re
                                                          is    a
lative to the record of the direction of the primary wave          means     by
of the small cylinder or prism. When shock occurs in any given
                                                    a
point of the globe, or rather when the centre of the earthquake                         is
manifested in any given point, we know that undulations proceed
from that point as from centre, and are propagated over
                             a                                       cir          a

the shock or the conducting power of the ground.           Now would     I
ask   ifthe first wave, which     gradually extended and enlarged in
                                  is
its course, always proceeds from the centre of convulsion to the
circumference, or whether the reverse can ever happen             Let us?

which the air has been exhausted ; is it not evident that, at the
moment of rupture, the surrounding air will rush violently in to fill
the vacuum, and the first wave will come from the circumference
to the centre; and that the same may be affirmed of the other more
distant waves which successively enter the ball ? On the other
hand, should a certain quantity of gunpowder be ignited, in con
sequence of which a gas is formed which demands a new or
greater space, will not the first wave proceed from the centre to
the circumference ? To make use of a better expression, we may
call this last wave positive, and the first negative.     This ques
tion might be theoretically treated by mathematicians, and their
considerations might be of essential service in throwing light on
the still obscure origin of earthquakes.
   An earthquake may be produced from two very different causes
with reference to our mode of considering the wave. It may
happen that a considerable quantity of water or other matter
may instantaneously produce such a volume of gas or vapour as
will raise or displace in some manner a portion of the terrestrial
crust and afterwards allow it to return to its primitive position ;
on this supposition the first wave must be positive.       But if the
steam or gas be slowly formed and expanded gradually (with in
creasing tension) till it finds instantaneous vent in the open cre
vices of the earth's crust, the first wave must be negative.        In
either case, laying aside the theoretical consideration   of  the ever
difficult problem of the waves, of which we know neither the
origin nor the depth, nor the medium through which they are
propagated, nor the great and various pressure of the different
strata, our pendulum may solve the practical question for us ;
for should we find, after a certain number of earthquakes of
which the centre of effort has been subsequently ascertained,
that our little cylinder had been displaced either in the direction
of that centre or in the opposite direction, we might infer whether
the earthquake had originated from the first or from the second
of the supposed causes. Besides, we may conclude that the ne
gative wave must rapidly decrease in strength as it is removed
from the centre, and cannot be sensibly felt as far as the posi
tive wave, which is in its nature much more powerful.            Some
experiments, although very imperfect, which were tried on the
surface of a lake on which were placed wood floats, bearing card
cylinders balanced so as to fall easily at the agitation of the water
either in a positive or a negative sense, led me to conclude that
the negative wave must be extremely weak.            The accuracy of
our instrument in noting the direction of the primary wave may
throw greater light on another phsenomenon, and perhaps com
pletely solve it :  I mean the phsenomenon already noticed by
some geologists, that the earth-waves produced by shocks take

                Prof. Cavalleri on  a New Seismometer.           107
certain directions in preference to others, according to the differ
ent lie of valleys and mountains ; and further, that these waves
are broken in their course and reach a given point more or less
late, thus occasioning confluxes of different waves all generated
from the primary, so as to produce shocks more considerable than
at spots nearer the first convulsion.      This appears to be the ne
cessary consequence      of the  heterogeneous material of which the
crust of our globe is composed.          A single strong shock sent
through strata of different density, arrangement, and elasticity,
the strata also lying at angles widely varying from the direction
of the primary impulse, and afterwards subject to different
changes of dip (incidenza) , must indubitably occasion — 1st, a
composition of forces; whence, 2nd, a different direction of waves;
 3rdly and lastly, varying velocity in their progress. These effects
would of themselves be greatly complicated, even admitting that
the waves should act only in one plane ; but when we add, as
truth requires, that the waves necessarily act in different planes
 according as the earthquakes are generated at a greater or less
 depth, and that the waves must radiate or expand, not over a
 single surface, but in a mass of three dimensions, every one must
 admit that the phenomena of earth-waves are most complicated,
 and have a thousand different aspects. Our instrument is capable
 of recording these anomalies and others which we are about to
 notice.
     When an earthquake occurs, the pendulum being disengaged
from the cylinder, which falls in the direction from whence the
 first wave proceeded, is set at liberty, and traces in the ashes
 which lie beneath, and which rise a little above the point, the
 general direction of the wave. The application of the pendulum to
tracing the direction of the earth-wave is already known, and has
 been frequently tried ;    I cannot boast of adding anything further
 to this invention than a most important auxiliary.          But here
 some observations present themselves which I consider very im
 portant.    The traces which the pendulum leaves impressed in
 the ashes,  as  I observed at Bologna during the earthquake which
 occurred there last year, are in general more or less long and well
 marked.      These are not occasioned by the oscillations of the
 pendulum itself, which are always relatively small, but by the
 ground moving under the pendulum.           The pendulum is soon set
 in motion, but its oscillations are very limited, and take the form
 of ellipses, — at first very excentric, almost pointed; but they
  shortly lose their excentricity and increase their minor axes, until
 they become small circles.        These figures are easily perceived
 if j^the point of the needle is sharp, and the ashes or brickdust
  smooth and regular, but only when the earth-wave proceeds from
 one direction. Should the waves come from two or more, it would

108                Prof. Cavalleri on             a    New Seismometer.
 be impossible to make them out accurately.          However, if we can
  not always accurately tell the direction of the waves which have
 different horizontal inclinations, we can at least discover the
 direction of the principal one.        Since the oscillations of the pen
 dulum, especially if it be a long one, must be very small in com
 parison to the motion of the terrestrial crust lying beneath                           it,
 we hope no argument will be drawn thence against increasing
the sphere of application of our seismometer.                Another desi

 thods are employed) stops the motion of              timepiece which

compelling the observer to take daily note whether an earthquake

    But seismometers ought to mark not only undulatory or hori

the earth's crust.    Let us imagine a spiral formed by an iron
wire, hard as from the draw plate, with rings of equal size, form
ing a cylinder the spires of which are separated from each other.
Let the spiral be attached at one extremity to a fixed point, sus
pended with its axis vertical, and let a moderate weight be placed
at the other extremity.     The spiral will lengthen and stretch a
little, and then remain motionless.     Now if the weight be pushed
up and then left free, the spiral will oscillate like a common pen
dulum, only vertically. The elasticity of the spiral performs the
same office as attraction in common pendulums.          The descend
ing weight acquires an accelerated motion, which tends to stretch
the spiral more than it would do were it at rest ; hence follows
the reaction of the elastic spiral, which tends to draw the weight
up more than it would do were it motionless ; and this continues
until, after a certain time, the resistance of the air and the im
perfect elasticity of the spiral stop the vertical pendulum.     Such
is the apparatus which I have constructed for noting vertical up
heavals or elevations of the earth's crust.        But as the number
 of the oscillations of the spiral within a given time must depend
 on the weight which is attached, the size of the rings or turns,
 the thickness of the wire, and the number of the rings,      I consi
 dered it necessary to institute a series of experiments in order to
 give to the spiral, conditions capable of fulfilling our intention,
 and thus to render complete a work which, so far as       I am aware
 of, has not been done by another.
    The following laws are the result of my experiments : —
    1st. The vertical oscillations are isochronous.
    2nd. With the same length of wire, the number of oscillations
 in a given time is in the inverse ratio to the diameter of the
 spiral.
    3rd. The number of oscillations with the same number of
 rings is in the inverse ratio to the square root of the weights
 which stretch the spirals, subtracting the weight of the spiral
 itself, which acts as a weight and tends somewhat to retard the
 oscillations.
    4th. The number of the oscillations in a given time is in
 inverse ratio to the square root of the number of rings or coils
 in the spiral.
    5th. With the same weight, length of wire, and diameter of
 spiral, the number of oscillations is in the inverse ratio to the
 diameter of the wire.
    The first and fifth of these laws agree fully with those dis
 covered by Coulomb relative to the elasticity of torsion.        The
 second (note being taken that the spirals used in my experiments
 are cylindrical) arises from the constant relation between the
 length of the wire and the number of rings in the spiral, and

110             Prof. Cavalleri on a New Seismometer.
must therefore substantially agree with the laws of the same
philosopher. The third would agree if the weight of the spiral
were nought, or might be so considered; but as one cannot
attach to the spiral a weight which would render the weight of
the spiral itself evanescent, since it would draw down the spiral too
much and cause it to lose its elasticity, so the weight of the spiral
has always a sensible effect, and tends to retard the oscillations :
some advantage is gained by the use of spirals of tempered steel.
The second law has no counterpart [riscontro) among those of
Coulomb, as it depends on conditions not found in twisted
threads, on which the laws of elasticity of torsion depend. With
the same wire and of the same length, spirals can be formed
which will have widely different oscillations by enlarging or nar
rowing the diameter of the coils.
    These laws ascertained, it is easy to find the conditions best
adapted to our purpose.       The weight attached to the spiral must
be of a certain size in  order  to produce a strong reaction, and to
move the markers which we are about to describe.          The oscilla
tions ought to be slow, so that the time employed by the rising
and falling of the ground may not exceed that required to trans
mit the motion from the top of the spiral to the weight itself.
I  have therefore given to the spiral, measured along its axis, a
length of 80 centims., and attached to it a weight of 1*2 kilog.
The diameter of the cylindrical spiral is 5-3 centims.         It con
sists of ninety rings, and vibrates seconds : the diameter of the
wire is about 3 millims.      I  have constructed it in the following
manner : —A strong iron bar fixed in the wall supports one end of
the spiral ; a cylindrical weight of equal diameter to the spiral
is attached to the other extremity.      This weight oscillates freely
within an iron ring secured to the wall. The spiral is enclosed
in a kind of cylinder in which it can freely oscillate vertically,
but not horizontally.     The weight terminates in a point, and
rests on the short arm of a lever very easily moved ; the other
arm of the lever, by means of a graduated quadrant, serves as
an index.     All this apparatus of lever, quadrant, and index, is
securely attached to the wall, and is united to the bar by which
the spiral is suspended.     Now let us suppose that the ground
has been suddenly elevated by an earthquake.            It is evident
that, when the wall and the bar which holds the spiral are raised,
the arm of the lever, being part of the same rigid common system,
will rise also. But for a certain time the weight attached to the
spiral will remain unmoved in its place, because a sensible time
is necessary to communicate motion from the top of the spiral to
the weight itself.    Meantime the short arm of the lever will be
pushed by     the  weight, and being very light, it will fall, while
the longer arm will rise and record the elevation.        This arm is

                    Prof. Cavalleri on a New Seismometer.                  Ill
ratcheted in such      a way that it can easily go up, but cannot
descend,       seen in the figure (Plate I.).
               as                                     Thus the index will
mark the elevation of the ground or vertical undulations, the
ratio between the two arms of the lever being taken into account.
Instead of the lever we may use a cylinder of cork a little larger
than the weight, which cylinder must run easily between two
fixed vertical side-pieces or guides, as represented in the figure.
As £ar as the cork, by the push of the weight, has been lowered
it will remain fixed there, being light and held by its own elas
ticity so fast that it is impossible for a shock alone to move it
from its position. An upright scale, suitably divided, placed at
the side of the cylinder, shows the height of the vertical wave, —
as it rises with the ground, while the cylinder is depressed.
This last method          is,
                          think, superior to that which
                          I                                I    constructed
with the lever.

vation of the soil performed in          relatively long period of time.

For example, we might record an elevation with velocity of a                a
millimetre per second, or even still slower.           Knowing by obser
vation that elevations or depressions of the soil occupy              a very
short time,    I thought      useless to give the spiral
                                it                         a   longer time
of oscillation.        may happen that the first vertical wave
                         It                                           is one
of depression and not elevation but in this case also the instru
                                         ;
ment will accurately note the vertical movement, in consequence
of the elevation which succeeds the depression.             It may happen
also, and in fact often does, that the weight gradually stretches
down the spiral and falls         certain degree (by loss of elasticity,
                                     a
namely)    ; but  in this  case  the  short arm of the lever     is  carried
down also by the weight, and the other arm the place fixes, on
account of the ratcheting already mentioned, so that the space
found between the weight and the lever below               it   will always
indicate the height of the vertical wave.       I     will not conceal an
objection which may be alleged against this method of measuring
vertical undulations — an objection which, with much greater rea
son, may be raised to other seismometers, — viz. that when vertical
undulations are frequently repeated, the instrument will mark
sometimes more and sometimes less than the real altitude of the
earth-waves, according as the time of the undulations            is   tauto-
chronous with that of the oscillations of the pendulum or the
contrary.           If
                   the spiral perform its oscillations more slowly,
this defect will generally be very small      ;    and besides, these ver
tical shocks being almost always confined to single pulse, the
                                                       a
instrument will mark accurately in most instances.
    Lastly, there remain mixed shocks,       i.   e. those which, besides

112             Prof. Cavalleri  on a  New Seismometer.
moving the ground with the objects upon it in a horizontal
direction, also elevate or depress it. These waves, which for
perspicuity we have called mixed, are perhaps in reality the only
ones which exist.     Several authors, especially geologists, treat of
these waves,  —  some from one point of view, some from another,
and many so hastily that it may truly be said we are yet far from
possessing a theory of their nature.         Such at least is the im
pression   received   from  the   papers  of  Gay-Lussac, Humboldt,
Achille Rossi, Savi, Collegno, Pilla, Favre, and more particularly
of Dr. Young, who compares (I use his own words) " the earth
quake of land to the earthquake of the air.'''       He also compares
the shock to the striking of a number of balls placed in a right
line, of which, when the first is struck, the last only is separated.
We can do no better, therefore, than closely to adhere to obser
vation, and patiently record the components of these waves in
order to draw deductions from them.           In fact, having the ver
tical altitude of the wave recorded by the spiral, and the hori
zontal deviation marked by the pendulum, we possess all the
necessary data for mixed waves.          Acting thus at right angles
 (leaving aside for the present more subtile considerations), we
 may regard the mixed wave as the diagonal of these two forces,
 so that the mixed wave would be equal to the square root of the
sum of the squares of the above-named components.                Besides,
we might also get the inclination which the plane of the mixed
wave makes with the horizon by considering this diagonal as
radius, and the vertical altitude given by the spiral as the sine,
the angle of inclination being that corresponding to this sine.
A good seismometer ought also to mark the time of the duration
 (tempo delta durata) of the shock ; but although        I  do not think
it impossible  to form   such  an  arrangement as    should    mark this
also, the problem appears so complicated and difficult that         I am
not at present prepared to attempt its solution.         I   have rather
 sought to discover the time which the earth-wave employs in its
excursion, or that of the seismometrical oscillation.         It is desi
rable to learn how many undulations the earth-wave makes in a
given time, and thence to see if this do not differ in every instance
of earthquake and in every country, on account of the different
strata through which the wave is transmitted, and perhaps also
on account of the diversity of originating causes.          Earthquake-
waves, so far as   I can remember in three distinct cases which I
have present to my mind, appeared very rapid and almost iso
chronous.     Recalling these shocks, it does not appear to me far
from the truth to assign about three undulations per second as
the rate, at least in our Lombardy Plains.             The instrument
which   I have  constructed   with  this view  will note   the duration
of these undulations, and consequently whether they are different

                  Prof. Cavalleri on  a Neio Seismometer.            113
 in various countries    and in different earthquakes.    The principle
 upon which the instrument is constructed is very simple.
     Let us imagine a pendulum formed by a ball suspended by a
 wire, and this wire attached to a moveable point of suspension.
 If  this point of suspension be moved forward and backward a
 certain distance in the same horizontal line, moving to and fro
 in equal times with the time of oscillation of the pendulum itself,
 then the arc which the pendulum makes continually increases
 with the increase of the motion to and fro of the point of sus
 pension.      If, however, the motion of this point occur in times
 which are not isochronous with the oscillations of the pendulum
 itself, its arc of oscillation will become less. In the first case, to
the momentum which the pendulum acquires from being dis
placed by following the altered perpendicular of the point of
 suspension, must be added the momentum communicated by its
moving to and fro, and so the arc of oscillation is increased.        In
the other case the force of the moving to and fro is partly or
 entirely subtracted from the vibrations of the pendulum, since it
 acts more or less in a contrary direction ; hence the arc of vibra
 tion is diminished.      A reciprocating motion tautochronous with
 the pendulum causes the greatest arc of oscillation. These con
 siderations being premised, I take a strong bar inclined some
 degrees towards the horizon.        To this bar, and at such distances
 as shall exceed the amplitude of the largest earth-wave occurring,
 I  fasten a number of small pendulums, as represented in the
 Plate.     These pendulums terminate in sharp needles which touch
the ashes beneath them, so that when a shock occurs they leave
impressed the traces of their vibrations.        The ashes are hollowed
out like a cup, in order to assimilate to the arcs traced by the
various pendulums, and prevent the deep impression of the
needles, which might partly hinder their vibrations.         The lower
extremities of the pendulums form a horizontal line, as in the
figure, so that their lengths vary: they are ten in number,
which     I consider sufficient.    I  have arranged them in such a
manner that the shortest will make a little more than four oscil
lations per second, and the longest two.          These two limits, of
about four and two oscillations per second, appear to me suffi
cient to embrace every undulation occasioned by any earthquake.
Let us suppose the pendulum to be set in motion by a shock.
All the pendulums will vibrate, and leave separately traces of
their oscillations impressed on the ashes ; and the pendulum
which has marked the largest arc will have performed its oscilla
tions in equal limes with those of the earth-wave ; so that by find
ing the square root of the length of the pendulum, or, better, by
actually observing its time of oscillation, we shall learn the dura
tion of the undulations of that particular shock and in that

locality.  I  must add that usually, if not always, the undulations
are several in number, and therefore the increased force which
the tautochronous pendulum acquires will always cause it to
make an arc of oscillation visibly larger than the others, so that
no doubt can arise as to which of the pendulums is that accord'
ing with the motion of the earth-wave ; but strictly, a single
tautochronous wave would be quite sufficient.      For clearness, we
have here assumed the terrestrial wave to be horizontal ; usually,
if not always, however, it is mixed, and inclined more or less to
the horizon.    However, in this case it is obvious that, if we
separate the mixed wave into its horizontal and vertical compo
nents, the latter being perpendicular to the horizon, can have no
influence on the arc of oscillation of the pendulum, whilst the
horizontal force remains alone active.      The knowledge of the
velocity of earth-waves, besides determining the relative inten
sity of earthquakes, may lead to most valuable discoveries, and
explain many phenomena which now excite strong interest.           I
think that, having gained this knowledge by the aid of our seis
mometer, we possess the necessary data for calculating the inten
sity of the shock or earth-wave.    In short, the intensity of the
wave may be represented by three distinct elements ; viz. the
vertical altitude which the ground attains, the horizontal lengths
of the wave, and the time occupied by this simultaneous move
ment. On this supposition, the intensity of the wave may be con
sidered in the direct ratio of the two first quantities, and in the
inverse ratio of the time.    Now our instrument being capable of
marking, 1st, the vertical altitude of the wave by the spiral pen
dulum ; 2nd, the horizontal undulation by the great pendulum j
3rd, the time of the wave as marked by one or other of the small
pendulums, we have all the elements necessary for calculating
the intensity of the shock.     Lastly, it is clear that with these
three elements we can make all possible theoretical inferences,
and assign to each of the three its appropriate value in referring
to the effects of an earthquake, whether on buildings, on plains,
or on the sea, &c, in all of which one or other of the three men
tioned powers will have a greater or less influence : it has been
proved, for example, that with an equal degree of intensity, the
vertical shock will do more damage than the horizontal.        Thus
we can note with these instruments —
    1st. The moment at which the earthquake occurs.
   2nd. The direction of the primary shock or earth-wave.
   3rd. The general horizontal direction of the waves, their am
plitude, or length.
   4th. The height of the vertical wave of shock, however
complex the vertical and horizontal waves acting together
may be.

    If, then, as frequently happens, we also know the total dura
tion of the earthquake, we may approximately infer its total in
tensity.    I say approximately, because it appears that the last
undulations are always weaker than the first or following ones.
Were it not for this, we might obtain the intensity due to any
given earthquake by multiplying the intensity of one wave, as
above, by the number of the oscillations which were made by the
pendulum in the total time the earthquake lasted. We shall
conclude the description of this apparatus with a remark equally
applicable to the other seismometers, which we purpose briefly
to notice.
    In earthquake convulsions, very irregular or rotatory pertur
bations occasionally occur.       Our seismometer, although it is
incapable of noting all, can record the most important of these
 convulsions, and intimate the occurrence of others by the irre
 gular marks which will be impressed on the ashes. Lastly,
 wherever the centre of effort may be, the ground must be so
 affected as to destroy the apparatus, if happening to be there
 set up.    This, however, will not occur once in a thousand times ;
 so that out of a thousand instances the instrument will be of
 service in 999, as may be seen in the repeated shocks which
 occurred in July 1855, at Vispe in the Alps, as observed and
 described by Favre.
     To complete my remarks on seismometers, it is necessary to
 institute a comparison of our seismometer with those that have
 come under my notice.       Passing over some which do not deserve
 the name, such as the vessel of water with floating particles [una
polvere galleggiante) which is spilled by the earthquake, we shall
 mention one attributed to Cacciatore, but really invented by a
 Milanese, as         I
                   was assured by the astronomer Carlini.

FITTIG of acetone.       When sodium is added to acetone, the liquid
becomes filled with white flakes, and is ultimately converted into
a lustrous, gelatinous substance, without the disengagement                  of
any permanent       gas.  On   subjecting  the  mass    to distillation, a yel
lowish viscous oil was obtained which solidified toacrystallinemass.
This mass, freed by pressure between paper from some adherent
oil, and crystallized from a small quantity of boiling water, yielded

large transparent quadratic plates.           They contain water of cry
stallization, and even by pressing between paper partially lose their
transparency. Their composition was found to be Ce H12 O8: Fittig
considers that the body is an isomeric modification of acetone, the
rational formula being C6' H6 O2 + 6 aq.          The crystals gradually
lose water when exposed to the air, and more rapidly in vacuo
over sulphuric acid ; but it was impossible to determine this loss
exactly, owing to the volatilization of a portion of the sub
 stance.    That the substance was formed from the decomposition
 of acetone, and not from the crystallization from water, was
proved by the fact that when some of the crystalline mass was
   ressed and crystallized from anhydrous ether, the crystals formed
   ad the same composition.
    Fittig further examined the action of caustic lime on acetone.
 Well-burned marble was covered with acetone, and left in closed
 vessels for some time ; the dry yellowish mass was then distilled.
 On rectifying the distillate, it was found to consist of two bodies,
 of which one distilled below 150° and the other above 200°. By
 fractionally distilling the first of these a body was obtained which
 boiled at 1310,5, and in its analyses and properties was found
 to be identical with Kane's oxide of mesityle or niesitic ether,
 C12 H10 0s.     It is a colourless transparent oil, smelling like pep
 permint, and with a caustic taste.            It burns with a lustrous
 flame,  and  is  not soluble in water, but readily so in ether and
 alcohol. Oxide of mesityle is converted into a resin by the action
 of nitric acid, and with chlorine it yields a substitution product.
     The other body produced by the action of caustic lime, was
 found to be partially decomposed by distillation.          The analysis
 of a specimen gave results agreeing with the formula C18 Hu 02.
 Hence it might be formed from 3 atoms of acetone with the eli
 mination of 4 atoms of water.          It is isomeric with phorone* ;
                                         f
 and in a subsequent investigation Fittig found that it was iden
 tical with that substance.      The body from acetone, by treatment
 with anhydrous phosphoric acid, yielded cumole, C18 H12, from
 which, by oxidation with nitric acid, nitrobenzoic acid,
                             C14H5 (NO4) 04,
 was obtained, — a result interesting as showing that from acetic
 acid, a member of the fatty acid series, a derivative of benzoic
 acid, a member of the aromatic acid series may be obtained.
     The action of sulphuric acid and of alkalies on acetone appears
 to be identical, giving rise to the formation of a series of bodies
 which are acetone minus water, as is seen from the list.

composition the relation C6 H4 CI9 O2, which             is that  of Kane's
Mesitchloral.       Fittig considers it to be bichlorinated acetone.
That it belongs to the acetone type, is evident from its forming a
crystalline compound with bisulphite of soda.             It is a colourless
liquid with a penetrating odour, and strongly affects the eyes.
It has an extremely caustic action on the skin. It is insoluble
in water, but dissolves in alcohol and ether.
   By the action of nitric acid on acetone a heavy yellowish oil
is obtained, which from its ready decomposability and explosive-
ness appears to be a nitro-compound.            Its properties precluded
any accurate examination.
   Fittig has further * examined the products of the destructive
distillation of acetates.      He finds that acetone is not the only
product, but that other allied substances are formed at the same
time.     In their separation he found it most convenient to use the
oil which floats on the surface of the crude acetone, in its pre
paration. He succeeded in isolating the following bodies : —
   Methylacetone, C8 H8 0s, a colourless liquid resembling acetone,
but boiling between 75° and 77°.
   Ethylacetone, C10 H10 O2, a colourless liquid also like acetone,
and boiling between 90° and 95°.            Both these bodies form cry
stallized compounds with bisulphite of soda.
   Dumasine. — This substance was first discovered by Kane, who
assigned to it the formula C]0 H8 0.             It is a colourless liquid,
which, however, gradually becomes yellow. It is lighter than, and
insoluble in water, but quite soluble in alcohol. Fittig's analysis
gives for it the formula C12 H10 02.            It is isomeric with oxide
of mesityle, but is distinguished by forming a crystallized com
pound with bisulphite of soda, which oxide of mesityle does
not.     Dumasine forms a chlorinated substitution product,

    He has examined the body discovered by Fittig        ; he prepared
it by the same method, and his description of its properties agrees
with that of Fittig. He finds that, according to the conditions
of its crystallization, it forms either long prismatic needles or
thick plates. On account of its property of crystallizing in large
plates, he names it pinakone {mva^, aplate). Stadeler's analyses
of the body lead to the formula C12H1202 + 14HO. He re-
presents it as formed from acetone by the loss of oxygen in the
following manner : —

    The soda formed at the same time decomposes some acetone,
producing several oily bodies which distil over with pinakone,
and among which appears to be phorone.
    Sehwanert* has investigated the action of pentachloride of
phosphorus on hippuric acid.         At ordinary temperatures there is
no action; but when the mixture is gently warmed, hydrochloric
acid is evolved, and a liquid distillate is obtained.      The decom
position differs according to the proportions taken.          When a
mixture of one atom of hippuric acid with two atoms of penta
chloride is distilled in small quantities, oxychloride of phosphorus
first passes over, followed by a colourless oily liquid which distils
between 180° — 200° C.j and at length a liquid passes over
between 200° and 250°, which partially crystallizes.           In the
retort a solid insoluble mass is left. The distillate between 180°
— 200° consists of chloride of benzoyle, containing a small
quantity of crystals which have the composition C18 H6 CI NO2 :
the crystals which distil over in the reaction consist chiefly of
this substance. When pure they are colourless prisms, which
fuse at 45°, distil at about 220° C., and crystallize on solidifying.
They are distinguished by their great stability, which renders
their investigation very difficult.        Caustic potash is without
action upon them.        They form with hydrochloric acid a crystal
line compound, which readily gives up hydrochloric acid. Besides
this body there is formed in the reaction a small quantity of an
other crystalline compound, which seems to be C18 H5 CI2 NO2.
They are both probably substitution products of a compound,
C,8H7N02.
    Anhydrous    sulphuric acid acts on hippuric acid, forming a
clear brown solution.       This is mixed with water, nearly neutral-

ized with carbonate of lead, filtered, the nitrate decomposed with
sulphuretted hydrogen, and the filtrate from this carefully eva
porated.       A brownish yellow hygroscopic mass remains, which
is sulphohippuric acid.         Its formation is thus expressed :

    Sulphohippurate of baryta, formed by treating the carbonate
with the acid, is bibasic, and has the formula
                        C18 H7Ba2NS2012 + 2HO.
    Sulphohippuric acid is decomposed by nitrous acid into sul-
phobenzoic acid and glycolic acid.
    Nitrohippuric acid, C18 H8 (NO4) NO6, formed by the action
 of sulphuric and nitric acids on hippuric acid, crystallizes in
fine white needles.        By treatment with sulphuretted hydrogen
this body is converted into amido hippuric acid, C18 H8 (NH2) NO6.
 It crystallizes from alcohol in light colourless lamina?. It is
 difficultly soluble in ether, but readily so in boiling water and
 alcohol.     Its solutions soon become coloured on standing.
    Schiel* has investigated the action of chlorous acid on certain
 organic substances.        He found that chlorite of lead, which can
be readily procured in large quantities, is a convenient form of
 using this reagent. When 30 or 40 grms. of chlorite of lead
were mixed with about two-thirds the weight of alcohol, and a
few drops of sulphuric acid added, the mixture soon became
coloured yellow from chlorous acid; but when exposed to the
 sun, this colour disappeared.           Sulphuric acid was added from
time to time until the chlorite was quite decomposed : the liquid
 product of the reaction was found on rectification to consist of
acetic ether. Its formation may be thus expressed :

Amylic alcohol, treated in like manner,              yielded valerianate of

    By the action of an aqueous solution of chlorous acid on urea,
a   body was obtained crystallizing in large flat prisms, which
were very hygroscopic.              Its composition was found to be
 C2 H8 N8 CI 02. It might be regarded as a compound of urea and
 sal-ammoniac, C2 H4 N2 O2 + N H4 CI. By crystallizing together
 equivalents of these substances, this body could not be obtained.

           Composition  of the  Gas in non-luminous Flames.       121
crystalline salts with baryta and lead, and with silver a caseous
precipitate. Its composition is C14 H" N6 O11 ; and Schiel names
it chloraluric acid. Besides this, other bodies are formed, the
investigation of which is not complete.
    The gas in the dark cone of the non-luminous flame of Bun-
 sen's gas-burner is a mixture of atmospheric air and coal-gas.
Lunge* has analysed this gas with a view to ascertain the propor
tions in which these two constituents exist.       To collect the gas,
the following method was adopted : — In the upper part of the
burner, a few millimetres below the mouth, a small aperture was
made through which a fine, bent glass tube was so introduced
that it stood exactly in the middle of the aperture of the burner,
and projected about 17 millims. above. The diameter of this
tube was about 0-3 millim. ; it was fastened in the burner by
 means of gypsum, and its other end was connected by means of
caoutchouc with two wide gas-collecting tubes.        The caoutchouc
junctions could be closed by means of Mohr's stopcocks.           The
last gas-tube was connected with an aspirator under a constant
pressure, the efflux of which could be regulated by a tap.
    The flame was so regulated that its height was about 136 mil
lims. ; the internal cone was about 61 millims. high.       The aspi
 rator was then set in motion, and a stream of gas withdrawn so
 slowly that the dimensions of the flame were scarcely altered.
 When the tubes were full they were closed, and transferred to a
eudiometer.
    The analysis of the gas, made according to the methods de
scribed in Bunsen's gasometric methods, gave the following
results for the composition of the mixture : —

Earlier analyses of the Heidelberg gas (which was used in this
investigation), as well as some analyses made simultaneously
with this research, showed that it contained no oxygen; and
hence all the oxygen found could be assigned to the atmospheric
air of the mixture, the quantity of which was accordingly 68-13

    Oxide of ethylene also* unites with glycol under the same
circumstances as with water.            The principal product of the reac
tion is the above intermediate ether, G4!!10©3; but when this
has distilled over, a very thick colourless liquid is obtained which
boils at about 290°.          It is formed by the combination of two
atoms of oxide of ethylene with one atom of glycol, and its com
position is expressed by the formula
                 2(G2H4G)         + G2H6©2=G6H14©4.
             Oxide of ethylene.       Glycol.       New body.
It  is also formed,     but in very small quantities, by the action of

Hence one, two, or three atoms of oxide of ethylene can unite
with one atom of water to form, by direct synthesis, more and
more complicated bodies, which are nevertheless very simple in
their molecular constitution. Wurtz considers these bodies to be
alcohols.     If   the name ethylenic alcohol be given to glycol, the
other two bodies may be named diethylenic alcohol and triethy-
lenic alcohol.      The following formula?          indicate the relations of

    Wurtz has also* found that oxide of ethylene can combine
directly    with ammonia to form very powerful organic bases.
When oxide of ethylene is added to a concentrated aqueous solu
tion of ammonia, the two bodies combine with great energy ; and
on evaporating the mixture, a strongly alkaline liquor is obtained.
By neutralization with hydrochloric acid and further evaporation,
brilliant colourless rhombohedra are obtained which have the
formula
                          GSH^NG3, HC1.
With bichloride of platinum this body combines to form        a double
salt which crystallizes in golden yellow laminae    ;  the composition
 of this body is expressed by the formula
                       C6H15N03, HC1, PtCl2.
    The mother-liquor from the above rhombohedra contains an
uncrystallizable hydrochlorate.         When this is evaporated and
bichloride of platinum added, a double salt is obtained which
 crystallizes in magnificent orange-red rhomboidal prisms j their
 composition is
                        G«HnNO« HC1, PtCl*.
 The base contained in the latter platinum-salt contains the ele
 ments of an atom of ammonia, and of two atoms of oxide of
 ethylene ; its formation is thus expressed :
          2€9H49 + NH3=SJJS!*NH3=€4H'1N02.
           Oxide of            £   n,^J
                               Isew base-
          ethylene.
    The base contained in the rhombohedric hydrochlorate con
tains the elements of an atom of ammonia, and of three atoms of
oxide of ethylene.      Thus :
                                G2H401
          3G2H40 + NH3=€2H49 ^NH3=G6H15N03.
           Oxide of
           ethylene.
                                €2H49J
                               New base.
    These bases result from the tendency which oxide of ethylene
exhibits when added to the elements of another body to form
 direct combinations, and also to double or triple its molecule.
 Unlike the compound ammonias, these base3 are not formed by
 substitution, but by direct addition; they are rather to be
regarded as conjugated ammonias, and seem to support the idea
 of Berzelius, that the alkaloids contain ammonia ready formed.
 Wurtz considers, nevertheless, that they belong to the ammonia
type, and reserves for a future communication the discussion of
 their constitution.

    It  is obvious,    as Wurtz remarks, that by treating oxide of
ethylene with compound ammonias, a great variety of artificial
alkaloids containing oxygen may be obtained.

                       By Professor Knoblauch-)-.
            differences of phase observed by Prof. Knoblauch in
THEthe setherial         oscillations of interfering thermic rays were
produced in the following four different ways.
  1. Difference    of phase in   consequence of unequal lengths    of path
                       in one and the same medium.
    A beam of solar light, after being reflected by a heliostat,
entered through a slit, from 4 to 6 millims. wide, into a dark
room, and at about 23 metres from the window fell upon a glass
grate behind which was placed an achromatic glass lens.               When
 a square thermo-electric pile (whose anterior opening could be
narrowed or widened by means of wings) was placed at about
 0"5 metre from the lens in different parts of the interference-
 spectrum there formed, a multiplier connected with the thermo
electric pile showed deflections varying, according to the fine
 ness of the grate, from 20-15 to 18°-5 when the pile entered
 the central white luminous field.          The needle of the multiplier
 returned to its zero-point when the thermoscope was placed in
 one of the dark bands to the right or left of the centre.               It
 became deflected again, however, to 00-6 or 0o,7 as soon as the
 instrument was moved into either of the next following coloured
 spectra.    With very fine grates, the increased cold between the
 first and second spectra could be detected with certainty.
     The phenomenon was clearest with finely scratched plates of            .
 rock-crystal, behind which the indications of the thermo-multi-
 plier were the following : —
           2° in the central white       .   .    2-5 millims. broad,
           0° in the first dark band .       .    9"0 millims. broad,
           1°*25 in the first spectrum        .   8-5 millims. broad,
           0° in the second dark band         . l-25 millims. broad,
           0o-87 in the second spectrum       . 15-0 millims. broad.

              Prof. Knoblauch   ore the Interference   of Heat.         127
    In  order to diminish to the utmost the absorption in the tra
versed media, and thus to increase the intensity of the effects,
a grate and lens of rock-salt were employed.                 With such a
grate, containing     600  lines   in  an  inch,  the   deflection  for the
centre was 31° 0, and for the first spectrum       l°-5  ; these two lumii
nous bands were separated by a colder one corresponding to a
deflection of 0O-3. With a finer grate the deflection was observed
to be 17°'25 in the centre, 3°*5 in the first spectrum, and only
0O-5 between the two.         The deflections which with rock-salt
remain on the dark bands are due to diffusion of the rays, which,
with this substance, cannot be avoided.
    The above effects can certainly not be ascribed to accidental
secondary actions; for the several differences of temperature
were still observable when the pile exposed the same surface
during its displacements, or even when it presented a greater
aperture to the rays in the dark bands.
     At. the same time a new proof of the divergence of the rays
 of heat through inflexion may be deduced from these experi
 ments. For whilst, without the grate, the enclosing limits of
 these rays at the place of measurement were, say, 2'5 millims.
 apart, after replacing the grate the extreme limits of heat were
 not even reached at a distance of 300 millims. on each side of
 the Centre; consequently at places which were 600 millims.
 distant from each other.
 2. Difference of phase with the same length of path in consequence
       of the passage of rays through a body of unequal thickness.
     After interference-bands had been produced by introducing
 into the path of the solar rays an interference-prism in place of
 the grate, and a cylindrical glass lens in place of the achromatic
  one or the rock-salt lens, and after the thermo-electric pile had in
  this case, too, distinguished in the most unmistakeable manner
  the dark bands from the neighbouring light ones by a deflection
  of from 0°-25 to l°-25 at the multiplier, a somewhat conical
  strip of glass was interposed behind the interference-prism, in
  such a manner that the rays of heat, in order to traverse one-
  half of the same, had to pass through a greater thickness of
  glass than was necessary in order to traverse the other half. By
  this means a displacement of the interference-bands              was pro
  duced ; for the thermo-multiplier indicated a decrease of tempe
  rature, on the introduction of the glass, when the thermic pile
  was at a place of original maximum of heat, and an increase of
  temperature when the pile was situated in one of the former cold
  bands : this latter fact is the more significant, since the action
  was there opposed by the absorption of the interposed glass. With
  respect to interference, therefore, the influence of unequal thick

nesses of traversed glass is such              that places of greater heat
become colder, and vice versd.

vage, two groups of interference-phamomena          are also obtained
by   employing the first-mentioned oils, since their indices of
refraction lie between those of the ordinary and extraordinary
rays in the calcareous spar     these phsenomena can only be sepa

and the interference-apparatus.      In the one case, corresponding
to the dark centre,     deflection of 0o,25 was obtained in the
                                a                                                 ;

and that of the rhomb of calcareous spar were inclined at 90° or
were parallel to each other.       By every position of the Nicol's
prism the centre of the rings had the same low temperature
when, between the convex flint-glass and the calcareous spar, one
of those substances were interposed whose index of refraction                             is
smaller than that of the extraordinary ray in the calcareous spar.

     It appeared to promise interest to examine also in this field
 the quality of the thermic colours produced by interference.         In
 order to obtain the latter, a thin plate of gypsum was introduced
 between two Nicol's prisms, 85 millims. in length and 42 mil-
  lims. in diameter.      The test itself was instituted by means of
 diathermanous substances, such as coloured glasses, placed suc
 cessively before the pile.      Observation proved that equal quan
 tities of rays of heat,   after passing through the polarizing appa
 ratus and the gypsum, possess in different degrees the power of
 traversing the same diathermanous substance according as the
 principal sections of the polarizing and analysing Nicols cross
 each other at right angles or are parallel; further, that both
 these groups of rays differ from that which corresponds to an
 angle of 45° between the principal sections of the two Nicols,
 and which constitutes the transition from any thermic colour to
 its complementary one.
 XVII.     Remarks    on the behaviour  of Mercury as an Electrode.
     By T. Stbethill Wright, M.D.,             President of the Royal
     Physical Society, Edinburgh*.
            voltaic movements of mercury have been investigated by
THE       Davy, Gerbour, Hellwig, Erman, Pfaff, and Eunge, and
especially by Sir John Herschel, who almost exhausted the sub
ject in the Bakerian Lecture for 1824. The great majority of my
observations were similar to those made by the authors above men
tioned.     I shall therefore not detail them to the Society tonight,
but merely bring forward those which appear to be new.
     Experiment 1 . — An ounce of mercury was poured into a shallow
vessel containing a quantity of sulphuric acid diluted with water,
sufficient to cover the surface of the metal.       The mercury was
then connected by a fine copper wire with one of the terminal
wires of a galvanometer.         The other wire of the galvanometer
was armed with a small plate of amalgamated zinc ; the whole
consequently formed a voltaic circle of zinc, mercury, and dilute
acid.     On plunging the zinc plate into the acid, the needle was

burgh on the 21st of February, 1859.

130    Dr. Wright on    the  Behaviour of Mercury   as an Electrode.
deflected to 90°, and the mercury, which lay extended against the
side of the vessel, contracted itself into a more globular form,
and, throwing off the liquid from its surface, appeared above the
latter dry and bright.      The instant, however, that the mercury
had become contracted, the needle of the galvanometer returned
to zero ; indicating the cessation of the powerful current which
had passed at the first completion of the circuit. The nine plate
was then removed from the liquid, and the mercury, after
remaining contracted for a short time, reassumed its elongated
form and hid itself beneath the acid.
   Experiment 2. — The mercury Was brought to the contracted
state as before, and the zinc plate quickly changed for one of
platinum.     The fluid metal now quickly extended itself ; and at
the same time a momentary current of great energy was indi
cated by the galvanometer, but passing in a contrary direction
to that obtained by the former arrangement with zinc.
   Experiment 3.— The galvanometer was removed, and the zinc
brought for an instant in contact with the mercury j by which
means a slight addition of zinc to the mercury was effected.
The result was a contracted state of the mercury which continued
for eight hours. The globule so contracted was then connected
with a plate of platinum immersed in the solution^ when an
evolution of hydrogen commenced on the surface of the platinum
which continued until the mercury suddenly resumed its ex
tended shape.
   These experiments appear to indicate that the first effect of
communication by a connecting wire between the mercury and
zinc, was to set in motion a current which deposited a thin layer
or film of hydrogen over the whole surface of the mercury. The
metal being thus released from its attraction for the acid,
assumed a form still more globular than it possessed in air, in
consequence of the support it received from the liquid surround
ing it. The extension of the mercury, which occurred after the
interruption of the circuit, was probably in consequence of the
Union of the film of hydrogen with the oxygen of the atmo
spheric air Contained in the water.
   Experiment 4. — A portion of mercury A, brought into the con
tracted state as in Exp. 1, was connected, by means of a thin
wire, with a Second portion of mercury B. B instantly con
tracted itself as if A had been a plate of zinc.
   Similar but less energetic contractions took place in mercury
immersed in solutions of common salt, iodide of potassium, and
Other alkaline salts.
   The rapidity of contraction and extension in the mercury was
greatly enhanced by the addition of a little nitric acid to the
sulphuric acid solution.      Indeed, by placing the extremity of the

the sulphuric acid solution of the last experiment.        instantlyA

direction of the current was now suddenly reversed, when A

assumed the contracted            state.

the induced and interrupted current from the primary wire of                       a
powerful electro-magnetic coil machine was passed through the

each other, and did not cease to do so until the whole formed                      a
single mass.

attraction, instead of contracting, expands.
   Experiment 8. — One ounce of mercury was placed in saucer             a
containing    a solution of chloride of sodium, and was connected
with the negative wire of Grove's cell. The positive wire of the

violence    in the direction of the zinc.          At the same time the
strong currents were set up in the solution which have been so
fully described by Herschel and others.
  Experiment 9. — A common dinner plate was inverted, and a nar
row strip of silver cemented across its bottom.   This strip served
to retain a large pool of mercury in the centre of the plate.     A
solution of iodide of potassium was now poured on the plate, and
two iron wires dipping into the liquid transmitted the current of
twelve small Daniel's cells across the plate and the silver strip.
The mass of mercury immediately commenced flowing to and
fro between the wires, touching and receiving an impulse from
each wire alternately.   By employing several pounds of mercury,
the last experiment might be rendered a very striking illustration
of the galvanoscopic properties of mercury before a large audience.
                   Undulatory Motions     of Mercury.
    Two globules of mercury immersed in a solution of chloride of
 sodium were connected with the ends of the primary wire of an
electro-magnetic coil machine.       When the machine was slowly set
in motion, the mercury undulated in two directions so as to repre
 sent a cross.    Increasing speed in the action of the break caused
the metal to assume successively the form of a star with six,
eight, twelve, or more rays.          Occasionally, also, these stars
would revolve slowly on their centres.
   A large pool of mercury under the same circumstances had
its entire surface thrown into innumerable waves, which showed,
by their mutual interference, figures of remarkable complexity,
when examined by a reflected beam of light.           These figures were
always constant for the same speed of break, power of battery,
and shape of the mercury.
   Having noticed on several occasions the occurrence of un
dulatory motions in mercury when traversed by a constant cur
rent, I endeavoured to reproduce these motions, but for some
time in vain.             I
                  At last found that they took place in a solution
of chloride of sodium containing a very small quantity of sul
phuric acid ; in the former of which solutions mercury expands,
while in the latter it contracts.         This beautiful experiment as
perfected  was  performed   as follows  : — A plate of zinc three inches
in diameter, having a wire soldered to       it,    sewed up in muslin
                                                   is
and cemented in the centre of     a   white dinner plate.     A quantity
of mercury   is  then poured into the plate until       it lies as
                                                                 a   flnid
ring  round  the   bottom  and  at  about  two  inches  distant  from  the
zinc.    The metals are now covered with clear saturated solution
                                             a
of chloride of sodium.      The wire soldered to the central piece of
zinc  is  connected with the positive pole of           aplatinized zinc

battery* of two cells, while a wire connects the negative pole of
the battery with the mercury. The mercurial ring now flattens
itself out, and strong currents pass through the solution from the
zinc to the mercury. Very dilute sulphuric acid is now added
drop by drop, until all at once the currents in the solution stop,
and the whole of the inner edge of the mercury is thrown into
large waves of equal size which flow rapidly round the circle, the
mercury assuming the appearance of a ring with large rounded
teeth in rapid rotation. A further addition of acid increases the
rapidity of the undulations, and at the same time decreases the
size of the waves, until at last it stops them altogether, and the
mercury becomes contracted.             The mass of the mercury has no
rotatory    movement    even   when   the undulations are the most ener
getic.    At   first the  waves    often  pass in opposite directions in
different parts of the ring, until the longer set compels the
shorter to change its course, and they all pass round in the
same direction.

    and the Conservation of Force in Vital Phenomena. By Joseph

    Carolina College, Columbia-^.
                   constantly changes its form, h'ut is itself inde
 MATTER    structible, except by the same power which called it
into being. The same quantity of matter exists in the uni
verse at all times.       So also force changes its form constantly,
but is itself indestructible, incapable of increase or diminution,
and the same absolute amount of force exists in the universe at
all times and for ever. The mutual convertibility of the various
forms of force is called " correlation of forces." The invariability
of the absolute amount in the midst of constant change is called
" conservation of force." This principle of correlation and con
servation of force must be looked upon as one of the grandest
generalizations in modern science, — a principle startling at first,
but when clearly understood and firmly grasped, almost axiom
atic.    It must be considered a necessary truth, and, as such, is
a legitimate basis of deductive reasoning.
    The correlation of physical forces is universally recognized as
a principle in science, and not only so, but has already been pro-

ductive of many beautiful and useful results ; but the correlation
of physical and vital forces, while generally recognized as a pro
bable fact, has only been speculated on in a vague and as yet
unfruitful manner.        The science of life is scarcely yet ripe for
the legitimate extension of this principle over its domain.           The
 most elaborate attempt of this kind which          I  have seen is con
tained in the very remarkable and suggestive paper of Dr. Car
                    " Mutual Relation of Physical and Vital Forces,"
 penter, entitled
 and published in the Philosophical Transactions for the year 1850.
                              I
     In the present paper wish simply to present a few thoughts
 which have originated in my own mind in the course of reflec
 tion on this subject, in the hope that they may prove suggestive
 to others.      They have at least the merit of being uninfluenced
 by the writings of others, and therefore perhaps of presenting
 the subject in a somewhat new light.         I  sincerely wish I could
 present the matter in a more definite form ; but it is certain that,
 where a subject is not perfectly understood, the attempt to give
 our ideas more definiteness also makes them more questionable.
 We are obliged to be content with a certain vagueness, in the
 hope that by the use of right methods a clearness will come
 after. We must gratefully accept the twilight in the hope that
 it marks the approach of the full light of day.
      There are four planes of material existence which may be re
 garded as being raised one above the other.          The first and lowest
 is the plane of elementary existence; the second, the plane of
 chemical compounds, or mineral kingdom ; third, the plane of
 vegetable existence ; and fourth, of animal existence.          Now it is
 apparently impossible for any known force in nature to raise
  matter through all these grades at once.        On the contrary, there
  is a special force adapted for the elevation of matter from each
 plane to the plane above. It is the special function of chemical
  affinity to raise matter from plane No. 1 to No. 2. All the
  changes, too, which take place upon plane No. 2 by the mutual
 Teactions of bodies situated on that plane, are under the guidance
  and control of this force.       It is the special prerogative of the
  force of vegetation — of vegetable life —to lift matter from No. 2
  to No. 3, i. e. from the condition of mineral matter to the higher
  condition of vegetable matter.      All the changes which take place
  upon   this  plane, the  laws of which   constitute vegetable physio
  logy, are under the guidance of this force.        Finally, the force of
  animal life, and that alone, enjoys the privilege of lifting mat
  ter still higher, into the fourth plane, i. e. the plane of animal
  existence.     No force in nature can lift from No. 1 to No. 3, or
   from No. 2 to No. 4. Plants cannot feed entirely upon ele
  mentary matter, nor can animals feed upon mineral matter. The
   reason of this will be seen in the sequel.         Thus it seems that

              Prof. LeConte on     the Correlation of Forest.         135
after matter is raised from the elementary to the mineral con
dition, it requires an additional force of another* and peculiar
kind to    raise it into the vegetable kingdom, and again another
accession    of force to raise it into the animal kingdom.          These
kingdoms       are  therefore  truly represented   as  successive  planes
raised one above the other, thus :
                       No. 4. Animal kingdom.
                            3. Vegetable kingdom.
                            2. Mineral kingdom.
                            1. Elements.
     If, then, it  be admitted that this is the relative      position of
these planes — that it requires a greater and greater expenditure
 of force to maintain matter upon each successive plane, then it
follows that any amount of matter returning to a lower plane by
 decomposition must set free or develope a force which may, under
favourable circumstances, raise other matter from a lower to a higher
 condition.     Or to express it by a mechanical illustration, a given
 amount of matter falling from one plane to any plane below,
 developes a force sufficient to raise an equal quantity of matter
an equal height.        Thus decomposition must in every case deve
lope force, which force may take the form of heat as in combus
 tion, or electricity as in electrolysis, or may expend itself in
 forming chemical compounds, or even in organizing matter.
    Again, in the same manner as matter may be arranged in
 several distinct and graduated kingdoms, so it seems to me the
forces of nature may also be properly divided into distinct
groups arranged in a similar manner one above the other. These
are the physical, the chemical, and the vital forces.          And as in
 the case of matter, so also in the case of force, it is impossible to
 pass directly from the lowest to the highest group without pass
ing through the intermediate group. The conversion of physical
into vital force seems impossible without passing through the
intermediate condition of chemical force.
    These are the simple principles upon which are based all that
 follows, — principles which may possibly seem fanciful to some
 unfamiliar with the principle of conservation of force ; but the
 number of phenomena which they consistently explain will,              I
 hope, entitle them to serious thought.
    1st. It is well known that chemical elements, in what is called
the " nascent condition," i. e. at the moment of liberation from
 previous combination, exhibit a peculiar energy of chemical
 affinity not exhibited under other circumstances.          It seems to
me that this is readily explicable on the principle of conserva
 tion of force.      At the moment of decomposition the chemical
 affinity which bound the elements together and which was be

136            Prof. LeConte on      the   Correlation      of Forces.
fore satisfied, is suddenly left unsatisfied.      There is an attraction
set free which 'was before disguised — a force liberated which was
before latent.      If
                    conditions favourable are present, this force may
preserve the form of chemical affinity, and expend itself in form
ing other chemical compounds, or even, as we shall see here
after, in organizing matter.       But if favourable conditions are not
present, then it may take some other form of force, e. g., heat or
electricity, and therefore no longer exist as chemical affinity : the
chemical affinity is said to be lost.       To return to the mechanical
illustration used above. Matter falling from plane No. 2 to
plane No. 1, developes force sufficient to raise other matter from
plane No. 1 to No. 2, but which in the absence of such matter
may expend itself in heat or electricity, or some other form of
physical force.
    2nd. It is a fact, now well established, that the seed in germi
nation forms carbonic acid, and in doing so loses weight : that
is, the organized matter of the seed             partially decomposed, a
                                                  is
portion of its cai'bon uniting with the oxygen of the air to form
carbonic acid.     Now    it
                          is  this decomposition which developes the
force     by
           which germination       effected.
                                    is             portion of the organic
                                                    A
matter of the seed       isdecomposed.         This decomposition      sets
free  a force which suffices to organize the rest.        The force neces
sary, and therefore the amount of decomposition necessary in this
case  is small, because the work to be accomplished            simply the
                                                                      is
change from one form of organic matter to another, or rather
from organic to organized matter — to recur again to the former
illustration, merely shifting       certain quantity of matter from
                                    a
one place to another upon the plane No. 3.            " But how," may            it
be asked, "is this decomposition brought about?"               This seems
to be effected by the heat, and perhaps (according to Hunt)                           by
the actinic rays of the sun*.       Heat and actinic rays have been
spoken of by many writers, e. g.             by
                                              Carpenter and        Robert   by
Hunt, as the physical force which               changed into organizing
                                               is
force      means of the "substratum of an organized structure:"

but the peculiarity of the view which         I now present     that this
                                                                       is
conversion does not take place immediately, but only through the
mediation      another force more nearly allied to the vital, viz. che
               of
mical force.    The food      laid up in the seed mostly in the form
                              is
of starch.    In the act of germination this starch         changed into

sugar.     Starch,  as   well
                         is    known,    differs from sugar in two im
portant respects, viz.    it    insoluble, and
                               is                       more highly car-

of the partial decomposition is to change the food from an inso
luble to a soluble form; and this can be done only by elimina
tion of a portion of the carbon in the form of carbonic acid.
According to the view which              I  now present, the food is always
laid up in a more highly carbonised condition than is wanted, in order
that force may be set free by elimination of superfluous carbon.             Ac
 cording to the ordinary view, if an insoluble food could be found
 capable of conversion into the soluble form without loss of car
 bon, then germination of the seed might take place without
 loss of weight, by the direct conversion of heat into vital force.
 According to my view, decomposition, and therefore loss of weight
 is absolutely necessary to develope the organizing force, the loss of
 weight being in fact the exact measure of that force.
      3rd. As soon as the plant developes green leaves, a complete
 change takes place in its mode of development.                   It no longer
 loses weight, but increases in weight.             It not only developes, but
  grows.        The reason of this is that the organizing force is no
  longer developed by decomposition of food laid up within its
  own tissues, but by the decomposition of food taken ab externo.
  Sunlight is universally admitted to be the physical force con
  cerned in this decomposition.            Further, it is generally supposed
  that there is a direct and immediate conversion of light into
  vital force in the green leaves of plants. But evidently this is
  impossible, since the work done by the light is the separation of the
  two elements carbon and oxygen. Light is therefore converted into
  motion. It is therefore the chemical affinity thus set free which
  is the force immediately converted into vital force.              The food of
  plants     consists   of  carbonic  acid,  water,  and  ammonia     (CO2, HO
   and NH3), or in some cases, according to M. Ville, of CO2, HO
   and N*.         Sunlight acting through the medium of the green
   leaves of plants has the remarkable power of decomposing CO2.
   The force thus set free from a latent condition, or the chemical
   affinity of carbon in a nascent condition, is the force by means of
   which C, H, 0 and N are raised to the organic conditionf. To
   return to my former illustration : matter (oxygen) falling from
   the second to the first plane developes force sufficient to raise
   other matter from the second to the third plane.                   Thus it is
   evidently impossible,       on the principle  of conservation   of force, that

    plants should feed entirely upon elementary matter ; whereas ac
      cording to the ordinary view of the direct conversion of light
     into organizing force, there is no reason why plants should not
     feed entirely on elements, except that one of them, carbon, is
     insoluble.
         4th. There are many other phsenomena of vegetable life which
     receive a ready explanation on this theory.                  I
                                                                have said that
      sunlight has the power of decomposing carbonic acid only in the
     green leaves of plants.       Pale plants, such as the Fungi among
     cryptogams     and   the  Monotropa among phaenogams, have no
     power to decompose CO2.          These plants, therefore, cannot feed
     upon chemical compounds — mineral matter. They must feed upon
     organic matter, which organic matter in its partial decomposition
<
    furnishes the force necessary for organization.
                                                         '
                                                           If so, then this de
     composition, as in the case of germination, must be attended
     with the elimination of CO9.          Both of these are known to be
     facts.   Pale plants do feed upon organic matter and do evolve
     CO2. The necessary connexion of these facts with one another
     and with the principle of conservation of force, is now for the
     first time, as far as I know, brought out. The phsenomena of
     nutrition in these plants is similar to that of seeds in germina
     tion, except that the latter contain the organic matter already
     laid up within their own tissues, while the former derive it from
     decaying vegetable or animal matter taken ab externo into their
     tissues.   In this case, too, as in germination, heat is apparently
    the physical force which effects the decomposition of the organic
    food, and which is therefore converted indirectly through chemi
    cal into vital force. Light is actually unfavourable to this process ;
    for light tends to decompose, not to form CO2. In both cases
    therefore the conditions favourable for nutrition are, first, abund
    ance of soluble organic matter, second, absence of light and
    presence of heat.       Thisis,  then, apparently the true reason why
    germinating plants and pale plants avoid the light.           These plants
    grow   by  the  oxidation   of carbon  and  formation    of  CO2.    Light
    decomposes CO2, and must therefore be antagonistic to its forma
    tion, and consequently to the growth of these plants. Whether
    or not this property of light      is entirely limited        by
                                                                 the condition
    of its acting through an organic tissue,             question yet unde
                                                         is   a
    termined.      Heat we know        favourable to the oxidation of car
                                      is
    bon (combustion, fermentation, putrefaction, &c.) under all cir
    cumstances.       Has light an opposite property also under all
    circumstances  ?    oris   this opposite property of light limited to
    the condition of its acting through the medium of an organism          ?
I      hope the experiments already commenced, and still in progress,
    by   my brother Prof. John LeConte, and published in the last
      Proceedings and in the American Journal of Science and Arts,
    '            '

             Prof. LeConte on     the  Correlation of Forces.        139
vol. xxiv. p. 317, will eventually furnish the means of solving
this very important problem.          I  do not wish to anticipate the
final results of these experiments j but it seems to me that the
negative results thus far obtained rather support the view that
the action of light is not thus limited.         In all experiments on
this subject the light and heat of the sun have been combined.
Now heat we know is favourable to combustion. The fact, then,
that combined light and heat produced no effect, would seem to
 indicate that light counteracted the effect of the heat of the sun.
     5th. Etiolated plants, or plants artificially blanched by exclu
 sion of light, exhibit the same phaenomena, and for the same
 reason.     These plants cannot receive their organizing force
 through the decomposition of CO* by sunlight, therefore they
 are obliged to obtain it from decomposition of organic matter.
  Hence these plants require organic food ; hence also they evolve
  CO4 instead of oxygen.        In this case also decomposition of
  organic   matter, with  a separation of a portion of the carbon in
  the form of CO2, furnishes the organizing force.         In the absence
  of any external organic matter in the form of humus or manure,
  etiolated plants, like germinating seeds, will feed for awhile upon
  organic matter previously accumulated in their tissues in the
  form of starch, and actually lose weight of solid matter*.
      6th. In a most interesting and suggestive article in the Biblio-
  theque Universelle {Archives des Sciences f) on the subject of
  humus, M. Risler shows in the most conclusive manner that
  organic matter in a soluble condition (soluble humus) is taken
  up by almost all plants.       This fact had been previously proved
  experimentally by Th. de Saussure ; but having been denied by
  Liebig, it has been very generally neglected by vegetable physio
  logists.   The doctrine of Liebig and of physiologists generally
  is that, except in case of pale plants, organic matter is decom
  posed into CO2, HO, and NH3, i. e. must fall into the mineral
                                  absorbed and assimilated by plants,
  and therefore that organic manures only supply the same sub
  stances, and in exactly the same form, which are already sup
  plied, but in insufficient quantities, by the atmosphere.           But
   M. Risler repeats with great care the experiments of De Saussure,
   and confirms the accuracy of his conclusions.          Hyacinths and
   other bulbs were placed with their roots suspended in water co
   loured with soluble extract of humus. When these plants were
   placed in the sun, the water became rapidly decolorized.         Other
   roots, such as carrots, also germinating grains of wheat, were ob
   served to produce the same effects.        An extract of humus was
   exposed  at a somewhat    elevated   temperature  to sunlight under a

   bell-glass. Microscopic plants developed in great abundance.
   As long as tbese plants continued to develope, the infusion was
   transparent and did not putrefy in the slightest degree; and yet
   there was a constant evolution of CO8, as shown by analysis of
   the air in the bell-glass.
                                   " Now the cellules formed in the liquid
   contained carbon.       Thi3 carbon did not come from the CO2 of
   the air, for the liquid, far from absorbing, disengaged CO2. There
  fore the soluble humus must have furnished the carbon directly
  to the vegetable cells."        It could not have furnished it indirectly
  in the form of CO2 derived from decomposition of the organic
  matter, otherwise oxygen, instead of CO2, would have been elimi
  nated.     M. Risler thinks moreover that the embryo in germina
  tion takes up soluble organic matter in the form of humus in
  addition to the soluble organic matter contained within the coty
  ledons, and that the evolution of CO2 by germinating seeds is
  due in part also to the oxidation of humus.             Finally, according
  to the same author, the formation of roots in all plants, but par
  ticularly those containing much starch or sugar, is due to the
  direct absorption of humus, and not, as is generally supposed,
  to the fixation of carbon by means of light.             " In order,"
                                                                        says
 he,
       " that CO2 of the air should form these substances, it is neces
  sary, in the beet and the potato, that there should be a descend
 ing sap, which there is not." Moreover, if the carbon were taken
 from the soil in the form of CO2, there should be elimination of
 oxygen instead of evolution of CO2 ; but the converse is the fact,
 as has been proved in the most indisputable manner by De Saus-
 sure and Boussingault*.
     Mulder is equally explicit in affirming that plants absorb
 soluble organic matter, which is converted in the roots, by elimi
 nation of a portion of the carbon, into starch and sugar (Mulder,
 pp. 620, 664, 682).         Thus, according to these authors, sap is
 actually elaborated by the roots from organic manures.
     Now according to the theory which             I  propose, this change
 from humus into starch, sugar, or cellulose, furnishes an addi
tional life-force. Humus is a more highly carbonized substance
than either starch or cellulose.          By the partial decomposition of
humus in the tissues of the plant, with the elimination of a por
tion of its carbon (removed by oxidation), a chemical force is set
free which serves to assimilate the remainder.              Hence this pro
cess of evolution of CO2, as we have already said, is opposed by
light, but favoured by darkness and heat. Light favours the
formation of chlorophyll,, of woody fibre, of essential oils, gums,
&c. ; darkness, heat, and organic manures favour the formation
of sugar, starch, &c. Hence the explanation of the well-known
fact, that by covering up the lower portions of potato plants by
            * Bibl. Univ., Arch,  des Set., New Series, vol. i. p. 5.

               Prof. LeConte on         the Correlation     of Forces.
heaping earth around them, many buds which would otherwise
form, leafy branches develope into tubers.                  Hence also the expla
nation of the equally well-known fact, that the roots of plants
seek and grow most rapidly in the direction of most abundant
food. If the sap is elaborated entirely in the leaves, it is diffi
 cult to understand why the descending sap should flow in greater
 abundance in one direction than another.                    But if sap is elabo
 rated    in the root  itself,   it is  easy   to  see why growth is most rapid
 in the direction of most abundant manure.                        It is easy to see,
 too, why roots avoid the light ; since light decomposes CO2, and
 therefore must be unfavourable to the formation of this substance.
      7th. It is a well-known fact that the so-called respiration of
 plants consists of two distinct and apparently opposite processes :
  1st, the absorption of CO2 by the leaves, and also in solution by
 the roots, the decomposition of this CO2 by means of light,
  with the fixation of the carbon and the elimination of the oxy
  gen; 2nd, the recomposition and evolution of CO2.                      The decom
  position    of CO2   undoubtedly        takes   place  in the  leaves   ; but where
  the recomposition of CO2 takes place is not so well ascertained.
  It is exhaled, however, like the oxygen, from the leaves. The
  process of decomposition of CO2 takes place only during the day,
  as light is absolutely necessary for this process.                 The recomposi
  tion of CO2 takes place night and day, although its exhalation,
  according to some observers, seems to be more abundant during
  the night.       The process of decomposition of CO2 is well under
  stood ; of that of recomposition our knowledge is very imperfect.
  M. Bjsler's explanation of this latter process seems most probable.
  Plants, we have seen, undoubtedly absorb soluble organic mat
  ter, i. ft humus.       Humus we know is a more highly carbonized
   substance than cellulose or starch.                  This humus is therefore
  oxidized in the roots and interior of the trunk, away from light,
  by means of oxygen, also absorbed by the roots, and thus forms
   CO2. This CO2 then circulates in the sap to be exhaled by the
   leaves, or perhaps to be again decomposed by sunlight in these
   organs. In the absence of light the whole is exhaled undecom-
   posed.     This readily accounts for the apparently greater exhala
   tion of CO2 during the night.                A series of well-conducted ex
   periments     would   test   the   truth   of  this view.      If it is true, there
    should be relation
                 a            between       the   richness   of  the   soil in organic
   manures and the amount of CO2 exhaled.                      For a given amount
    of growth, the amount of CO2 exhaled is the measure of the
    amount of food taken up in the form of organic matter, and the
    amount of oxygen exhaled is the measure of the amount of food
    taken in the form of mineral matter.                 Or if the exhaled CO2 is
    decomposed      in  the   leaves     during     the  day, then of course the
    difference   between    the   amount      exhaled   during the night and day

 142          Prof. LeConte    on the Correlation  of Forcet.
 would enter as an element in the calculation.           Also, it would
 seem that those plants especially which frequent rich shady
 spots, should exhale proportionally more CO9 and less oxygen,
 than those loving thin soils and sunny places.
    In plants, then, there are two sources of organizing force, the
 relative proportion of which varies infinitely, according to the
 amount of light, heat, colour of the plant and richness of the soil
in organic matters.       The two sources are immediately, 1st, the
 decomposition of CO2, 2nd, the decomposition of soluble highly
carbonized organic matter ; remotely, the two sources are light
and heat.      In plants which first take possession of desert spots,
bare rocks, &c, the first is the only source.       In pale plants and
fungi the second is the only source ; but in most plants the two
are combined in various proportions.          The first must of course
be considered the most fundamental and necessary, the second
heing evidently supplementary.          The decomposition of CO* by
sunlight may     be considered   as the  original source of all vegeta
tion j but in most of the higher orders of plants the process of
nutrition is expedited by the reabsorption of organic matter
before it again returns to the condition of CO8, HO, and NHS.
    8th. The egg during incubation absorbs oxygen, evolves CO2,
and probably HO, and loses weight.           As the result of this evo
lution of CO2, we find the egg developes. What it loses in weight
it gains in organization. Now what is the source of the organi
zing force ? It evidently bears a direct relation to the loss of
weight. Here also, then, we have partial decomposition furnish
ing the necessary force.     A portion of the organic matter, falling
from the organic to the mineral plane, sets free a force which
raises the remaining portion into a slightly higher condition.
Heat is evidently the physical force or agent which is trans
formed, not directly but indirectly, through chemical affinity into
vital force ; in other words, heat is the agent which effects the
necessary decomposition.       The phsenomenon of development of
the egg is therefore very similar to that of the seed.
    9th. After the hatching of the egg, the animal no longer loses
weight, because recomposition of food taken ab externo proceeds
pari passu with decomposition.        But in this case also decompo
sition supplies the force by which recomposition is effected, and
growth and development carried on.             As this is an important
point, I will attempt to explain it more fully.
    It is well known that in the animal body there are, going on
constantly, two distinct and apparently opposite processes, viz.
decomposition     and recomposition      of the tissues ; and that the
energy of the life is exactly in proportion to the rapidity of these
processes.     Now according to the ordinary view, the animal body
must be looked upon as the scene of continual strife between

                     Prof. LeConte on      the   Correlation       of Forces.         148
antagonistic forces, chemical and vital; the former constantly
tearing down and destroying, the latter as constantly building
up and repairing the breach.         In this unnatural warfare the che
mical forces are constantly victorious, so that the vital forces are
driven to the necessity of contenting themselves with the simple
work of reparation.       As cell after cell is destroyed by chemical
forces, others are put in their place by vital forces, until finally
the vital forces give up the unequal Contest, and death is the
result.         I
              do not know if this view is held by the best scientific
minds at the present day as a fact, but it certainly is generally
regarded as the most convenient method of representing all the
phsenomena of animal life, and, as Buch, has passed into the best
literature of the age. Certain it                    is,
                                              however, that the usual
belief,  even   among    the  best  physiologists,     that the animal

in other words, creates the necessity of food. But, according to
the view which        now propose, decomposition

           decomposition^seems to be expended in maintaining the
body   at   agiven position.  How then can growth and animal
activity go on?    The answer to this question   obvious enough        is
when we recollect the nature of the food of animals.    Anhnalsj
it
is   well known, cannot feed upon mineral matter, but only on
food already organized, at least up to the vegetable condition.
But when decomposition takes place, the animal matter returns
no longer to the vegetable condition from which     was immedi              it
ately raised, but to the mineral condition.   It decomposed into       is
CO2 HO and urea.        This last substance, though not strictly                       a

  only possible but certain, on the principle of conservation of
  force, that decomposition        of animal tissues should set free a
   force, a part of which is consumed in the recomposition            of a
  larger amount of new matter and thus maintaining growth, a
  part in animal heat, and a part in animal activity of all sorts.
  In this view of the case, we see at once the absolute necessity
  that the food of animals should be organized.          Upon the prin
  ciple  of  conservation   of force, growth  and animal   activity — in a
  word, animal     life — would  otherwise be  impossible.
      It follows also from the above, that the higher the organiza
  tion of the food, the smaller the amount of force necessary to
  effect assimilation, and therefore the larger the amount of resi
  dual force to be expended in animal heat and animal activity.
  In this we find a ready explanation of the superior activity of
  carnivorous animals, and the loss of animal activity which results
 in a state of domestication from the use of vegetable diet ; also
 of the supposed superior activity of men fed upon meat diet.
      10th.   I  have spoken thus far of only one source of vital
 force in animals, viz. the decomposition of the tissues.          I have
 attempted to show how, upon, the principle of conservation
 of force,- this is sufficient to carry on the growth and the activity
 of the animal organism.           But decomposition of the tissues,
 though the fundamental source — the source characteristic of, and
 peculiar to animals — of immediate and universal necessity in this
 kingdom, and in many cases sufficient of itself, i3 not the only
 source.      There is also in animals, as in plants, a supplemental
 source, viz. the decomposition of food.
     It is well known that the food of animals consists of two kinds,
 the nitrogenous, such as albumen, fibrine, caseine, &c. ; and the
non-nitrogenous, such as fat, starch, sugar, gum, &c. According
 to all physiologists since Liebig, the nitrogenous alone are used
in the repair and growth of the tissues. The non-nitrogenous
are either quickly consumed in respiration, or else are laid up in
the form of fat for future consumption in the same way.              Now
there can be no doubt that animals may live entirely on nitro
genous food; in which case the whole vital force, whether for
assimilation of food or for animal heat and animal activity, is
derived from the decomposition of the tissues.         This is the case
also, apparently, in the starving animal, particularly if lean. But
in almost all cases much food in the form of fat, starch, sugar,
&c. (non-nitrogenous),' is never transformed at all into tissues,
but is taken into the blood, gradually decomposed, oxidized in
the course of the circulation, changed into CO2 and HO, and
finally removed by exhalation from the lungs.             Now what is
the object of the non-nitrogenous food, since these do not form
any part of the tissues, but are again decomposed and thrown

             Prof. LeCoute on the Correlation     ofForces.         145
 out of the system ? The answer usually given is that such food
 is used in the animal economy solely as fuel to keep up the ani
 mal heat.     On this view it is difficult to see why this class of
 food should be used at all, especially in warm climates.        But ac
 cording to the view which I propose we have here an additional
 source of vital force.     The decomposition of these ternary com
 pounds   sets  free a force which is used in organizing and assimi
 lating other matter (nitrogenous) and in producing animal acti
 vity and animal heat. As in plants, although the decomposition
 of CO8 by sunlight is all that is absolutely necessary for growth
 and development, yet the decomposition of organic food sup
 plies an additional force which greatly increases the vigour and
 rapidity of vegetation; so in animals, although decomposition
 of the tissues is all that is absolutely necessary to furnish the
force of growth and the phsenomena of animal life generally, yet
the decomposition of non-nitrogenous organic food furnishes ad
 ditional force by which growth and animal activity may be
 maintained without too great an expenditure of the tissues.
    11th. In what then consists the essential difference between
animals and plants ? There can be no doubt that it consists,
generally, in their relations to one another and to the mineral
kingdom.       Plants occupy a middle ground between the mineral
and animal kingdom — a necessary halting-place for matter in its
upward struggles. But when we attempt to define this relation
more accurately, the problem becomes much more difficult.             It
is indeed probable that no single distinction will be found free
from objection. The commonly received and, to a certain ex
tent, very correct idea, is that the essential distinction consists
in their relation to CO*. Plants decompose, and animals recom-
pose CO2.      The beautiful manner in which the two kingdoms
stand related to each other through these converse processes is
familiar to all. But it is well known that most plants carry on
both of these processes at the same time ; while some, as fungi,
pale plants, &c, only recompose CO2, like animals.          It seems to
me that at least an equally good fundamental distinction may
be found in this : that in plants the fundamental and necessary
source of vital force is the decomposition of its mineral food ;
while in animals the fundamental source of vital force is the de
composition of its tissues.     It is true that in what I have called
the supplementary source of vital force they seem to meet on
common ground, viz. the decomposition of organic food ; but
even here there is this essential difference, that in plants this de
composition of organic food is only partial, and therefore fur
nishes not only force but material for organization ; while in
animals the decomposition is complete and therefore furnishes
only force.
    As a necessary result of the above, it would seem that the

 " vortex " of Cuvier   is characteristic of animals.        There seems no
 reason to believe that a tissue once formed in plants is ever de
 composed and regenerated, as is the case in animals.                 When
 plant-cells  decompose,   the tissue     dies.   Hence    the absolute   ne
 cessity  of continuous   growth   in   plants.    In  this kingdom,   life is
 synonymous with growth. There is no possibility of life without
 growth. There is no such thing as determinate size, shape, or
 duration. There is no such thing as maturity j or if so, death
 takes place at the same instant.            As cell-life is necessarily of
 short duration, and as there is no regeneration of tissues in
 plants, it is evident that the life of the tissues must be equally
 short.     Thus plant-life can only be maintained by the continual
 formation of new tissues and a constant travelling of the vital
 force from the old to the new.          In exogenous plants the direc
 tion of travel is from the interior to the exterior ; in endogens
 from exterior to interior, and still more from below upwards, by
 the continual addition of new matter at the apex. In fungi, where
 there is no such superposition of new tissue upon the old, where
 growth takes place by multiplication of cells throughout the
 whole plant — in other words, a true interstitial growth as in
 animals — since there is no regeneration of tissues, the duration
 of the life of the plant is limited by the duration of cell-life.
    The respiration of animals, also, differs essentially from that of
 plants. At one time the absorption of CO2 and exhalation of
 0 was called the respiration of plants. It is universally admit
 ted now, however, that this is rather a process of assimilation
 than of respiration. The recomposition and exhalation of CO*,
 as soon as discovered, was very naturally likened to animal re
 spiration, and is in fact looked upon by many, as for example
the physiologist Carpenter, as a true respiration.             But there is
 an essential difference between this and animal respiration, which
 1 have already pointed out.           Its very significance is radically
 different.    The essential object of animal respiration is the re
moval of poisonous decomposed matters from the organism.
The so-called respiration of plants, on the contrary, is rather a
process of assimilation, since by it the too highly carbonized or
ganic food, by the elimination of a portion of its carbon, is
brought into a proper condition for organization. A true respi
ration is necessarily connected with a change of the matter of
the tissues — with the vortex of Cuvier — which has never been
shown to exist in plants.       It is true the exhalation of CO2 has
been looked upon by some physiologists as indicative of a re
generation of tissues ; but       I   have already shown that this is
probably not the case, but, on the contrary, that the CO2 is
formed by the partial decomposition             of highly carbonized or
ganic   food.
    1 2th. The most natural condition of matter is evidently that of

           Prof. LeConte on     the   Correlation of Forces.                  147
chemical compounds, i. e. the mineral kingdom.            Matter separ
ated from force would exist, of course, only as elementary matter
qr en the first plane ; but united with force, it is thereby raised into
the second plane and continues to exist most naturally there.
The third plane is supplied from the second, and the fourth from
the third.    Thus it is evident that the quantity of matter is great
est on the second and least on the fourth plane.            Thus nature
may be likened to        a pyramid,    of which the mineral kingdom
forms the base and the animal kingdom the apex. The absolute
necessity of this arrangement on the principle of the conserva
tion of force may be thus expressed.        Matter, force, and energy
are related to one another in physical and organic science some
what in the same manner as matter, velocity, and momentum                      in,
mechanics.      The whole energy remaining constant, the greater
the intensity of the force (the elevation in the scale of existence)            ,
the less the quantity of matter.         Thus necessarily results what
I  have called the pyramid of nature, upon which organic forces
work upwards and physical and chemical forces downwards.

garded as so much force abstracted from the common fund of
force, to be again restored, the whole of        it,
                                                   at death*.    If then
vital force is  only transformed physical force,           not possible,

it will be asked, that physical forces may generate organisms (ie
novo      Do not the views presented above support the doctrines,
of equivocal generation " and of the original creation of species

by physical forces    ?   I  answer that the question of the original
tion of  species is   left exactly where   it was found and where              it
must always remain,        viz. utterly beyond the limits of human
science.    But although we can never hope            by
                                                    the light of science
to know how organisms originated, still all that we do know of
the laws of the organic and inorganic world seem to negative
the idea that physical or chemical forces acting upon inorganic
matter can produce them.          Vital force     transformed physical
                                                 is
force true, but the necessary medium of this transformation
     :                                                                         is
an organized fabric the necessary condition of the existence of
                      ;
vital force is   therefore the previous existence of an organism.
As the existence of physical forces cannot even be conceived
without the previous existence of matter as its necessary sub
stratum, so the existence of vital force        inconceivable without
                                                is
the previous existence of an organized structure as its necessary
substratum. In the words of Dr. Carpenter, " It the speciality  is

            little handbook belongs to a class a great demand for which
THIS   has been created by the recently adopted system of competi
tive examinations in connexion with our civil and military services.
These examinations, intended originally as tests, have very naturally
become objects of education, and, as such, liable to great abuse.            In
general  the    demand    of which  we   speak simply expresses     a desire to
pass these     examinations    with  the  least   possible  amount  of trouble,
and not unfrequently it indicates a tendency to evade the true spirit
of the test. Many of the books written to satisfy this demand, pro
fessing to help the candidate through his examination rather than to
impart to him a thorough knowledge of his subject, are at once inac
curate and superficial — in short, purely injurious.          On this account,
rather than for the merits        of the   best  of   them, they require to be
watched and carefully sifted.        Convinced of the pernicious effects of
such books, we felt compelled, not long ago, to condemn severely a
certain treatise on Practical Geometry ; today we are glad to be able
to speak more favourably of a more modest, and at the same time
more genuine work on the same subject. It is evident that Mr. Winter
could, if required, write a book of a much higher order, and on this
account he has been able to accomplish his simpler task creditably.
Few of his readers will fail to learn from him how to construct the
more essential geometrical figures ; and the more intelligent amongst
them, instead of finding their reasoning faculties unexercised, or
perhaps unrecognized, are continually invited to seek for a reason
for the construction they are taught to make. This is as it ought
to be ; and we trust that Mr. Winter's little book will meet with the
success  it   deserves.

  I   consider this paper as in many respects an exceedingly valuable

that affection which has yet been given by a party affected, in pos

by others, and of the theories advanced to account for                 it,

for describing the phenomena of colour-blindness, than any normal-
eyed person can possibly be.           Itobvious that on the very same

principle that the latter considers himself entitled to refer all his per
ceptions of colour to three primary or elementary sensations —
whether these three be red, blue, and yellow, as Mayer (followed in
this respect by the generality of those who have written on colours)
has done, or red, green, and violet, as suggested by Dr. Young,
reasoning on Wollaston's account of the appearance of the spectrum
to his eyes — on the very same principle            person in Mr. Pole's

condition, or one of any other description of abnormal colour-vision,
quite equally entitled to be heard, when he declares that he refers his
sensations of colour to two primary elements, whose combination in
various proportions he recognizes, or thinks he recognizes, in all hues
presented to him, and which,       he pleases to call yellow and blue, no
                                     if
one can gainsay him      ;though, whether these terms express to him
the same sensations they suggest to us, or whether his sensation of
light with absence of colour corresponds to our white,            question

                                                                  it
such  is really the case). All we are entitled to require on receiving
such testimony is, that the party giving         should have undergone
                                                   it
that sort of education of the sight and judgment, especially with
reference to the prismatic decomposition of natural and artificial
colours, for want of which the generality of persons whose vision                     is
unimpeachably normal, appear to entertain very confused notions,
and are quite incapable of discussing the subject of colour in                        a
manner satisfactory to the photologist.
   It as necessary to distinguish between our sensations of colour,
      is
and the qualities of the light producing them, as           to distinguish

between bitterness, sweetness, sourness, saltness, &c, and the che
mical constitution of the several bodies which we call bitter, sweet,
&c. Whatever their views of prismatic analysis or composition
might suggest to Wollaston and Young,           cannot persuade myself
                                                 I

  ray, the commencement of a higher octave too feeble to affect the
  sight in its superior tones.      Speaking of my own sensations,         I
  should say that in fresh grass, or the laurel-leaf, I do not recognize
  the sensation either of blue or of yellow, but something sui generis ;
  while, on the other hand, I never fail to be sensible of the presence
  of the red element in either violet, or any of the hues to which the
 name of purple is indiscriminately given ; and my impression in this
 respect is borne out by the similar testimony of persons, good judges
 of colour, whom I have questioned on the subject.
    I  would wish, then, to be Understood as bearing in mind this
 distinction when speaking of the composition of colours by the super
 position of coloured lights on the retina.        It seems impossible to
 reason on the joint or compound sensation which ought to result
 from the supraposition in the sensorium of any two Or more sensa

 colours, refer only to the possibility of producing all coloured sensa

 regard as      logical sequence Mr. Pole's conclusion in

 because he perceives as colours only yellow and blue, therefore the
neutral impression resulting from their union must be that sensation
which the normal-eyed call green.         On the contrary,I    am strongly
disposed to believe that he sees white as we do, for reasons which       I
am about to adduce.
    Mr. Maxwell has lately announced his inability to form green         by
the combination of blue and yellow.         On the other hand, the pris
matic analysis of the fullest and most vivid yellows (those which
excite the sensation of yellowness in the greatest perfection), as the
colours of bright yellow flowers, or that of the yellow chromate of
mercury, clearly demonstrates the fullness, richness, and brilliancy
of their colour to arise from their reflexion of the whole, or nearly
the whole of the red, orange, yellow, and green rays, and the sup
pression of all, or nearly all the blue, indigo, and violet portion of the
spectrum.      On the hypothesis of an analysis of sensation correspond
ing to an analysis of coloured light, these facts would seem incom
patible with the simplicity of the sensation yellow, and            itWould
appear impossible (on that hypothesis) to express them otherwise
than by declaring red and green to be primary sensations, and yellow
a  mixture of them — proposition which needs only to be understood
                         a
to be repudiated — quite as decidedly as that the sensation of green
ness    is mixture of the sensations of blueness and yellowness, and for
             a
the same reason      the complete want of suggestion of the so-called
                     ;
simple sensations by the asserted complex ones.
    Mr. Maxwell's assertion that blue and yellow do not make green,
assuredly appears startling as contradictory to all common experience     ;
but the common experience appealed to       is that of artists, dyers, and
others in the habit of mixing natural colours as they are presented to

             Sir J. F. W. Herschel on Colour-Blindness.              151
us in pigments, coloured tissues, &c, who have for the most part
never seen a prismatic spectrum, or at least attended to its phseno-
mena.     The perceptions of colour afforded by such objects are those
of white light from which certain rays have been abstracted by ab
sorption, that is to say, they are negative hues, or hues of darkness
rather than of light, inasmuch as all the colouring of the artist is
based, not on the generation, but on the destruction of light.       This
circumstance, which is not generally recognized, even among edu
cated artists, has vitiated all the language of chromatics as applied to
art, and so placed a barrier between the painter and the photologist,
which has to be surmounted before they can come to a right under-
Standing of each other's meaning.           It is evident, that, to make
experiments     on  the  subject  free   from  this objection, absorptive
colours must be discarded, at least in bodily mixture with each other.
Thus it is true that a dingy green may be produced by rubbing
together in powder prussian blue and the yellow chromate of mer
cury above mentioned ; but both these agree in reflecting a con
siderable, and the latter a very large proportion of green light, to the
predominance of which in the joint reflected beam its tint is owing.
So also, when blue and yellow liquids (not acting chemically on each
other) are mixed, as in water-colour drawings, greens, sometimes
very lively ones, are produced.        In these cases the yellow absorbs
almost all the whole of the incident blue, indigo, and violet light, and
the blue a very large proportion of the red, orange, and yellow, both
allowing much green to pass ; 'and to this, rather than to a mixture of
the other rays, the resulting tint is due.
    In the light transmitted by cuprate of ammonia of a certain thick
ness, the red, orange, yellow, and green are wholly extinguished,
while the blue, indigo, and violet are allowed to pass. The result is
the fullest and bluest blue it is possible to obtain.    From this result,
compared with that derived from the analysis of natural yellows, it
follows that the union on the retina of the yellowest yellow, and the
bluest blue, in such proportions that neither shall be in excess,{so as
to tinge the resulting light either yellow or blue, is not green, but
white.     The same conclusion follows from dividing the spectrum
 into two, the one portion containing all the less refrangible rays up
 to the limit of the green and blue, the other all the remaining rays.
 If  the blue portion be suppressed, and the remainder reunited by a
 refraction in the opposite direction, the resulting beam is yellow, if
the other, blue, both vivid colours —but if neither, white of course,
 and not green, results from the exact recomposition of the original
 white beam.
    It may be objected to this, that in the complementary colours
 exhibited by doubly-refracted pencils in polarized light, yellow is
 often found to be complementary to purple, and blue to orange.
 But in neither of these pairs of colours is the spectrum divided in
 the manner above indicated ; and, moreover, in many instances yellow
 and blue are found as complementary colours in the oppositely
 polarized pencils ; of which examples will be found in the scale of
 tints produced by sulphate of barytes in my paper " On the Action
 of Crystallized Bodies in Homogeneous Light" (Phil. Trans. 1820,

152                           Boyal Society       :   —
Table I.).
                 " Rich yellow" appears also as opposed to " full blue"
in the scale of complementary tints exhibited by mica in my " Trea
tise on Light" (Encyc. Metrop., art. 507).              It is not asserted that
either a good yellow or a good blue cannot be produced otherwise
than in a particular manner, but that they can be produced in that
 particular manner, and that when so produced, their union affects
 the eye with no sensation of greenness.
    Let two very narrow strips of white paper, A, B, be placed parallel
 to one another in sunshine, so as to be seen projected on a perfectly
 black ground (a hollow shadow), and viewed through a prism having
 the refracting edge parallel to them, the refraction being towards the
 eye, and let the nearer B be gradually removed towards A, so that
the red portions of B's spectrum shall fall upon the green portion of
 A's. Their union will produce yellow, or, if too far advanced,
 orange.     On the other hand, it will be seen that the yellow space in
 B's spectrum on which the blue of A's falls is replaced by a streak
 of white, — whiteness, and not greenness, being the resultant of the
joint action of these rays on the retina.                 Ifthe strips be made
 wedge-shaped, tapering to fine points, and A being still white, B be
 made of paper coloured with the yellow chromate of mercury before
 mentioned, the whiteness of the streak where the blue of A mixes
 with the yellow of B near the pointed^ extremities will be very
 striking.
    There is a certain shade of cobalt-blue glass which insulates, or
 very nearly so, a definite yellow ray from the rest of the spectrum,
 suppressing the orange and a great deal of the green.                   If
                                                                       the spec
 trum of B, formed and coloured as last described, be viewed through
 this glass, a very well-defined image of      it,   clearly separated from its
 strong   red and   very  faint blue  images,   will  be seen.    As the glass in
 question    allows   blue  rays  to   pass,  the white   object, A, besides its
 definite yellow image, will form       a broad blue, indigo, and violet train
 nearer to the eye.        Now let  B   be gradually brought up towards A,
 so that the violet, indigo, and blue rays of this train shall coincide in
 succession with the yellow image of B, — no sensation of greenness will
 arise at any part of its movement.            Again, if   a white card be laid
 down on      a  black surface, the edge nearest the eye, when refracted
towards the spectator by      a   prism, will of course be fringed with the
more refrangible half of the spectrum.             Let this be viewed through
such  a    glass, and in the blue space so seen introduce one half of          a
narrow rectangular slip of paper thus coloured, having its upper edge
in contact with the lower edge of the white card, the other half pro
jecting laterally beyond the card.           In this arrangement the definite
image of the yellow paper insulated by the glass will be seen divided
into  a  yellow half, projecting beyond the blue fringe, and            purplish-
                                                                         a
or bluish-white one within        it,  hardly to be distinguished from the
image of the white paper, of which           it    seems       continuation, and

which through the glass in question appears           a  pale blue. This same
purplish tint was observed to arise also under the following circum

 set upon the line of junction a sheet of glass inclined to the plane of
 the papers upwards towards the eye, so as to allow the blue to be
 seen by transmitted light, while the yellow reflected from the glass
 was at the same time received into the eye.     By varying the inclina
 tion of the glass, the yellow reflexion could be made more or less
 vivid, so as either to be nearly imperceptible or quite to kill the
 blue of the paper.     But at no stage of its intensity, gradually in
 creased from one to the other extreme, was the slightest tendency to
 greenness produced.      The colour passed from blue to yellow, not
 through green,   but through   a pale uncertain purplish tint, not easy
 to describe, but as remote from green as could be well imagined.
    Of course in all such experiments one eye only must be used.
 Stereoscopic superposition of colour, which at first sight would ap
 pear readily available, does not satisfy the requisite conditions, and
 yields no definite results.
    The conclusions from these facts may be summed up as follows : —
 1st. That in no case can the sensation of green be produced by the
joint action on the eye of two lights, in neither of which, separately,
prismatic green exists ; 2ndly. That the joint action of two lights,
separately producing the most lively sensations of blue and yellow,
does not give rise to that of green, even when one of them contains
in its composition the totality of green light in the spectrum ;
and, 3rdly. That all our liveliest sensations of yellow are produced by
the joint action of rays, of which those separately exciting the ideas
of red and green form a large majority ; and that a decided yellow
impression is produced by the union of these only.
    From these premises it would seem the easiest possible step to
conclude the non-existence of yellow as a primary colour.       But this
conclusion    I
              am unable to admit in the face of the facts, — 1st, that
a yellow ray, incapable of prismatic analysis into green and red, may
be shown to exist, both in the spectrum and in flames in which soda
is present ; and 2ndly, that neither red nor green, as sensations, are
in the remotest degree suggested by that yellow in its action on the
eye.    Whether under these circumstances the vision of normal-eyed
persons should be termed trichromic or tetrachromic, seems an open
question.
    That Mr. Pole's vision is eftchromic, however, there can be no
doubt.   If  I could ever have entertained any as to the correctness
of the views I have embodied of the subject in that epithet, after
reading all   Ihave been able to meet with respecting           it,
                                                              this paper
would have dispelled it. That he sees blue as we do, there            no
                                                                      is
ground for doubting      and
                          ;    Ithink   extremely likely that his sensa
                                        it
tion of whiteness      the same as ours.
                         is                   Whether his sensation of
yellow corresponds to ours of yellow, or of green,    it   impossible to
                                                           is
decide, though the former seems to me most likely.
    One of the most remarkable of the features of this case, and in
deed of all similar ones,     the feebleness of the efficacy of the red
                              is
rays of the spectrum in point of illuminating power, which certainly
very strongly suggests an explanation drawn from the theory of three
primary coloured species of light, to one of which the colour-blind
may be supposed absolutely insensible.       Mr. Pole himself evidently

154                           Royal Society     :   —
leans to this opinion.        I had satisfied myself, however, in the case
of the late Mr. Troughton, that the extreme red — that pure and de
finite red which is seen in the solar spectrum only when the more
luminous red is suppressed, and in which I cannot persuade myself
that any yellow exists, was not invisible to him, — though of course not
seen as red ; and on supplying Mr. Pole with a specimen of a glass,
so compounded of a cobalt-blue and a red glass as to transmit posi
tively no vestige of any other ray, but that copiously, so that a
candle seen through it appears considerably luminous, and the
window-bars against a cloudy sky are well seen if other light be kept
from falling on the eye, — T am informed by him that he saw through
it "gas,fre and other strong lights with perfect distinctness," and
that the colour so seen is a " very deep dark yellow." Now it seems
to me impossible to attribute this to any minute per-centage of yellow
light of the same refrangibility, which this can be supposed to con
tain.     The purity of its tint is extraordinary ; and its total intensity
so small, that supposing it reduced to one-tenth of its illuminating
power by the suppression of the whole of its primary red constituent,
I  cannot imagine that any gas-flame or fire-light would be visible
through   it,  or any other luminous body but the sum
    Still
        it   remains a   fact, however explained, that the red rays of the
Spectrum generally are to the colour-blind comparatively but feebly
luminous.       Mr. Pole speaks of red in more places than one as "
darkening power      ;
                       " and in the letter have received from him
                                            I                                  in a
reply to my query as to the visibility of light through the red glass
above mentioned, he insists strongly on its action as darkness. This,
however, can only be understood of the effects of red powders in
mixture, and not of red light and as, to our eyes, an intense blue
                                 ;
powder, such as prussian blue, has, besides its colorific effect,        vio
                                                                          a
lent darkening one (owing to its feeble luminosity), so, to the colour
 blind, red powders, when added to others, contribute but little light
in proportion to the bulk they occupy in the mixture, and therefore
exercise a    darkening power by displacing others more luminous than
themselves.     I  think it    therefore very probable that red appears to
the colour-blind as yellow-black does to the normal-eyed, or, in
 other words, that our higher reds are seen by them as we see that
shade of brown which verges to yellow — that of the faded leaf of the
tulip-tree for instance.        Now
                                  it   is  worthy of remark, that    it very
                                                                          is
difficult for the normal-eyed to become satisfied that the browns are
merely shades of orange and yellow.            Brownness (such at least has
always    been  my  own  impression) is  almost  as mucha  distinct sensation
as greenness      so thatI    am not at all surprised at the expression in
    22, that the " sensation of red as
                ;
|                                           a  dark yellow  iscertainly very
distinct from full yellow," or that colour-blind person should, after
                                        a
long and careful investigation, arrive at the conclusion that red              is
not to him      a distinct colour.I      find all this completely applicable
to my own perception of the colour brown.
    Mr. Pole    (§ 11) appears to lay great stress on the fact/that in a
closed colour circle in which red, yellow, and blue are so arranged
that each shall graduate into both the others, there occurs in the
space where red and blue graduate into each other,

   and richness of the tints, or insensible to the brilliancy of the nume
   rous shades of red and scarlet.           It may be, however, that the per
   centage  is   on   the  increase —  certainly  we hear of more cases than
   formerly  ;  but   this  probably  arises  from  the fact of this, like many
   other subjects, being made more generally matter of conversation.
      In further reference to the question of the superposition of colours
   in the spectrum, or of the intrinsic compositeness of rays of definite
   refrangibilities,    I  may mention a phenomenon which I have been
  led to notice in the prosecution of some experiments on the photo
  graphic impressions of the spectrum on papers variously prepared,
  which appeared to me, when first noticed, quite incompatible with
  the simplicity of those rays at least which occupy the more luminous
  portion of the spectrum, extending between the lines marked D and E
  by Fraunhofer, and clearly to demonstrate the presence of green
  light over nearly the whole of that interval.           In these experiments
  the spectrum formed by two Fraunhofer flint prisms, arranged so as
  to increase the dispersion, and adjusted to the position of least de
  viation for the yellow rays, was concentrated by an achromatic lens,
  and received on the paper placed in its focus, which could be viewed
  from behind.         A scries of white                    ited with washes of
  various colourless or very slightly coloured chemical preparations,
  and dried, were exposed ; and the spectrum being received on them,
  and the centre of the extreme red image as viewed through a stand
  ard glass, adjusted to a fiducial pinhole ; a sensitizing wash of nitrate
  of silver, or any other fitting preparation, was copiously applied to
  the exposed surface while under the action of the light. Now, under
  these circumstances,        I uniformly found that whereas the spectrum
  viewed from behind through the paper exhibited all over the space
 in question a dazzling very pale straw-yellow, hardly distinguishable
  from white, yet as the photographic action proceeded, and the
 translucency of the paper began to be somewhat diminished also by
 incipient drying, very nearly the whole of that space became occu
 pied by a full and undeniable green colour, so as to give the idea of
 a distinctly four-coloured spectrum — red, green, blue, and violet ;
 the yellow being in some instances almost undiscernible, and in
 others limited to a mere narrow transitional interval rather orange
 than yellow.        It was at the same time evident that a great extinction
 of light (illumination independent of colour) had also been operated,
 the vivid glare of the part of the spectrum in question being reduced
 to a degree of illumination considerably inferior to the red part, or,
 at all events, not much superior.              The change of colour was far
greater than could be attributed to any effect of contrast, and was
proved decisively not to be due to that cause by hiding the adjacent
red and blue when the green remained unaffected in apparent tint.
     When, for the photographic preparations wetted as described,
ordinary, dry, coloured papers were substituted, the change of colour
in question was always produced whenever the thickness of the paper
and its absorptive power were not such as to destroy or very much
enfeeble the more refrangible light.             Taking, as a term of compa
rison, a purely white, wove, writing-paper,          I found that the substi
tution of writing-paper, tinted with the ordinary cobalt blue com-

             Sir J.  F. W. Herschel on Colour-Blindness.             157
monly met with, sufficed to give a very great extension of the green,
almost to the extinction of the yellow, while, when the papers used
were pale-yellow or clay-coloured, answering to the tints called
"buff" or "maize" (nearly approximating to Chevreul's orange"
4 and 3), and which might naturally have been expected to transmit
yellow rays more abundantly at all events than the blue, the spectra
(viewed at the back of the papers) were particularly full and abun
dant in green, occupying the whole of the debateable ground.          In
the case of the former, a narrow yellow space was seen, and the blue
was very much enfeebled, and separated from the green by a very
perceptible suddenness of transition.     "With the latter the green was
finely  exhibited,  and the yellow confined  to a narrow orange-yellow
 border : the blue and violet much enfeebled.
    On further considering these facts, there seemed to be but three
ways of accounting for them : — 1st, by the effect of contrast.     This
I consider to ,be disposed of by the suppression of the adjacent
colours, as recorded above.     2ndly, by extinction of a yellow element
of colour over the space DE, allowing a substratum of green to sur
vive ; or, which comes to the same, by the extinction of the red ele
ment over the same space, which, by its combination with (an as
sumed elementary) green, produced the original brilliant straw-yellow.
And 3rdly, by admitting as a principle, that our judgment of colours
absolutely, in se, and independent of contrast, is influenced by the
intensity of the light by which they affect the eye, and that very
vivid illumination enfeebles or even destroys the perception of
colour.    As the apparent change of colour from pale-yellow to green
in the cases above related was always accompanied with a great
diminution of general intensity, it occurred to me to produce such
diminution by optical means, which should operate equally on all the
coloured rays, and diminish all their intensities in the same ratio.
This was accomplished by viewing the spectrum (as projected on
purely white paper) by reflexion on black glass, or by two successive
Teflexions in different planes, and    I found the very same effect to
take place.     That portion DE of the spectrum which in the unre-
flected state appeared dazzlingly bright and nearly colourless, wa3
seen by one such reflexion, and still more so by two, green.        The
extension of the green region was greater, and the limitation of the
yellow portion more complete, according to the amount of illumina
tion destroyed by varying the angles of incidence on the glasses.
When much enfeebled by two cross reflexions, the aspect of the
spectrum was that represented in Chevreul's coloured picture of it
from the line A to H. When enfeebled by other means, as by view
ing the spectrum thrown on a blackened surface, the effect was
exactly the same.
   The last of our three alternatives, then, would appear to be esta
blished as the true explanation ; and in respect of the second, it is
eliminated by the consideration that neither the slight degree of
coloration in the bluish papers, or the tint of the pale-yellow ones
which effected the change, would give rise to so great a preferential
extinction of yellow or red rays as an explanation founded on that
alternative would require.       The phenomenon is certainly a very

    1. "On some Remains of Polyptychodon from Dorking."             By
Prof. Owen, F.R.S., F.G.S.
    Referring to the genus of Saurians which he had founded in 1841
on certain large detached teeth from the Cretaceous beds of Kent
and Sussex, and which genus, in reference to the many-ridged or
folded character of the enamel of those teeth, he had proposed to
call Polyptychodon, Prof. Owen noticed the successive discoveries of
portions of jaws, one showing the thecodont implantation of those
teeth, which, with the shape and proportions of the teeth, led him to
suspect the crocodilian affinities of Polyptychodon ; and the subse
quent discovery of bones in a Lower Greensand quarry at Hythe,
which, on the hypothesis of their having belonged to Polyptychodon,
had led him to suspect that the genus conformed to the Plesio-
sauroid type.
    The fossils now exhibited by Mr. G. Cubitt of Denbies, consisted
 of part of the cranium (showing a large foramen parietale), frag
ments of the upper and lower jaws, and teeth of the Polyptychodon
interruptus, from the Lower Chalk of Dorking, and afforded further
evidence of the plesiosauroid affinities of the genus. Professor Owen
remarked that in a collection of fossils from the Upper Greensand
 near Cambridge, now in the Woodwardian Museum, and in another
 collection of fossils from the Greensand beds near Kursk in. Russia,
 submitted to the Professor's examination by Col. KiprianofF, there
 are teeth of Polyptychodon, associated with plesiosauroid vertebrae
 of the same proportional magnitude, and with portions of large limb-
 bones, without medullary cavity, and of plesiosauroid shape.
    Thus the evidence at present obtained respecting this huge, but
 hitherto problematical, carnivorous Saurian of the Cretaceous period
 seemed to prove it to be a marine one, more closely adhering to the
 prevailing type of the Sea-lizards of the great mesozoic epoch, then
 drawing to its close, than to the Mosasaurus of the Upper Chalk,
 which, by its vertebral, palatal, and dental characters, seemed to
foreshadow the Saurian type to follow.
    Prof. Owen exhibited also drawings of specimens in the Wood,
 wardian Museum and in the Collection of Mr. W. Harris, of Charing,
 which show the mode and degree of use or abrasion to which the
 teeth of Polyptychodon had been subject.

    The south-west point of the hill on which the Fort of Montserrate
 is built, in Bahia Bay, exhibits a section of alternating beds of con
 glomerate, sandstone, and shale ; in the last Mr. Allport discovered

several Crocodilian teeth, and numerous large scales of Lepidotus,
together with a few Molluscs (Paludina, Unio, &c), some Ento-
mostraca, and Lignite.      Two miles from Montserrate, in a N,E,
direction, is the Plantaforma, another hill of the same formation, but
loftier. The shales here also yielded similar fossils.
   These fossiliferous shales and conglomerates dip to the N.W.
towards the Bay, and appear to overlie a similarly inclined whitish
sandstone, which rests against the gneissose hills ranging north
eastwardly from the point of St. Antonio.
  3.   " On   a   Terrestrial Mollusc,    a Chilognathous Myriapod, and
some new species        of  Reptiles,  from  the Coal-formation of Nova
Scotia."     By  J.  W.  Dawson,    LL.D.,  F.G.S. &c.
    On revisiting the South Joggins in the past summer, Dr. Dawson
had the opportunity of examining the interior of another erect tree
in the same bed which had afforded the fossil stump from which the
remains of Dendrerpeton Acadianum and other terrestrial animals were
obtained in 1851 by Sir C. Lyell and himself.             This second trunk
was about 15 inches in diameter, and was much more richly stored
with animal remains than that previously met with. There were here
numerous specimens of the land-shell found in the tree previously
discovered in this bed ; several individuals of an articulated animal,
probably a Myriapod ; portions of two skeletons of Dendrerpeton ;
and seven small skeletons belonging to another Reptilian genus,
and probably to three species.
    The bottom of the trunk was floored with a thin layer of carbonized
bark.     On this was a bed of fragments of mineral charcoal (having
 Sigillarioid cell- structure), an inch thick, with a few Reptilian bones
and a Sternbergia-c&st.        Above this, the trunk was occupied, to a
height of about 6 inches, with a hard black laminated material,
consisting of fine sand and carbonized vegetable matter, cemented by
carbonate of Jime.        In this occurred most of the animal remains,
with coprolites, and with leaves of Noeggerathia (Poacites), Carpo-
 lithes, and Calamites, also many small pieces of mineral charcoal
 showing the structures of Lepidodendron, Stigmaria, and the leaf
 stalks of Ferns.      The upper part of this carbonaceous mass alter
 nated with fine grey sandstone, which filled the remainder of the
 trunk as far as seen.      The author remarked that this tree, like other
 erect Siyillaria in this section, became hollow by decay, after having
been more or less buried in sediment ; but that, unlike most others, it
remained hollow for some time in the soil of a forest, receiving small
 quantities of earthy and vegetable matter, falling into    it,  or washed in
 by rains.    In this state it  was probably  a   place of residence for the
 snails and myriapods and      a  trap and tomb for the reptiles though
                                                                  ;
 the presence of coprolitic matter would seem to show that, in some
 instances at least, the latter could exist for   a     time in their under
 ground prison.      The occurrence of so many skeletons, with hundred
                                                                  a
 or more specimens of land-snails and myriapods, in        a    cylinder only
  15 inches in diameter proves that these creatures were by no means
 rare in the coal-forests  ;   and the conditions of the tree with its ajr

  160                      Geological  Society : —
 breathing inhabitants implies that the Sigillarian forests were not
  so low and wet as we are apt to imagine.
     The little land-shell, specimens of which with the mouth entire
 have now occurred to the author, is named by him Pupa vetusta.
 Dr. Dawson found entire shells of Physa heterostropha in the stomach
 of Menobranchus lateralis, and hence he supposes that the Pupa may
 have been the food of the little reptiles the remains of which are
 associated with them.
     Two examples of Spirorbis carbonarius also occurred ; these may
 have been drifted into the hollow trunk whilst they were adherent
 to vegetable fragments. The Myriapod is named Xylobius Sigillaria,
  and is regarded as being allied to lulus.
     The reptilian bones, scutes, and teeth referable to Dendrerpeton
 Acadianum bear out the supposition of its Labyrinthodont affinities.
 Those of the new genus, Hylonomus, established by Dr. Dawson on
 the other reptilian remains, indicate a type remote from Archegosaurus
 and Labyrinthodon, but in many respects approaching the Lacertians.
 The three species determined by the author are named H. Lyellii,
 H. aciedentalus, and H. Wymani.
     4.   " On the Occurrence of Footsteps of Chirotherium in the Upper
 Keuper of Warwickshire."        By the Rev. P. B. Brodie, F.G.S.
     True Chirotherian footsteps do not appear to have been hitherto
 met with in the Keuper of Warwickshire ; but a specimen of Keuper
 sandstone showing the casts of a fore and a hind foot of Chirotherium
 was lately turned up by the plough at Whitley Green near Henley-
 in-Arden. The breadth of the fore foot is about 2 inches ; the hind
foot is 4| inches across. As the New Red sandstone of Cheshire, so
well known for its fine Chirotherian foot-tracks, certainly belongs to
the upper part of the New Red series, it may now be further corre
lated with the Upper Keuper of Warwickshire, the latter having
yielded true Chirotherian foot-prints.

           On the Freshwater Deposits of Bessarabia, Moldavia, Walla-
chia, and Bulgaria." By Capt. T. Spratt, R.N., C.B., F.R.S., F.G.S.
    Capt, Spratt first referred to the many isolated patches of fresh-

  Capt Spratt on    the Freshwater   Deposits of Bessarabia,   fyc.  161
  water deposits in the Grecian Archipelago and in the neighbouring
  countries, also around the Black Sea, to which others have alluded,
  or which have been described by himself as evidences of the existence
  of a great freshwater lake, probably of middle tertiary age.
     On the borders of the Yalpuk Lake, in Southern Bessarabia, are
 sections exhibiting old lacustrine deposits containing similar fossils
 to those found elsewhere by Capt. Spratt in the strata referred by
 him to the extensive oriental lake of the middle tertiary period.
 Among these fossils are freshwater Cockles ; such as are associated
 with Dreissena polymorpha in the strata at the Dardanelles and
 elsewhere.     After some search, Capt. Spratt found similar Cockles
 living in the Yalpuk lake ; and from this evidence, and from the
 relatively different levels of the old lacustrine deposits and the
 present Black Sea, he satisfied himself of the really freshwater
 condition of the old tertiary lake, — the Black Sea area having been
 separated from the old lacustrine area of Bessarabia and the Pro
 vinces by a barrier at the Isaktcha hills which the Danube has since
 cut through.     Capt. Spratt remarked that the lacustrine conditions
 of the great area in Eastern Europe and Asia Minor where he has
 indicated freshwater deposits were probably interfered with by
 volcanic outbursts, which opened a communication between the
 Euxine and Mediterranean, altering the levels of the region, causing
 the formation of the great gravel-beds at the foot of the Carpathians,
 and an outspreading of the brown marly superficial deposits of the
 Steppe, which are locally impregnated with mineral or marine salts,
 indicative either of the influx of the sea, or of mineral solutions set
 free by volcanic agencies.
    Capt. Spratt also described the older rocks, some probably of
Triassic age, and others Cretaceous, which are here conformably
overlain by the lacustrine deposits.       These he saw in the hills,
south of the Danube, near Tultcha and Beshtepeh ; also at the
 Raselm Lagoon, where Cretaceous shales and marble containing
Ceratites, &c. occur ; the latter at Popin Island.     At Dolashina, a
cape south of the Raselm Lagoon, the soft Cretaceous limestone is
full of small Inocerami.
    These indications of Secondary rocks are intimately connected
with those further south, at Cape Media and Kanara, formerly
described by the author.

Sienna, Palermo, and Malta (communicated by Prof. Ansted, Prof.
Meneghini, and the Marchese C. Strozzi, or supplied from the

  in eleven columns, were illustrative of the range of the respective
  species and varieties in different zones of sea-depth, from the shore
  to 1700 fathoms, and of the relative size of the individuals, and of
  their proportional paucity or abundance.          Among the seventeen
  columns of fossil Foraminifera, some were very rich in species and
  varieties, especially in the case of the Siennese clays, the Malaga
  clay, and the Vienna basin.      From the evidence afforded by the com
  parison of the fossil with the recent Foraminifera, the Siennese blue
  clays of S. Cerajolo, S. Donnino, S. Lazaro, and Coroncino were
  regarded as having been deposited in various depths of from 40 to
   100 fathoms ; so also the clay-beds of Malaga and of the Vienna
  basin.    A blue clay from S. Quirico was probably formed in about
  200 fathoms ; a blue clay from Pescajo, on the contrary, was the
  deposit of a shallow estuary.      A sand from Pienza, and others from
  Montipoli, Castel' Arquato, and San Frediano, contain Amphistegina,
  and were probably deposited in from 10 to 20 fathoms water.            As
  the Amphistegina appears now to be extinct as regards the Medi
  terranean, these Amphistegina-beds, and others at Palermo and in
  the Vienna Basin, may be of miocene age.        Another Siennese clay
  from Monti Arioso is of shallow-water formation.       From Turin some
  shelly sands, of pliocene age, were defined as containing a group of
  Foraminifera similar to those now living on the western shores of
  Italy ; and the Palermo deposits are, for the most part, not very
 dissimilar.    The Heterostegina-bed at Malta, formed probably in
 rather shallow water, is characterized by a species now absent from
 the Mediterranean.         The tertiary deposit from Baljik appears to
 have been a shallow-water deposit, characterized by some forms
 peculiar at the present day to the Red Sea, —a condition that is also
 indicated by some of the Viennese deposits.

      OPTICAL LECTURE-EXPERIMENTS.             BY PROF. KNOBLAUCH.
 T~\ID I not hope to furnish my colleagues with            a few welcome
          experiments for the lecture table, I should scarcely venture
 to occupy these pages with a communication which involves nothing
 but what has been long well known.
     Optical lenses have been so universally constructed of substances
 whose indices of refraction exceed that of the surrounding medium
 (such being alone useful in practice), that, accustomed to the pheno
 mena dependent thereupon, we unconsciously associate convergent
 effects with convex, and divergent ones with concave lenses.
     In order strikingly to illustrate by experiment the influence which
 here, under the same form of the limiting surfaces, the enclosed
 medium exerts, I introduce, in my lectures on experimental physics,
 experiments with hollow lenses so composed of plane glass discs and
watch-glasses, that the one forms a plano-convex, the other a plano
concave    lens*.
    * The radius of curvature here is about 116 millims. ; the
                                                                 aperture of
the setting has a diameter of about 64 millims.

    After filling both lenses with water, the first is used in a dark
room to obtain all the phenomena presented by the objective collec
tion, behind the lens, of all the luminous rays which pass through
the same : for instance, the principal focus is determined, and the
displacement of the same by the approach of a luminous point is
shown ; this displacement is continued until the rays leave the lens
in parallel directions, and subsequently the objective focus becomes
a virtual one.    When the luminous point is replaced by a luminous
object,   the convex  water-lens also presents the series of diminished,
equal,   and  magnified inverted images, and at sufficiently small di
stances of the object, the magnified uninverted virtual images.
    The concave water-lens presents in air the simple phenomena of
a diverging lens.     It serves to demonstrate that, for every distance
of the luminous point, the rays diverge on leaving the lens, that the
foci are in consequence all virtual ones, and that in all cases dimi
nished uninverted images are alone observed.
    If the media in question are now interchanged, that is to say, if
the lenses are filled with air and surrounded by water, the optical
phenomena, as may be easily seen, will be all reversed.
    The convex lens will become a diverging one with a virtual prin
 cipal focus, whose distance from the lens may be easily measured
 (according to Eisenlohr's method) by receiving upon a white screen
 the divergent solar rays proceeding from the lens in such a manner
 that the illuminated surface has a diameter double that of the lens.
 The distance of the screen from the lens will then be equal to the
 principal focal distance*. All objects (e. g. flame of a candle) behind
 the lens now appear diminished in the same manner as we usually
 find them to be with a concave glass lens.
    The concave air-lens, however, has now under water become a
 converging lens, whose principal focal length may be found by im
 mediately ascertaining the point of convergence of incident solar
 rays.    By means of a white screen immersed in the water, the course
 of the rays before and after convergence may be clearly followed, and
 the change of position of the focus, with changing distances of the
 luminous point, easily proved t. A piece of ground glass, protected
 from contact with the water by a second glass, is better than a non-
 transparent white screen for receiving the objective inverted images :
 for the screen can only be regarded from above, and the images upon
 it appear to be raised and distorted ; whilst the ground glass can be
 looked at from behind, whence the images appear both sharp and un-
  *   I  employ a similar method in catoptrics in order to measure the prin
cipal focal distance of a convex mirror. Thus between the mirror and the
sun, and perpendicular to the rays from the latter, is placed a screen in
which is a circular hole equal in magnitude to the portion of the mirror
required to be operated upon ; around the hole, and concentric with      it,   is
described      circle of double its diameter on the side of the screen facing
               a
the mirror. When the screen          so placed that the reflected rays exactly
                                    is
fill this circle, its distance from the mirror equal to the required distance
                                                 is
of the virtual focus.
 t     If were required to surround the luminous point with water, the
          it
•lectric light between coal-points might be used.

changed when the eyes are on the same level and look through the
transparent sides of the box containing the water*.                          After illus
trating  in  this manner      the   changing     magnitude        of   the   images, the
objective  foci  may   be  made    to  pass   into    virtual   ones,   and    the corre
sponding    uninverted    magnified     images    will    make    their    appearance.
   The agreement between convex lenses of water surrounded by air,
and concave lenses of air in water, maybe followed further by distin
guishing the central and circumferential rays.                   So long as the foci
remain objective,      the   circumferential        rays   intersect      nearer to the
lens than   the  central   ones,    but   further     from    it  when      the foci are
virtual.   With    the  concave     water-lens        surrounded       by air, and the
convex air-lens    in water,    the  foci  are  all   virtual,  and   those    of the cir
cumferential rays     are  always     nearer    to   the  lens   than    the   foci  of the
central rays.
   Although all this is easily explained by the simple laws of refrac
tion, it was always instructive and surprising to spectators to observe
how a mere change of medium converts a diverging lens into a burn
ing glass, and a microscope into a telescope.
   To complete the above experiments, the action of a concave lens
 may be destroyed by a convex one on placing one behind the other
in the water ; or           if,
                         instead of being all equal, the curvatures of the
lenses be properly adjusted,          Galilean telescope or

  The consequences     of the above phenomena of refraction, relative
to the phsenomena of reflexion which present themselves with water-
lenses in air and air-lenses in water, also hold good.
   These hollow lenses, too, serve to compare with each other the
several effects presented by differently refracting bodies, such as
water and clove-oil, with the same form of lens in different media. —

          XXII.   On certain Laws    of Chromatic Dispersion.
                   By Mungo Ponton, F.R.S.E.*
                      hitherto made to determine the laws of chro
THEmatic dispersion have generally proceeded
            attempts
                                                     on the principle
 of assuming a certain law, and endeavouring, on its basis, to con
 struct a universal formula, which shall render it possible, from
having given the refractive indices of two or three of the fixed
 lines of the spectrum for any medium, to find those of the
 remainder.     These attempts are known to have been attended
 with but imperfect success.
     It has accordingly been deemed expedient to adopt a different
 course, — to assume the indices of all the seven fixed lines for
 every refracting medium that has been examined, to be, as deter
mined by observation, nearly correct ; to analyse and compare
these indices with a view to discover the hidden law or laws
which they involve ; and, the general nature of these laws having
been thus brought to light, then to make on the observed indices
such corrections as may be required to bring them into strict
agreement with the laws so ascertained.          Thus, without assu
ming any one or more of the observed indices to be absolutely
accurate, as in the former method of proceeding, it may be found
possible so to correct each index as to obtain results harmo
nious in themselves, and all agreeing with determinate general
laws.     The following is a brief outline of the results to which
this method of research has led.
     The most general formula under which the law of chromatic
dispersion can be expressed is the following.        Let U represent

166                Mr. M. Ponton      on certain Laws
the length of undulation corresponding to a luminous wave that
should occupy the place of any one of the fixed lines of the
spectrum in the free aether, as determined by Fraunhofer's
method of transmitting a divergent beam through a system of
fine equidistant lines so as to obtain chromatic dispersion with
out refraction. Let /i be the refractive index of this undulation
in any medium.         Call — = u the length of the undulation within
the medium after refraction.          Then the relation between       U
and u may be expressed by the general formula                  a+x=u;
or conversely, e(w + a + x) = U.       Here the quantities e and a are
constant for the same medium and temperature, being the same
for all undulations.       The quantity x, again, which is compara
tively  minute,  is, peculiar to each wave, the medium and tempe
rature remaining the same. It is not, however, a mere irregular
fragment applied either to remove an excess or supply a defi
ciency, but it is subject to symmetrical laws to be hereafter ex
plained. Suffice it meanwhile to state that these variable quan
tities, represented by x, added to, or subtracted from each wave
length, constitute the irrationality of the spectrum.
    Save for these small quantities, every spectrum formed by a
refracting medium would present the same appearance as the
spectrum formed by transmitting a divergent beam through a
system of equidistant fine lines. The fixed lines of the spectrum,
whatever might be their actual distances, would preserve the
same relative mutual distances.        The above formula would thus
assume the yet simpler form     of — — a = u, or   e (u + a)
                                                             = U. There
                                    €
would then be no irrationality in the various spectra ; and the
constant relations of the fixed lines B, C, D, &c. to the same
lines when refracted, or to b, c, d, &c, would always be
          B-C —b—c,  .       C-D —c—d,. B-D              .
                                                       = b—d,
                                                              .
and so on.
    In every refracting medium, however, the fixed lines are more
or less extruded or thrust out of the places which they occupy in
the unrefracted spectrum, and their mutual distances are altered ;
so that the above relation no longer subsists.           This extrusion
constitutes the irrationality, and every medium accordingly pos
sesses an extrusive power besides its
                                             refractive and dispersive
powers.
    To study the laws by which these several powers are governed,
it is needful to separate the effects due to each, and especially, in
the first place, to eliminate the quantity x from the formula with

                           of Chromatic Dispersion.                                     167
a view to determine the constants e and a.      Seeing that, in the
absence of x, the difference between the wave-lengths correspond
ing to any two fixed lines before refraction, when divided by the
difference between those same two wave-lengths          within the
refracting medium, would always be equal to e, it follows that,
by taking the whole of the fractions which may be thus formed,
we shall obtain as many values of e as there are fractions ; and by
taking the average of all these, the effects produced on the value
of e by the variable quantity x will be mutually neutralized.
    Hence, by taking the sum of the 21 differences between the
wave-lengths corresponding to the seven fixed lines before re
fraction (or as they exist in the unrefracted spectrum), and
dividing them by the sum of their 21 differences within the
refracting medium, the quotient will be e. The wave-length
within the medium is found by dividing each normal wave
length by its own refractive index ; so that, u, being the index,
          B        C
we have — =b,      —=c, &c. In this manner the positive and
negative extrusions are made to neutralize each other.                              The pro
cess, however, may be shortened thus :
                (3B + 2C+D)-(F+2G + 3H)_
                 (3b + 2c+d)  {f+2c,+3h)-~e-
The numerator of this fraction is of course constant for all media,
and its denominator varies with the refractive indices.
  The constant e having been thus found, a may be easily de
termined   as   follows.       Call B + C + D + E + F + G + H = S, which
is of course constant.          Call b + c + d+e+ f+ g + h—s, which will

vary with the indices.             Then is —                = a, or               =a.
   The two constants e and a having been thus determined, if is
easy to find a second series &2, c2) rf2, &c, showing what the
wave-lengths within the medium would be, apart from their ex

168                  Mr. M. Ponton on certain Laws
and this having been accomplished, the mutual relations of these
extrusions, whether in the same or in different media, and the
laws by which they are governed, may be advantageously studied.
This is indeed the most important branch of the inquiry ; for
unless it can be shown that the extrusions follow some determi
nate law, the general formula becomes indefinite.
    A careful analysis and comparison of the extrusions of the
fixed lines in various media have brought to light the following
general principles and laws.
    The extrusive power of a medium may in every case be defined
to be " a property in virtue of which the medium transfers a
 small portion of motive energy from one part of the spectrum to
 another."
     The media hitherto examined may be distinguished into two
 great classes — Regular and Peculiar, the former being consider
 ably the larger of the two.       As all media, however, are greatly
 affected by temperature, it may sometimes happen that a medium
may be regular at one temperature and peculiar at another.
 These two classes shall be separately considered and described.
     The following is a list of all the regular media hitherto ex
 amined : —
 Solution of Nitrate of   Calcareous spar, both   Oil of  anise, temp. 20°
    bismuth.                rays.                    and 13°.
Water.                    Oil of sassafras.       Creosote.
 Sol. Subacetate of lead. Sol. Nitrate of lead.   Crown-glass.
 Sol. Nitrate of mercury. Sol. Muriate of am      Rock-salt.
 Sol. Sulphate of soda.     monia.                Arragonite, three axes.
 Sol. Muriate of baryta.  Nitric acid.            Quartz, both rays.
 Sol. Superacetateoflead. Sol. Muriate of lime.   Sulphuret of carbon.
 Sol. Nitrate of potash.  Sol. Potash.            Flint-glass.
 Sol. Sulphate of mag     Oil of turpentine.      Topaz, three axes.
    nesia.
     In all regular media the transfer of motive energy takes place
 from the terminal to the central parts of the spectrum ; and they
 are therefore medio-positive.      The undulations corresponding to
 the lines J), E, and F are always quickened by the extrusive force ;
consequently their wave-lengths within the medium are length
 ened.     Hence for these three the formula is always — — a + x = u.
 On the other hand, the undulations corresponding to the fixed
lines B, C, G, and H are always retarded, or their wave-lengths
within the medium are shortened.             Hence for these four the
formula is — — a— #=«.         In  every case the motive energy gained
by the one set of waves is exactly balanced by the loss sustained
by the others ; so that the sums of the positive and negative ex

                            of Chromatic Dispersion.                                    169
trusions being each denoted by X, these two quantities are always
equal, and 2X may be regarded as the measure of the extrusive
power of the medium.       This, which may be called " the law of
equal transference," is the first to be recognized ; and it is found
to prevail in all media whatever, whether regular or peculiar.
   From the above it follows that every regular medium presents
two nodal points, at which the extrusion passes from positive to
negative, or vice versd — the upper node lying between C and 1),
the lower between F and G.       At these nodes the extrusion is nil.
   The second law may in all regular media be expressed as fol
lows: 3bx+2cx— dx=3hx + 2gx— fx. It is proposed to call this
the " semel-bis-ter law."
   From these two laws may be deduced the following general
formula for expressing the extrusive power of a medium :
                            --(Q + «±2X)=0.
The two quantities K and Q have different values according                               as
the medium is regular or peculiar. In the former,
                   K=(B     + C +        G+H)-(D+E              + F),
and is constant for all regular media.                    In   these, also,
                    Q=      (6 + c   +g + h) ~{d+ e+f) j
so that the value of Q varies with the medium and temperature.
The alterations in the constitution of these two quantities pre
sented by peculiar media will be afterwards explained.
    The third law governing the extrusions is as follows : — If these
be taken in pairs equidistant from the centre ex) and if the differ
ence between bx and hx be denoted by                 8j,

by  Ss, and that between       and
                                 dx by              Sg,
                                          then the differences be

ing with the medium and temperature.        This        proposed toit   is
call "the law of the equicentral common difference."             The
varieties which this law presents are interesting     and         im;         it   is
portant, as furnishing the means of detecting and correcting
 slight errors of observation.
    There     is
              yet  fourth law, which may be termed " the law of
                   a
coincident nodes;" but for the understanding of its nature,                              a
little explanation    required.
                       is
    The series of internal wave-lengths bv c3> rf2, based on the
supposition of the medium being destitute of extrusive power,
having been calculated from the formula
                       B             .     C

170                    Mr. M. Ponton              on certain Laws
the series of refractive indices corresponding to it may be found
from the formula
and so on.    This series of indices, ^B, ^C, &c, is that which
the medium would present had it only a refractive and disper
sive, but no extrusive power.     The differences between the ob
served indices and this second series show what portion of the
former is due to the extrusive power of the medium.       The posi
tive and negative quantities do not here balance each other, as
in the case of the wave-lengths ; nor do they, like the extrusions,
exhibit any symmetrical arrangement ; but they present nodes
corresponding to those of the extrusions.      It might a priori be
expected that this correspondence would be quite exact.      It will
accordingly be found to be very nearly so in every case, taking
the indices as given by observation, or after having been subjected
to the corrections required by the third law ; and where the co
incidence is not perfect, the difference is generally traceable to
the defects of decimal calculation.      There can therefore be no
doubt of its being a general law that these two sets of nodes
ought exactly to correspond ; that                   is,
                                          the refractive indices of
the nodes, deduced from the extrusions, should precisely tally
with the nodes of the two sets of refractive indices.
   To exhibit this fourth law,       needful to determine the nodes
                                         it   is
of the wave-lengths and the nodes of the refractive indices.     To
find the nodes of the wave-lengths in regular medium       a    Let           :
cx be the extrusion of    and c,  the extrusion of

   When the corrections on the refractive indices, and the corre
sponding extrusions required                          by
                                      these laws, shall have been
made where necessary, there will be obtained         series of values     a
of these two sets of quantities perfectly self-harmonious, all the
errors arising from inaccuracy of observation having been made
to neutralize each other.    The resulting figures will be found to
agree so nearly with those obtained from observation, as to leave
not a  doubt of the real existence of the several laws which have
been thus ascertained, and of the accuracy of the method of in
vestigation pursued.
   So much for the regular media, which all present the foregoing
characteristics; and now for the •peculiar.     The only media yet
ascertained to fall under this class are the following eight — ¦                        :
     Alcohol.                                              Pyroligneous acid.
     Oil of cassia.                                        Muriatic acid.
     Oil of anise, T. 15°.                                 Solution of sodaV
     Muriate of zinc.                                      Sulphuric acid.
   The peculiarities presented                       by
                                     these media, as respects their
extrusive property, are of three  kinds  — 1st, an alteration in the

                                  ;
of the nodes, involving, as     consequence, both the other two
                                        a
peculiarities.
   Alcohol has its upper node between      and    its lower between
                                                            B           C,
P  and  G;    may therefore be termed high nodal.
               it                                        Oil of cassia
has its upper node in the usual place between         and D, but its      C
lower between      and H
                     G         may therefore be termed low nodal.
                                       ;
Oil of anise, at temp. 15°,     also low nodal; but at the other two
                                 is is it
temperatures   examined        regular.
                                 it        The muriate of zinc pre
sents two peculiarities.   It    like       is,
                                       alcohol, high nodal   but
                                                                                                  is is
                                                                                   ;         it
also medio-negative   that
                         ;     the transference of motive energy
                                      is,
from the central to the terminal parts of the spectrum, being
the reverse of what     observed in regular media.
                            is                          Its nodes are
between  B  and    and
                     C     andE     near F.     F,
   The remaining four present more than two nodes, thus invol
ving an oscillation of the transfer of motive energy.        Pyrolig
neous acid has three nodes — between                  and D,
                                                                        C,
                                            and             B     and   C               G

   172               Mr. M. Ponton on certain Laws
   H   near G, so that the first is the abnormal  node.   The transfer
   of energy takes place from C and H to B, D, E, F, and G.
      Muriatic acid has four nodes — between B and C, C and D,
   D and E, F and G, the transfer of energy being from B, D, G, H
  toC,E, F.
      Solution of soda presents also four nodes —between B and C,
   C and D, E and F, G and H. The transfer of energy is from
  BDEHtoCFG.
      Sulphuric acid has no less than five nodes — between B and C,
  D and E, E and F, F and G, G and H. The transfer of energy
  is from BEG to CDFH.                This medium has the smallest
  amount    of extrusive  power  of any yet examined.
      It would be well to have the observations on these eight media
  carefully repeated, in order to ascertain how far these peculiari
  ties, or any of them, may be due to serious errors of observation, —
- a supposition which will in the sequel be shown to be very highly
  probable.    At the same time it would be difficult to assign any
  reason why such peculiarities should not exist, or why all media
  whatever should conform to one uniform type.
     Meanwhile, assuming the observations to be nearly correct, it
  is needful to point out the changes which these several peculiari
  ties introduce into the laws before indicated.
     1st. The law of equal transference subsists unaltered.
     2nd. The semel-bis-ter law undergoes the following modifi
  cations.    The regular type being
                      3i, + 2c, -dx- 34, + 2gx-fx,
  it becomes in high nodal media,
                       3bx-2cx-dx=3hx+ 2g,-fx;
  in low nodal media,
                      3bx +  2cx-dx=3hx-2gx-fx       ;
  in pyroligneous acid,
                    -3b-   + 2cx-dx=3hx-2gx-fxi
  in muriatic acid,
                       3i, - 2c, + dx = 3h, + 2gx-fx ;
                                            - 2gx-f„ i
  in solution of soda,
                       3J„- 2c, +       U.
  in sulphuric acid,
                       36,-2c,-tf,= _3A,+25r,-/,.
   Hence the general expression for this law must be
                       ±36,±2c,±d,= ±Zhx±2gx±fx.
     3rd. As respects the law of the equicentral common difference,
  one general rule will suffice.     Where the pairs b„ and hx) c, and

                                 of Chromatic            Dispersion.                                          173
gx, dx and fx have like signs, as in regular media, their differences
are to be taken to form the three quantities Su                whose                         S2,   Bs,
three differences form the required progression.          But     the                                   if
members of any of the above pairs have unlike signs, then their
sum    isto be taken instead of their difference.     Thus        and                              if    bx
 hx stand on opposite sides of the account, we must take the sum
instead of the difference of this pair to constitute the quantity                                              81
                                                                                                                ;
and so with the others.
   4th. The law of coincident nodes        not affected     these pe
                                                             is                              by
culiarities, — the indices of the nodes, and the nodes of the indices
always coinciding very nearly, whatever may be the position or
number of the nodes.
   With respect to the general formula for expressing the extru-
sive power of       a    medium,         namely          ——    «   +   Q  + 2X =             0,    the con
stitution of the quantities                    K    and      materially modified
                                                             Q    is                                           by
these peculiarities.              As     a   general rule, all the fixed lines which
undergo positive extrusion are to be added together in one sum,
and all those negatively extruded into another, and the difference
between those two sums will be K.      Thus in high nodal media
we have
                     (C+D+E              + F)-(B                       H) = K2;
                                                           +
                                                           G
                                                           +
and    in low nodal,
                        (D    E      F   +    G)-(B +                    H) = K3;
                             +     +                           C
                                                               +
and so with the others.
   In like manner, those of the quantities         &c, which are         b,   c,   d,
positively extruded, are to be collected into one sum, and those
negatively extruded into another, and the difference between
those two sums will be Q.
                                                -
   Thus in high nodal media we shall have
                         (c  +   d+ +/)
                                     e              {b   +g    +   h)   = Qj  j
in low nodal,
                         (d+e+f+g)-{b                    + c   +   h)=Qa.
The alterations introduced                    by
                                an increase in the number of the
nodes will be easily understood from the above.
   The calculations from which the foregoing laws have been de
duced have been based on the relative normal wave-lengths for
the fixed lines, assuming that of                         B
                                       as unity, according to the
values given in the separate paper on that subject*. These values,

  174                Mr. M. Ponton    ore certain Laws
      From a considerable number of trials made with various sets
  of normals, it appears that any alteration on the above numbers,
  within the probable limits of error, would not affect the general
  character of the laws above indicated.
      From the foregoing investigation it follows that the refractive
  index deduced from observation for any of the fixed lines, is a
  somewhat complex quantity.        In the first place, each index in
  volves a certain fixed amount e, which is constant for waves of
  every length.     It is the common divisor by which the differences
  between the normal wave-lengths would have to be divided, in
  order to produce within the medium a set of wave-lengths which
  should present no extrusion of the fixed lines, but in which each
  line should occupy the same position in relation to the others as
  the normal lines occupy in the spectrum produced by transmit
  ting a divergent beam through a system of equidistant fine lines.
  This quantity e is always less than the observed refractive index ;
  so that it forms only a portion, yet by much the greater propor
  tion of its amount.      Had all the fixed lines this constant e as
  their common refractive index, the medium would then have
  refractive power without either dispersive or extrusive power.
  Although no single medium exhibits this peculiarity, it is pos
  sible by a combination of two or more substances to obtain a
 compound medium that shall present this condition, which is
 that of achromatic refraction. The preceding investigation, if
 followed out, may tend to facilitate the effecting of such com
 binations.
     As the purely refractive power of a medium is due simply to
 the state of compression of„the aether within its pores, the con
 stant e may be viewed as the measure of that compression, and
 may accordingly be termed the .compressive index of the medium,
 as distinct from the refractive index, which is a complex quan
 tity ; or it might be termed the optical elasticity of the medium,
 for it is at least a measure of that elasticity. In doubly-refract
 ing media the value of e differs considerably in the direction of
 the different optic axes of the same medium, thus showing the
 compressive power of the constituent molecules to be specific and
polarized.
     The variety in the refractive indices of the fixed lines in any
medium is due primarily to its dispersive power.          The effects of
this property, viewed apart from the extrusive power, are exhi
bited by the series of indices ^B, '''C, &c. obtained         from the
formulae         a=ug and — =«», in which only the normals and
the two constants e and a are involved.        The differences between
this series of indices and the constant e may accordingly be
viewed as the respective dispersive indices of the fixed lines in

                                 of Chromatic Dispersion.                                      175
the particular medium. The constant a may be termed "the
optical abstract," because it must be taken from the normal
wave-length corresponding to each of the fixed lines after it has
been divided by the constant e, in order to obtain the internal
wave-lengths            &2,
                  c2, &c.
   The quantity a       thus indicated as being portion of the
                                is                                         a
refracted wave-lengths, distinguishable from the main body, and
of the same magnitude for all waves.    But while      thus con                it   is
stant for the same medium and temperature, yet in comparing
one medium with another, the value of will depend on the cona
stant    and on
         e,        the sum of the internal wave-lengths jointly
                            s
for  S being the sum   of the normal wave-lengths, the value of                                   a ;
         --s
is        -
     — — —.            The constants         e   and   a   are thus mutually indepen
dent, inasmuch as               a   may be indefinitely altered without affecting
e,and vice versd.
   The product of these two constants, or ea, deducted from each
of the normal wave-lengths, will show the extent to which each
normal    shortened during its passage through the medium, in
              is
virtue of the dispersive power alone.     The actual loss of length
being represented by ae,       of the same magnitude for all waves
                                        is                                                        ;
but  itof course tells more on those waves which are primarily
shorter.   Henpe the numbers representing the loss of length
sustained by each wave in proportion to its primary length, from
the operation of the dispersive power of the medium alone, irre
spective of either its refractive or extrusive powers^ are in exact
inverse proportion to the primary wave-lengths.
   Thus, taking as an example the bisulphuret of carbon                                           (a
medium of high dispersive power), its constant           0-038772,             a   is
and ea   =  0*058953, which, being deducted from each normal
wave-length, gives as under                  :

Dividing these remainders by the normal wave-lengths, we obtain

 tion to its primary length, from the operation of the dispersive
 power of the medium alone ; and these are in inverse proportion
 to the primary wave-lengths.                 Thus also the proportion of the
 refractive indices corresponding to this temporary loss of wave
 length, must also have a certain dependence on the initial force
 which generated the particular wave to which the index belongs,
 and may be found by multiplying the indices ^Bj, T^, &c- (being
 the observed indices freed from the portion due to the extrusion)
 by the above complementary numbers, representing the loss of
 length sustained by the waves from the operation of the disper
 sive power.         Thus, in the case of the bisulphuret of carbon, the
 indices hBv MCj, &c. are
    ''Bj 1-615760,     ^C2 1-620667,     *DS 1-632958,     •'B, 1-647548,    fF3 1-659425,
          *GS 1-679311,      ''Hj 1-695681.
 These, multiplied by the above series of complementary numbers,
 give for the proportion of the indices due to the dispersive power,

       H0  1 75176,
 which numbers are identical with the differences between the
 above indices and the constant e= 1-520505.
     In different media, the loss of length sustained by any one
 wave through the action of the dispersive power is always pro
 portional to the constant a, which may be accordingly regarded
 as a measure of that loss.
    To generalization beyond this point, the uncompensated errors
 of observation and the yet unascertained effects of change of tem
 perature are a serious obstacle.               But the data already obtained
 may be found useful in detecting some of those errors and effects,
 and in determining their probable limits.
    As regards the effects of temperature, the most instructive
 cases are those of the oils of cassia and anise ; for of these we
 have observations at three different temperatures, though unfor
tunately these do not coincide in the two media.                             Comparing
the values of e in these two fluids for the three sets of observa
tions, they will be found as under :—
            Oil of Cassia.              Diff.             Oil of Anise.               Diff.

    It will be perceived that not only are these values of e in the
inverse order of the temperatures, but that their differences are
not far from being proportional to the differences of temperature.
To make them exactly so, they would have to be altered thus : —

    The above correction may be effected by an alteration of the
indices so small as to be of no account.
    This law, then, that the indices of elasticity of the sether in
the pores of any medium are in the inverse order of the tempe
ratures, and the differences of the indices are proportional to the
differences   of temperature, may be regarded              as rendered highly
probable by     these   two   cases,   being the   only   media  on which we
have observations at more than two temperatures, so as to illus
trate this point.
    The subsistence of this law in the case of oil of anise is all the
more remarkable, because the indices of all the fixed lines are there
greater in No. 2 (the intermediate temperature) than in either
No. 1 or No. 3, thus showing the absolute magnitudes of these
indices alone to be an imperfect criterion by which to judge of
the condition of the aether within the pores of the medium.                This
law thus removes an anomaly which would otherwise be presented
by the oil of anise, in which, were we to judge by the indices of
the fixed lines alone, we should be led to infer that, in passing
from temperature 13C-25 to temp. 15°'l, the enlargement of the
pores is attended by an increase in the tension of the sether, — a
result in the highest degree improbable.               The foregoing investi
gation shows that this is not the case, but that the tension of
the sether, as determined by the value of e, does actually dimi
nish with the enlargement of the pores, consequent on the rise
of temperature.
    This law is important in reference to the undulatory theory,
being exactly what it would lead us to expect ; and it confirms
the conclusion that the quantity e is the true index of the elas
ticity of the aether within the pores of the medium.
    On comparing together the two media — the oils of cassia and
anise— it will be perceived that in the former the rise of 12°*5 of
temperature, from temp. 10° to temp. 22°-5, gives on the value
of e a decrease of 0 008190 ; and in oil of anise, the rise of 70-65
from temp. 13°-25 to 20o,9 gives on e a decrease of 0 005030.
These two are so nearly proportional to each other, as to lead
to the inference that in two different media, in which the elas
ticity of the sether is nearly the same, the effects produced by
a given change of temperature are also nearly the same.
    From the foregoing, it appears that the effects of temperature
in altering the action of any medium on the light passing through
it are so considerable, as to render it highly desirable that obser
vations should be made on each medium at six or seven different

178                          Mr. M. Ponton                on certain Laws
temperatures, in order that these might operate as a check on
each other.
   It will be particularly noted that in each medium the con
stants e and a are independent of the absolute magnitudes of the
extrusions, and are affected only by the relations which these in
dividually bear to each other.   Hence, provided those relations
be preserved, the constants e and a will remain unaffected by any
alteration in the absolute magnitudes of the extrusions, which
may accordingly be multiplied by any multiple m, integral or
fractional, without altering e or a. These two quantities are
thus consistent with an indefinite number of sets of indices of
refraction, so that these last may always be altered in a certain
manner without affecting those constants.
   This point being kept in view, the following general formula
will be found applicable to all media whatever, namely,

dividing these by the indices of refraction. Selepting for this

It will   be observed that in this last series the extrusions have
changed their signs, and are greater in amount than with the
squares.      There must accordingly be an intermediate exponent
of the normals between 2 and 3, at which the extrusions will be
reduced to their lowest amount.            This exponent of least extru
sion will be found to be, for flint-glass No. 30, as nearly as pos
sible 2*2, with which the extrusions become
   B +0-000007,   C   -0 000009,  D -0-000010,   E +0 000004,   F +0  000024,
        G -0 000017,    H +0-000001,    S ±0-000036.
These values are so insignificant that they may be regarded as
arising from small errors of observation, and they may be entirely
thrown out of view in the calculation of the indices.            The follow
ing are     the differences between the indices       thus   calculated and
those given by observation : —
   B -0-000020,   C -0-000026,    D -0-000038,   E +0-000035,   F +0-000138,
        G -0-000130,    H +0-000007.
These differences are so small as to lie quite within the limits of
probable error in the observed indices.
    Now what is thus true of flint-glass No. 30, will be found to
hold good with respect to all other media.             Each has a specific
exponent of least extrusion, which is constant for the medium
and temperature.         The question thus arises, How is this expo

nent of least extrusion to be determined ? On a careful analysis
of all the media, it will be discovered that the value of this ex
ponent depends entirely on the proportion which the extrusive
property of the medium bears to its dispersive power at a given
temperature; in other words, it depends on the proportion
which the irrationality bears to the length of the spectrum, with
a given prism and at a given distance from the prism.      Repre
senting the dispersive power by the optical abstract a, and the
irrationality by the amount of the positive and negative extru-

sions   2X, and calling     —=P        the ratio which the extrusion bears
to the dispersion —representing also the exponent of least extru
sion by n, we have the following equation universally applicable,
  p
      , = constant.
n— 1
  The value of this constant,          as determined     from the best of the
observations, appears to be as nearly as possible 0'0092593*;
at least this value is sufficiently near the truth for all practical
purposes.     The reciprocal of this number is 10 8, which, added
to unity, gives ll-8 as the highest limit of these exponents, or
that which the medium would have if p were = 1, or 2X=a.
The lower limit of these exponents, being 1, obtains when a is
equal to the above constant, or a=0-009259 and 2X=0.
   As p is obtainable with tolerable correctness from any set of ob
servations which are approximately accurate, the exponent of least
extrusion may always be found from the equation 10'8p + l=n,
for any medium and temperature.       It is unnecessary, in estima
ting these exponents, to go beyond the first place of decimals,
which gives their value sufficiently near for the purposes of cal
culation.
   The exponents calculated from this equation for the various
media will be found specified in Table I.     From this specifica
tion the muriate of zinc is excluded, because it forms an excep
tion.   This circumstance, however, need not lessen confidence
in the correctness of the law ; for it only tends to confirm the
opinion expressed by the observer himself, that the indices which
he has given for this medium are so inaccurate, that no conclu
sion can be formed with respect to it till further observations be
made.
   The exponents of least extrusion having been thus ascertained
from the observed indices of refraction, the next step       meansis,   by
of the exponent, so to correct the indices as to reduce the extru
sions to zero — matter of easy accomplishment

XXIII.     On a Simple and Expeditions Method      of estimating Phos
   phoric Acid and its Compounds, which is particularly applicable
    to the Analysis of Phosphatic Manures and the Ashes of Plants.
    By Edmund W. Davy, M.B., M.R.I.A. fyc, Professor of
    Agriculture and Agricultural Chemistry to the Royal Dublin
    Society*.
           want of some             and expeditious   method of esti
THEmating phosphoricsimple    acid and its compounds    has long been
felt ; for though several means have been devised for the deter
mination of this acid under different circumstances, they are so
complicated and require so much time in their performance, that
they are quite unsuited for many cases where expedition is
particularly required.
    After much investigation       I  have succeeded in devising a
method which is very quickly performed, easy of execution, and
capable of affording extremely accurate results.        It is founded
on the fact that phosphoric acid possesses a great attraction for
the peroxide of iron, so that when a persalt of that metal is
added to a solution containing phosphoric acid, an insoluble
combination of the peroxide of iron with that acid is produced,
which under particular circumstances has the following com-

182      Prof. Davy on a Simple and Expeditious Method of
position, viz. (Fes 0s, PO5), in which 80 parts of the peroxide
containing 56 of metallic iron, are combined with 72 parts of
phosphoric acid.
    The fact of the peroxide of iron forming an insoluble com
pound with phosphoric acid has long been known ; and different
methods founded on it have been proposed and adopted for the
estimation of phosphoric acid and its compounds, — as, for ex
ample, those of Berthier,Kobell, and Raewsky, which are described
in different works on analytical chemistry.
    Each of those methods, however, requires a considerable
devotion of time, from the collecting, washing, drying, igniting,
weighing, and other operations through which the precipitated
phosphate of iron has to pass, which not only consume much
time, but, unless they are very carefully performed, lead to great
inaccuracies in the results obtained.
                         I          I
    In the modification propose, dispense altogether with those
tedious and troublesome operations, by simply adding a gra
duated solution of iron of known strength to the phosphate, and
ascertaining the point when sufficient iron has been added to
combine with all the phosphoric acid present; and from the
 quantity of iron employed,   I calculate the amount of that acid ;
every 56 parts of iron being equivalent to 72 of phosphoric
acid.
    The iron solution which   I use for this purpose is somewhat
 different from that hitherto employed.    I make it in the following
manner : a certain quantity of the finest pianoforte iron wire,
perfectly clean and free from rust, is dissolved in pure hydro
chloric acid, and sufficient nitric acid is afterwards added to
convert the so-formed protochloride into the perchloride of iron ;
and as any excess of hydrochloric acid would be injurious to the
process, and as it cannot be removed by heating the mixture and
evaporating it to dryness, which would decompose a portion of
 the perchloride, giving rise to peroxide of iron and hydrochloric
acid,   I   add caustic ammonia till all the free acid has combined
with that substance, and a small quantity of the peroxide of iron
precipitated by the alkali remains undissolved after agitating the
mixture and allowing it to stand for a few minutes. Acetic acid
is then added to dissolve the oxide, and when it has effected its
 complete solution (which it will do by leaving the Jftid to act on
the oxide at the ordinary temperature for a short time), the mix
 ture is largely diluted with distilled water and graduated in the
usual way, so that the amount of iron may be known which is
 contained in a given quantity of the liquid.       The proportions
 which    I  have used are 100 grains of iron in 1000 cubic centi
 metres of the liquid ; and this quantity of standard solution will
 suffice for a great number of determinations.

             estimating Phosphoric    Acid and its Compounds.            183
    This liquid, which contains the perchloride and peracetate of
iron, together with the chloride of ammonium, the acetate of
ammonia, and a little free acetic acid,          I find to be well adapted
for the estimation of phosphoric acid ; and as it appears from my
experiments that it may be kept for a considerable time without
undergoing any change, it is therefore preferable to the acetate
and other salts of iron hitherto employed, which, from their
proneness to decompose, require to be freshly prepared before
using them. Having made the standard solution of iron, the
next step is to prepare the phosphate, and if it is (as is ge
nerally the case) an insoluble one dissolved by an acid, am
monia is first added to the solution till it is distinctly alkaline
to turmeric paper*, then acetic acid to redissolve completely
the phosphate precipitated by the ammonia, and leave that acid
in slight excess ; and finally the standard solution of iron is
carefully added from a Mohr's alkalimeter, or any other con
venient form of volumetric apparatus f, till the iron begins to be
in slight excess.
    I  ascertain this point by taking out of the mixture (after it
has remained a few minutes with occasional stirring to effect the
complete combination of the oxide of iron with the phosphoric
acid) a drop of the solution on the end of a glass rod, and
touching with it a piece of thick and close-textured filtering
paper, under which is placed some ordinary filtering paper,
which has been previously saturated with a strong solution of
gallic acid, and then dried.
    By this arrangement we avoid filtering : the insoluble phos
phate of iron formed in the process being retained by the upper
         and the solution passing down to the lower, at once shows,
Eaper,
  y the light-purplish stain produced, the point when sufficient
iron has been added to combine with all the phosphoric acid
present, and a very minute excess exists in the mixture^.
    This experiment being repeated a second or third time, by
having the phosphate under examination dissolved in a given
quantity of solution and taking a certain amount of it for each
   * A   large excess of ammonia should be avoided, for by its afterwards
combining with the acetic acid to form the acetate of ammonia, which dis
solves to a slight extent the phosphate of iron, the amount of phosphoric
acid estimated in that case by this process is somewhat diminished.         A
large excess of acetic acid, however, appears to affect but very slightly the
results obtained.
   t  The form which     I have used and found most convenient is Mohr's
alkalimeter with the addition of Professor Erdmann's float, which affords
great facilities for the accurate reading of the volume of liquid employed.
   I  When the excess of iron added is very minute,     I have found that by
gently drying the wet spot on the gallic acid paper, the stain becomes
more visible.

184     Prof. Davy  on a  Simple and Expeditious Method of
determination, we ascertain the exact quantity of iron solution,
and therefore of iron, necessary to produce this effect ; and from
this we easily calculate the amount of phosphoric acid present
in the manner before explained.
    Though the ferrocyanide and the sulphocyanide of potassium
may be substituted for the gallic acid, using them in the way
I   have described for that acid, still I   have found gallic acid to
give more satisfactory results than either of them, and to be an
exceedingly sensitive test to the presence of iron in solution.
For   I found, by direct experiment with 2 cubic centimetres of
the iron solution containing 0'2 parts of a grain of iron, diluted
with distilled water so as to make up 300 cubic centimetres, that
one drop of this mixture let fall on the gallic acid paper, produced
a faint purplish stain, and the smallest drop which could be
taken up on the top of a glass rod gave with a solution of gallic
acid a very decided effect ; so that this test is one of great deli
cacy in ascertaining the point when the slightest excess of iron
has been added to the mixture in this method for the estimation
of phosphoric acid and the phosphates.           I may observe that
when the phosphate under examination is very largely diluted
with water, it will lead to more accurate results to reduce by
evaporation the bulk of the liquid (having previously added a
little hydrochloric acid in those cases where evaporation would
cause the precipitation of any insoluble phosphates), — the effect
of large dilution, by its rendering the gallic acid less sensitive to
the point when iron is in excess, being to indicate a somewhat
greater amount of phosphoric acid than is present.
    This source of inaccuracy might also in a great measure be
obviated by seeing how much of the iron solution was necessary
to give an indication of that metal when it was diluted with a
bulk of fluid equal to that employed in the experiment; and
this being deducted from the quantity of iron necessary in the
determination, would give a very close approximation to the real
amount required to combine with the phosphoric acid, where it
might be inconvenient and occupy too much time to evaporate
the liquid.
    Hitherto the estimation of phosphoric acid volumetrically by
the use of a standard solution of iron has been thought by many
to be impracticable, as the analyses of different chemists show that
the composition of phosphate of iron is subject to great variation.
    This, however, may be accounted for by the different circum
stances under which it has been formed by those experimenters,
which give rise to phosphates of different constitution.       But  I
entertain no doubt that, by always placing the oxide of iron and
the phosphoric acid under the same conditions, compounds of
the same constitution would in every case be formed.

            estimating Phosphoric      Acid and its Compounds.                  185
     Be this as it may, my experiments have clearly shown me that
under the conditions in which             I  place those substances, in the
method recommended for the estimation of phosphoric acid, a
compound having the composition (Fe203, PO5) is uniformly
produced.        I have proved this by taking certain quantities of
different phosphates and treating them in the manner described,
I   ascertained how much iron was necessary to combine with the
phosphoric acid present ; and in every case I have obtained re
sults which agree almost exactly with those I should have got,
calculating according to that formula, which would not have
been the case had the composition of the phosphate of iron been
different.
     The following are taken from among my experiments.                      Some
pyrophosphate       of magnesia     and    tribasic  phosphate of lime being
carefully prepared, a certain quantity of each was taken and dis
solved by the aid of heat in a little hydrochloric acid ; and the
solutions being diluted with distilled water, they were very care
fully graduated, so that 5 cubic centimetres should contain one
grain of each of those compounds.
     Common tribasic phosphate of soda was likewise taken, and
after being exposed to a red heat for some time to convert it into
the anhydrous pyrophosphate, a solution of it was also made, con
taining the same proportion of dry salt as in the former cases.
     Five cubic centimetres of each solution (containing one grain
of those compounds) were then taken and several estimations
made, employing the same quantity of solution every time, when
 the results obtained were as follows : —

  These results, agreeing so closely with those obtained by cal

of iron would have been very different from that obtained by

which would appear strongly to favour the first-mentioned hy
pothesis.
   Preliminary experiments upon the freshly precipitated chlo
ride of silver, as ordinarily prepared, having demonstrated the
difficulty of effecting more than a mere superficial decomposition
by exposure to sunlight, a process of preparation was adopted
whereby an exceedingly finely divided condition of the substance
was ensured, and its exposure conducted under circumstances
favourable to its thorough decomposition.          For this purpose
highly   dilute  solutions  were prepared, both   of nitrate of silver
and chloride of sodium, in proportions so adjusted that equal
bulks represented amounts of chlorine and of silver in the ratio
of their chemical equivalents.
   (5*85 grains of pure rock-salt, on the one hand, and 17 grains
of fused and neutral nitrate of silver, were dissolved each in
two gallons of pure distilled water.)
   When equal measures of these solutions were mixed in an
obscurely illuminated apartment, the white chloride of silver
was precipitated in a form so finely divided that an opalescence
only, without visible particles, was at first apparent.      By dif
fused daylight this became quickly darkened, and in the course
of time subsided into a very small purple-grey deposit.       But in
order to ensure full decomposition, it was the general practice to
employ the silver solution in excess and to add the salt water
under the full action of sunshine, the liquid being contained in
three, and sometimes four, pale glass flasks, each of nearly two
gallons capacity, which were placed on the roof of one of the
buildings in the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, and in such a posi
tion that the solar rays had uninterrupted access to their con
tents, almost from sunrise to sunset. Under favourable circum
stances it was then frequently impossible to observe the formation
of the white chloride of silver on mixing the two solutions, so
rapidly was it converted into the dark coloured product. At the
expiration of the day's action the small precipitate had become
completely darkened, and in the same time had subsided, so that
on the following morning the supernatant liquid could be drawn
off through a siphon, and a fresh charge introduced, the pro

 188             Mr.   J.  Spiller on the Composition   of
 duct being usually collected from the flasks at intervals of two
 or three days.
    In this manner, during the remarkably brilliant days in June
 and July 1857, no less than forty-six gallons of the standard
 solutions were submitted to treatment, and a comparatively con
 siderable quantity of the darkened material procured for in
 vestigation.
    The appearances presented during these trials were often such
 as to indicate a reduction more complete than that which would
 probably be required on the subchloride hypothesis : — first, a
 thin pellicle of high metallic lustre, white as silver, was usually
 seen floating on the surface of the liquid, and the internal walls
 of the flasks were frequently coated with a film much resembling
 the condition of silver reduced by any of the so-called
                                                                  " silver
ing" processes. The product also, although containing admixed
chloride, was susceptible of a high degree of lustre on being
burnished in an agate mortar.
    In colour the products of several experiments varied a little, —
 sometimes presenting a dark purple-grey appearance, at other
times the grey was slightly tinged with green ; and to this
depth of colour is probably attributable the circumstance that
sometimes, during exposure to the burning rays of a midsummer
sun, the contents of the flasks attained a degree of temperature
which should be recorded as a condition of experiment, although
such heat may not be supposed to have exercised any special
influence in determining an abnormal decomposition.                On the
24th of June, 1857, a hot sunny day with cloudless sky, the tem
perature of the dark liquids in three of the flasks reached 110°,
115°, and 116° Fahr. respectively; whilst at the same time,
3 p.m., a thermometer in the shade registered 83°, and only 91°
with the sun shining freely on the mercury in the bulb ; such
high degrees of temperature were, however, unusual and never
again observed.
    With a view    to counteract the possibility of the material
undergoing alteration by drying, it was constantly preserved
under water, and in the moist condition submitted to numerous
experiments for the purpose of ascertaining its constitution.
    On determining by chemical analysis the composition of an
average product, it was found to contain a larger proportion of
silver than the original white chloride, as will appear in the
following comparison : —

   A   substance having the composition specified in the second
column, cannot be referred to any probable formula, but would
appear to be composed of a mixture of silver with unaltered
chloride, in about the proportion that would result from the
destruction of two only in every seven parts of white chloride
submitted to the action of the sun's rays.          This, as already
stated, represents the extent of decomposition       on the average
product    ; but special experiments,  in which the nitrate of silver
was employed in greater excess, and the chloride solution un
usually dilute, enabled me to prepare, on the very brilliant day,
June 16th, 1857, a product containing more than 82 per cent,
of silver, and in which it might be assumed that one-third of the
total amount of white chloride operated upon had become re
duced to the metallic state.      In attempting to pass this stage,
the mechanical difficulty of the reduced silver particles encrusting
and offering protection to the undecomposed white chloride,
presents an obstacle which only extreme dilution and excessively
fine state of division seem likely to combat.
    In the application of the several chemical reagents by which
it was proposed to eliminate the portion of unaltered chloride in
admixture, and thus to isolate the essential matter which con
stituted the darker residual portion, it was found impossible to
arrive at any other conclusion than that of its consisting of pure
silver : throughout the examination no evidence was presented
which pointed to the existence of the so-called subchloride of
silver, or at least of its production under these circumstances ;
but, on the contrary, it appeared to be uniformly proved that the
metal, somewhat modified in colour and physical condition by
the varying circumstances of the experiment, was in every case
the product resulting from the action of light upon the chloride
of silver.
    The reactions more particularly examined were the following: —
    Ammonia dissolved out from the substance the whole of the
unaltered chloride (afterwards recovered in a white scaly form
by the evaporation of the solvent), while it left insoluble a
grey residue of metallic silver in which no chlorine could be
found.
    Cyanide of potassium solution dissolved away the chloride and
left metallic silver.
    Hyposulphite of soda, employed in the form both of concen
trated and dilute solutions, speedily dissolved out in the cold
the unchanged chloride, leaving a residue of grey metallic silver,
which contained neither oxygen, chlorine, nor sulphur.
    Iodide of potassium operated first in the conversion of the
chloride into yellow iodide of silver, which, on adding an excess
of the reagent, was entirely taken into solution. The grey

190              Mr.  J. Spiller on the Composition of
metallic residue, after repeatedly washing with dilute iodide of
potassium solution and finally with water, was found to consist
of silver without any admixture either of chlorine or iodine.
    Nitric acid in a cold and diluted form was inactive ; but more
concentrated acid effected the removal of the reduced silver by
converting it into nitrate (with evolution of red nitrous fumes),
 and left insoluble the white chloride of silver ; ammonia then
added dissolved completely this latter substance.
    On the other hand, the darkened product was reconverted
into its original white condition, with varying degrees of rapidity,
by treatment with chlorine-water, nitro-hydrochloric acid, the
brown solution of bichloride of manganese, and by a mixture of
hydrochloric acid and chlorate of potassa.       An acid solution of
the green    chloride of copper  had  also the power of reconverting,
 although more slowly, the darkened chloride into its primitive
 condition ; and a similar change appeared to be brought about
 by digesting in a cold saturated solution of chloride of mercury,
 but in this instance the conversion was attended with a reduc
 tion of the mercury salt to the state of subchloride, so that a
 black residue, derived from the calomel, remained on afterwards
attempting to dissolve the chloride of silver in ammonia.
    It was in the next place thought desirable to prepare for com
parison a sample of altered chloride which had not been so fully
acted upon by the light, and to restrict the excess of nitrate of
 silver employed, in order to ascertain whether at an earlier stage
 a more partial reduction, attended with the formation of an in
ferior chloride, could possibly occur.      On a cloudy day in Sep
tember 1857, a purple product was obtained, which differed from
the former samples by containing a much larger proportion of
unchanged chloride ; and in consequence of the more marked
physical change in the state of aggregation of the particles
 attending the removal of this larger quantity of unaltered matter,
the colour of the substance exhibited a more striking transition
from purple to grey on treatment with hyposulphite of soda and
other solvents already enumerated. Neither in this instance was
any chlorine detected in the insoluble residual portion, nor evi
dence furnished of its having been removed from a state of weak
chemical combination.
    It will be perceived that the results now recorded bear refer
ence to a series of experiments from which the interfering in
fluences of organic matter, and all other chemical agents, ex
cepting only water and the nitrates of silver and soda, have been
intentionally excluded.      The motive for such a course rests on
the belief that the full and accurate determination of the action
of light in its simplest phase must precede other considerations
likely to involve secondary and more complex reactions, which

                         the Photographic Image.                    191
will be better investigated after     a full knowledge of the first has
been acquired.
    The fact of chlorine being evolved during the decomposition
by solar agency of chloride of silver under water, has been repeat
edly observed and is fully corroborated by my own experiments.
 It follows, therefore, that if a solution of nitrate of silver be em
ployed in conjunction with the chloride, as in the ordinary prac
tice of photography, the evolved chlorine will exert its own
peculiar action on the silver solution in contact, precipitating
from it an additional amount of white chloride, which in turn
becomes, partially at least, decomposed by light.           It has been
 assumed that the whole of the nascent chlorine is thus available
                                                                 I
for the formation of new chloride of silver ; but this can, think,
 be true only if other matters are present having the power to
 decompose hypochlorous acid, a product always formed to the
amount of half that of the available chlorine, according to the
reaction first pointed out by Balard,
               Cl2 +  AgO, NOs= AgCl + CI 0 + NO5.
    It might then be predicted that, by exposing pure white chlo
 ride of silver under a solution of the nitrate of known strength,
this latter would become continually weakened.                 I
                                                          This find to
be the case ; and in the event of employing a dilute solution,
every trace of silver is removed, leaving only mixed nitric and
hypochlorous acids as residual products dissolved in the water.
It is possible also to remove the metal from a solution of nitrate
of lead, by exposure to sunlight in contact with recently pre-
    Again, inasmuch as the white chloride darkens with a rapidity
regulated by the energy with which the liberated chlorine is re
moved from its sphere of influence,        I  have been able to prove*
that reducing agents, the protochloride of tin especially, as also
certain alkaline solutions, greatly facilitate the decomposition ;
while the higher chlorides of platinum and mercury are known
to exert a power in the opposite direction.
    Several experiments were also made upon the chloride of silver
formed by the direct union of its elements — silver-leaf, electro
plated daguerreotype tablets, and the silver specula obtained on
collodionized glass by the ordinary photographic processes ;
these several conditions of silver, converted into chloride by the
action of chlorine gas, furnished products all of which suffered
decomposition on exposure to sunshine, but were very much less
speedily affected than the condition of precipitated chloride

News, October 1859.

usually employed in the practice of photography. The resulting
 darkened surfaces were found to be capable of restoration by
renewed exposure to gaseous chlorine. These experiments were
pursued no further, as they did not appear to present so close a
parallel to the ordinary application of chloride of silver as the
system of preparation already described.
     From a general examination of the products obtained by the
action of light upon several of the more definite compounds of
 silver, it appeared to me that the oxalate would be likely to pre
sent the most indubitable evidence of reduction to the metallic
state, and from its ready decomposability be well fitted for com
parison with the results afforded by the examination of the
altered chloride.    Some oxalate of silver was therefore prepared
by precipitation from nitrate of silver and oxalate of ammonia
 (the former|in slight excess), washed by decantation, and exposed
under pure distilled water to the direct rays of the sun.       The
white oxalate soon changed colour, becoming reddish brown,
and was seen to evolve small gas bubbles, which proved to be
carbonic acid by the water having now the property of precipi
tating basic acetate of lead, producing a milkiness easily soluble
in acetic acid. That silver was, on the other hand, the product
of reduction, became evident on repeating the experiment with
a more finely divided condition of the substance, and by re
moving the large proportion of unaltered material, which in this
instance also remained in admixture with the blackened parti
cles.    The same transition of colour from dark purple to grey,
attended the withdrawal of the undecomposed oxalate by dilute
hyposulphite of soda solution, and the metal was left in a state
of purity.     Hence the decomposition will be expressed by
                      AgO,C2Os=Ag        + 2C03.
    Passing in review the results obtained in the foregoing expe
riments, it will probably be considered that the weight of evi
dence tends to show that the metal is the ordinary product of
the chemical action of light upon chloride of silver ; and that
the principal difficulty which has stood in the way of accepting
this conclusion has in a great measure to be accounted for by the
often varying shades of colour presented by the reduced metal,
and more especially the transition observed at the moment of
removing the unaltered portion of material by the application of
the fixing agent.     If in these several stages the change in phy
sical condition be considered in its proper connexion, and due
allowance be made for the very important influence known to be
exercised over the light-reflecting capacity of these minutely
divided particles by very slight modifications in their state of
aggregation (quite irrespective of change in chemical constitu

    M. Foucault's discovery is mentioned in the course of a paper
 published in L'Institut of Feb. 7, 1849, having been brought
 forward at a meeting of the Philomathic Society on the 20th of
 January preceding.      In describing the result of a prismatic
 analysis of the voltaic arc formed between charcoal poles,
 M. Foucault writes as follows (p. 45) : —
    " Its spectrum is marked, as is known, in its whole extent by
 a multitude of irregularly grouped luminous lines ; but among
 these may be remarked a double line situated at the boundary
 of the yellow and orange.         As this double line recalled by its
form and situation the line D of the solar spectrum, I wished to
try if it corresponded to it ; and in default of instruments for
 measuring the angles,    I had recourse to a particular process.
      I
    " caused an image of the sun, formed by n converging lens,
to fall on the arc itself, which allowed me to observe at the same
time the electric and the solar spectrum superposed ;      I  convinced
 myself in this way that the double bright line of the arc coin
 cides exactly with the double dark line of the solar spectrum.
    " This process of investigation furnished me matter for some
 unexpected observations.       It proved to me in the first instance
 the extreme transparency of the arc, which occasions only a faint
 shadow in the solar light. It showed me that this arc, placed in
 the path of a beam of solar light, absorbs the rays D, so that the
above-mentioned line D of the solar light is considerably strength
 ened when the two spectra are exactly superposed.            When, on
the contrary, they jut out one beyond          the  other,  the  line D
appears darker than usual in the solar light, and stands out bright
in the electric spectrum, which allows one easily to judge of their
perfect coincidence.     Thus the arc presents us with a medium
which emits the rays D on its own account, and which at the
same time absorbs them when they come from another quarter.
    " To make the experiment in a manner still more decisive,          I
projected on the arc the reflected image of one of the charcoal
points, which, like all solid bodies in ignition, gives no lines ;
and under these circumstances the line D appeared to me as in
the solar spectrum."

dated Heidelberg, 20th of October, 1859, was brought before the
Berlin Academy on the 27th of that month, and is printed in
the Monatsbericht, p. 662.
     " On the occasion of an examination of the spectra of coloured
flames not yet published, conducted by Bunsen and myself in
common, by which it has become possible for us to recognize the
qualitative composition of complicated mixtures from the appear
ance of the spectrum of their blowpipe-flame,          I  made some ob
servations which disclose an unexpected explanation of the origin
of Fraunhofer's lines, and authorize conclusions therefrom re
specting the material constitution of the atmosphere of the sun,
and perhaps also of the brighter fixed stars.
     " Fraunhofer had remarked that in the spectrum of the flame
of a candle there appear two bright lines, which coincide with the
two dark lines D of the solar spectrum.           The same bright lines
are obtained of greater intensity from a flame into which some
common salt is put.       I   formed a solar spectrum by projection,
and allowed the solar rays concerned, before they fell on the slit,
to pass through a powerful salt-flame.           If   the sunlight were
sufficiently reduced, there appeared in place of the two dark
 lines D two bright lines ;     if,   on the other hand, its intensity
surpassed   a   certain limit, the two dark lines D    showed themselves
in much greater distinctness than without the employment of
the salt-flame.
     " The spectrum of the Drummond light contains, as general a
rule, the two bright lines of sodium,     if   the luminous spot of the
cylinder of lime has not long been exposed to the white heat           ;
if  the cylinder remains unmoved these lines become weaker, and
finally vanish altogether.     If   they have vanished, or only faintly
appear, an alcohol flame into which salt has been put, and which
is  placed between the cylinder of lime and the slit, causes two dark
lines of remarkable sharpness and fineness, which in that respect
agree with the lines  D    of the solar spectrum, to show themselves in
their stead Thus the lines     D    of the solar spectrum are artificially
evoked    ina   spectrum in which naturally they are not present.

defined line, which lies midway between Fraunhofer's lines             B

fall through the flame on the slit, the line at the place pointed

of sunlight there appears in its place        dark line, which has quite

     " I concludefrom these observations, that coloured flames in the
 spectra  of which bright sharp lines present themselves, so weaken
 rays of the colour of these lines, when such rays pass through
 the flames, that in place of the bright lines dark ones appear
 as soon as there is brought behind the flame a source of light of
 sufficient intensity, in the spectrum of which these lines are
 otherwise wanting.     I conclude further, that the dark lines of
the solar spectrum which are not evoked by the atmosphere of the
 earth, exist in consequence of the presence, in the incandescent
atmosphere of the sun, of those substances which in the spectrum
of a flame produce bright lines at the same place. We may
 assume that the bright lines agreeing with D in the spectrum of
a flame always arise from sodium contained in it ; the dark line
D in the solar spectrum allows us, therefore, to conclude that
there exists sodium in the sun's atmosphere.           Brewster has
found bright lines in the spectrum of the flame of saltpeter at
the place of Fraunhofer's lines A, a, B ; these lines point to the
existence of potassium in the sun's atmosphere.        From my ob
servation, according to which no dark line in the solar spectrum
answers to the red line of lithium, it would follow with proba
bility that in the atmosphere of the sun lithium is either absent,
or is present in comparatively small quantity.
    "The examination of the spectra of coloured flames has
accordingly acquired a new and high interest;           I
                                                        will carry it
out in conjunction with Bunsen as far as our means allow.          In
connexion therewith we will investigate the weakening of rays of
light in flames that has been established by my observations.
In the course of the experiments which have at present been insti
tuted by us in this direction, a fact has already shown itself
which seems to us to be of great importance.        The Drummond
light requires, in order that the lines D should come out in it
dark, a salt-flame of lower temperature.       The flame of alcohol
containing water is fitted for this, but the flame of Bunsen's gas-
lamp is not. With the latter the smallest mixture of common
salt, as soon as it makes itself generally perceptible, causes the
bright lines of sodium to show themselves.       We reserve to our
selves to develope the consequences which may be connected with
this fact."
   Note. — The remarkable phenomenon discovered by Foucault,
and rediscovered and extended by Kirchhoff, that a body may be
at the same time a source of light giving out rays of a definite
refrangibility, and an absorbing medium extinguishing rays of
that same refrangibility which traverse   seems readily to admit

   We know that        a stretched  string which on being struck gives
out a certain note (suppose its fundamental note) is capable of
being thrown into the same state of vibration by aerial vibra
tions corresponding to the same note.             Suppose now a portion
of space to contain a great number of such stretched strings,
forming thus the analogue of a medium."
                                        "                It is evident that
such a medium on being agitated would give out the note above
mentioned, while on the other hand, if that note were sounded
in air at a distance, the incident vibrations would throw the
strings into vibration, and consequently would themselves be
gradually extinguished, since otherwise there would be a creation
of vis viva.     The optical application of this illustration is too
obvious to need comment. — G. G. S.

The process used in the text is a modification of Newton's, arrived at thus ;
Let X and Y be of the mth and nth degrees in the quantity to be elimi

   t A and B (which I call respectively v and u in the ' Diary ') are known

200               Mr.   J.   Cockle on the Theory             of Equations
have inferred that it is (arts. 58, 59).    The presumption is now
rebutted.   But since d5 replaces d in the formulae, we have to
inquire  whether S45 be a rational function of 3,*.
                                                           it be, then,           If
since every root of a rational  equation is  a rational function  of its
own square (for the equation may be written a?<£(#2) +^(;ra)=0),
we see that 045 must be a rational function of 0f, and 0410 of 0™.
Consequently each of the expressions
     exbe*+e*eb?+6>e£>       and 0l^etw+0ilo0em+eav>06w
must be a symmetric (and indeed rational) function of the roots
of the given quintic. Hence it is readily seen that the cubic
whose roots are the above three values of 0*m 0„ will have all its
coefficients symmetric in w, and therefore invariable under all
interchanges of the x's.    It would follow that 0m      has only                      0),
three values   and;that for  some one value  (at least) of  and                              r         s
we have                  01=0),
an inadmissible result.
  87. The same difficulty presents      itself in another shape.
Since all functions of the above form are invariable under inter
changes of the x's, the doctrine of similar functions shows that
the second coefficient of the cubic could only be determined                                           by
the solution of     quintic, even
                        a           the first were known.
                                                    if        But
inasmuch as one of the most distinguished of writers on the
theory of equations has recently repeated the expression of                                            a
belief, formed many years ago, that the general quintic    soluble                           is

to / be so assigned that x6 may disappear from r„ in other words
that  rx{x^ may be a symmetric function, say r,(0), of x. We
may form the cubic
                 V3-7-1(0)V2 + r8K)V-r3(a;5)=0,
the roots of which will be the above three values of V.
   89. If xs does not disappear from r% and r3, the determination
of those functions depends upon the solution of a quintic, and
cannot be attained.      If it  does disappear, the cubic becomes
                 V3-ri(0)V2 + r2(0)V-r3(0) =0.
   90.   In the latter case, since r(0) is not affected by any inter
change of the x's, of the fifteen values of V?j r three only will be
distinct.   But (art. 62) this involves the relation
                              V     =V
which is equivalent, for some finite value of n, to
   91. But no such relation exists among the roots of the sextic
in 0, and no such cubic can be formed the coefficients of which
shall be symmetric functions of x ; and since the 3 of Mr. Jer-
rard and my 0 are similar functions (fonctions semblables), I am
constrained to conclude that the supposed cubic of that eminent
algebraist cannot be formed, and that the supposition that the
general quintic is soluble by an Abelian sextic involves the untenable
supposition that the sextic in 0 has equal roots, or roots some inte
gral powers of which are equal.
   92. In perfect accordance with this conclusion is that dedu-
cible from the symmetric product, ir{0), of the sextic in 0. We
find, by substitution in the formula which       I have already* given,
that
                   tt(0) = £(108Q5-E3)2(510E)2,
and that when it vanishes and cubic radicals appear, the sextic
and the given quintic have each equal roots.
   93. So, too, although      I  have succeeded in obtaining unsym-
metric functions of 0 which are symmetric in x, and therefore
known, the doctrine of similar functions shows that these known
quantities can only be applied to the solution of the sextic through
the medium of a quintic.

at all events verified, by a process resembling that employed in

perfect. The error of Mr. Jerrard inheres, in my opinion, in his
mode of comparing the equations (ab) and (ac) at pages 80 and
81 of his most valuable    Essay/ His functions jH, aS, 3B, and

eliminating radicalities. They lead to no other result than that

is soluble by radicals.
    97. The present discussion, then, seems to me to establish
the insufficiency of two proposed methods of solving equations of
the fifth degree, or rather equations in general, and to add to
the moral evidence of the impossibility of the solution. Perhaps
the want of universal assent to the argument of Abel may in
some degree be owing to the want of uniformity in the views
taken by Abel himself, by Sir W. R. Hamilton, by M. Kronecker,
and by Galois, and it is unquestionably desirable that that argu
                                            I
ment should be simplified. But do not think that M. Wantzel's
modification of it meets the desire.                 The formulae in his second

That n=3, X=l, p=l cannot,                      I   think, be inferred without
previously showing that the only prime power of an unsymme-
tric function which can have two values only is a cube, and we
are once more remitted to the arguments of Abel and Sir W. R.
Hamilton. W. Wantzel's third step, too*, seems open to objec
tion.     Perhaps the impossibility of cubic radicals entering into
the root may afford the basis of the desired simplification.

 XXVII.      On  the  Equilibrium    and Motion      of Liquids in Porous
                      Bodies.   By M.    J.  Jamin*.
           function performed by vegetables, which consists in the
 THEraising       of water through their tissues to their leaves, has
 never yet been explained.        This effect, however, must either be
 due to the play of special organs analogous to the human heart,
 or it must be determined by the exercise of molecular forces and
 gravity in the ligneous body.        If the first hypothesis were true,
physiology would, in all probability, have detected at least the
 existence of the supposed organs; from its silence, therefore,
 we are led to conclude their non-existence.          On the other hand,
 if the second hypothesis holds good, the question enters the
 domain of general physics, and may with justice be studied ex
 perimentally with a view of imitating artificially this function of
vegetables.
    Regarding     the problem from the latter point           of view, M.
Jamin announces having arrived at          a  plausible solution. In this,
 his first communication, however, the author occupies himself
 solely with certain preliminary phsenomena of capillarity in tubes
and porous bodies; he proposes subsequently to apply the
principles he here establishes and to describe an apparatus, ex
clusively composed of inorganic substances, which in its struc
ture presents a striking analogy to that of vegetables, and which
possesses the property of raising water, as trees do, to a height
greater than that of the atmosphere between a moist soil, from
which this water is continually drawn, and the artificial leaves
where the water is continually evaporated.             The conclusion he
announces is that capillary forces suffice to explain the motion
of the sap in vegetables.
    A capillary tube being taken, one of its extremities is put
in communication with a vacuum ; by so doing a current of air is
established within the tube from the atmosphere to the vacuum.
If then the finger, covered with wet linen, be alternately pressed
against, and lifted from the free extremity of the tube, the opera
tion being frequently repeated at very short intervals, columns
of liquid separated by bubbles of air will traverse the tube with
a velocity which, from being very great at first, will diminish as
the operation proceeds, and finally become zero. A chaplet whose
beads are air and water is thus obtained, and the apparatus thus
prepared is found to possess peculiar properties.
   When a pressure is exerted at one extremity the nearest beads
recede quickly, the following ones are less displaced, and the
more distant ones remain unmoved.              By doubling the pressure
twice as many beads are put in motion ; or, more generally, the
              * From the Comptes Rendus, January 23, 1860.

 On   the Equilibrium and Motion of Liquids in Porous Bodies.     205
 number of beads to which motion is imparted is proportional to
 the magnitude of the pressure applied.      Consequently the oppo
 site extremity of the column only begins to be displaced when
 the difference between the pressures acting at its two extremities
 reaches a limit proportional to the number of beads in the
 column ; and if this number be increased indefinitely, the limit
in question will also be indefinitely increased.    In this manner
 a pressure of three atmospheres, acting incessantly for fifteen
 days at the extremity of a very fine tube containing a great
 number of beads, failed to produce the least visible displacement
 of the liquid.
    Inversely, when a partial vacuum is produced at one end of
 the tube the nearest bubbles of air dilate greatly, the interme
 diate ones less, and those furthest distant remain unaffected so
long as the diminution of pressure does not exceed a limit pro
portional to the number of bubbles or beads. To make the ex
 periment, a very long tube containing a great number of beads
 may be cemented into the upper part of a barometer-tube.         The
 mercury will then maintain precisely the same position as it
would do if the tube were perfectly closed.
    This experiment shows that the pressure exerted at one ex
tremity diminishes abruptly by a constant quantity at each place
where the continuity of the column of liquid is interrupted ; and
this fact may be easily explained.
    For it is probable that the first effect of the pressure H' is to
alter the form of the nearest bead of liquid, by hollowing out its
anterior surface and increasing the radius of curvature of the
meniscus which bounds its posterior surface.      A portion, L, of the
pressure being thus expended in the deformation of the first
bead, a deformation which cannot exceed a certain limit, and
which is the same for all the beads, the residual pressure H'— L
is transmitted by it to the next succeeding air-bubble, and thus
to the second bead, which, in becoming similarly deformed, again
diminishes the pressure by the same amount as before.            This
action continues until the originally applied pressure has, by n
equal, successive decrements, one at each bead, become reduced
to H'— »L=H, the normal pressure in the tube, when, of
course, equilibrium results.
    By generalizing this idea, it is easy to show that the chaplet
may assume an infinite number of states of equilibrium, whose
conditions may be calculated ; and experiment is found to verify
the results of calculation.
    It will be at once seen that these properties must considerably
modify the ascent of liquids in capillary tubes.        There are in
fact two cases to be distinguished.
    First. After raising the tube in the liquid in which one end is

 206      On the Equilibrium and Motion    of Liquids in Porous  Bodies.
 immersed, and allowing the column of raised liquid to descend
  to its position of equilibrium, the length of the raised column is
  a + nL, and consequently      greater the greater the number n of
 interruptions ; this length may increase indefinitely.
     In the case where the weight of each bead is equal to L, they
 are individually in equilibrium, and a column of indefinite
 height, interrupted only by very small bubbles, and everywhere
 at the atmospheric pressure, may be sustained.
     Secondly. When the tube is depressed in the bath, and the
 liquid allowed to rise to its position of equilibrium, the length of
 the raised column is diminished in proportion to the number of
 bubbles, and becomes a—?iL; it is always less than if the column
 were continuous, and it may become negative and decrease inde
 finitely.
     In  accordance with theory, experiment also proves that when
 once a column of liquid, whose length is between the limits a + nh
 and a— nL, has been placed in the tube it will remain there.
 Some experiments were also made with a view of measuring the
 limit L of the resistance which a single bead can oppose to the
 pressure.      It was found that this limit is independent of the
 length of the bead, but that it increases when the bubbles of air
 diminish ; it increases, too, very rapidly when the diameter of
 the tube is diminished, and is equivalent to 54 millims. in a tube
 where the capillary ascension amounts to 200 millims.          In such
 a tube, therefore, four interruptions are equivalent to the capillary
 force, and may annul the latter when the liquid rises, or double
 the height of the sustained column when the liquid descends.
 Mercury produces effects much more intense, but alcohol and
 oil oppose no resistance to pressure.
    When a capillary tube, instead of being cylindrical, possesses
 successive contractions and expansions, it exhibits still more
 curious properties.      After being once moistened, the thin film
 of liquid which remains adhering to its walls soon collects at the
 contractions, and there forms interrupted beads.          Here then a
 chaplet   is formed,  as it were, spontaneously,  and  in consequence
 of the nature of the canal, the above-mentioned properties of a
 cylindrical tube become exaggerated in a surprising manner. A
tube with eight very narrow contractions sufficed to close a baro
meter-tube hermetically, and even to overcome a pressure of two
atmospheres.
    If  pressure be applied to one extremity of such a tube, filled
with water, the latter overflows (filtre) without difficulty j but if
this pressure is exerted on a compressed gas, the latter replaces
the water in each successive chamber, and leaves a bead of liquid
at each contraction ; these beads, by opposing a resistance which
increases with their number, finally destroy the pressure.

              MM.   Deville and Troost on Vapour densities.         207
      Inversely, when the tube is full of air and a column of water
is forced into it by pressure, it fills the several chambers suc
cessively, destroys the beads, and annuls their resistance ; finally,
it fills the whole tube and commences to overflow.
      These consequences may be applied to porous bodies in which
 we may assume the existence of canals alternately narrow and
 broad.      When a porous vessel, such as is used in the battery,
 or an alcarraza, or a plaster statuette, or any other cavity formed
 in a porous mass is filled with water, any pressure exerted upon
 this water causes the same to filter through the mass ; on the
 other hand, however, a perfect vacuum may be formed in the
 interior, atmospheric air being incapable of penetrating through
 the walls when moistened.
       When both surfaces are immersed in water, and a pressure is
 exerted in the interior by means of compressed air, the latter, in
 the first place, expels all the water ; but when this is accomplished,
  the air does not filter through the walls : the pressure, indeed,
  may be increased to two, three, and in some cases even to four
  atmospheres without causing the least air-bubble to traverse the
  porous sides ; and this pressure, too, may be maintained for an
  indefinite period, exactly as if the sides of the vessel were not
  traversed by capillary fissures.

 very accurate relation between the densities of the two vapours,
 the density of one of which is perfectly well established.
    The results arrived at were as follows : —
    Sulphur. — The vapour-density of this substance at 860° is 2-2.
 For the temperature 1040° the same number was also obtained
 in twelve successive experiments.        Previous determinations of
 other experimenters had furnished the number 6*6, which gave for
 sulphur an atomic value ^ that of oxygen, phosphorus, &c.
 Various explanations have been offered to explain this anomaly,
 which is removed by Deville and Troost's observations.
    Selenium. — Its vapour-density at 860° is 8"2 ; at 1040° it is
 6'37.    Theory and analogy with sulphur require the number
 5*44.    By making the determination at 12° to 1400° C, the
 authors hope to obtain this number.
    Phosphorus. — Vapour-density at 1040°, 4 8. Calculated, 4-4.
    Cadmium. — At 1040° the vapour-density is 3-94.            For a
condensation to two volumes the number 3*87 is required.
    Chloride of Ammonium. — At 1040° the observed vapour-density
was l'Ol.      For a condensation to eight volumes the number
3 87 is required.
   Bromide of Aluminium. — Vapour-density            18 62.   Theory
requires   18-51.
   Iodide of Aluminium. — The observed vapour-density was 27'0.
The number required by theory is 27*8.
   Bineau has also published* some determinations of the densities
of superheated vapours, executed upwards of ten years ago.
The experiments were made in tubes placed in a sort of cylin
drical iron case, from which the finely drawn out extremities of
the tubes projected.     The capacity of each tube was determined
before the experiment.      The tubes were sealed by means of an
oxyhydrogen flame. The tubes were covered with an argillaceous
lute, and were surrounded by sand, or iron filings.      The cylinder
was placed horizontally on a grate, and heated as regularly as
possible ; the temperature was determined by means of an air-
thermometer; and in order to test the method, a control deter
mination of the density of mercury was made.             It gave the
number 6*7, which agrees well with 6'97, the number obtained
by Dumas, and 6*91, the calculated number. A control deter
mination of the density of iodine gave the number 8*65.       Dumas
obtained 8 716, and the calculated number is 8-8.
   The numbers obtained for the density of sulphur vapour varied
in nine experiments between 2'1 and 2-8. These experiments
may be divided into two groups ; in one of these the temperature
was below 800°, and the numbers were —

    At 450° to    500°, Dumas obtained the number 6*56, and
Mitscherlich 6*9. Bineau assigns to sulphur vapour at 600° the
density 5 ; at 700°, 2-8 ; and at 800°-1000° the density 2-2,
which is the number obtained by Deville and Troost.
    Berthelot has published* a detailed account of a series of
experiments, preliminary notices of which have already appeared,
in which he shows that cholesterine, meconine, and Borneo
 camphor belong to the class of alcohols.          He considers an al
cohol to be a neutral substance, consisting of carbon, hydrogen,
 and oxygen, which unites directly with acids, under elimination
 of water, to form a neutral compound, which by assimilation of
 the elements of water is again resolved into the substances of
 which it was composed.
    The neutral ethers of the above substances are obtained by
 heating them with acids, in sealed tubes, for several hours, to a
 temperature of 200°, and then purifying the resultant substance
 by appropriate methods.
    Cholesterine is considered by Berthelot to have the formula
 C52 H44 O2, and to belong to the series of alcohols whose general
 formula is C" HB-802, and to which cinnamic alcohol, C18 H10 O2,
 belongs.     Cholesterine forms compounds with stearic, butyric,
 and acetic acids, as also with hydrochloric and benzoic acids.
 The stearic acid compound, C52 H43 0, C36 H35 03, is a white body
 crystallizing in small brilliant needles.        It melts at 65° to a
 colourless liquid which solidifies to a dull, uncrystalline waxy
 mass.
    With spermaceti, which has long been recognized           as an alcohol,
 Berthelot has prepared      the stearic, butyric, acetic, and benzoic
 compounds.       With the exception of the benzoate, they are
 difficult to obtain pure.

   Meconine,   C^WO8, also forms                    an ether when heated with
stearic acid.   It is a neutral, solid,            colourless substance, and is
readily fusible. It has the formula                C92 H78 O12 ; and its forma

   Borneo camphor, C20 H18 O2, according to Berthelot, stands in
the same relation to ordinary camphor, C*° H16 O2, as benzylic
alcohol, C14 H8 O4, does to hydride of benzoyle, C14 H6 Oa. Ordi
nary camphor is an aldehyde ; it does not combine with acids ;
when it is heated with potash in a sealed tube for a long time
at the temperature 180°, it is resolved, though with difficulty,
into borneole (Borneo camphor) and a new acid, camphic acid,
which probably has the formula C20 H18 O4. The decomposition
would be thus expressed :

   The artificial Borneo camphor, or camphole, has all the pro
perties of the natural substance, excepting that it deviates the
plane of polarization more strongly,       Camphole combines with
hydrochloric acid at 100° and with organic acids at about 200°.
The stearate is a neutral, viscous, colourless, inodorous oil which
sometimes crystallizes. The hydrochlorate, C20 H17 CI, has all the
physical properties of the substance isomeric with           produced           it,
by the combination of hydrochloric acid with oil of turpentine,
and known as " artificial camphor."         Unlike this compound,

   Berthelot also examined the action of organic acids at a high
temperature on orcine, thymole, alizarine, and the hydrates of
oil of turpentine.   AH these substances, with the exception of
orcine, contain 20 equivs. of carbon.  Orcine, C14 H8 O4, appears
to form a compound with stearic acid.      The experiments with
the other substances led to no positive results.
   Vulpic acid, one of the lichen acids first isolated, and found in
the Cetraria vulpina, was so little known that its identity as a
distinct acid was doubted.       Moller and Strecker* have recently
investigated      and have arrived at some very interesting results.

     Alphatoluylic acid is oxidized, but with difficulty, with forma
  tion of hydride of benzoyle.        Strecker and Moller have prepared
 the chloride, the amide, and the nitro-compound of this acid.
 They represent its formation from vulpic acid in the following
  manner : —

 If, in  the decomposition       of vulpic acid, potash be used instead
 of baryta, other products occur.           Methylic alcohol distils over ;
 and when the residue is supersaturated with hydrochloric acid,
 carbonic acid is disengaged in abundance and a crystalline pre
 cipitate formed.       This is a new acid, which, when recrystallized
 from boiling alcohol, appears in the form of rhombic prisms. The
 crystals are brittle, but tolerably hard ; they melt at 154° ; they
 are difficultly soluble in water, but readily so in alcohol.           The
 formula of this acid is C3S Hl606 j and the authors name it oxa-
 toluylic acid.     The baryta-, silver-, and lead-salts are all crystal
lized, and are monobasic. Oxatoluylic ether, C82 H15 (C4 H5) 06,
is best obtained by the action of iodide of ethyle on the silver-
 salt.   It forms colourless prismatic crystals, which melt at
45°*5.     By the action of nitric acid on the acid, a nitro-compound
is formed.       The formation of oxatoluylic acid is as follows : —
     Vulpic acid    .

     When boiled with strong potash, oxatoluylic acid readily un
dergoes a further change ; it becomes converted into oxalic acid
and toluole.       From this deportment it appears to have received
its name.      The decomposition may be thus expressed : —
              C32   Hlfi 06 + 2 HO = C4 H2 O8 + 2 C14 H8.
           Oxatoluylic acid.          Oxalic acid.    Toluole.
The difference in the decomposition of vulpic acid by potash and
by baryta is remarkable as snowing a great mobility of the atoms.
It appears probable that the insolubility of oxalate of baryta is
the determining moment in the first reaction, as is frequently
observed in double decompositions of salts.
    Salicylic acid, C14 H6 O6, has been considered by Kolbe to have
a  constitution analogous to that of carbovinic acid; in short, to

This view is supported by the well-known fact that salicylic acid
decomposes, when heated with powdered glass, into phenylic
alcohol and carbonic acid.
   Kolbe and Lautemann* have recently effected the synthesis
of this acid from phenylic alcohol and carbonic acid.   It is not
formed when carbonic acid is passed into sodium-phenylic
alcohol, C12H5Na09; but when carbonic acid is passed into
phenylic alcohol while sodium is being dissolved in    the three    it,
bodies unite with liberation of hydrogen to form salicylate of
soda.   On neutralizing this product with hydrochloric acid, and
boiling with water to expel excess of phenylic alcohol, salicylic
acid pure and in tolerable quantity   obtained.is

hydrate of cresyle and hydrate of thymole the corresponding
acids, and from bisulphide of carbon and hydrated oxide of phe-

it  exists along with guanine.       The pancreas contains about
0*0166 per cent, of xanthine, and         01223 of guanine. It

contains 0-003 per cent.
   Scherer has also observed that leucine       contained in the pan

and the residue treated with hot water.         The filtrate was pre
cipitated    by
              baryta water, filtered, and the filtrate evaporated on
the water-bath with the addition of acetate of copper. The pre
cipitate formed, which consisted of xanthine and guanine in com
bination with copper, was filtered off.       On saturating this fil
trate with sulphuretted hydrogen, and evaporation, the liquor
yielded about six ounces of pure leucine containing mere traces

of tyrosine.     This quantity corresponds to l-77 per cent, of the
fresh pancreas, or, since that contains 76 to 77 per cent, of water,
to 7*37 per cent of the solid constituents. A subsequent experi
ment, made with a fresh pancreas under special precautions,
showed that leucine pre-existed in the gland, and was not a pro
duct of decomposition.
    Professor Schmidt and Dr. Stiirzwage in Dorpat have made
a series   of experiments on the action of arsenious acid, when in
troduced into the circulation, on the oxidizing process in the
body. The mode of experimenting consisted in determining the
normal quantity of carbonic acid exhaled in an hour by certain
animals (fowls, pigeons, and cats), and then administering to them
arsenious acid, and again observing the quantity of gas exhaled
in the same time. The apparatus consisted of a bell-jar, stand
ing on a ground-glass plate, under which the animal was placed.
In the tubulure of the bell-jar were inserted two tubes, and a
delicate thermometer.       One of these tubes communicated freely
with the air, the other was connected with a series of tubes for
the absorption of carbonic acid and water, and with an aspirator
by which a regulated quantity of air could be drawn through the
system.      Each experiment lasted about an hour, during which
time about 30 to 35 litres of air were drawn through : the car
bonic acid of this air was determined by a separate experiment,
and allowed for.      The secretion of urea was determined in some
cases : the determinations were made by Liebig's method.
    A fowl weighing 896 grms. was found to respire on an
 average 2-07 grms. CO2 in the hour.       A solution of 0-018 grm.
 arsenious acid was then introduced into its crop, and after half an
 hour the bird was placed under the jar. It was found to respire
 1-88 grm. of CO2 in the hour.       On the next day 0*027 grm. of
 AsO3 were administered; the quantity of CO2 diminished to
 1*35 grm. ; at the same time the bird was attacked by severe
 diarrhoea, its respiration became greatly accelerated, it drank
 much water, and trembled violently.         On the following day
 these symptoms diminished, and 0 035 grm. AsO8 were injected.
 Three hours after, the expiration of carbonic acid diminished to
 1*296 grm.
    In an experiment with another fowl, the injection of 0-032
 grm. AsO3 caused the respiration to diminish from 2*085 grms.
 in the hour to 1*75 grm.
    In another fowl weighing 1400 grms., the respiration of CO2
 was 2*37.      An hour and a half after the injection of 0-035 AsO3
 it fell to 1*92 grm., and ten hours after to 1-37 grm. It showed
 at the same time the usual symptoms of arsenical poisoning, but
 afterwards gradually recovered, and in five days its respiration

              by the administration  of Arsenioics Acid.         215
had reached the normal quantity.          On administering the pre
vious dose, the quantity diminished to 1'27 grm.
   With a cat weighing 2'61 kilogs., and which consumed daily
130 grms. of flesh, the normal respiration was 3"08 grms.
0*025 grm. AsO3 were injected into the jugular vein ; the quan
tity fell to 2'301 grms., and subsequently the animal died.
   With another cat the average respiration of carbonic acid in an
hour was 2*925 grms., and the average amount of urea secreted
per diem was 9*85 grms. After the administration of 9*01 grms.
AsO8, the respiration sank to 1*98 grm., and the secretion of
urea to 3'61 grms.
    With starving animals, previous investigations (by Bidder and
Schmidt) showed that the respiration diminishes in the first
forty-eight hours, but afterwards remains constant even until the
sixteenth day, notwithstanding the continuous decrease in weight
of the animal. To ascertain the effect of arsenious acid upon
starving animals, the following experiments were made.          A cat
whose respiration amounted to 3*3 grms., was left without food
for three days.      On the first day the respiration had sunk to
2-45, and on the third to 2"24 grms. 0'018 grm. As O3 were
then injected into the jugular vein.       The respiration of CO2 de
creased to T902 grm.        The action of the heart also diminished
greatly.
    In another experiment with a cat weighing 3'31 kilogs., and
fed on 150 grms. flesh daily, the respiration and the secretion
 of urea were determined for four days. The animal was then
 deprived of food, and the same determinations made for the
 same time.     The weight and the secretion of urea remained
 constant for the first four days ; during the next four days the
 weight diminished to 2-88 kilogs., and the respiration of carbonic
 acid from 3*45 grms. to 2-54 grms.        An injection of 0 005 grm.
 As O3 into the jugular vein was then made, and the animal fed
 with meat, which it consumed with great avidity, but afterwards
 vomited all but 24 grms. On the following day it refused food.
 The respiration of CO4 diminished to 2"24 grms., while the bodily
 weight slightly increased, and underwent no diminution until the
 third day after the injection, during which time the animal rejected
 all nourishment.     This result is the more surprising since, in the
 earlier period of inanition, fasting for twenty-four hours produced
 a considerable diminution in the bodily weight.
    From these experiments, Schmidt and Stiirzwage conclude
 that arsenious acid introduced into the organism occasions a
 considerable diminution in the secretion of matter.        The phe
 nomena are most observable in fowls ; but even in cats, which
 vomit after the injection, and are to be considered as starving,
 the diminution amounts to 20 per cent., even after eliminating

216     Prof. Dufour    : Instructions    for the better observation  of
the diminution caused by mere inanition.                This fact explains
the fattening of horses after the administration of small doses of
arsenious acid, a fact well known to horse-dealers.            That quan
tity of fat, and of albumen, which corresponds to the depression
in the secretion of carbonic acid and urea, remains in the body ;
and if the animal receive adequate nourishment, its weight
increases.
XXIX.      Instructions for    the   better observation   of  the Scintilla
    tion of the Stars. By     Charles Dufour, Professor of Mathe
    matics at Morges*.
               lately the study of the scintillation of the stars has
 UNTIL   not    formed the subject of any series of observations.
 Here    and there may be found a few isolated directions, and
 several persons have attempted divers explanations of the phe
nomenon, but no continued observations have as yet been pre
 sented to the learned world.         I  believe I   am the first who has
undertaken a work of this kind.            My observations, commenced
 at Morges in 1852, were at first but a series of gropings in the
 dark, but since 1853 down to the present time,              I  have never
allowed one evening to pass in which the stars were visible,
without carefully observing the scintillation ; and after six years'
perseverance in the work,         I  am convinced that this branch of
astronomical study is important, and merits a place amongst
meteorological observations.
    But in order that the results obtained may be more general
and more complete, it would be very desirable to undertake a
series of observations analogous to those          I  have commenced, in
other climates and under other meteorological circumstances.
                   I
    At the time am writing (December 1859) the following are
the stations where,     I hope, a work of this kind is begun or con
tinued.
    Morges (Switzerland), 46° 30" North latitude and 4° 9" longi
tude east of Paris. — Since 1853         I  have taken at Morges nearly
24,000 observations on the scintillation of the stars. The prin
cipal results obtained up to the present time, have been published
in the reports issued by the Academies of Belgium and Paris,
the ' Notices' of the Astronomical Society of London, and the
Bulletin de la Societe Vaudoise des Sciences Naturelles.
    The Great St. Bernard, at an altitude of 2480 metres. — The
monks who inhabit this elevated spot all the year round, on the
borders of the eternal snow, have willingly undertaken to carry
on the observations that        I   commenced there in the summer of
                     * Communicated     by the Author.

                    the Scintillation       of the Stars.             217
1856, during the time         I
                              was staying at the hospital for scientific
purposes.
    Grand Cairo, where Mahmoud Effendi, Director of the Ob
servatory there, has already commenced, or will immediately com
mence, a series of observations analogous to my own at Morges.
    The Peak of Teneriffe, where Mr. Piazzi Smyth, Director of
the Observatory of Edinburgh, has already passed several months
for scientific purposes.      This gentleman has promised me, that
if, as he hopes, he      is able to continue his researches on this
isolated mountain, he will give special attention to the study of
the scintillation of the stars.
    Several localities in Russia. — Last year the Geographical Society
of St. Petersburgh decided on publishing instructions for the
observation of all kinds of meteorological phenomena, and M.
Kaemtz, who was charged with the direction of the publication,
requested me to draw up the part relating to the scintillation        ;so
that  I  have reason to believe that in various parts of Russia,
observations in accordance with these instructions have already
been commenced.
    Havanna, where M. Poey has founded an observatory during
the past year.       This gentleman, with       view to observing the
                                                  a
scintillation at Havanna after my method, requested me to for
ward him   a   copy of the instructions already sent to Russia       ; so
 that there also,
                I      hope, the work       is
                                          begun.    But  these stations
are very wide apart on the surface of the globe.
   -There are certain countries and certain climates from which
       most desirable that observations should be taken          for in
it
is                                                               ;
 stance, the Torrid Zone, as the observations taken at Havanna are
 the only ones within the tropics.     It would be well to have several
 stations in various parts, as    it  important to know what
                                       is                            the
                                                                     is
 amount of scintillation in the hottest and dampest countries in
the world.     In the Austral Hemisphere also, observations would
 be extremely valuable, because there not only would the student
 have the opportunity of observing stars invisible to us (Acherner
 and Campus among others), but the meteorological phsenomena,
 being notably different, would doubtless sensibly affect the scin
tillation.    Those beautiful stars of our own hemisphere also,
 Sirius and Rigel, which we see only in winter, are visible south
 of the equator during the hot season, and are also nearer the
zenith and
      ;        itwould be interesting to know    their scintillation
                                                       if
is at all affected  bythese circumstances.
   In countries situated to the extreme north, would also beit
extremely interesting and important to procure observations, and
to ascertain the amount of scintillation in those serene nights of
intense frost so constant in Eastern Siberia and even in European
Russia.

218       Prof. Dufour     :  Instructions for the better observation of
    If it were possible to procure observations from the Polar
regions during their long night of several months, it would be
specially interesting ; and          I would take the present opportunity
of recommending this branch of study to the notice of travellers
who may be passing one or more winters in the midst of the ice
of a Polar region.           I  regret exceedingly not having begun my
observations ten years sooner, as then those hardy mariners, who,
in search of Sir John Franklin, spent so many winters and tra
 velled over so great a portion of those regions, might perhaps
have been induced to devote some of their time to this branch of
 study. But similar expeditions may be undertaken again ; and
if such should be the case, I promise myself to call the attention
 of future explorers to this phenomenon, in the hope of procuring
 valuable results from their observations.
     But in order to facilitate their efforts, and to avoid useless ex
 penditure of time, as well as to render the indications given by
 one observer capable of being compared with the observations
 made by another,        I   would recommend the use of the following
 instructions, as the fruits of the experience acquired in the long
 series of observations taken by me at Morges.
                        1st.     The manner  of observing .
      I  have tried several scintillometers — all those indicated by
 Arago, and a new one proposed by myself ; but               I am convinced
 that none of them are worth the observations taken by the naked
 eye.      After a little practice it becomes easy to ascertain with
 tolerable exactitude whether a star scintillates more or less than
 another star, and to indicate the amount of scintillation by a
  given number, in like manner as in meteorology the state of the
  sky, or the force of the wind, is indicated by figures. My own
 method is to designate by 0 the absence of all scintillation, and
  by 10 the highest degree, which is seen very rarely, and only
  when the star is near the horizon, when it sometimes scintillates
  very strongly, changes colour, and sometimes even disappears
  and appears again.           With a little practice it soon becomes easy
  to distinguish degrees of scintillation even between 0 and 1,
  1 and 2, &c.      The next step is to ascertain the scintillation with
  still more exactitude, and to designate it as 0-4, 1'6, &c, though
  it is scarcely possible to subdivide these degrees further than 1,
  4, or 5.
      It  may appear that this division is an arbitrary one, and that
  it is difficult to appreciate by figures     a phenomenon like the scin
  tillation of the stars : but this mode of proceeding is indicated
  by several learned men '; among others by the celebrated Horace
  Benedict de Saussure, who employed a similar means of estima
  ting the famous dry fog of 1783.
       De Saussure gives the amount of intensity sometimes as 8,

                       the Scintillation  of the Stars.              219
sometimes as 4, and sometimes as 8, &c., and gives the follow
                                   "
 ing reasons for so doing : — This scale that           I have employed
is an imaginary division for the estimation of a phaenomenon for
which we can have no real measure.             I suppose, then, that the
highest degree     is  10,  the  lowest  1 ;  and  I shall endeavour to
 determine the intermediate degrees either by the intensity of the
 sensation produced, or by other circumstances connected with
 the phaenomenon.        This appears to me to present ideas with
 more precision than by simply qualifying the different degrees
 by the vague terms of strong, middling, and feeble.              Thus  I
 would estimate at 8 degrees the fog of July 3, 1783." (De Saus-
 sure, Travels in the Alps : Third Journey, chap. 2.)
    I have explained the scale I employ ; other observers can form
 their own, according to their ideas of what is best.          The num
bers can be changed at will, so long as the degrees remain prac
tically the same. Thus, my brother Mark, who began his ob
 servations about a year ago, has adopted a scale much lower than
 mine ; but we always agree as to the amount of scintillation on
 any given evening, and also as to whether one star scintillates
more than another.          These are the most important points to
 decide on ; for, as all the observations cannot be taken by the
 same person, it would often be difficult to ascertain if the scin
tillation is of the same intensity at Cairo, New Archangel, on
 the Peak of Teneriffe, or at Morges.
    Within certain limits this difficulty can be obviated, as will I
endeavour to show later; but in any case, by following the
method of instruction        I  have indicated, it will be possible to
know how much the scintillation varies from one night to an
other, and whether the amount appears affected or is influenced
by any meteorological perturbations.
    It is of course needless to add, that the height of the star ob
 served must be known and noted.           It is not necessary, however,
to take a direct observation of the height of the star in question ;
it is much easier to calculate this from the time of the night j
and, to abridge these calculations, a Table can be drawn up indi
cating what is the exact height of the stars to be observed in the
different sidereal hours, according to the latitude of the obser
ver's position.      The Table   I  have gives the degrees of height for
Morges,    calculated   at intervals  of half an hour. And this Table
is sufficient ; for in the space of half an hour one can interpolate
with all the exactitude necessary, as in this case it is only need
ful to know approximatively, within a degree or half a degree, the
height of the stars.
                2nd. Mode      of comparing    observations.
    It has been proved that, all other circumstances being equal,
the scintillation of the stars decreases in proportion as they ap-
                                                                          -

220     Prof. Dufour    : Instructions for the better observation of
proach the zenith ; and reasoning from this fact, it may seem
impossible to compare observations unless they have all been
taken from stars at the same height.             On comparing a vast
number of observations       taken  under  most  favourable conditions,
and when there had been no apparent atmospheric perturbations
either on the preceding or following days, I have placed it beyond
doubt that the scintillation does really decrease when the stars
approach the zenith, and that, for any given height, the scin
tillation is sensibly proportional to the product obtained by mul
tiplying the depth of the stratum of air which the rays of light
traverse, by the astronomical refraction for the height under con
sideration.
    Let us designate this product by P.            Representing by 1
the height of the atmosphere, and estimating the refractions in
seconds, it will be found that for the different heights the results
P   are —

    These figures represent tolerably well the normal state of the
scintillation at Morges, when the height of the star above the
horizon varies from 20° to 75°.         Below 20° the calculated value
no longer corresponds with the observations, but the neighbour
hood of the horizon sufficiently explains this deviation ; and as
to the stars situated at a height which exceeds 75°, their scintil
lation is in general so feeble that the slightest error in the ob
servation will cause a notable modification in the correspondence
of the figures. Thus, if one has observed at a height of 60° a
scintillation of 1-6, and one wishes to know what would have
been, under the same circumstances, the scintillation of the same
star if it had been only 45° above the horizon, one would obtain
               Scintillation at 45°= 1'6Q^1'8 =3-4.

                          3rd. Errors    to be avoided.
        It often happens that from one night to another the scintil
    lation varies very considerably ; but it augments or diminishes
    proportionably for all the stars, except perhaps for those which,
    being nearest the horizon, have always a strong scintillation, or
    except when accidental causes modify it momentarily.             Among
    these accidental   causes   we  may cite,   first, the  twilight, which
    almost always very much augments the scintillation;                  and
     secondly, the neighbourhood of clouds.              I
                                                         think M. Kaemtz
     was the first to notice that the scintillation augments when there
     are clouds driven by the wind.                                I
                                         This is the fact, as have ob
     served it in thousands of cases, and         I
                                               do not remember noticing
     a single exception.
        Hence  I do not say that we ought to reject observations taken
     when the stars are near clouds ; only we must bear in mind this
     circumstance,   as it greatly modifies the results obtained.          A
     bright moonlight     is also  very unfavourable;      for  observations
     taken when the moon is full, are much less exact than those
     taken when she is absent.
      4th. Comparison     of the   observations made by different persons.
        This is the delicate point to consider ; for what precedes suf
    fices for the study of the phsenomenon when all the observations
    are taken by a single person ; but when there are several, how are
    we to know if the scintillation designated 2'5 is equal to that
    of another person also designated by 2-5 ?                 I
                                                        believe it is im
    possible to obtain this unison ; and unless every observer could
    be taught, by one single person experienced in the matter,         am   I
    certain it never will be obtained.      However, here is a method of
    recognizing if the scintillation     is,
                                           in absolute value, stronger in
    one station than in another —    :
        At Morges, during the nights of maximum scintillation, the
     stars at the zenith scintillate very decidedly.    In the nights of
    middling scintillation the stars in the same position scintillate
    feebly, though always enough to be appreciable; but in the
    nights when the scintillation           at its minimum, the stars
                                             is
     nearest the zenith have no longer any scintillation at all       and   ;
    the nearer the scintillation approaches to its minimum, the more
     extended  is  the spherical segment (of which the zenith          is
                                                                   always
    the centre), which comprehends all those stars of which the
    scintillation   isinappreciable.     have sometimes seen, when the
                                         I
     scintillation was very feeble, that the stars lost all scintillation
-    as soon as they were at 42° above the horizon       but   have never
                                                               ;   I
     seen it  cease entirely for stars less elevated, though, from what
     Arago says,    itappears that that happens sometimes.
        He names, among others, the observations of M. de Hum

 222     Prof. Dufour   : Instructions for the better observation of
 boldt, who says that on the borders of the Orinoco no scintil
 lation can be observed, not even at 4° or 5° above the horizon.
    Le Gentil asserts that at Pondicherry, during the months of
 January and February, the stars do not scintillate at all. Beau-
 champ wrote to Lalande, that at Bagdad the stars ceased to
 scintillate as soon as they arrived at 45° above the horizon.
    Garcin asserted, in 1743, that at Bender Abassi, on the
 borders of the Persian Gulf, in the spring, summer, and autumn
 the stars did not scintillate ; it was only in winter that a slight
 scintillation was perceptible.
    According to M. de Humboldt, at Cumana in general the
 scintillation is no longer sensible when the stars are more than
 25° above the horizon, &c.        Most assuredly    I have never seen
 at Morges, during the past six years, so small an amount of
 scintillation ; but it is by specifying the various heights at which
 stars cease to scintillate that my observations are susceptible of
 being compared with those of M. de Humboldt and Le Gentil.
 I therefore call the attention of observers specially to this point,
 as probably the best manner of comparing the calculations
 obtained in various parts of the globe.
    The scintillation of stars of the first magnitude is perfectly
appreciable by the naked eye ; that of the secondary ones less
so ; and so on, until for the smallest and least brilliant stars it
becomes quite inappreciable : but this limit varies from one
night to another, according as the general scintillation is strong
or feeble.     This fact may also serve as a means of comparing
the degrees of scintillation.
    The magnitude of the stars that appear to scintillate must be
noted ; and as we have seen that the height of the stars above
the horizon exercises a great influence on the intensity of the
phenomenon, it will be necessary to name some of the stars,
and to indicate, besides, their height above the horizon, or at
least the time at which the observation was taken ; but         I attach
less importance to this method of comparison than to the pre
ceding one, because the purity of the atmosphere, the sight of
the observer, and the various degrees in the brilliancy of the
stars, all exert more or less influence on the results obtained.
                           5th. Variable Stars.
                     I
    Of all the stars have observed, a. of Orion is the one of which
the scintillation appears to me to be the most irregular ; but it
is well known that the brilliancy of this star is not always the
same : and with reference to the variable stars, all that is known
of them is the duration of their periods ; and consequently their
scintillation is also an interesting phaenomenon to study. It would
be, above all, interesting in the case of the star 17 of Argo, whose

                     the  Scintillation of the  Stars.              223
singular variations of brilliancy have so much surprised astrono
mers for the last thirty or forty years.         Unfortunately this star
is only visible at 31° north latitude ; and to observe it at a height
of 30 above the horizon, one must travel as far as the equator,
bo that this research must be left to the astronomers of the other
hemisphere.
                    6th. Scintillation of the Planets.
     It is generally believed that the planets do not scintillate at
all, or scarcely at all. Nevertheless         I  have often observed a
 sensible scintillation of Venus and Mars, and in a few rare cases
I   have also observed a slight scintillation of Jupiter and Saturn.
For those persons who undertake to explain the phenomenon of
the scintillation, it would be important to know if really the
 scintillation of these planets ever becomes very decided.
     I  would therefore call the attention of observers who may find
 themselves under atmospherical conditions of a nature to render
 the general scintillation very strong, to this point, as they might
 perhaps be able to ascertain whether Jupiter and Saturn ever
 sensibly scintillate.
                      7th. Accidental Observations.
     In order to complete the study of this phaenomenon, excep
 tional circumstances must not be neglected : — Among others,
 observations taken during au aurora borealis, both of the stars
 which appear plunged in the light of the aurora, and of the
 others in other parts of the heavens.          During six years I have
 never been able to make any observations of this nature at
 Morges.
     The observation of the scintillation from the summit of a high
 mountain. De Saussure made several during the time he was
 on the "Col du Geant;" but those which are given in the works
 of this celebrated man are too few in number, and not detailed
 sufficiently to be able to draw from them any certain conclusions.
     Mr. Fiazzi Smyth remembers that the scintillation appeared
 to him very feeble from the summit of the Peak of Tenerifie ;
  and during the time I was staying on the Great St. Bernard,
  I remarked that the general scintillation was always very feeble.
  Is this always the case ?
                      8th. Accessory    Observations.
      In order to render the observations on the scintillation really
  interesting and useful, it is important that they should be accom
 panied by meteorological observations as complete as possible.
  At least let the state of the barometer, hygrometer, and thermo
  meter be noted exactly ; also the state of the heavens, and the
 force and direction of the wind.

224                            Royal Society : —
  It   is probable that wherever any observations      are taken,
meteorological observations are also taken and published ; so that
it would not be adding materially to the work of observers of the
scintillation to ask them to add those observations to their own.
   There are many more details which                 I
                                          pass over, because they
depend on the peculiarity of the sight of different observers, and
on the circumstances under which they may be placed, and
which of course vary in every individual case :    have contented I
myself with indicating the principal points, to which      call the           I
attention of observers, and the importance of which       know by         I
experience.
   In concluding, let me be permitted to express a wish, addressed
to all who may be disposed to observe the scintillation of the
stars in countries whose climates are different to that of Morges ;
and that   is,that they would kindly communicate to me          brief             a
summary of their work — for        needless for me to say that any
                                    it   is
result that they may arrive at will be of the highest interest to
me and reciprocally,
  ;                      they desire
                             if                it,
                                           shall have great pleasure
                                                I
in giving any further details or directions to any persons who
will interest themselves in this research.

        " On the Laws of Operation, and the Systematization of Ma
                                                         :
thematics."   By Alexander J. Ellis, Esq., B.A., F.C.P.S.
   The object of the following investigation   to give   firmer basis
                                                             is       a
to the calculus of operations, to assign the strict limits and con
nexion of the mathematical sciences, and to found them upon purely
inductive considerations, without any metaphysical or a priori
reasoning.
    Starting with the indemonstrable but verifiable hypothesis, that
objects exist external to the subject, we recognize equality as exist
ing between objects with common and peculiar properties, in respect
of their common properties. Operations, which, when performed on
equal objects, produce equal objects as their result, are recognized as
equal, in respect to the common properties considered in the equali
ties of the objects. When one operation        performed on an object,
                                                      is
and another on the resultant object, the single operation by which the
first object   transformable into the last
              is                              regarded as the product
                                                     is
of the other two, the order of succession being important.       When
the resultant object     the same as the original operand, the product
                        is
of the operations  is termed unity. When two operations performed

    Mr. A.       J.   Ellis on   the Systematization   of Mathematics.    225
on the same object produce different resultant objects, the operation
of transforming one of these resultant objects into the other, is re
garded as the quotient of the two former operations.                Two opera
tions are termed reciprocal when their product is unity.             Hence the
quotient of two operations is the product of the one and of the reci
procal of the other. When two objects are combined in any manner
so as to produce a third, and the two first are formable from any
fourth by two known operations, the single operation by which the
third object can be also formed from the fourth, is termed the same
combination of the two first operations. From this we gain the con
ception of null or zero, as the operation of annihilating any object in
respect to any place. The product of a combination of two opera
tions and a third operation, is the same combination of the products
of each of the combined operations severally and the third operation,
in the particular order thus specified, provided all the operations and
products are performable on the same operand.
    The above general conceptions and laws of combined operations
hold for any operations whatsoever with their appropriate operand
objects ; but the nature of the operations and operands requires
especial study.        In mathematics, objects are only considered with
respect    to   their  three most general properties : first, as contem-
platable in discontinuous succession, whence number and Arithmetic'^
secondly, as contemplatable in continuous succession, whence ex
tension and Geometry ; and thirdly, as contemplatable in a con
tinuous succession bearing a relation to another continuous succession,
 whence motion in time and Mechanics.               The problem of mathe
matics   is,  first, to discover the laws of these successions as respects
 results (that        is,
                      statically), by means of considerations drawn from
 contemplating operations (that is, dynamical)          ;  secondly, to investi
 gate the relations of these laws, giving rise to statical algebra            ;
 thirdly, to reduce all dynamical to statical laws, as in dynamical
 algebra and fourthly, to make the expression of all the results de
        ;
 pendent on the most simple, viz. those of common arithmetic.               The
 purpose of the problem           to prepare the mind for the further investi
                                 is
 gation of nature, and to increase practical power immediately.
    In Arithmetic we conceive objects spread out in scale, and by
                                                               a
 aggregating those contained between any one and the beginning of
 the scale, form statical groups, whose distinctive character        is  derived
 from the scale.        The operation by which any group        is formed from
 the first object        termed an integer, the especial laws of which are
                        is
 next investigated.        All objects being interchangeable in respect to
 discontinuous succession, an aggregate         isnot changed by altering the
 disposition of its parts.         This leads to the first two laws of commu
 tation and association in addition.            The possibility of arranging
 objects at once in two horizontal directions, and            a   third vertical
 direction, leads to the laws of commutation and association in multi
plication.        Combining these with the two former, we have the law
 of  commutative      distribution. From the laws of association in multi
 plication  is   immediately deduced the law of repetition or indices.
  . Having obtained these laws, we proceed to study their relations in

226                              Royal Society :—
 the algebra of integers, first, statically, in order to reduce all results
 to the form of a numerical integer ; secondly, dynamically, con
 sidering the effect of a variation in the integer employed.                   This
 leads to the conception of a formation (Lagrange's "analytical
 function "), as a combination of a fixed and independently variable
 integer.     Such a combination       is,  therefore, also itself dependency
 variable.     The inversion of formations, whereby the independent
 variable is   expressed as  a   formation of the dependent variable, imme
 diately  engages     our  attention.    The inversion of   a      sum leads to a
 difference, with the limitation that the minuend should be greater
 than the subtrahend.          The inversion of     a    product leads to a     quo
 tient, with the limitation that the dividend should be              a  multiple of
 the divisor.       The inversions of   a    power lead to the root and loga
 rithm, with increasing limitations.           The study of discontinuous ob
 jects  then   allows   the  application   of  these inversions to the solution
 of problems in common life.
     The operation by which any group in the arithmetical scale already
 described   is   formable from any other group in the same scale, leads
 to the conception of fraction, necessarily expressible, according to
                         a
 the general laws of operation, as the quotient of two integers.                The
 operands     of   such  operations    must    admit    of  being separated into
 certain numbers        of equal parts, or     rather,  in  order that they may
 admit of any fractional operation, into any             number    of equal parts.
 Thus discontinuous approaches continuous succession. The laws of
fractions are the same as the laws of integers, provided the indices
 used are all integers. The object of the statical algebra of fractions
is   to reduce all combinations of numerical fractions to numerical
 fractions.     The inversion of formations        is  less limited than before.
 There  is  the same limitation respecting differences, but none respect
 ing quotients.       The attempt to convert all fractions into radical
 fractions (whose denominators are some powers of the radix of the
 system of numeration), leads to the conception of convergent infinite
 series, and hence allows an approximation to the inversion of           a    power
 with constant index.
      a
     In Geometry, the notion of continuous succession or extension              is
  derived from the motion of the hand, which recognizes separable but
 not separated parts.        This motion gives the conception of surfaces,
  which by their intersections two and two, or three and three, give
  lines and points.      Recognizing  a   line as the simplest form of exten
 sion, we distinguish the straight lines, which coincide when rotated
  about two common points, from the curves, which do not.                     These
  straight lines are shown to be fit operands for the integer and fraction
  operations.      By moving one coinciding line over another so as to
  continue to coincide (by sliding), or to have one point only in com
  mon (by rotating), or no points in common (by translation), we
  obtain the conceptions of angles and parallels, which suffice to show
  that the exterior angle of     a   triangle is  equal to the two interior and
  opposite, and that two straight lines meet or not according as the
  exterior angle they make with           a   third is    not oris   equal to, the
  interior angle.     Angles   are  then   considered    statically  as amounts of

    Mr. A.      J.   Ellis   on the Systematization        of Mathematics.         227
rotation not exceeding a semi-revolution.          Proceeding to examine
the relations of triangles and parallelograms, we discover the opera
tion of taking a fraction of a straight line, and therefore of a triangle
and of any rectilineal figure.      We see that this operation              is,
                                                                       in fact,
the same as that of altering        third line into
                                     a                  fourth, so that the
                                                            a
multiples of the third and fourth, when arranged in order of magni
tude, should lie in the same order as those of the first and second
when similarly arranged.          The relation of two magnitudes, with
respect to this order, we term their ratio, and the equality of ratios
proportion. The inversion and alternation of the four terms of                         a
proportion are now investigated.         The operation of changing any
                                                                 it,

                                                                 is         a
The laws of tensors, being investigated, are shown to be the same as
those of fractions.     They, however, furnish the complete conception
of infinite and infinitesimal tensors,       by
                                           letting one or other of the mag
nitudes by which the ratio         given become infinite or infinitesimal.
                                   is
Thence     isdeveloped the law, that tensors differing infinitesimally are
equal for all assignables. Consequently tensors may be represented
by convergent series of fractions.        The algebra of tensors allows of

algebra applied to geometry allows of the investigation of all statical
relations, that       is,
                       of all the geometry of the ancients, in which
magnitudes alone were considered, without direction.           In respect to
areas, the consideration of the parallelogram swept out by one straight
line translated so as to keep one point on another straight line, leads
to an independent algebra of areas, in which the generating lines are
considered immediately.         The laws of the relations of lines thus
discovered, are shown to be identical with the laws of the relations
of tensors. Consequently, with certain limitations, the whole of the
algebra of tensors may be interpreted as results in the algebra of
areas.     This leads to perfect conception of the principle of hotno-
                             a
nomy, or dissimilar operations having the same laws, and conse
 quently the same algebra.
    In dynamical or modern geometry, all lines are considered as in
construction, having initial and final points.              If
                                                        the initial points of
any two straight lines are joined to third, not on either, and the two
                                             a
parallelograms be completed, the lines drawn from the point parallel
to the given lines are dynamically equal to them                   ;these last
                                                                       if
lie on each other, the first two lines have the same direction              the

last have only one point in common and lie in the same straight line,
 the first have opposite directions      and

 same straight line, the first have different directions, and the angle
 between the last      the angle between the first lines. Similar defini
                       is
 tions can be given of direction in the case of angles and circular
 arcs.

laws of appension are shown to be the same as those of addition,
and are hence expressible by the same signs of combination, the
difference in the objects combined preventing any ambiguity.              We
thus get the conception of a point as an annihilated line.
    The tensor operation, considered dynamically, leads to the opera
tion of changing a line dynamically so that it should bear the same
relation to the result as two given lines bear to each other in magni
tude and direction.       This assumes three principal forms according
to the difference of direction.      If there is no difference of direction,
the operation is purely a tensor.        If the directions differ by a semi-
revolution, the rotation of one line into the position of the other may
take place on any plane.       The operation is then termed a negative
scalar ; the tensor, which includes the operation of turning through
any number of revolutions, is distinguished as a positive scalar.          If
the rotation be through any angle, but always on the same plane,
the operation is here termed a clinant.            If   the rotation may take
 place  on any  variable  plane,  the operation   is  a  quaternion.
    The laws of scalars are immediately proved to be the same as
those of tensors, but in addition they introduce the idea of negativity.
This enables us in the algebra of scalars, to invert a sum generally,
 and thus allows of a perfect inversion of the first two formations.
But a power with a fixed integral exponent can only be inverted on
 certain conditions.     This partial inversion, however, leads to a solu
 tion of quadratic equations, and to a proof that formations consisting
 of a sum of integral powers, cannot be reduced to null by more
 scalar values of the variable than are marked by its highest exponent.
 Hence if such a formation is always equal to null, all the coefficients
 of the variable must be null. We thus obtain the method of inde
 terminate coefficients, by which we are enabled to discover a series
 which obeys the laws of repetition with respect to its variable, and
becomes equal to a power when its variable is an integer.                This
 enables us to define a power with any index, as this series, and hence
 to attempt the inversion of powers with variable indices, which we
 succeed in accomplishing under certain conditions. This investigation
 introduces the logarithm of a tensor, powers with fractional and
negative exponents, and the binomial theorem for these powers.              It
 also induces us to consider the laws of formators, or the operations
 by which a formation of any variable is constructed.                They are
 shown to be commutative and associative in addition, associative in
 multiplication, directly distributive and repetitive, but not generally
 commutative in multiplication, nor even inversely distributive.        When
 formators are commutative in multiplication and distribution, they
are entirely homonomous with scalars, which may even be considered
 as a species of formators.      The results of the former investigation,
 therefore, show that logarithms, fractional and negative powers, and
the binomial theorem hold for these commutative formators.
    The necessity of tabulating logarithms and of approximating to
the solutions of equations, leads to the consideration of a method of
deriving consecutive values of formations for known differences of
the variable, and of interpolating values of the same formation for

Considering the two operations of altering           formation by increasing

added to the second), we regard them as formators, and immediately
apply the results of that algebra, which furnishes all the necessary
formulae.      For approximating to the roots of equations, we require
to consider the case where the variable changes infinitesimally, thus
founding the algebra of differentials, which                is,
                                                         in fact, mere sim a
plification   of that of  differences, owing to  all  the  results being ulti
mately    calculated  for assignables only.   Finally,  to  find the alteration
in formation of commutative formators, when the variable formator
     a
is  increased by any other formator, we found the algebra of deri
vatives.
    In applying the results of scalar algebra to geometry, we start with
 the fundamental propositions that the appense of the sides of an en
 closed figure taken in order       is   point, and that when the magnitude
                                         a
 and direction of the diagonal of parallelogram or parallelopipedon,
                                             a
 and lines parallel the sides which have the same initial point as the
 diagonal, are given, the whole figures are completely determined. In
 order to introduce scalars,        a unit-sphere   isimagined, with its radii
parallel to the lines in any figure, and in known directions. Any line
can then be represented as the result of performing            scalar operation
                                                                       a
on the corresponding radius.
    The first object     isto reduce the consideration of angles to that of
straight    lines,  by   the  introduction of cosines and sines, which are
strictly   defined    as  the   scalars represented by the relation of the
abscissa to the abscissal radius, and the ordinate to the ordinate
radius respectively.        These definitions immediately lead to the rela
tions   between    the cosines and sines of the sums of two angles, and
those of the angles themselves, whatever be their magnitude or direc
tion, and thus found goniometry.
    Defining projection of any figure on any plane to be that formed
               a
 by  joining the points on that plane corresponding according to any
law with those of the figure, we have the fundamental relation that,
if the first, and therefore the second figure      isenclosed, the appense of
the sides of the second in the order indicated by the sides of the first,
is   a point.    The orthogonal projection of any figure, by means of
 planes drawn perpendicular to any line, being all in one line, each
 projection can be represented as the result of    scalar operation per
                                                            a
 formed on the same unit radius, and hence this projection leads to one
invariable relation between scalars.   By choosing three lines at right
 angles to each other on which to project, we obtain three scalar re
 lations from every solid figure.            If
                                      the figure    plane, then
                                                             is     pro         by
jecting on  a   line and on    perpendicular
                                a             to that  line, we get two
 scalar relations.

   As any line drawn from the centre of the unit-sphere may be con
sidered as the appense of three lines drawn along or parallel to three
given unit radii, it may be expressed as the sum of the results of
three scalar operations performed on these radii respectively.             By
properly varying    these three   scalars, the  final  point  of the line may
be made to coincide with any point in space. But if there be a given
relation between the scalars, then the number of points will be
limited, and the whole number of the points constitutes the locus of
the original concrete equation referred to the accessory abstract equa
tion.    The consideration of this entirely new view of coordinate geo
metry is reserved for a second memoir.
    Proceeding next to the laws of clinants, we readily demonstrate
that they are the same as the laws of scalars ; they introduce a new
conception, however, that of rotating through an angle not necessarily
the same as a semi-revolution, that         is,
                                             of plane versor. By the con

simplest versor to select        the quadrantal versor, which, under the
                                is
name of quadrantation,        now studied. The two addends of clinant,
                               is                                  a

considered as     product, are its tensor and versor. The laws of these
parts are then studied.
    The statical algebra of clinants has for its object the reduction of
all combinations of clinants given in the standard form of the sum of
a  scalar and veotor, to   aclinant of the same form.         The application
of this to the series obtained for general scalar power, leads to two
                                        a
series, called cosines and sines of the variables, as distinguished from
the goniometrical cosines and sines of an angle, with which they are
ultimately shown to have         close connexion, which can be rendered
                                    a
most evident by assuming as the unit-angle that subtended by           a   cir
cular arc of the length of its radius.        Studying these series quite in
dependently of these relations to angles, we discover that they bear to
each other the same relations as the goniometrical cosines and sines,
and that if  the least tensor value of the variable for which the cosine
series becomes null,       known, all its other values can be found by
                          is
multiplying this     byfour times any scalar integer. This last product
must be added to the least tensor value of the variable for which
both the cosine or the sine series become equal to given scalars, in
order to find all the solutions of such equations.             Supposing the
values of such series tabulated by the method of differences for all
scalar values of the variable, so that such least tensor values can
always be found, we are now able to assign the meaning of any
power whose base and index are both clinants, and the logarithm of
any clinant.    This enables us to invert completely all the simple for
mations, sum, product, power with variable base and constant index,
or constant base and variable index         and hence to solve all equations
                                            ;

 of four dimensions with clinant coefficients, and to show that every
 formation consisting of a sum of integral powers with clinant coeffi
 cients, can he expressed as a product of as many simple formations as
 is determined by the highest index of the variable.         The cosine and
 sine series can also be generally inverted.      The versor of any clinant
 having a known angle (which is always equal to the cosine of its
 angle added to the product of the sine of its angle into a quadrantal
 versor), can now be shown to equal the cosine series added to the sine
 series multiplied by a quadrantal versor, when the variable of the
 series is the scalar ratio of the angle of the clinant to the angle sub
 tended by a circular arc equal to its radius.       From this the ratio of
 the circumference to the diameter of a circle is shown to be twice the
least tensor value of the variable, for which the cosine series is equal
 to null ; and as that value can be readily assigned in a convergent
series, the former ratio is determined. The same investigation shows
 the relation already mentioned between the goniometrical cosines
 and sines, and the cosine and sine series.
    Clinant algebraical geometry allows us to interpret all results of
clinant algebra when referred to lines on one plane.           It thus fur
nishes a complete explanation of the " imaginary" points and lines
in the theory of ankarmonic ratios, when viewed in relation to the
unit radii, as already explained.        In the case of coordinate geo
metry    of two,  and  even three  dimensions, the possibility of interpret
ing the results of a clinant operation performed on a given unit radius
in a given plane, allows us to understand the whole theory of " ima
         " intersections. The
ginary                            theory of scalar and clinant algebraical
coordinate geometry will form the subject of a future memoir.
    Proceeding to quaternions, we find their laws to be the same as
those of clinants while the plane remains unaltered ; but if the plane
is alterable, they cease to be commutative in multiplication, that re
lation being replaced by one between certain related quaternions
called their conjugates.       This makes the algebra of quaternions
(which is not here systematized, as being too recent) entirely different
from that of scalars.
    In meohanics the motion of any point is not considered absolutely
as in dynamical geometry, but relatively to some external, constant,
independent motion, as the apparent motion of the fixed stars ; this
gives the conception of time.        But the necessity of considering the
motion not merely of a point, but of a body, gives rise to the com
parison of the motions of various bodies, and to a conception of their
equality, when the products of their velocities, multiplied by a con
stant which is always the same for the same body, but different for
different bodies, are equal.        This constant is the mass, which in
bodies of the same kind varies as the volume.
    By considering the case of the mutual destruction of motion, we
eliminate time and simplify the problem, thus founding statics ;
and by conceiving the motion of any body to be destroyed by the
application of variable motions equal and opposite to those actually
existent, we reduce dynamics to statics.

   The deportment of phenylamine under the influence of dibromide
of ethylene gives a fair illustration of the nature of the substances
which are generated, under the influence of diatomic molecules, from
primary aromatic monamines.

   To complete the study of this subject, have examined, moreover,
the action of dibromide of ethylene upon ethylamine, as a repre
sentative of the monamines containing an ordinary alcohol-radical.
   Dibromide of ethylene acts upon ethylamine even in the cold, the
products of the reaction varying according to the relative proportions
of the two bodies, and according to the temperature.     Among other
products invariably   occur the  two bromides   corresponding to the
two salts of the phenyl-compounds mentioned in the previous para
graphs.

I   have fixed the composition  of the former compound by the ana
lysis of the dibromide of the dichloride and of the base itself, all of
which are remarkably well-defined crystalline bodies, and that of
the latter by the examination of well-defined platinum-salt.

      The first  base, separated  by the action of anhydrous      baryta from
  the dry bromide, distils as an oily liquid of a powerfully      ammoniacal
  odour, which solidifies into a brittle crystalline mass           not unlike
  fused stearic acid.      The composition of the body is         remarkable.
  It contains
  and thus constitutes the dioxide of the diatomic metal, ethylene-
  diethyl-diammonium.
      The second base is liquid, and boils at 185°.      It is easily obtained
  from the dibromide, which, being extremely soluble, may be readily
  separated from the bromide of the first body.        I have experimentally
  established that this body may be readily procured by the action of
  dibromide of ethylene upon the dioxide previously mentioned.
      The dioxide,
  determined the vapour-density of this compound by Gay-Lussac's
 process. Experiment gave the number 2*26.               Assuming that the
  molecule of the body under examination corresponds to 4 volumes
  of vapour, the theoretical density is 4'62.
     The extraordinary discrepancy between theory and experiment
 may be removed in two ways : viz. either by halving the formula,
 or by assuming that the molecule of the dioxide of ethylene-diethyl-
 diammonium corresponds to 8 volumes of vapour, in either of which
 cases the theoretical density becomes 2*31, closely agreeing with the
 experimental number 2*26.
     I  shall discuss the vapour-densities of the diammonias somewhat
 more fully in a future communication ; but          I  cannot refrain from
 pointing out even now, that, by dividing the formula by 2, we arrive
 at an expression containing 1 equiv. of oxygen (0=8), which, in the
 eyes of those who consider the number 16 as the true molecular
 value of oxygen, must appear perfectly inadmissible.

         " Notice of some Sections of the Strata near Oxford." By
John Phillips, M.A., LL.D., F.R.S., Pres. G.S. &c.
    From the Yorkshire coast to that of Dorset, evidence of uncon
formity between the Oolitic and the Cretaceous strata is readily
observed, the latter resting on several different members of the
former along this tract.       This is especially seen in the neighbour -
                                                                               y

236                       Geological Society   : —
 hood of Oxford, where it is difficult to trace out correctly the limits
 of the Lower Cretaceous beds.         The Oolitic rocks having been
 deposited whilst the relative position of the land and sea was being
 changed, many of the deposits are subject to local limitation ; thus
 the Coralline, Oolitic, and the Calc-grit die out rapidly, and the
 Kimmeridge Clay comes to rest on the Oxford Clay.          It is on the
 surface formed by these irregular beds, and that surface considerably
 denuded, owing to elevations before the Oolitic period was ended,
 that the Lower Cretaceous beds have been laid down.          From their
close propinquity, the sand-beds of different ages, when without
fossils, are scarcely to be defined as Oolitic or Cretaceous, and where
one clay lies upon a similar clay, the occurrence of fossils only can
secure their distinction.
    The Farringdon sands, the sands of Shotover Hill, and those near
Aylesbury, are still open to research, — their Lower Greensand
 characters not having been clearly established.      At Culham, a few
miles south of Oxford, a clay-pit is worked, which presents, at the
top, 3 feet of gravel ; next about 20 feet of Gault with its peculiar
fossils ; then 9 feet of greenish sand, with a few fossils ; and lastly
23 feet of Kimmeridge Clay, with its peculiar Ammonites and other
fossils.   In winter the clay-pit, being wet, offers little «vidence of
any distinction between the upper and the lower parts of the clay ;
but in summer the Gault and its fossils are more easily recognized.
The intervening sand contains Thracia depressa, Cardium striatulum,
and an Ammonite resembling one found in the Kimmeridge Clay.
Although this sand at first sight resembles the Lower Greensand,
yet it is probably more closely related to the Kimmeridge Clay.
Puzzling as this sand is in the pit, another enigma is offered
by the railway-section      at Culham, where the Kimmeridge Clay
is overlaid by a sand perhaps equivalent to that of Shotover
Hill, not that of the clay-pit; whilst the Gault, which lies on it
unconformably, can be connected with that of the clay-pit.           At
Toot Baldon also, though Lower Greensand probably caps the hill,
yet an Oolitic Ammonite was found on the eastward slope of the
hill, in a ferruginous sand, lying conformably on the Kimmeridge
Clay. From these and other instances the difficulty of mapping the
country geologically may be shown to be very great, — the sands of
any one bed differing in colour from green to red, according to the
amount of oxidation produced by exposure and other causes ; and if
fossils are absent, the Portland Sand and the Lower Greensand,
lying against each other, may never be defined. From the great
and irregular denudation, too, of the rocks, and the unequal depo
sition of many of the beds, it will prove a difficult problem to trace
the several sands and define their age, — a problem to be solved only
by close perseverance and strict search for organic remains.
   2. *' On the Association of the Lower Members of the Old Red
Sandstone and the Metamorphic Rocks on the Southern Margin of
the Grampians."      By Prof. R. Harkness, F.R.S., F.G.S.
   The area to which this paper referred is the tract lying between

        On   the   Old Red Sandstone       of the South of Scotland.          237
Stonehaven and Strathearn, including the south-eastern flanks of
 the Grampians for about two-thirds of their course.                 Metamorphic
rocks, trap-rocks, the Lower and Middle members of the Old Red
 Series (the former being sandstone, and the latter conglomerate),
 are the constituent rock-masses of the district, and give it its pecu
liar physical features. The mode in which these rocks are associated
is well exhibited in the section on the coast (at Stonehaven), and in
the several sections in the interior where streams lay bare the rocks.
 Sections at Stonehaven, Glenburnie, Strathfinlass, North Esk, West
Water of Lithnot, Cruick Water, South Esk and Prosen, Blairgowrie,
Dunkeld, Strathearn, and Glenartney, were described in detail.
    Against the nearly vertical, but somewhat north-westerly dipping,
metamorphic schists (which sometimes include conformable lime
stones), come purple flagstone, but usually separated from them by
trap-rocks, having the same strike.             These flagstones pitch to the
south-east, but retain a liigh angle away from the schists, and, in
many places, are intercalated with beds of trap.              The lower purple
flagstones     are  unfossiliferous  ;  but  higher up   tracks  of Crustaceans
(Protichnites)     have  been   discovered    by  the  Rev. H.  Mitchell.      The
grey   fossiliferous  flagstones   of  Forfarshire   succeed,  still  with a steep
dip.     Conglomerates succeed, in beds having a less inclination,
gradually becoming more and more horizontal as they reach the low
country.
    The axis of the elevation of the Grampians thus appears to be
along their southern margin, and to be marked by the trap-rocks
separating the metamorphic schists and the purple flagstones of the
Old Red series, and giving the latter their general south-easterly
dip.    As the metamorphic rocks of the Grampians have not yielded
any fossils, their relation to the other old rocks of Scotland is diffi
cult to determine.
    3.  " On the Old Red Sandstone of the South of Scotland." By
Archibald Geikie, Esq., F.G.S., of the Geological Survey of Great
Britain.
    This paper was the result of a series of explorations carried on at
intervals from Girvan to St. Abb's Head.              The first part related to
the geology of the border-district of Lanark and Ayr, near Lesma-
hagow.        The Silurians and Lower Old Red sandstones of that
district, as formerly pointed out by Sir Roderick Murchison, form
one consecutive series.          They are traversed by great numbers of
felstone-dykes, and are disposed in longitudinal folds, ranging from
N.E. to S.W., the Silurian strata forming the axis of each anticline.
Both series are overlaid unconformably by Carboniferous strata
belonging to the horizon of the Mountain Limestone group of
Scotland.       The features of this unconformity are well displayed all
round Lesmahagow, where an enormous series of Lower Old Red
sandstones, more than 1 0,000 feet thick, have their truncated edges
overlapped by gently inclined beds of Carboniferous sandstone, shale,
and limestone.        The whole of the Lower Carboniferous group and
the upper Old Red Sandstone, amounting in all to at least 6000 or

    238                        Royal Institution   : —
     8000 feet, are here wanting.     But as the junction of the Carboni
    ferous Limestone with the Lower Old Red is traced towards the east,
    the thickness of strata between the two formations gradually in
    creases, until at the Pentland Hills the whole of the Lower Carboni
    ferous series and a considerable part of the Upper Old Red have come
    in ; and these strata, as at Lesmahagow, rest quite unconformably on
    the base of the Lower Old Red Sandstone and the higher beds of
    the Upper Silurian.     Hence it becomes apparent that in the south
    of Scotland, as in Ireland, there is a great physical break between
    the Upper Old Red Sandstone and the lower part of that for
    mation.
       The author next pointed out the character of the Upper Old Red
    Sandstone in East Lothian and Berwickshire ; showing that it
    graduated by imperceptible stages into the Lower Carboniferous
   sandstones, and formed with these one great lithological series.
   The former wide extension of the Upper Old Red Sandstone
   throughout the south-east of Scotland was shown by the height at
   which it occurs among the Lammermuirs.              These hills must un
   questionably   have  been  covered by  it ;  and  hence the denudation of
   the south of Scotland will eventually be shown to be one of the greatest
   which this country has undergone.             The author concluded by
   sketching the physical geography of South Scotland during the
   Upper Old Red Sandstone period, in so far as it was indicated by
  the facts presented in this paper.           He showed that the rate of
  subsidence was probably much greater in the eastern than in the
  western districts, inasmuch as the whole of the vast series of Upper
  Old Red and Lower Carboniferous sandstones had accumulated in
  the Lothians and Berwickshire before the base of the Lesmahagow
  hills began to be washed by the waves of the encroaching sea.

      January 20, 1860. — ** On the Influence of Magnetic Force on the
 Electric Discharge." By John Tyndall, Esq., F.R.S.
     The intention of the speaker was to bring before the meeting a
 series of experiments illustrative of the constitution of the electric
 discharge and of the action of magnetism upon it. The substance
 of the discourse was derived from the researches of various philo
 sophers, its form being regulated to suit the requirements of the
 audience.
     1. The influence of the transport of particles was first shown by
 an experiment suggested, it was believed, by Sir John Herschel, and
 performed by Professor Daniell.       The carbon terminals of a battery
 of 40 cells of Grove were brought within one-eighth of an inch of
each other, and the spark from a Leyden jar was sent across this
space.     This spark bridged with carbon particles the gap which
had previously existed in the circuit, and the brilliant electric
light due to the passage of the battery current was immediately
displayed.

      Influence   of Magnetic Force on     the  Electric Discharge.     239
    2. The magnified image of the coal-points of an electric lamp was
projected upon a white screen, and the distance to which they could
be drawn apart without interrupting           the current was noted.       A
button of pure silver was then introduced in place of the positive
carbon, a luminous discharge four or five times the length of the
former being thus obtained. The silver was first observed to glow,
and afterwards to pass into a state of violent ebullition.         A narrow
dark space was observed to surround one of the poles, corresponding
probably with the dark space observed in the discharge of Ruhmkorff s
coil through rarefied media*.
     3. The action of a magnet upon the splendid stream of green light
obtained in the foregoing experiment was exhibited.           A small horse
shoe magnet of Logemann was caused to approach the light, which
was bent hither and thither according as the poles of the magnet
changed their position : the discharge in some cases formed a mag
nificent green bow, which on the further approach of the magnet
was torn asunder, and the passage of the current thereby interrupted.
 It was Davy who first showed the action of a magnet upon the
voltaic arc. The transport of matter by the current was further
illustrated by a series of deposits on glass obtained by Mr. Gassiot
 from the continued discharge of an induction coil.
     4. A discharge from Ruhmkorffs coil was sent through an at
 tenuated medium ; and the glow which surrounded the negative
 electrode was referred to.       One of the most remarkable effects
hitherto observed was that of a magnet upon this negative light.
 Pliicker had shown that it arranges itself under the influence of the
 magnet exactly in the direction of the magnetic curves.         Iron filings
 strewn in space, and withdrawn from the action of gravity, would
 arrange themselves around a magnet exactly in the manner of the
 negative light.
     An electric lamp was placed upon its back ; a horseshoe magnet
 was placed horizontally over its lens, and on the magnet a plate of
 glass : a mirror inclined at an angle of 45° received the beam from
 the lamp, and projected it upon the screen.              Iron filings were
 scattered on the glass, and the magnetic curves thvrs illuminated
 were magnified, and brought to clear definition upon the screen. The
 negative light above referred to arranges itself, according to Pliicker,
 in a similar manner.
     5. The rotation of an electric current round the pole of a magnet,
 discovered by Mr. Faraday in the Royal Institution, nearly forty
 years ago, was next shown ; and the rotation of a luminous current
 from an induction coil in an exhausted receiver, by the same magnet,
 was also exhibited, and both shown to obey the same laws.               This
 beautiful experiment was devised by De la Rive.
      6. Into a circuit of 20 cells a large coil of copper wire was intro
  duced ; and when the current was interrupted, a bright spark, due to
  the passage of the extra current, was obtained.        The brightness and

             Faraday noticed this dark stripe while the speaker was making
  his preparatory experiments.

 loudness of the spark were augmented when a core of soft iron was
 placed within the coil.       The disruption of the current took place
 between the poles of an electro-magnet ; and when the latter
 was excited, an extraordinary augmentation of the loudness of the
 spark was noticed.        This effect was first obtained by Page, and
 was for a time thought to denote a new property of the electric
current.
    But Rijke had shown, in a paper the interest of which is by no
 means lessened by the modesty with which it is written, that the
 effect observed by Page is due to the sudden extinction of the
 primary spark by the magnet ; which suddenness concentrates the
 entire force of the extra current into a moment -of time.       Speaking
 figuratively,  it  was  the  concentration of  what, under  ordinary  cir
 cumstances, is a mere push, into a sudden kick of projectile
 energy.
    7. The contact-breaker of an induction coil was removed, and a
 current from five cells was sent through the primary wire.           The
 terminals   of  the  secondary wire being brought very     close to  each
 other, when the primary was broken by the hand, a minute spark
passed between the terminals of the secondary.           When the dis
 ruption of the primary was effected between the poles of an excited
 electro-magnet, the small spark was greatly augmented in brilliancy.
 The terminals were next drawn nearly an inch apart. When the
primary was'broken between the excited magnetic poles, the spark
 from the secondary jumped across this interval, whereas it was in
 competent to cross one-fourth of the space when the magnet was
not excited.       This result was also obtained by Rijke, who rightly
 showed that in this case also the augmented energy of the secondary
current was due to the augmented speed of extinction of the primary
spark between the excited poles. This experiment illustrated in a
most forcible manner the important influence which the mode
 of breaking contact may have upon the efficacy of an induction
coil.
    The splendid effects obtained from the discharge of RuhmkorfFs
coil through exhausted tubes were next referred to. The presence
of the coil had complicated the theoretic views of philosophers with
regard to the origin of those effects ; the intermittent action of the
contact-breaker, the primary and secondary currents, and their mu
tual reactions, producing tertiary and other currents of a higher
order, had been more or less invoked by theorists to account for the
effects observed.      Mr. Gassiot was the first to urge, with a water
battery of 3500      cells, a voltaic spark across a space of air, before
bringing the electrodes into contact ; with the self-same battery he
had obtained discharges through exhausted tubes, which exhibited
all the phsenomena hitherto observed with the induction coil. He
thus swept away a host of unnecessary complications which had
entered into the speculations of theorists upon this subject.
    8. On the present occasion, through the kindness of Mr. Gassiot,
the speaker was enabled to illustrate the subject by means of a
battery of 400 of Grove's cells.         The tension at the ends of the

      Influence   of Magnetic Force     on the Electric Discharge.     241
 battery was first shown by an ordinary gold-leaf electroscope ; one
 end of the battery being insulated, a wire from the other end was
 connected with the electroscope ; the leaves diverged ; on now con
 necting the other end of the battery with the earth, the tension of
 the end connected with the electrometer rose, according to a well-
 known law, and the divergence was greatly augmented.
    9. A large receiver (selected from Mr. Gassiot's fine collection),
 in which a vacuum had been obtained by filling it with carbonic acid
 gas, exhausting it, and permitting the residue to be absorbed by
 caustic potash, was placed equatorially between the poles of the
 large electro-magnet.       The jar was about six inches wide, and the
 distance between its electrodes was ten inches.       The negative elec
 trode consisted of a copper dish, four inches in diameter ; the positive
 one was a brass wire.
    On the 16th of this month an accident occurred to this jar. Mr.
 Faraday, Mr. Gassiot, and the speaker had been observing the dis
 charge of the nitric acid battery through it.       Stratified discharges
 passed when the ends of the battery were connected with the elec
 trodes of the receiver ; and on one occasion the discharge exhibited
 an extraordinary effulgence ; the positive wire emitted light of daz
 zling brightness, and finally gave evidence of fusion.          On inter
 rupting   the circuit, the positive wire was found to be  shortened about
 half an inch, its metal having been scattered by the discharge over
 the interior surface of the tube.
    10. The receiver in this condition was placed before the audience
 in the position mentioned above.         When the ends of the 400-cell
 battery were connected with the wires of the receiver, no discharge
passed ; but on touching momentarily with the finger any portion of
the wire between the positive electrode of the receiver and the po
sitive pole of the battery, a brilliant discharge instantly passed, and
 continued as long as the connexion with the battery was maintained.
 This experiment was several times repeated : the connexion with
the ends of the battery was not sufficient to produce the discharge ;
but in all cases the touching of the positive wire caused the discharge
 to flash through the receiver.
    Previous to the fusion of the wire above referred to, this discharge
usually exhibited fine stratification : its general character now was
that of a steady glow, through which, however, intermittent lu
minous gushes took place, each of which presented the stratified
 appearance.
    1 1 . On exciting the magnet between whose poles the receiver was
placed, the steady glow curved up or down according to the polarity
of the magnet, and resolved itself into a series of effulgent transverse
bars of light.     These appeared to travel from the positive wire along
the surface of the jar.      The deflected luminous current was finally
extinguished by the action of the magnet.
    12. When the circuit of the magnet was made and immediately
interrupted, the appearance of the discharge was extremely singular.
At first the strata rushed from the positive electrode along the upper

                            Royal Institution.
surface of the jar, then stopped, and appeared to return upon their
former track, and pass successively with a deliberate motion into
the positive electrode.     They were perfectly detached from each
other; and their successive engulfments at the positive electrode
were so slow as to be capable of being counted aloud with the grea est
ease.    This deliberate retreat of the strata towards the positive pole
was due, no doubt, to the gradual subsidence of the power of the
magnet.     Artificial means might probably be devised to render the
recession of the discharge still slower.        The rise of power in the
magnet was also beautifully indicated by the deportment of the
current.
   After the current had been once quenched, as long as the magnet
remained excited, no discharge passed ; but on breaking the magnet
circuit, the luminous glow reappeared.        Not only, then, is there an
action of the magnet upon the particles transported by an electric
current, but the above experiment indicates that there is an action
of the magnet upon the electrodes themselves, which actually prevents
the escape of their particles.      The influence of the magnet upon
the electrode would thus appear to be prior to the passage of the
current.
    13. The discharge of the battery was finally sent through a tube
whose platinum wires were terminated by two small balls of carbon :
a glow was first produced ; but on heating a portion of the tube
containing a stick of caustic potash, the positive ball sent out a
luminous protrusion, which subsequently detached itself from the
ball, — the tube becoming instantly afterwards filled with the most
brilliant strata. There can be no doubt that the superior effulgence
of the bands obtained with this tube is due to the character of its
electrodes : the bands are the transported matter of these electrodes.
May not this be the case with other electrodes ? There appears to be
no uniform flow in nature ; we cannot get either air or water through
an orifice in a uniform stream ; the friction against the orifice is
overcome by starts, and the jet issues in pulsations.        Let a lighted
candle be quickly passed through the air ; the flame will break itself
into a beaded line in virtue of a similar intermittent action, and it
may be made to sing, so regular are the pulses produced by its pas
sage.    Analogy might lead us to suppose that the electricity over-
comes the resistance at the surface of its electrode in a similar man
ner, escaping from it in tremors, — the matter which' it carries along
with it being broken up into strata, as a liquid vein is broken into
drops*.
   * Mr. Gassiot has shown that a
                                    single discharge of the Leyden jar pro
duces the stratification.  May not every such discharge correspond to a
single draw of a violin bow across a string ?

       Gentlemen,
TN     reference to the very interesting paper of Professor Le Conte's,
      published in the February Number of the Philosophical Magazine
(on the Correlation of Physical, Chemical, and Vital Force), may I
take the liberty of calling your attention to the fact that a view in
many respects similar to his has been argued in a paper
                                                                       " On the
Theory of Inflammation," contributed by me to the British and
Foreign Medico- Chirurgical Review for July 1858 ?
    Two or three sentences from that paper will sufficiently exhibit
the pointsof agreement. After a reference to the partial decomposition
in the egg and the seed, which is a condition of their development,
and to other instances, these words follow :— " Such facts as these
justify us in placing decomposition in organic tissues among the
circumstances which give rise to the organizing process." — P. 215.
At p. 222 is the following sentence : — " As a formative or vital pro
cess, dependent on a decomposing or chemical one, it [inflammation]
corresponds to the clearest conception of nutrition that we can gather
from the phenomena of life in all its forms."
    It is a great satisfaction to me to see views to which I had been
led, so much more ably and fully exhibited by an independent writer.

   ON THE    CONDUCTIBILITY OF CERTAIN ALLOYS FOR HEAT AND
                   ELECTRICITY.        BY G. WIEDEMANN.
    In an experimental investigation, Wiedemann              and Franz* found
 that the thermal and electrical conductibility of metals was nearly
 identical.   Their researches also showed that in brass (which con
 tains 1 part of zinc to 2 of copper) the thermal conductibility differs
 but very little from that of the worse conducting metal, zinc, although
 the latter is present in smallest quantity.         In other alloys, as those
 of tin and lead, an analogous relation prevails in reference to the
 electric conductibility.      Messrs. Calvert and Johnson have lately
 investigated the thermal conductibility of several alloys, and have
 arrived at results which differ materially from those of Wiedemann
 and Franz, and which render doubtful the analogy which had been

heat as well as for electricity, differ but little, even with a consider
able excess of copper, from the conductibility of the worse conducting
metal, zinc.      The alloys of zinc and bismuth, on the contrary, have
nearly the mean conductibility calculated from their atomic com
position.-— PoggendorfF's Annalen, Nov. 1859.

XXXII.     On   the Effect of the Motion    of a Body   upon- the   Velocity
   with which it is traversed by Light.        By M. H. Fizeau*.
             theories have been proposed with a view of accounting
MANY     for the   phenomenon of the aberration of light according
to the undulatory theory. In the first instance Fresnel, and
more recently Doppler, Stokes, Challis, and several others have
published important researches on this subject ; though none of
the theories hitherto proposed appear to have received the com
plete approval of physicists.        Of the several hypotheses which
have been necessitated by the absence of any definite idea of the
properties of luminiferous aether, and of its relations to ponder
able matter, not one can be considered as established; they merely
possess different degrees of probability.
   On the whole these hypotheses may be reduced to the follow
ing three, having reference to the state in which the aether ought
to be considered as existing in the interior of a transparent body.
Either, first, the sether adheres or is fixed to the molecules of the
body, and consequently shares all the motions of the body ; or
secondly, the sether is free and independent, and consequently
is not carried with the body in its movements ; or, thirdly, only
a portion of the aether is free, the rest being fixed to the mole
cules of the body and, alone, sharing its movements.
   The last hypothesis was proposed by Fresnel, in order at once

246     M. H. Fizeau      on the Effect   of the  Motion  of a Body
to satisfy the conditions of the aberration of light and of a cele
brated experiment of Arago's, which proved that the motion of
the earth does not affect the value of the refraction suffered by
the light of a star on passing through a prism. Although these
two phsenomena may be explained with admirable precision by
 means of this hypothesis, still it is far from being considered at
 present as an established truth, and the relations between sether
 and matter are still considered, by most, as unknown.                 The
 mechanical conception of Fresnel has been regarded by some as
too extraordinary to be admitted without direct proofs ; others
 consider that the observed phsenomena may also be satisfied by
one of the other hypotheses ; and others, again, hold that certain
consequences of the hypothesis in question are at variance with
experiment.
    The following considerations led me to attempt an experiment
the result of which promised,         I thought, to throw light on the
 question.
    It will be observed that, according to the first hypothesis, the
 velocity with which light traverses a body must vary with the
 motion of that body.         If  the motions of the body and the ray
 are like-directed, the velocity of light ought to be increased by
 the whole velocity of the body.
    If  the aether be perfectly free, the velocity of light ought not
 to be altered by the motion of the body.
    Lastly, if the body when moving only carries with it a portion
 of the sether, then the velocity of light ought to be increased by
 a fractional part of the velocity of the body and not by the whole
 velocity, as in the first case. This consequence is not as evident
 as the two preceding ones, though Fresnel has shown that it is
 supported by mechanical considerations of a very probable nature.
    The question then resolves itself to that of determining with
 accuracy the effect of the motion of a body upon the velocity
with which light traverses it.
    It is true that the velocity with which light is propagated is
 so immensely superior to any we are able to impart to a body,
 that any change in the first velocity must in general be inappre
ciable.     Nevertheless,     by combining the most favourable cir
cumstances,     it  appeared to be possible to submit to a decisive
test at least two media, air and water, to which, on account
of the mobility of their particles, a great velocity may be im
parted.
    We owe to Arago         a method of observation, founded on the
phsenomena     of  interference,    which is well suited to render evident
the   smallest  variation    in  the  index of refraction of a body, and
hence also the least change in the velocity with which the body
is traversed by light ; for, as is well known, this velocity is in*

      upon the Velocity with which    it is traversed by JAght.   247
versely proportional to the refracting index. Arago and Fresnel
have both shown the extraordinary sensitiveness of this method
by several very delicate observations, such as that on the difference
of refraction between dry and moist air.
   A method of observation founded upon this principle appeared
to me to be the only one capable of rendering evident any change
of velocity due to motion.     It consists in obtaining interference
bands by means of two rays of light after their passage through
two parallel tubes, through which air or water can be made to
flow with, great velocity in opposite directions. The especial
object before me necessitated several new arrangements, which        I '
proceed to indicate.
   With respect to the intensity of light, formidable difficulties
had necessarily to be encountered.         The tubes, which were of
glass and 5-3 millims. in diameter, had to be traversed by light
along their centres, and not near their sides ; the two slits, there
fore, had to be placed much further apart than is ordinarily the
case, on which account the light would, in the absence of a spe
cial contrivance, have been very feeble at the point where the
interference bands are produced.
   This inconvenience was made to disappear by placing a con
vergent lens behind the two slits ; the bands were then observed
at the point of concourse of the two rays, where the intensity of
light was very considerable.
'
   The length of the tubes being tolerably great, 1*487 metre,
it was to be feared that some difference of temperature or pres
sure between the two tubes might give rise to a considerable
displacement of the bands, and thus completely mask the dis
placement due to motion.
   This difficulty was avoided by causing the two rays to return
towards the tubes by means of a telescope carrying a mirror at
its focus.    In this manner each ray is obliged to traverse the two
tubes successively, so that the two rays having travelled over
exactly the same path, but in opposite directions, any effect due
to difference of pressure or temperature must necessarily be eli
minated by compensation.                                     I
                                By means of various tests assured
myself   that   this compensation   was complete, and that what
ever change in the temperature          or density of the medium^
might be produced in a single tube, the bands would preserve'
exactly the same position.     According to this arrangement, the
bands had to be observed at the point of departure itself of the'
rays : solar light was admitted laterally, and was directed towards
the tubes by means of reflexion from a transparent mirror ; after>
their double journey through the tubes, the rays returned and
traversed the mirror before reaching the place of interference,;
where the bands were observed by means       of a graduated eye-piece.

248     M. H. Fizeau   on the Effect of the Motion  of a Body
   The   double   journey   performed by the rays had also the
advantage of increasing the probable effect of motion      ; for this
effect must be the same as if the tubes had double the length
and were only traversed once.
    This arrangement also permitted the employment of a very
simple method for rendering the bands broader than they would
otherwise have been in consequence of the great distance (9
millims.) between the slits. This method consisted in placing a
very thick plate of glass before one of the slits, and inclining the
same in such a manner that, by the effect of refraction, the two
slits had the appearance of being very close to each other : in
this manner the bands become as broad as they would be if the
two slits were, in reality, as near each other as they appear to be ;
and instead of the intensity of light being sensibly diminished
by this expedient, it may, in fact, be greatly augmented by giving
greater breadth to the source of light.     By causing the inclina
tion of the glass to vary, the breadth of the bands may be varied
at pleasure, and thus the magnitude most convenient for pre
cisely observing their displacement may be readily given to them.
    I proceed to describe the disposition of the tubes, and the
apparatus destined to put the water in motion.
    The two tubes, placed side by side, were closed at each ex
tremity by a single glass plate, fixed with gum-lac in a position
exactly perpendicular to their common direction.         Near each
extremity was a branch tube, forming a rounded elbow, which
established a communication with a broader tube reaching to the
bottom of a flask ; there were thus four flasks communicating
with the four extremities of the tubes.
    Into one flask, which we will suppose to be full of water, com
pressed air, borrowed from a reservoir furnished with an air-
pump, was introduced through a communicating tube.             Under
the influence of this pressure the water rose from the flask into
the tube, which it then traversed in order to enter the flask at
the opposite end.     The latter could also receive compressed air,
and then the liquid returned into the first flask after traversing
the tube in an opposite direction.     In this manner a current of
water was obtained whose velocity exceeded 7 metres per second.
A similar current, but in an opposite direction, was produced at
the same time in the other tube.
    Within the observer's reach were two cocks fixed to the re
servoir of air ; on opening either, currents, opposite in direction,
were established in both tubes ; on opening the other cock the
currents in each tube were simultaneously reversed.
    The capacity of the reservoir, containing air at a pressure of
about two atmospheres, amounted to 15 litres (half a cubic foot),
that of each flask to about 2 litres ; the latter were divided into

       upon the Velocity with which   it is traversed by Light.       249
 equal volumes, and the velocity of the water was deduced from
 the section of the tubes, and from the time of efflux of half a litre.
    The apparatus above described was only employed for the ex
 periments with water in motion : with some modifications it
 might also be used for air ; but my experiments on moving air
 had been previously made with a slightly different apparatus, of
 which more hereafter, and the results had been found quite con
 clusive.   I had already proved that the motion of air produces no
 appreciable displacement of the bands. But      I   shall return to this
result and give further details.
    For water there is an evident displacement.           The bands are
 displaced towards the right when the water recedes from the ob
server in the tube at his right, and approaches him in the tube on
his left.
    The displacement of the bands is towards the left when the direc
tion of the current in each tube is opposite to that just defined.
    During the motion of the water the bands remain well defined,
 and move parallel to themselves, without the least disorder,
through a space apparently proportional to the velocity of the
                                 .....
water.    With a velocity of 2 metres per second even, the dis
placement is perceptible ; for velocities between 4 and 7 metres
it is perfectly measureable.
    Tn one experiment, where a. band occupied five divisions of the
micrometer, the displacement amounted to .1*2 divisions towards
the right and 1*2 divisions towards the left, the velocity of the
water being 7-059 metres per second.        The sum of the two dis
placements, therefore, was . equal to 2"4 divisions, or nearly half
the breadth of a band.
                                                I
    In anticipation of a probable objection, ought to state that
the system of the two tubes, and four flasks, in which the motion
of the water took place, was quite isolated from the other parts
of the apparatus : this precaution was taken in order to prevent
the pressure and shock of the water from producing any acci
dental flexion in parts of the apparatus whose motion might in
fluence the position of the bands.       I assured myself, however,
that no such influence was exerted, by intentionally imparting
motions to the system of the two tubes.
    After establishing the existence of the phsenomenon of dis
placement,    I  endeavoured to estimate its magnitude with all
possible   exactitude.   To avoid all possible sources of error,       I
varied the magnification of the bands, the velocity of the water,
and even the nature of the divisions of the micrometer, so as to
be unable to predict the magnitude of the displacements before
measuring them.        For in measuring small quantities, where our
own power of estimating has to play a great part, the influence
of any preconception is always to be feared        ;  I think, however,

250    M. H. Fizeau      on the Effect of the  Motion of   a Body
that the result   I have  ohtained is altogether free from this cause
of error.
   For the most part the observations were made with           a velocity
of 7-059 metres per second ; in a certain number the velocity
was 5-515 metres, and in others 37 metres.              The "magnitudes
observed have been     all reduced to the maximum velocity 7*059
metres, and referred to the breadth of a band as unity.

   By doubling the mean value we have 0-46, nearly half the
breadth of    a band, which represents the magnitude of the dis
placement produced by reversing the direction of the current in
each tube.
   To show the deviations on each side, the differences between
the several observed displacements and the mean value of all
have been inserted in the Table. It will be seen that, in general,
they represent a very small fraction of the breadth of a band ;
the greatest deviation does not exceed one- thirteenth of the
breadth of a band.
   These differences are due to a difficulty which could not be
overcome ; the displacement remained at its maximum but for a
very short period, so that the observations      had to be made very

          upon the Velocity with which it is traversed by Light.          251
rapidly.    Had it been possible to maintain the velocity of the
current of water constant for a greater length of time, the mea
surements would have been more precise ; but this did not
appear to be possible without considerably altering the appa
ratus, and such alterations would have retarded the prosecution
of my research until the season was no longer favourable for
experiments requiring solar light.
     I
     proceed to compare the observed displacement with those
which would result from the first and third hypotheses before
alluded to.     As to the second hypothesis, it may be at once
rejected  ; for the very existence of displacements produced by the
motion of water is incompatible with the supposition of an aether
perfectly free and independent of the motion of bodies.
   In order to calculate the displacement of the bands under the
'supposition that the sether is united to the molecules of bodies
in such a manner as to partake of their movements, let
   v be the velocity of light in a vacuum,
   vf the velocity of light in water when at rest,
   « the velocity of the water supposed to be moving             in   a direc
tion parallel to that of the light.   It follows that
     v*+ u is the velocity of light when the ray and the water move
          in the same direction, and
     v'—u when they move in opposite directions.
     If   A
         be the required retardation and E the length of the
column of water traversed by each ray, we have, according to the
principles proved in the theory of the interference of light,
or
                                      v       v*—vr
Since u is only the thirty-three millionth part of v, this expres
sion may, without appreciable error, be reduced to
                                          v
If m=         V—t   be the index of refraction of water,   we have the ap
proximate formula
                               A=2E-ms.v
Since each ray traverses the tubes twice, the length     double  E   is
the real length of the tubes. Calling the latter = -4875 metre.
                                                       L     1

252      M. H. Fizeau     on the Effect  of the Motion of a Body
the preceding formula becomes
                          A=4L-ms:
                                  v
and the numerical calculation being performed,          we find
                          A=0-0002418 millim.
Such is the difference of path which, under the present hypo
thesis, ought to exist between the two rays.
    Strictly speaking, this number has reference to a vacuum, and
ought to be divided by the index of refraction for air ; but this
index differs so little from unity, that, for the sake of simplicity,
the correction, which would not alter the last figure by a unit,
may be neglected.
    The above quantity being divided by the length of an undula
tion, will give the displacement of the bands in terms of the
breadth of one of them.       In fact, for a difference of path amount
ing to 1, 2, ... m undulations, the system of bands suffer a dis
placement equal to the breadth of 1, 2, . . . m bands.
    For the ray E the length of an undulation is X = 0000526,
and the rays about it appear to preserve the greatest intensity
after the light has traversed a rather considerable thickness of
water.      Selecting this ray, then, we find for the displacement
the value
                             ^=0-4597.
    Had, therefore, the aether participated fully in the motion of
the water, in accordance with the hypothesis under consideration,
 a displacement of 046 of a band would have been observed in
the foregoing experiments.        But the mean of our observations
 gave only 0-23 ; and on examining the greatest particular values,
it will be found that none approached the number 0-46.            I may
 even remark that the latter number ought to be still greater, in
 consequence of a small error committed in the determination of
 the velocity of the water; an error whose tendency is known,
 although, as will soon be seen, it was impossible to correct it
 perfectly.
    I  conclude,   then, that this hypothesis does not agree with ex
 periment. We shall next see that, on the contrary, the third, or
 Fresnel's hypothesis, leads to a value of the displacement which
 differs very little from the result of observation.
    We know that the ordinaiy phsenomena of refraction are due
 to the fact that light is propagated with less velocity in the in
 terior of a body than in a vacuum.         Fresnel supposes that this
 change of velocity occurs because the density of the sether within
a body is greater than that in a vacuum. Now for two media

     upon the Velocity with which                  it is traversed by Light.                253
whose elasticity is the same, and which differ only in their den
sities, the squares of the velocities of propagation are inversely
proportional to these densities ; that                   is,
                                            ~
                                      D         V2'
D  and D' being the densities of the aether in                            a   vacuum and in
the body, and v,   the corresponding velocities.
                        v1                                                    From the above
we easily deduce the relations
                                v                               i/2
the latter of which gives the excess of density of the interior
sether.
   It assumed that when the body put in motion, only part
      is                                                is                              a
of the interior sether    carried along with
                              is                 and that this part it,
is that which causes the excess in the density of the interior
over that of the surrounding sether    so that the density of this
                                                    ;
moveable part        —
                  D' D. The other part which remains at rest
                   is
during the body's motion has the density D.
   The question now arises, With what velocity will the waves be
propagated in     medium thus constituted of an immoveable and
                   a
a moveable part, when for the sake of simplicity we suppose the
body to be moving in the direction of the propagation of the
waves ?
   Fresnel considers that the velocity with which the waves are
propagated then becomes increased                       by
                                         the velocity of the centre
of gravity of the stationary and moving portions of sether. Now
m being the velocity of the body,
                                     D'-D
will be the velocity of the centre of gravity of the system in
question,   and according to the last formula this expression                                is
equal to
                                     j,2   — jj/2
                                            5— U.
Such, then,   is the quantity              by
                                 which the velocity of light will be
augmented   ;   and since     the velocity when the body
                                vf   is                      at rest,              is

will be the respective velocities when the body moves with and
against the light.
   By means of these expressions the corresponding displacement
of the bands     our experiment may be calculated in exactly the

  «* differs little from unity, the term in m2 may, without appre
  ciable error, be neglected, and the above expression considerably
  simplified.     In fact, if m be the index of refraction, and L =    |E
  the length of each tube, we have approximately
                            A=4L-
                                      v
  whence by numerical calculation we deduce
                            A =0 00010634 millim.
  On dividing this difference of path by the length X of an undu
 lation, the magnitude of the displacement becomes
                            ^-=0-2022,
  the observed value being 0*23.
     These values are almost identical ; and what is more, the dif
 ference between observation and calculation may be accounted
 for with great probability by the presence of the before-mentioned
 error in estimating the velocity of the water.         I proceed to show
 that the tendency of this error may be assigned, and that ana
 logy permits us to assume that its effect must be very small.
     The velocity of the water in each tube was calculated by divi
 ding the volume of water which issued per second from one of
 the flasks by the sectional area of the tube.       But by this method
 it is only the mean velocity of the water which is determined ; in
 other words, that which would exist provided the several threads
of liquid at the centre and near the sides of the tube moved with
equal rapidity.       It is evident, however, that this cannot be the
case ; for the resistance opposed by the sides of the tube, acting
in a more immediate manner on the neighbouring threads of
liquid, tends to diminish their velocity more than it does that of
the threads nearer the centre of the tube.           The velocity of the

       upon the Velocity with which      it is traversed   by  Light.   255
water   in the centre of the tubes, therefore, must be greater than
that of the water near the sides, and consequently also greater
than the mean of both velocities.
    Now the slits placed before each tube to admit the rays whose
interference was observed, were situated in the middle of the cir
cular ends of the tubes ; so that the rays necessarily traversed the
central zones, where the velocity of the water exceeded the mean
velocity*.
    The law followed by these variations of velocity in the motion
of water through tubes not having been determined, it was not
possible to introduce the necessary corrections.               Nevertheless
analogy indicates that the error resulting therefrom cannot be
considerable.      In fact, this law has been determined in the case
of water moving through open canals, where the same cause
produces a similar effect ; the velocity in the middle of the canal
and near the surface of the water is there also greater than the
mean velocity.       It has been found that, for values of the mean
velocity included between 1 and 5 metres per second, the maxi
mum velocity is obtained by multiplying this mean velocity by a
certain coefficient which varies from 1'23 to             I'll.    Analogy
therefore permits us to assume that in our case the correction
to be introduced would be of the same order of magnitude.
    Now on multiplying u by        l'l, 1-15, and 1*2, and calculating
the corresponding values of the displacement of the bands, we
find in place of 0*20 the values 0*22, 0-23, 0-24 respectively;
whence it will be seen that in all probability the correction would
tend to cause still greater agreement between the observed and
the calculated results.       We may presume, then, that the small
difference which exists between the two values depends upon a
small error in estimating the real velocity of the water j which
error cannot be rectified in a satisfactory manner, in consequence
of the absence of sufficiently accurate data.
    Thus the displacement of the bands caused by the motion of
water, as well as the magnitude of this displacement, may be
explained in a satisfactory manner by means of the theory of
Fresnel.
    It was before observed that the motion of air causes no per
ceptible displacement of the bands produced by the interference
of two rays which have traversed the moving air in opposite di
rections.    This fact was established by means of an apparatus
which    I will briefly describe.
    A pair of bellows, loaded with weights and worked by a lever,
impelled air forcibly through two parallel copper tubes whose
extremities were closed by glass plates.           The diameter of each
   * Each slit was a rectangle 3 millims. by  1*5, and its surface was equal
to one-fifth that of the tube.

•
  256     M. H. Fizeau    on the Effect  of the Motion  of a Body
  tube was    1 centimetre,   and its effective length 1*495 metre;
  the direction of the motion in one tube was opposite to that in
  the other, and the pressure under which this motion took place
  was measured by a manometer placed at the entrance of the
  tubes ; it could be raised to 3 centimetres of mercury.
     The velocity of the air was deduced from the pressure and
  from the dimensions of the tubes, according to the known laws
  of the efflux of gases. The value thus found was checked by
  means of the known volume of the bellows, and the number of
  strokes necessary to produce a practically constant pressure at the
  entrance of the tubes.     A velocity of 25 metres per second could
  easily be  imparted  to the air ; occasionally greater velocities were
  reached, but their values remained uncertain.
     In no experiment could a perceptible displacement of the
  bands be produced : they always occupied the same positions,
  no matter whether the air remained at rest, or moved with a
  velocity equal or even superior to 25 metres per second.
     When this experiment was made, the possibility of doubling,
  by means of a reflecting telescope, the value of the displacement,
  and at the same time of completely compensating any effects due
  to accidental differences of temperature or pressure in the two
  tubes, had not suggested itself ; but     I employed a sure method
  of distinguishing between the effects due to motion, and those
  resulting from accidental circumstances.
     This method consisted in making two successive observations,
  by causing the rays to traverse the apparatus in opposite direc
  tions. For this purpose the source of light was placed at the
  point where the central band had previously been, when the new
  bands formed themselves where the source of light had previously
  been placed.
     The direction of the motion of the air in the tubes remaining
  the same in both cases, it is easy to see that the accidental effects
  would in both observations give rise to a displacement towards
  the same tube, whilst the displacement due solely to motion
  would first be on the side of one tube and then on the side of
  the other.   In this manner a displacement due to motion would
  have been detected with certainty, even if it had been accom
  panied by an accidental displacement due, for instance, to some
  defect of symmetry in the diameters or orifices of the tubes,
  whence would result an unequal resistance to the passage of air,
  and consequently a difference of density.
     But the symmetry given to the apparatus was so perfect that
  no sensible difference of density existed in the two tubes during
  the motion of the air.    The double observation was consequently
  unnecessary  ; nevertheless  it was made for the sake of greater
  security, and in order to be sure that the sought displacement

                                       it is traversed by Light.     '
        upon the Velocity with which                             257
 was not accidentally compensated by a difference of density,
 which, though small, might be sufficient totally to mask such
 displacement.
     Notwithstanding    these precautions, however, no displacement
 of the bands occurred in consequence of the motion of the air j
 and according to an estimate     I have made, a displacement equal
 to one-tenth of the breadth of a band would have been detected
 had it occurred.
     The calculations with respect to this experiment are as fol
 lows. Under the hypothesis that the air, when moving, carries
 with it all the sether, we have
                   A=2L-m2=00002413 millim.,
                           v
 »i2  being equal to  1 "000567 at the temperature    10° C.
     This experiment having been made in air, the maximum illu
 mination was due to the yellow rays ; and this maximum deter
 mined the breadth of the bands.         Hence the value of X corre
 sponding    to the ray  D being taken,  we have
                               •^=0-4103.
     Now  so great a displacement   could certainly not have escaped
 observation, especially since it might have been doubled by re
 versing the current.
     The following would be the results of the calculation accord
 ing to the hypothesis of Fresnel : —
                   A=2L    - (m*-l) =0-0000001367,
                           ^=0-0002325.
                            A.
     Now a displacement equal to j^jjth of the breadth of a band
could not be observed ; it might, in fact, be a hundred times
greater and still escape observation.      Thus the apparent immo
bility of the bands in the experiment made with moving air may
be explained by the theory of Fresnel, according to which the
displacement in question, although not absolutely zero, is so small
as to escape observation.
    After having established this negative fact, and seeking, by
means of the several hypotheses respecting aether, to explain it
as well as the phsenomenon of aberration and the experiment of
Arago, it appeared to me to be necessary to admit, with Fresnel,
that the motion of bodies changes the velocity with which light
traverses them, but that this change of velocity varies according
to the energy with which the traversed medium refracts light ; so

 258      M. H. Fizeau   on the Effect  of the Motion  of a Body
 that the change is great for highly refracting bodies, but small
 for feebly refracting ones such as air.
     I was thus led to anticipate a sensible displacement of the
 bands by means of the motion of water, since its index of refrac
 tion greatly exceeds that of air.
    It is true that an experiment of Babinet's, mentioned in the
 ninth volume of the Comptes Rendus, appeared to be in contra
 diction to the hypothesis of a change in the velocity of light in
 accordance with the law of Fresnel.         But on considering the
 conditions of that experiment,    I detected the existence of a cause
 of compensation whose influence would render the effect due to
 motion insensible. This cause proceeds from the reflexion which
 the light suffers in the experiment in question.      It may, in fact,
 be demonstrated that if a certain difference of path exists be
 tween two rays, that difference becomes altered when these rays
 suffer reflexion from a moving mirror.         Now on calculating
 separately the two effects (of reflexion) in the experiment of
 Babinet, their magnitudes will be found to be equal and oppo
 site in sign.
    This explanation rendered the hypothesis of a change of velo
 city still more probable, and induced me to undertake the expe
riment with water, as being the most suitable one for deciding
the question with certainty.
    The success of this experiment must,        I  think, lead to the
 adoption of the hypothesis of Fresnel, or at least to that of the
law discovered by him, which expresses the relation between the
 change of velocity and the motion of the body ; for although the
fact of this law being found to be true constitutes a strong argu
ment in favour of the hypothesis of which it is a mere conse
quence, yet to many the conception of Fresnel will doubtless still
appear both extraordinary and, in some respects, improbable ;
and before it can be accepted as the expression of the real state
of things, additional proofs will be demanded from the physicist,
as well as a thorough examination of the subject from the ma
thematician.
    Shortly before the publication of the above interesting memoir
in the Annates    de Chimie, M. Fizeau presented to the Academy
a second memoir, containing the results of his experiments on
the effect of the motion of a transparent solid body, such as glass,
upon the velocity with which it is traversed by light.            The
Comptes Rendus of November 14th, 1859, contains a brief ex
tract from this memoir ; and from it we gather the principal re
sults of his experiments, and the principles upon which the same
were based.
    The method     of experiment which was employed in the fore

      upon the Velocity wiih which it is traversed by            Light.         259
  going researches on air and water being no longer applicable,
  recourse was had to the following property of light established
  by the researches of Malus, Biot, and Brewster.            When a ray of
 polarized light      traverses  a plate    of glass, inclined  towards its
  direction, the plane of polarization of the transmitted ray is in
  general inclined towards that of the incident ray. The magnitude
  of the rotation of the plane of polarization which is thus caused
  by the two refractions at the two surfaces of the plate of glass
  depends, first, upon the angle of incidence ; secondly, upon the
  azimuth of the primitive plane of polarization with reference to
 the plane of incidence ; and thirdly, upon the index of refraction
  of the glass forming the plate.
     The angle of incidence and the azimuth of the primitive plane
  of polarization remaining the same, the rotation of this plane
 increases with the index of refraction of the glass plate.             Now
  since this index is inversely proportional to the velocity with
  which waves of light are propagated through the glass, it follows
  that the magnitude of the rotation of the plane of polarization
 increases when the velocity with which light traverses the glass
 plate diminishes.         The determination of any change in this
  velocity  is,therefore, reduced to that of the corresponding change
  in the rotation of the plane of polarization.
     In the first place   it   was deemed necessary to determine the
  change in the rotation which any given increase or decrease of
 the index of refraction could produce.         By direct and comparative
 measurements of these indices and rotations, in the cases of flint
  and ordinary glass,     it  was found that when the index was in
 creased    by    small fraction, the rotation increased
                  a                                              by  fraction
                                                                      a
 4| times greater than the first.
     The question next arises what change, according to the hypo
 thesis of Fresnel, ought to be produced in the velocity of light
 when  it   traverses glass in  a    state of motion   ?     The answer             is
 based upon the following data.
     The greatest velocity at our command        is     unquestionably that
 of the earth in its orbit. At noon, during the period of the sol
 stices, for instance, the direction of this motion          horizontal and
                                                            is
 from east to west from this
                      ;           it   follows that when     aplate of glass
 receives a   ray  of  light coming   from   the  west,it  ought to be con
 sidered as really moving to meet the ray with the immense velo
 city of 31,000 metres per second.             When, on the contrary, the
 incident ray comes from the east, the glass plate must be con
 sidered as moving with this velocity in the same direction as that
of the propagation of the waves of light,         by    which latter       in
                                                                          it   is
reality   overtaken.
     Now, according to the theory of Fresnel, the difference between
the velocities of the light in these two extreme cases would be

260       On  the Effect of the Motion  of a Body on  Light.
sufficient to produce a change in the rotation of the plane of
polarization equal to yj^th part of the magnitude of that
rotation.
   In order to test this result by experiment, a series of glass
plates were interposed in the path of a polarized beam of parallel
rays of light. The primitive plane of polarization was determined
by a divided circle, and the rotation which this plane underwent
by the action of the plates was measured by means of a second
graduated circle fixed to a convenient analyser.    The instrument
could, moreover, be fixed in any direction so as to study the in
fluence of all terrestrial motions upon the phsenomena.
   In order to make the two necessary observations conveniently
and rapidly, two mirrors were previously fixed on the east and on
the west of the instrument, and upon each, alternately, a beam
of solar light was thrown by means of a heliostat, and thence re
flected towards the instrument.
   The greatest difficulties were encountered in the annealing of
the glass plates of the series ; and as perfectly homogeneous
plates could not be obtained, it was necessary to employ various
compensating expedients, all which will be found described in
the memoir itself.
   The conclusions to which M. Fizeau was led by means of more
than 2000 observations are thus stated : —
                                              '
    1. The rotation of the plane of polarization produced by a
series of inclined glass plates is always greater when the light
which traverses them comes from the west than when it comes
from the east ; the observation being made about noon.
   2. This excess of rotation is decidedly at a maximum at or
about noon during the solstices.      Before and after this hour it
is less, and at about 4 o'clock is scarcely perceptible.
   3. The numerical values deduced from the numerous series of
observations present notable differences, the cause of which may
be guessed, though it cannot yet be determined with certitude.
   4. The influence of the earth's annual motion, as determined
by calculation on the hypothesis of Fresnel, leads to values of
the above excess of rotation which agree tolerably well with the
majority of the values deduced from observation.
   5. Theory, as well as experiment, therefore, lead us to con
clude that the azimuth of the plane of polarization of a refracted
ray is really influenced by the motion of the refracting medium,
and that the motion of the earth in space exerts an influence of
this kind upon the rotation of the plane of polarization produced
by a series of inclined glass plates.

XXXIII.      On a new Instrument for the Mechanical Trisection of
    an Angle ; and on the Multisection of an Angle.      By Thomas
    Tate, Esq.*
          trisection of an angle is a subject of historical celebrity,
THEand,       apart from its utility, must always be interesting to
the mathematician.       Some years ago, Professor Christie invented
an instrument for the mechanical trisection of an angle, which
consists of four rods, kept at equal angles apart from each other
by means of linkwork.       Although simple in principle, this in
strument is somewhat complicated in construction, and therefore
necessarily, to some extent, inaccurate as regards its application.
This instrument contains four rods, ten links, ten axes, and two
sliding-pieces; whereas the instrument which I have made con
tains only two rods, four links, four axes, and two sliding-pieces.
Both instruments are mathematically correct in principle.
     The instrument
which   I   have con-
structed is represent
ed in the annexed
diagram.      AB and
AC are two rods
turning on the axis
A; DE, DF, DH,
and    DG     are   four
links, each equal in
length to A E or A P,
turning on a common
axis D, DE being
connected with AB
by an axis at E, and
DF with AC by an
axis at F.     The pin
G, of the link D G,
slides in the slit a b
formed in the rod
AB in the line of
the axes A and E;
and the pin H, of
the link D H, slides
in the slit e c formed in the rod A C in the line of the axes A
and F. The inner edges of the four links, D E, D F, D H, D G,
are in a line with the centres of their respective axes, as shown
in the diagram.      The rods A B and A C are connected by a half-
lap joint at A ; and similarly the four links are connected at D
by half-lap joints, so that the pieces all lie flat upon the surface

of the paper.      The links 1) E, D F, D H, D G lie below the rods
A B and A C at their respective points of connexion, so that the
plane of A B C always lies parallel to the plane of the paper.
The instrument is used in the following manner.
    Let K D L be the angle to be trisected.        Produce R D to H,
and L D to G.        Laying hold of the extremities B and C of the
rods AB and AC, move the links DH and DG until their inner
edges coincide with the lines forming the angle G D H ; draw
lines D E, D F along the inner edges of the links DE and DF ;
then these lines will trisect the given angle K D L, as required.
    Demonstration.— hi all positions of the instrument, AEDF is
an equilateral parallelogram, and DGE, DHF are equal isosceles
triangles.
    Because DG = DE, ZGED=zDGE;                   and because DF is
parallel to EG, /LDF=zDGE; therefore ZLDF = /GED;
but because DF is parallel to EG, /EDF= ZGED ; therefore
 ZLDF=/EDF.
    In like manner it may be          shown that ZKDE = ZEDF;
therefore the lines DF and DE        trisect the angle KDL.
     I have made this instrument of lance-wood, with brass pivots.
The links are each 8 inches long, ^ of an inch in width, and
•j-^ths   of an inch in thickness. By means of this instrument,
any angle not much exceeding two right angles and not less than
nine degrees, may be at once trisected with great precision ; but
by an obvious mathematical artifice it may be used for the tri
section of angles, however small or large they may be.
    It is scarcely neces
sary to observe, that
all general methods
for the multisection
of a given arc can only
be approximate.        In
such cases there can
be no objection to the
use of approximate
methods of construc
tion, provided that
they are given as such.
By the following me
thod of construction,
a given     arc may be
divided into any num
ber of equal parts,
with an approach to
truth which is only
limited by the inac

              On certain Laws    of Chromatic Dispersion.           263
curacies   necessarily involved in the drawing of lines through
points formed by the intersection of straight lines or circular
arcs.
     Let it be required to divide the given          arc   ABD,   whose
centre is C, into any number of equal parts.            (In the example
here given, the arc is divided into seven equal parts.)
    First approximation. —Bisect the given arc in G, and draw
the chord A G.       Through A draw the diameter ACB, and divide
it into n equal parts in the points 1, 2, 3, &c. Bisect the chord
A G by the perpendicular F C 0 ; from A and B as centres, with
the diameter A B as radius, describe arcs cutting each other in
 K ; and from the centre C, with C K as a radius, describe the
arc K 0, cutting F C 0 in 0.         Through the point 2 draw 2E
parallel to 0 F, meeting A G in E ; and through E and 0 draw
the straight line 0 E a, meeting the arc in a ; then A a will be
 approximately the nth part of the arc A G B D, but which may
 be determined with greater precision as follows.
    Second approximation. — Take off the chord A a in the com
 passes, and apply it on the arc A G D proceeding from a towards
 D ; let A: be the last point in the division ; apply this chord from
 D to p, and join p C. Bisect A 1 mm; from the centre C, with
 Um as a radius, describe an arc cutting Cp in e; through e
 draw e n parallel to C k, cutting the arc in the point n ; then D n
 will be practically the nth part of the given arc A G B D, as
required.
    When the number of parts into which the given arc is to be
 divided is considerable, especially when the arc is equal to or
 nearly equal to the whole circumference of the circle, the second
 operation in the foregoing process becomes necessary in order to
 attain a sufficient degree of accuracy.
    The proposition contained in the first approximation is a
 generalization of a well-known method, sometimes employed by
 practical men, for the division of the whole circumference of the
 circle into a given number of equal parts.

         XXXIV.     On certain Laws     of Chromatic Dispersion.
                    By Mungo Ponton, F.R.S.E.
                          [Continued from p. 181.]
               a view to an examination     of the results arrived at in
 WITHthe previous         part  of  this paper, it will be found con
 venient   to classify the observations.        Fraunhofer has fortu
 nately given two sets of observations for water, and also for
 flint-glass No. 23 ; and from these a judgment may be formed
 of the degree of accuracy attainable.       It will be found that, while
                                    T2

264                 Mr. M. Ponton on certain Laws
 the two sets agree very closely, this agreement does not extend
 beyond the fourth place of decimals ; so that in no case can the
 fifth and sixth places of decimals, as given by observation, be
 depended on, while it is needful to carry the indices to the sixth
 place of decimals in order to their fulfilling with exactness the
 exponential law.    But if the observed indices be correct down to
 the fourth place of decimals, the exponential law, in combination
 with the laws governing the extrusions, may be relied on for the
 fifth and sixth places.
     It is proposed, then, to consider all those observations in
 which, when tested by these laws, no individual error amounts
 to 0-0001, as of the first order, greater accuracy of observation
 being unattainable ; those in which no individual error amounts
 to 0-0002, as of the second order ; those in which no individual
 error amounts to 0"0003, as of the third order, and so on.
     As regards Fraunhofer' s observations, it will be found that, of
 the whole twelve, there are of the first order seven ; namely,
water (two sets), solution of potash, oil of turpentine, and three
 specimens of crown-glass ; while there are of the second order
five, all of them on flint-glass.
     With respect to Rudberg's ten observations on doubly-refract
ing media, there are of the first order seven, namely, topaz
2nd axis, quartz ex. ray; Arragonite 1st axis, quartz 0. ray;
topaz 3rd axis, calc-spar 0. ray; topaz 1st axis: and of the
second order three, namely, Arragonite 3rd axis, calc-spar ex.
ray, and Arragonite 2nd axis.
     With Powell's observations the results are not so satisfactory ;
but that the discrepancies which they present are due, not to any
peculiarity in the media, nor to any defect in the exponential law,
but simply to the inaccuracy of the observations themselves, may
be clearly shown.      It fortunately happens that we have a set of
observations by Powell on water, on which we have two sets by
Fraunhofer. While the two latter agree very closely with each
other, and quite as closely with the exponential law, both being
of the first order, those of Powell are so inaccurate that they can
be classed only as of the eighth order.     Now this difference can
be attributed to no other cause whatever than to the inferior
accuracy of Powell's observations ; for it appears highly impro
bable that it should be due to the difference of temperature at
which the observations were made.        In the case of solution of
potash, on which we have also observations both by Fraunhofer
and Powell, and at temperatures more widely apart, the difference
in quality between the two sets is much less marked ; for while
those of Fraunhofer are of the first order, those of Powell are

Powell are so very inferior to those of Fraunhofer, it should not
occasion surprise to find that in some instances this inferiority is
still more marked, and that some of Powell's observations, when
tested by the exponential law, should be classed as only of the
tenth order.        Of this we have an example in the case of nitrate
of potash, which is of low dispersive power, and should therefore
have presented no peculiar difficulties.             But this case belongs to
a class of observations of which the observer himself says, that
the media being of low dispersive power, and considered by him
of little importance, the calculations were in consequence carried
to only a slight degree of approximation.                  So far, then, from
the discrepancies, in the case of nitrate of potash, tending to
shake confidence in the exponential law of the indices, they
ought to be regarded as strengthening its probability, by show
ing it to be capable of detecting the errors in these observations
which might otherwise have escaped notice, seeing that, in con
formity with the observed indices, nitrate of potash belongs to
the class of regular media ; and there is no other test by which
the errors could have been brought to light.
    This example shows that, with reference to any general law of
dispersion, no medium ought to be viewed as of small import
ance, but that the same attention should be given to secure
accuracy in media of low, as in those of high dispersive power.
    Of the twenty-nine observations by Powell which have been
tested by the exponential law of the indices, there is not one
that can be classed as of the first order— a fact sufficiently indi
cative of their general inferiority.           There are, however, thirteen,
or nearly one-half, which are of the second order, and may there
fore be regarded as fair observations.              These are —
Sulphate of magnesia.       Nitrate of bismuth.          Superacetate of lead.
Solution of potash.         Nitrate of lead.             Nitric acid.
Sulphate of soda.           Subacetate of lead.          Oil of sassafras.
Alcohol.                    Muriate of ammonia.          Oil of anise, T. 13°-25.
and the same at temp. 20o,9.              There are five of the third order,
muriatic acid, nitrate of mercury, muriate of lime, rock-salt, and
oil of anise, temp. 15°-8.          There are two of the fourth order —
 sulphuric acid and creosote ; three of the fifth order— pyrolig-
neous acid, bisulphuret of carbon, and muriate of baryta ; one of
the sixth order — oil of cassia, temp. 14°; two of the seventh
order — solution of soda, and oil of cassia, temp. 10°; one of
the eighth order — water, temp. 15°-8; one of the ninth order
— oil of cassia, temp. 22°"5 ; and one of the tenth order — solu
tion of nitrate of potash.          From this enumeration it is clear
that there is no connexion between the amount of error and the
dispersive power of the medium, seeing we have media of low

   266                Mr. M. Ponton    on certain Laws
   and high dispersive power indifferently among the best and the
    worst cases.
       In the three sets of observations, there are fourteen of the first
   order, in which the agreement with the exponential law may be
   considered perfect ; and there are twenty-one of the second order,
   in which the agreement may be regarded as nearly complete.
    These together amount to thirty-five out of the fifty-one, or better
   than two-thirds of the whole.       To these may be added the five
    of the third order, in which the agreement may be considered fair,
   thus making four-fifths of the whole, in which the observed and
•
   calculated indices agree as nearly as can be reasonably expected.
       The whole errors in Fraunhofer's twelve observations amount
    to 0-003449, or 0-000287 per medium, and 0-000041 per line.
    In Rudberg's ten observations, the sum total of the errors is
   0-003204, or 0 000320 per medium, or 0-000046 per line, so
   that these two sets are nearly equal in quality.          In Powell's
   twenty-nine observations,    the  total errors amount   to  0-034400,
   or about 0-001180 per medium, and 0 000170 per line ; so that,
   in general accuracy, Fraunhofer's observations are to Powell's
   nearly in the ratio of 4 to 1.
       That the whole of the discrepancies between the observed in
   dices and those calculated by the exponential law are due, not to
   any defect or inaccuracy in that law, but solely to inaccuracies
   in the observations, it is not difficult to show.     As regards the
   fourteen observations of the first order, there can be no doubt
   whatever.     With respect to those of the second order, it fortu
   nately happens that the two sets of observations on oil of anise,
   at temp. 13°25 and temp. 20O-9, are both of this order, and
   agree very nearly, — the cumulo errors in the former being
   0-000393, and in the latter 0 000387.         But the observations on
   the same medium, at the intermediate temperature 15°-1, are of
   only the third order, — the cumulo errors being 0-000748, about        .
   double of those in the former cases. Now this difference can arise
   from no other cause than a difference in the degree of accuracy
   with which the observations were made; so that there is here a
   difference in the amount of error, arising simply from an inferior
   degree of accuracy in the observations, equal to the total amount
   of error in the two best observations on oil of anise, thus show
  ing that these latter errors must themselves be due to defective
  observation.     But it is equally clear that the greater errors in
  the worst set must also arise from inaccurate observations ; for
  had these been made with the same care as the two first, they
  would have been of the same quality.           It may hence be fairly
  inferred, that in all the observations, thirty- seven in number, in
  which the cumulo differences do not exceed 0'000748, these are
  due to incorrect observations.

                      of Chromatic Dispersion.                    267
   Among the fourteen media in which the discrepancies are
greater, there is found water, as observed by Powell, in which
the total errors amount to no less than 0*001916; whereas in
Fraunhofer's two sets of observations on this medium, their
amounts are 0 0001 54 and 0 000205, — Powell's discrepancies
exceeding the least of Fraunhofer's by 0*001762, an excess which
can be due to nothing but a difference in the degree of accuracy
with which the observations were made.       Thus the total discre
pancies of 0*001916 in Powell's observations on water are clearly
traceable to experimental inaccuracy.     But the total discrepan
cies in the case of Powell's observations on oil of cassia, temp.
14°, very little exceed this amount, being 0*001984; so that
these may also be fairly attributed to the same cause.      Now the
reasoning applicable in the case of the oil of anise applies equally
to the observations on oil of cassia at temp. 10° and temp.
22°*5.    The discrepancies in these two cases amount respectively
to 0*003750 and 0*003529, or not far from double of what they
are at the intermediate temperature 14°.      This difference can be
attributed to nothing but the inferior accuracy with which the
observations at temp. 10° and temp. 22°*5 were made ; and had
only the same amount of care been bestowed on these as on those
made at temp. 14°, the gross amount of discrepancies would not
have exceeded those presented in the latter case, which have
already been shown to be due to experimental error.          Thus the
extreme amount of the discrepancies in the case of oil of cassia,
temp. 10°, may be logically traced to defective observation ; and
these discrepancies being the greatest in the Table, it may hence
be quite fairly inferred that all those of lower amount ought to
be attributed to the same cause.
   The indices, calculated by the exponential law from the four
teen observations of the first order, may be regarded as being
quite as correct as they can be possibly obtained.       Those calcu
lated from the twenty-one observations of the second order may
be deemed very nearly correct ; while those calculated from the
five observations of the third order may be viewed as fair ap
proximations to the truth.      It is,however, too much to expect
of the exponential law that   it  should yield accurate indices from
the eleven observations of an order inferior to the third.         No
mathematical law whatever can bring forth accurate results from
incorrect observations where the errors exceed      a   certain limit
                                                                    ;
the utmost that can be expected in such      a   caseis, that the law
should indicate the probable position and amount of the errors of
observation, and exhibit the necessity for more careful repetition.
It    in this light, then, that the calculated indices of these eleven
     is
cases ought to be regarded.
   This point must be kept in view in examining the question,

  268                  Mr. M. Ponton          on certain    Laws
  how    far the peculiarities observed in some of the media, as
  respects the number and position of the nodes of the extrusions,
  may be traceable to errors of observation.
     In the case of sulphuric acid, these peculiarities are removed
  by the entire extinction of the extrusions, under the operation of
 the exponential law.          But the extrusions are brought to assume,
  by  virtue  of this   law,  the   regular type in the following cases, in
  which the observed indices cause them to appear quite irregular,
 namely, muriatic acid, alcohol, solution of soda, pyroligneous
 acid, and oil of anise, temp. 15°.              See end of Table IV., where
 the extrusions of these media are given as they appear after the
 indices have been corrected by the exponential law.
     The removal of the irregularity in the extrusions, by the ope
 ration of this law, is particularly noticeable in the case of oil of
 anise ; for there is thus made to disappear from this medium the
 apparent anomaly of its having its extrusions regular at temp.
 13°-25 and temp. 20°-9, but irregular at temp. 150,1, they being
 thus rendered regular at all the three temperatures.
     It is interesting to note in this particular case the effect of the
 exponential law on the values of e, the index of elasticity, as
 viewed in relation to the temperature.               These values become —
                                                                    Diff.
              Temp. 13°-25        e  = 1-478427           .    .   1044
                 „      15°-1              1-477383       .    .  3898
                 „      20°-9              1-473485       .    .  4942
     These differences are not far from being proportional to the
 differences of temperature, but they may be brought into that
 precise ratio by a further slight alteration on the indices of refrac
 tion, while these latter may be at the same time preserved obe
 dient to the exponential law.                This end may be attained by
 making the values of log e„ and an stand thus : —
              Temp. 13°-25 log          e„ 0-1857298 a„ 0-006160,
              Temp. 15°-1        log    e„ 0-1857412 a„ 0 006303,
and           Temp. 20°-9        log   e„  0-1847219     an  0 006350.
 The values of     e  then become
                                                                 Diff.
                 Temp. 13°-25         e  1-478482      .     .   1181
                     „     15°1          1-477301      .     .   3733
                     „     20°-9         1-473568      .     .   4914
These differences        are in exact proportion to the differences of
temperature,      while   the values of e themselves are in the inverse
order of the temperature, thus strictly fulfilling the law.
    The indices of refraction thus corrected will be found at the

                         of Chromatic Dispersion.                           269
end of Table VI., and may be regarded as more accurate than
 those calculated from the exponential law alone.             It thus appears
that when observations are made at more than two different tem
peratures and with sufficient accuracy, they furnish data whence
the indices of refraction may be calculated so as to fulfil all those
three laws, namely, the exponential law, the law of regular ex
trusions, and the law of temperature, as affecting the index of
elasticity. When the indices of refraction fulfil these three con
ditions, they may be regarded as nearly quite correct.
    In reference to the law of temperature, it will of course be
understood that it is the differences of expansion under the in
fluence of temperature, rather than the differences of the degrees
of temperature themselves, to which the differences in the value
of the index of elasticity must correspond.
    To the effects of the exponential law, in bringing the extrusions
into conformity with the regular type, a solitary exception is
presented in the case of the oil of cassia.          The singleness of this
exception, however, raises a strong presumption that all media
whatever conform to the same regular type as respects their ex
trusions, and that the apparent departure in the case of the oil
of cassia is due solely to errors of observation.          This is rendered
the more probable by the fact of the proved existence of large
errors in the observed indices of this medium ; by the anomaly
that, at the intermediate temperature, it has a higher exponent
than at the higher and lower temperatures ; and by the circum
stance that the corrections deducible from the exponential law
tend greatly to reduce, though not quite to remove, the irre
gularity in the extrusion of 6, in which the departure of this
medium from the regular type consists.
    It would not be difficult to find for the oil of cassia a set of
indices of refraction which, while fulfilling the exponential law,
should at the same time render the extrusions regular, and also
fulfil the law of temperature as respects the index of elasticity,
taking advantage for this purpose of the analogies furnished by
the oil of anise*.       Owing, however, to the inherent inaccuracy
   * There seems to be some intimate connexion between the value of n,
the exponent of least extrusion, and the position assumed by the nodes of
the extrusions with the first powers of the normals.      Thus, in the case of
the oil of cassia, when the value of n is 3"4 or & 5, the position of the lower
node is considerably on the H side of G.      But if the exponent be gradu
ally lowered, the node will remove further and further from H, until, when
the value of n is 2-9, the node nearly coincides with G itself.      But when
the exponent is still further reduced, the position of the node gradually
advances towards F, and the extrusions then present the regular type.
This is a point which invites further investigation ; but for this purpose it
would be needful to have a more accurate set of observations on oil of
cassia.
   There seems to be also some probability that the position of the upper

270                 Mr. M. Ponton on certain Laws
of the observations on oil of cassia, those indices could be regarded
only as approximations to the truth ; and such a result would
hardly justify detention from a more important branch of this
inquiry, namely, the institution of a comparison between the laws
brought to light by the foregoing investigation, and the well-
known hypothesis of M. Cauchy.
   Suffice it meanwhile to have shown the high probability that
in every case the extrusions and the laws governing them are of
one uniform character, — a circumstance adding greatly to their
interest and their importance as one of the means available for
checking the accuracy of the indices, seeing that any departure
from this normal type may be regarded as a very strong pre
sumption of inaccuracy in the indices.
   It remains, then, to compare the results obtained from the
exponential law of the indices with those deducible from the
hypothesis of M. Cauchy, "that the differences between the
refractive indices of the medium are to each other very nearly as
the differences between the reciprocals of the squares of the
normal wave-lengths ; or the refractive indices are each com
posed of two terms, whereof one is constant for the medium and
temperature, the other reciprocally proportional to the squares
of the normal wave-lengths."
   It is on the basis of this law that the indices in Powell's
Tables have been calculated.          Those of the three lines B, F, and
H are assumed from observation ; and those of the four lines C,
D, E, and G are thence calculated by means of formula? based
on the above law.
   In order to exhibit more perfectly the differences between the
results thus obtained and those derived from the law of a variable
exponent, whose value depends on the proportion which the
irrationality bears to the dispersion, the indices, as calculated
from the law of M. Cauchy, are given in Table IX., being ex
tracted from Powell's Tables ; and the sums of the errors are
compared with those arising under the exponential law.
   Fully to appreciate the superiority of the latter, it is well to
select a case in which the law of M. Cauchy wholly breaks down.
For this purpose the highly dispersive medium, bisulphuret of
carbon, will suffice.     In this medium, the discrepancies arising
under the law of M. Cauchy, between the observed and the cal
culated indices for the four lines C, D, E, and 6, are
nC_0-000800,    ^D-0-001700,     *-E -0-002000,    '"G 0-004400, S+0-008900.
The discrepancies arising on the         seven  lines under the exponen-
node between C and D may be found to coincide with that of the mean
wave M, whose refractive index is that for white light ; but this, too, is a
point requiring further research.

                         of Chromatic Dispeision.                        271
 tial law, the exponent for this medium being          25,  are
^B+0-000143,    f»C- 0-000252,  ^D+0-000047,   ^E-OOOOllO,     ^F-0  000295,
      *G-0  000439,   "H+0-O0O39O,    S+0O01675.
 So that the sum total of these latter is less than the amount of the
 single error in D in the former case, and less than a fifth of the
 total errors arising under the law of M. Cauchy ; consequently, in
 this important medium, the ratio in favour of the exponential law,
 as compared with that of M. Cauchy, is more than 5 to 1.                The
 difference is still more striking if the individual discrepancies be
 compared, — the highest arising under the exponential law being
 only a tenth of that arising under Cauchy's law, the latter dis
 crepancy, moreover, being far too large to be attributed to errors
 of observation ; while those arising under the exponential law
 are all of such moderate magnitude, that there can be no hesita
tion in ascribing them to that cause.
     From an inspection of Table IX. it will be seen that, as respects
 Fraunhofer's observations, the agreement between the calculated
 and observed indices is as 2 to 1 in favour of the exponential
law*. In Rudberg's observations the ratio is as 4 to 3, and in
 Powell's as 10 to 7, while from the three sets combined it is as
 6 to 4.    But the best criteridn of judgment is furnished by those
 media which have a high dispersive and extrusive power, and in
which the law of M. Cauchy entirely fails, presenting discrepancies
far too great to be attributed to experimental error. Such are
 those in the case of the bisulphuret of carbon above noted ; such
are also the large discrepancies in the case of the oil of cassia,
ranging between 0 001 7 and 0-0029, while the largest indivi
 dual discrepancy arising under the exponential law is under 0 001 .
In some few instances it will be observed that the result appears
to be in favour of the law of M. Cauchy, but these anomalies are
all clearly traceable to experimental error.              Looking at the
results as a whole, there can be no doubt that the decided supe
riority rests with the exponential law, as being the true law of the
indices.
    The great defect in the hypothesis of M. Cauchy is its failure
to accommodate itself to the phaenomenon of irrationality and the
attendant extrusion of the fixed lines.         Its apparent agreement
with observation in a considerable number of cases, arises simply
from the circumstance that, with the squares of the normals, the
extrusions are in those cases so small that they may be elimi
nated without greatly affecting the indices ; and it is only when
   *  It must be kept in view, in examining this Table, that the normals on
which Powell's calculations are based differ slightly from those specified in
this paper ; but this circumstance does not materially affect the general
results.

272               Mr. G. B. Jerrard's Remarks on
the dispersive    and extrusive powers of the medium are large
that its inapplicability becomes manifest.
   The exponential law, on the other hand, entirely overcomes
the difficulty arising out of the irrationality j because it shows
that in each medium there           is,
                                  dependent on the proportion which
the irrationality bears to the dispersive power,   certain exponent

reduction of the general equation to the trinomial one, no such
function is introduced.

   2. Postscript. — Since writing these lines,          I
                                                    have seen a paper
by  Mr.  Cockle    in  the  Philosophical Magazine for the present
month. The objection which attaches to his method from the
absence of quintic surds is not overlooked.       But, instead of con
fining  himself   to  the  elucidation of the origin of an error, the
existence of which is so obvious, he goes on to infer, from the
failure of his method, the impossibility of effecting, except in a
limited number of cases, the algebraical resolution of equations
of the fifth degree,— a result in the accuracy of which           I
                                                                cannot
concur.    It is true that all methods of solution, if equally general,
must ultimately coincide.        The success of one involves the suc
cess of all*.    The failure of one the failure of all. It        how is,
ever, far otherwise with respect to methods subject to conditions
not necessarily, or rather not universally, inherent in the subject.
   3. But  I   come                                 forward as his
weightiest objection to my method.        He says, " The error of
Mr. Jerrard inheres, in my opinion, in his mode of comparing

    deacon    of Calcutta.
    To   the  Editors of    the  Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       Gentlemen,
             question    I have placed at the head of this paper, Prof.
THEHaughton             has answered in the affirmative in his paper in
the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy, vol. xxii. p. 251,
" On the Original and Actual Fluidity of the Earth and Planets."
If  this conclusion be correct, it must render altogether useless
such investigations as that by Mr. Hopkins regarding the thick
ness of the earth's crust.           This consideration invests Professor
 Haughton's conclusion with so much importance, that it demands
attentive examination.           It was upon this ground that pointed    I
 out in your Number for May 1859, what conceived to be — and
                                                        I
 still conceive to be— a fallacy in the reasoning which brought out
 this conclusion. In his last paper, in your Number for December,
which reached me yesterday, Professor Haughton does not, in my
 view, clear away the difficulty.
    2. In his original communication to the Irish Academy he
deduces the following equation (I here use his own notation) : —

Two lines further on he states that this is "independent of
the law of density and ellipticity of the solid parts of the earth."

                                                   ' Essay,' this second mode      of
arriving at the equation
                                S/-r{P/«».)}=0
presented itself to my mind.        But  I did not like  to deviate too widely from
the route I had taken in 1845.

                       Fluidity   of the Mass of the Earth.                                 275
     It   is this last statement which               I   controvert.           In my    paper
in your Number for May last (page 329, line 23), I assert that
equation (13) "assumes that the law of density and ellipticity is
continuous throughout the whole mass, solid and fluid, the solid
parts lying in strata of the form and density they would have if
they were wholly fluid."
    3. Professor Haughton, in your Number now received, replies
to my reasoning by showing that he has differentiated equa
tion (12) right.                  I
                    This never called in question.    " The ques
tion at issue
               " between us is not, as his " mathematical friend "
states, "to determine a rule for differentiating this equation
 [viz. (12)] with regard to a." What I assert         that certain        is,
terms of the differentiated equation will not cancel each other
so as to produce equation (13), unless we make such an assump
tion as involves this principle, — That the same law of density
and ellipticity belongs to the solid and fluid parts.   This will                  I
now show more fully.
   4. I  would first, however, observe that equations (12), (13)
apply equally to the solid and fluid portions of the mass. Equation
(12) expresses the law, that the resultant of all the forces acting
on any particle       at right angles to the layer or surface in which
                       is
the particle lies.    This law     essential to the equilibrium of the
                                          is
fluid part.       It also tacitly taken to be true for the solid parts
                       is
by   Professor Haughton.        For he differentiates equation (12)
with respect to       and therefore assumes that equation (12) holds
                        a,
at the immediate neighbourhood, on both sides, of the surface to
which a belongs. In the case in which this surface                 the                 is
bounding surface between the solid and fluid parts, the mass                                  is
solid on one side and fluid on the other. Hence equation (12)
applies to both the solid and fluid portions.
   5. To banish the integrals from equation (12) and obtain
equation (13), we must multiply by a8, differentiate with respect
to a, divide      by
                  a4, and differentiate   again.   The result    equa              is
tion (13). The first differentiation produces, from the second
term,     a   term —              an<l,   from the third term,        a   term + ^pa5
                       jPa&^ >
It    assumed that these terms cancel each other.
     is                                            So also the
second differentiation produces, from the second term,    term                     a
+    pT:

               and, from the third             term,   a   term   +   p

                                                                                 These       are

assumed to be equal to each other                      that               is    assumed       to
                                                                    ^

have the same value on both sides of the surface of which      the                 a    is
mean radius.   This will be the case when this surface      one of                is
the layers wholly within the fluid, or wholly within the solid
part, even though the laws of density and ellipticity of the fluid

276     On the Solidity and   Fluidity of the  Mass  of the Earth.
and solid parts are different.     But it will not be the case at the
bounding surface between the solid and fluid parts, unless the
             de
values  of p-r-, derived from the law of the fluid and from the law
             da
of the solid layers, are the same at this bounding surface.        As p
is some function of a, e is some function of a (as equation (13)
 <
                    de
shows) ; hence p        is some function    of p only.    Hence, then,
                    ^
the laws of density of the solid and fluid layers may be different, as
far as the reasoning at present has carried us ; but the two laws
must give the same amount of density at the bounding surface,
otherwise equation (13) does not follow from equation (12).
    6. Thus tar, then, this is the result we are come to.           The
mass consists   of solid  layers following   a certain law  of density,
and of fluid layers following the same or another law of density ;
but at the surface where they meet the density is the same.
Also the resultant force acting at any point of any layer, solid
or fluid, is at right angles to that layer.
   7. Now the equilibrium of this mass will not be disturbed if
the first solid layer, reckoning from the inner surface towards
the outer one, become fluid, retaining its density.        For the den
sity of that one layer accords with the fluid law, and the forces
acting on the layer are perpendicular to its surface.
    Equation (13), therefore, holds for the bounding surface be
tween the first and second solid layers only on the same terms
that it holds for the bounding surface between the solid and
fluid portions. From this it follows that the density of the second
solid layer must follow the fluid law, and so in succession with
all the rest ; and therefore the law of density of the solid and
fluid portions must be the same throughout the whole mass, if
equation (13) is a correct inference from equation (12).
   8. This result appears to me to be a priori evident without
this proof. For Professor Haughton will acknowledge that the
equilibrium of the fluid parts will hold, if the solid parts do fol
low the law of the fluid parts.      But if any different distribution
of the solid parts take place, their resultant attraction on the
fluid cannot possibly be the same as before on every particle of
the fluid.    The conditions of equilibrium would therefore not
hold, and   the  equilibrium would become impossible without a
change.
   9. With regard to the other subject touched upon in Professor
Haughton's last paper —the argument drawn from the Himma-
laya Mountains, and the Ocean south of India, in my paper in
your Number for November — I will simply make the following
observations.

                  M. Espenschied            on   Nitride of Selenium.                  277
,
   (1) The mountain mass must not be considered as one rigid
mass of rock without natural joints.          The Himmalaya Moun
tains are far too irregular in their structure, and too full of gigantic
cracks and joints in all directions to allow of our applying the
principle of the arch in the way Professor Haughton suggests.
Moreover, if the cross strain in his arch, of 500 miles span and
thickness of only one quarter of a mile at the spring, i3 not suffi
cient to compress the materials of the rock, it will surely break
off angles, as        I
                    have mentioned in art. 2, p. 346 of the paper
alluded to, and a catastrophe would ensue.
   (2) If Professor Haughton will not admit this, and still thinks
-
that the principles of the arch should be applied to the crust
under the Himmalayas, what will he say to the second part of
my paper, in which the upward effect of the ocean is considered ?
Here the arch cannot possibly act.
   (3) Professor Haughton notices a mistake                     I
                                                 made in omitting
a 2 in my calculation; but he observes that, as it does not
seriously affect my result, he lays no stress upon it. This mis
take   (which also occurs,             I
                               fear, in a treatise on "Attraction,
Laplace's Coefficients, and   the Figure of the Earth," which by
this time       is,
                suppose, published)
                I                       detected about
                                                  I      month ago,     a
when     was too late to correct it.   The calculation, however, in
which  it it
          occurs    not to find the actual thickness of the crust,
                          is
as will be obvious to my readers, but only to show that        very          it   is
thick. Where the mistake occurs in your Journal, the result                             I
bring out     that the thickness of the crust in the middle of the
                is
mass and at the end       581 and 576 miles
                                is               whereas   the mis

the great thickness seriously, but in fact not at all.

undergoes no change at 150°, but explodes at 200°.                   It is ex
tremely explosive ; the smallest pressure causes a detonation.               It
also explodes when placed in chlorine, or in hydrochloric acid.
It is dissolved by nitric acid with formation of ammonia and
selenious acid.     By treatment with potass, ammonia is liberated,
and selenate and selenide of potassium formed.              Hypochlorite of
soda converts it into selenate of soda, with liberation of hydrogen.
Heated with water in a sealed tube to 150° — 160°, it is completely
changed into ammonia, selenious acid, and pure selenium.
   Espenschied's analyses did not give very concordant results.
The mean numbers obtained were, selenium 83'69, nitrogen
16 33, which corresponds pretty closely to Se2 N.                  The body,
however, most likely contains hydrogen,             and  the   formula
                    Se6  N8 H =   Se2  NH + 2 Se2 N,
which Espenschied considers probable, requires selenium, 84*57 ;
nitrogen, 15-07; hydrogen, 0*36.
   Experiments by Espenschied to obtain a corresponding tellu
rium compound have not given the expected results. Chloride
of tellurium, TeCl2, absorbs ammonia, forming a greenish-yellow
mass which is not deliquescent.            It consists of TeCl2 + 2NH8*.
   Ufer has investigated nitride of chromium            f.     In preparing it
he tried several methods, but found none superior to Schrotter's,
¦which   consists in passing ammoniacal gas over sesquichloride of
chromium heated to a high temperature.                  The violet chloride
gradually changes, becomes first dark green, and ultimately
black. Vapours of chloride of ammonium are given off, and
when these cease to appear, the reaction is complete.                  At the
close  of  the experiment, as high a heat          is required as    the  tube
will bear.     The decomposition       is thus expressed     : —

                   M.*Ufer on Nitride of Ckromiurff.
    Nitride of chromium contains some undecomposed sesquichlo*
ride which cannot be removed completely by its being heated in
ammonia.       Ufer purified it by an application of an observation
of Peligot.     That chemist found that a very small quantity of
protochloride of chromium can convert a large quantity of the
insoluble violet chloride into the soluble modification. Accord'
ingly by digesting the impure nitride with zinc and hydro-
chloric acid, the nascent hydrogen (which does not attack,
the nitride) reduces a portion of the sesquichloride to proto
chloride, which then renders the remainder soluble ; by wash
ing the residue with water, any sesquichloride is completely
removed.
    The best method of determining the chromium is to convert
the nitride into sesquioxide by heating it in oxygen.        Ufer also
determined the chromium by fusing the nitride with carbonate of
soda and nitre, and estimating the chromic acid thus formed by
obvious methods.       The analyses gave as a mean result 79*1 per
cent, chromium, and 209 per cent, nitrogen ; agreeing well with
the formula NCr8, which requires 79-2 chromium, and 20*8
nitrogen..     Schrotter assigned to this substance the formula
 N2Cr5.      But it is probable that Schrotter' s preparation con
tained some undecomposed chloride.          Ufer's formula for nitride
 of chromium is rendered probable,      not only by his analysis, but
by the mode of its formation, which is further quite analogous
to the formation of nitride of boron from boracic acid and
 ammonia.
                      B03+NH8=3HO+BN.
    Nitride of chromium is     a black amorphous powder.        It has
 the remarkable     property (which  it  shares with  analogous  com
 pounds    of tungsten)   of decomposing    ammoniacal    gas into  its
 constituents when passed over it at a high temperature ; and
in its preparation, towards the close of the operation, there is a
 moment in which the smell of ammoniacal gas is no longer
perceived, but instead of it nitrogen and hydrogen gases
appear.
    Nitride of chromium is     a very permanent    body. It is with
 difficulty attacked by the strongest acids.      Heated in the air, it
is converted into oxide of chromium. It is not attacked by fusing
 caustic potash, nor by fused carbonate of soda ; but heated with
aqueous potash in a sealed tube to 190° it is converted into
 chromate, and when fused with nitre a deflagration takes place*
 It is dissolved by alkaline hypochlorites with disengagement of
 nitrogen gas.
    When gently heated in a current of chlorine, small explosions
 at first take place, probably arising from the formation of some

   When nitride of chromium, placed in a covered crucible and
covered with a layer of borax, is heated in a blast furnace, it is
converted into metallic chromium, a small residue of nitride of
chromium being left.
   M. Degousse, a goldbeater in Paris, has succeeded* in pre
paring aluminium in fine plates like gold or silver.      The opera
tion of beating is effected in the usual manner, but it is neces
sary that the reheating be more frequent ; the fire of a chauffer
is most suitable.      Aluminium-leaf may replace silver in many
cases ; its white, though less brilliant, is more durable.
   Wohlerf has the following remarks on Degousse's leaf-alumi
nium.     It is readily combustible ; if held in the edge of a spirit-
lamp   flame,  it takes fire and burns with great brilliancy. It is
very thin ; a cubic inch only weighs a milligramme.       If a leaf of
it be pressed together, placed in a bulb and heated by means of
a spirit-lamp in a current of oxygen, it burns instantaneously
with a dazzling lightning-like appearance.        The resultant alu
mina is fused, and as hard as corundum. Aluminium wire also
burns in oxygen like iron ; but the combustion does not proceed
far, for the next parts melt away before they have reached the
temperature of combustion.        Aluminium in the compact form
does not decompose water, but the leaf, when placed in boiling
water, decomposes a sufficient quantity to enable the hydrogen
to be collected.     The metal assumes at first a faint bronze sur
face colour.     After several hours' boiling, the laminae become
partially translucent, that    is,converted into alumina.      If the
residue be treated with hydrochloric acid, the uuoxidized metal
is dissolved, while the alumina remains undissolved.
   Several of the noble metals, but more especially platinum in
the finely divided state, have the property of causing    disen a
gagement    of  oxygen  when  placed in solution of peroxide of
hydrogen. For this enigmatical phsenomenon Schonbein                %   sug
gests an explanation based on the following reactions.

          Action of Platinum-black on Peroxide                 of Hydrogen.                    281
    1. Guaiacum resin solution gives with free as well as com
bined ozonized oxygen a very delicate blue colour, while the
active oxygen of peroxide of hydrogen and of the antozonides
are without action upon it.         But when platinum-black is added
to a solution of guaiacum which contains peroxide of hydrogen,
an intense blue colour is formed.
   2. Ether dissolves peroxide of hydrogen without being affected
by  it,  while free or combined ozonized oxygen at once renders                                 it
acid.     Now     ifan ethereal solution of peroxide, and which at
once gives an intense blue with chromic acid, be agitated with
platinum-black,          loses the property of giving
                          it                                   blue with       a

words, the layers of peroxide next the platinum would form ordi
nary oxygen and water.          After this catalysis, the     of another 0
portion of peroxide in contact with the platinum would be
changed into          0,
                     which would decompose with another portion
of peroxide of hydrogen into water and oxygen, and so on.                                       A
 small quantity of platinum might thus decompose an indefinite
quantity of peroxide.
    To saturate ether with peroxide of ethyle, Schonbein uses the

                                                                       is is

to stand.      This ethereal solution, poured off from the chloride of

 potash, and has indeed all the reactions of peroxide.          It may be
 distilled without alteration. When volume of                shaken with

282          Action of Light on Amylaceous       Substances.
    If two 1 per cent, solutions of starch be prepared under the
same circumstances, and if one of them be kept in the dark and
the other exposed to the sunlight, the latter will be found to
exert an action on the polarizing apparatus ; more dextrine and
sugar have been formed.         If very weak solutions be taken (about
         an^ exPosed to the sunlight for about eighteen hours, it
iv^ts)
will be found that the solution has lost the properties of the
original amylum, and more resembles inuline.
    Many substances, such as lactate or citrate of iron, and cor
rosive sublimate, limit or neutralize this action of the light;
while other substances, such as potassio-tartrate of iron, or nitrate
of uranium, greatly increase it.
    Dextrine and cane-sugar are unaffected by light.
 '
    There is a curious action on oxalic acid.       If  a 4 per cent, so
lution of the acid be mixed with a 1 per cent, solution of nitrate
 of uranium, and the mixture boiled for even a considerable length
 of time, provided this is done in the dark, no change takes place.
 But if the light, even of a clouded sky, have but a momentary
 action, a decomposition, evidenced by the disengagement of gas,
 at once sets in ; and if the mixture be placed in the sun, a quan
 tity of carbonic oxide may be collected.        That this action is due
 neither to the temperature nor to the free acid, is evident from
 the fact that at a temperature of zero, and with the employment
 of oxide of uranium, the same results are obtained.
     Direct experiments have shown that animal starch (glyco-
 genous substances) is more rapidly changed into sugar in the
 light than in the dark ; and, remarkably enough, nitrate of ura
 nium decreases instead of increases the action.
     It is remarkable that animal starch in frogs' liver is not
 changed into sugar in winter, which is also the case with the
 vegetable starch.
     This might explain why the sugar-forming substances which
 are so abundant in the membrane of the foetus immediately
 disappear after birth.
     It can scarcely be doubted that light plays a slow but very
 powerful part in effecting changes in the animal body ; and it is
 evident that a knowledge of the substances which accelerate or
 lesson this action is of great importance in medicine.               Th
 symptoms     of diabetes, and   the  action  which  light  has been  ob
  served to exert on scrofulous persons, may be adduced as cases
 in point.

ass&y  flask, carbonic acid is given off, and chloride of potassium
formed, with which remains associated a new body, cyaphenine.
Some benzonitryle is formed at the same time.        Cyaphenine is
volatile without decomposition, and may therefore be separated
from the chloride by heat ; or the chloride may be dissolved out
by water.
   Cyaphenine has the formula C42H15N3; it corresponds to
cyanethine,    C18H15N3, discovered by Frankland and Kolbe.
The latter body may be regarded as a triple molecule of cyanide
of ethyle, C18H15N3=3(C4H5C2N) ; so cyanethine may be
considered as a triple molecule of benzonitrile or cyanide of phe-
nyle, C42H15N3=3(C12H5C2N).                       The formation of cyaphe

phoric acid, and is diethylphosphoric acid in which the oxygen
of the radical phosphoryle is replaced by sulphur.   It is a vis
cous oily liquid, with a very sour and bitter taste.     It is a stable
body, but when heated it decomposes with formation of mercap
tan.    It forms a series of well-defined salts. The lead and zinc
salts have the peculiarity of being precipitated in oily drops, and
of solidifying when touched with a hard body. The salts, like

Tetrasulphophosphate of ethyle is an oily, clear, yellow liquid,
which is very like disulphophosphate of ethyle, but more de
composable.
   Alloxan, C8HsN209, and parabanic acid, C6H2Na06, both
products of the oxidation of uric acid, exhibit a great analogy of
properties ; both are decomposed by alkalies in a similar man
ner, and yield homologous products. By the action of reducing
bodies on alloxan, a substance, alloxantine, is formed.      Lim-
pricht  ha3 found*  that, by the action of nascent hydrogen on pa
rabanic acid, a corresponding compound, oxalantine, is formed : —
               2(C6H2N*O6) + 2H=C12H4N4O10+2HO
                   Parabanic acid.         Oxalantine.
It is prepared by adding dilute hydrochloric acid and zinc to a
solution of parabanic acid ; a slow disengagement of hydrogen
takes place, and a white crystalline compound of oxalantine and
zinc is formed. When this is treated with sulphuretted hydrogen,
and the solution evaporated, oxalantine is obtained in crystalline
crusts. It is little soluble in water, and almost insoluble in
alcohol and ether.
   Alloxan, by the action of different cyanides, undergoes differ
ent decompositions.   When treated with cyanide of potassium, dia-
lurate of potash is formed ; but if cyanide of ammonium be used,
the result, as Rosing and Schischkoff have shown f, is different.
They found that a* new body, oxalan, to which they ascribed the
formula C30 H26 N14 030, was formed in the reaction.        Liebig,
who had previously observed this reaction, examined the body J,
and found that the formation of oxalan might serve as a test for
the presence of alloxan in animal fluids.   If to a liquid contain
ing only a small quantity of alloxan, hydrocyanic acid and then
ammonia be added, a precipitate of oxalan is formed. Although
he did not propose a new formula for the body, he analysed                          it,
and pointed out that the ratio of the carbon to the nitrogen was
as   2:   1   §.
     Strecker has subsequently examined         §     the formation    of oxalan,

  and confirms the previous statements.    In its formation the pro
  portion of hydrocyanic acid is immaterial; a very small quantity
  can convert a large quantity of alloxan into oxalan.      It takes
  no part in the reaction, and merely serves as a sort of ferment.
  It is known that hydrocyanic acid effects in a similar manner the
  conversion of hydride of benzoyle into the polymeric benzoin.
 When a tolerably concentrated solution of alloxan is used, dialu-
 rate of ammonia is formed.     Strecker's analyses give for oxalan
the formula C6 H5 N3 O6 ; and he expresses its formation thus :

 Itmay be regarded as the amide of oxaluric acid, oxaluramide.
By treatment with water it is resolved into oxalurate of ammonia,
a part of which is further decomposed into oxalic acid and urea.
                 C6 H5 N3 O6 + 2 HO = NH4     0,     C6 H3 N9 O7.
                  Oxalan.                Oxalurate    of ammonia.
Compounds analogous to oxalan, but containing ethyle, methyle,
or phenyle in the place of hydrogen, may be obtained by substi
tuting in the preparation the corresponding amide base for
ammonia.
      If
      to a solution of alloxan containing hydrocyanic acid, car
bonate of potash is added to alkaline reaction, carbonic acid it
disengaged and dialuric acid separates, and the solution contains
oxalurate of potash.   Thus,
2(C8H4N908)+2HO+2KO=C8H3KNs03+C6H3KN208+2C02
      Alloxan.                         Dialurate of        Oxalurate of
<                                        potash.             potash.
Both in the   case of the decomposition of alloxan by cyanide of
 ammonium and by cyanide of potassium, the hydrogen of the
Water changes part of the alloxan into dialuric acid, while the
oxygen oxidizes a like quantity into carbonic acid and parabanic
acid.    In the presence of ammonia the parabanic acid forms
oxaluramide, in the presence of fixed alkalies an oxalurate.
   Pure ferro- and ferri-cyanide of potassium have no action on
alloxan solution ; but      if,
                           as    frequently the case, they contain
                                  is
traces of cyanide of potassium, oxaluramide      formed.  is  solu    A
tion of alloxan might accordingly be used to detect the presence
of cyanide of potassium in ferro- or ferri-cyanide of potassium.
   Streclcer suggests, and will pursue the question, whether the
poisonous action of hydrocyanic acid on the blood of vertebrate
animals may not depend on its exerting        decomposing action

    Riche* has investigated the decomposition of some bibasic
acids. When suberic acid is heated with excess of baryta, vapourB
are given off which condense into a pale yellow liquid.          On recti
fying this, it is found to consist principally of a liquid which
boik at 76°, the analyses and vapour-density of which lead to
the formula C12 H14.          Its formation may be thus expressed :—
           Ci6 His 06     2HO    + 4BaO = C12    H14  + 4BaO CO8.
              Suberic acid.               Hydrocarbon.
 It  is a mobile, highly refracting liquid, of specific gravity 0"671.
 It  is converted by chlorine into a viscous mass with disengage
 ment of hydrochloric acid. With bromine, iodine, nitric acid,
 and sulphuric acid no definite results are obtained.
     Sebacic acid distilled with excess of baryta behaves in a similar
 manner ; the reaction is very energetic, and it is necessary to mix
 the mass with a quantity of sand.            The liquid product, when
 redistilled, consists of hydrocarbon boiling at 127° C. It is a
                              a
 colourless, highly aromatic liquid, and burns with a blue-edged
 flame.     Treated with chlorine it becomes thick, and disengages
 hydrochloric acid.         Its analyses and vapour-density give for it
 the formula C16H18.             It appears to contain a little of the
 bodyC16H16.
     The formation of the hydrocarbon is thus :
           C20 H16 O6, 2 HO       + 4BaO = C           + 4BaO CO2.
                                              16
                                                  H18
           Sebacic acid.                 Hydrocarbon.
 From their composition these hydrocarbons would belong to the
  series of homologues of marsh-gas, C" H"+2. They are probably,
  however, only isomeric.          The hydrocarbon next below the one
  from suberic acid, hydride of amyle C10 H12, boils at 31° ; while
  the hydrocarbon, C12 H14, boils at 76°, and C1U H18 boils at 127°.
  It is probable that this series of bibasic acids will yield a series
  of hydrocarbons isomeric with those from the monobasic fatty
  acids.
     XXXVIII.       On Luminosity     of Meteors from Solar Reflexion.
                            By R. P. Greg, F.G.S.f
         has as yet by no means been decided from what cause arises
   IT    the luminosity of shooting-stars.         I  do not now propose to
  consider in detail all the various theories relative to this subject,
  but shall endeavour to prove that their luminosity cannot at
  least arise from solar reflexion, a theory partially supported by
     * Comptes Rendus, vol. xlix. p. 304.    Repertoire de Chimie, Jan. i860,
     f  Communicated     by the Author.

288             Mr. R. P. Greg       on Luminosity   of Meteors
Sir    J.
        Lubbock and others.         The very sudden appearance and
disappearance    of  shooting-stars     and small meteors, and their
general resemblance       on  a  small   scale to comets which shine
by solar reflexion, certainly favour the idea, either that suddenly
entering the cone of the earth's shadow they are instantly
eclipsed, or conversely, become visible as they emerge from it ;
or secondly, previously self-luminous in planetary space, they
may become suddenly extinguished on entering the denser atmo
sphere of the earth; or thirdly, they may suddenly become
visible and luminous, only on entering the earth's atmosphere by
friction and compression, by rapid absorption of oxygen and
sudden chemical action, or by electrical excitation.
   I  shall consider the first supposition most fully and in the
first instance, because          I
                               consider it may be most readily and
completely disproved.        Sir J. Lubbock, in an interesting paper
in this Magazine for February 1848, and one that has since
been frequently referred to, considers the hypothesis of solar re
flexion as a very applicable one in certain varieties of shooting-
stars : he even says, " knowing the time when, and the place
where the star disappeared, the elements of the geometry of three
dimensions furnish the means of determining the exact distance
of the body from the place of the spectator or from the centre
of the earth ;" and in his paper he gives several geometrical
equations and formulse for assisting such determinations.           I do
not propose entering into the nature of these calculations, or to
 question either the results or the data, but merely by a different
 treatment to show, if       I
                            can, how unlikely, if not impossible, it is
 that ordinary shooting-stars (I mean, of course, those not show
 ing symptoms of active ignition within the lower limits of the
 earth's atmosphere) can ever shine by reflected solar light ; and
 this simply from the fact that they would be quite too far off for
 us to observe such small bodies, at even the minimum distance
 at which (at certain times and places on the earth's surface when
 and where we know they are very frequently seen) they actually
 could be so visible.
    The problem      Ipropose then to solve      is,
                                                  what     the minimum
                                                           is
 distance at which      shooting-star could be thus visibly luminous
                         a
 seen at an angle, say of 45 degrees above the horizon (the ma
 jority of shooting-stars appearing, as         arule, to the spectator
 at even    agreater angle),     to  an  observer situate at midnight
within the tropics, or, to be more precise, at the equator, about
 the time of the vernal or autumnal equinox.

 .  Hospital*.                                                             '
               twelve months ago an Order of Council was issued
ABOUT   directing   the coffins in the vaults of the church of St. Mar-i
tin's in the Fields to be transferred to the catacombs.              A few
days  after  the  appearance    of  this order,  my   friend and colleague
Mr. Canton, in company with several other gentlemen, visited
the vaults with the view of endeavouring to find the remains of
the late celebrated surgeon, John Hunter, which were known to
have been deposited there.         The search proved successful, and
Hunter's remains were subsequently reinterred in Westminster
Abbey.
    During his visit, Mr. Canton observed that many of the leaden
coffins, although they retained their original shape, were, with
the exception of an external and exceedingly thin plate or foil of
metal, converted into an earthy-looking substance.                 Several
pieces of this substance were removed from a coffin which, there
is good reason for believing, had been in the vaults about eighty
years.    These were placed at my disposal ; and although it was
thought that they principally consisted of carbonate of lead, it
was nevertheless considered, from the peculiarity of the circum*
stances under which the material was formed, that the results of
its analysis might prove somewhat interesting.
    The pieces of the substance referred to were about a quarter
of an inch in thickness : they had a laminated structurej and
possessed a fawnish or drab-white colour.              Neither crystalline
form nor metallic lead were detected even by the aid of the
microscope.      The material was tolerably brittle, and readily
reduced to an impalpable powder.            On submitting it to quanti

   The results of the analysis of this substance, therefore, show
that it chiefly consists of protocarbonate of lead with a small
proportion of anhydrous protoxide of the same metal.             The pro
duction of these compounds was doubtless mainly due to the
                      Communicated     by the Author.

    If one might venture to assign a formula to this mixture of
carbonate and oxide of lead, its composition would be represented
by PbO + 15 (PbO, COs), as the following numbers clearly
indicate : —

    The interesting points in connexion with this substance are,
that it is anhydrous, that it contains but a small excess of oxide,
and that it consequently differs in composition from any of the
carbonates of lead hitherto described as being produced by the
united action of air and water on metallic lead ; or by the influ
 ences concerned in the well-known Dutch method for manufac
 turing " white lead," and which, it is believed, approximate in
 character to those under which the material forming the subject
 of this communication was developed.
    The difference in composition of the various carbonates of lead
 formed under the circumstances referred to, will be seen by
 glancing at the subjoined Table : —
                Source.                       Composition.

    Were any of these hydrated and basic carbonates of lead ex
 posed sufficiently long to the action of carbonic acid, they would
 in all probability be transformed into perfectly neutral and anhy
 drous carbonates.
     Lastly, it is most likely that the lead of the coffins was first
 converted into hydrated oxide, then into hydrated and basic car
 bonate, and finally into the anhydrous carbonate of the compo
 sition already given.

 XL.    On Osmious Acid, and the position of Osmium in the list of
     Elements.    By  J.  W. Mallet, Professor of Chemistry, fyc,
     University of Alabama*.
        most chemical     text-books it is stated, on the authority of
 IN Berzelius,     that there are five oxides of osmium — OsO,
 Os2Os, OsO2, OsO8, and OsO4 — of which, however, the second
 and fourth have not been isolated, although compounds containing
 them are known.         To these may be added a blue substance,
 first obtained by Vauquelin and supposed by Berzelius to con
 sist of OsO united to either Os2 O3 or OsO2, and the highest
 oxide, probably OsO5, the existence of which was announced by
 Fremy in 1854.
     While preparing osmium from some black platinum residues,
 I  have accidentally obtained a substance which there is some
reason to believe may be osmious acid — the hitherto unisolated
teroxide — mixed indeed with osmic acid, but still permitting cer
 tain of its properties to be observed.
     Three or four ounces of the platinum residue were treated by
 a modification of the original process of Wollaston, now seldom
adopted.      The powder was mixed with three times its weight of
 nitre, the mixture was fused for some time in an iron crucible,
and then poured out upon an iron plate.          While still warm the
fused cake was broken into fragments and put into a flask fitted
with a cork, through which passed a tube two feet,long, bent at
right angles, and a funnel-tube, the latter drawn out to a very
small bore at the lower end, and reaching to the bottom of the
flask.    The bent tube was well cooled, and J undiluted oil of
vitriol was very cautiously poured, by a few drops at a time, into
the funnel.
    The acid produced intense heat on coming in contact with the
cake of potash salt, and oily drops of a bright yellow colour began
to make their appearance in the cooled tube.         These drops very
slowly congealed to a solid resembling unbleached bees-wax.
By the time the sulphuric acid had been added in slight excess,
a considerable quantity of this yellow substance had collected
in the tube and in a receiver attached.        By gently heating, the
whole was obtained in the receiver, and united under a little
water to a single mass.         Towards the end of the distillation
colourless needles and fused drops of the well-known osmic acid
came over, and doubtless a considerable portion of the yellow
mass in the receiver consisted of the same.
    At first it seemed probable that the yellow colour of the latter
was due merely to some impurity, and it was therefore cautiously
          * From Silliman's American Journal for January 1860.

294             Prof.  J. "W. Millet   on the Chemical and
resublimed, but it again collected of the same tint as before.            It
appeared to be even more fusible and volatile than osmic acid ;
  t took a long time to congeal under a stream of cold water flow
ing over the outside of a tube in which it had been melted.
    The water in which it was fused acquired a bright yellow
colour, and gave off fumes, the odour of which seemed to me
somewhat different from that of osmic acid, and which irritated
the eyes so insufferably that it was scarcely possible to finish
work with the acid and put it up for preservation.                It was re
moved as a single cake from the water, and sealed up hermeti
cally in a glass tube which had been previously cleansed with
care from all traces of dust or other organic matter. The water
in which it had been fused was mixed with caustic potash, and
 gave a solution of very dark brown-red colour, such a tint as
would probably result from a mixture of the red* osmite of pot
ash discovered by Fremy with the orange-brown osmiate of pot
ash.
     The sealed tube containing the fused cake or stick of yellow
acid was allowed to remain upon a table exposed to the direct
 rays of the sun.       The acid immediately began to sublime upon
the sides of the tube, not in long needles and prismatic crystals
like osmic acid (which seems to be monoclinic), but in feathery
 crusts like sal-ammoniac, which under a lens had somewhat the
appearance of minute octahedrons grouped together.                The colour
was still bright yellow, but in a short time the sublimed acid
began to turn black, and in twenty-four hours the whole inner
 surface of the tube was perfectly black and opake.                  A tube
 containing pure colourless osmic acid has been exposed in a simi
 lar way to the sun for three weeks without any such blackening
taking place.       A tube closed by a cork, or one from which dust
 has not been carefully removed, will often cause osmic acid to
 turn dark, but never exhibits anything like the absolute black
ness and opacity of the whole tube noticed in the present in
 stance.
     It is easy, however, to imagine the cause of this change under
 gone by the yellow acid if it be in fact the teroxide of osmium
 (mixed with osmic acid).         The teroxide probably broke up into
 osmic acid, and one of the lower oxides of osmium, or perhaps
 the metal itself.      We might have
                          20sOs= Os04 + OsOs,
                          50s03=30s04 + Oss08,
                          30sOs=20s04-f OsO,
 or                       40s03= 30b04+Os.
    * A rose-red colour is also characteristic of the salt supposed by Berze-
 lius to be the muaomo-terchloride of osmium, corresponding in the chlorine
 series to osmite of ammonia.

    In order to ascertain, if possible, which of the above changes
had taken place, the tube was opened two or three months after
it had been sealed, and the contents were examined.             The fused
stick of acid was found to be black and partially friable; on
heating in another glass vessel, most of it sublimed, leaving a
little black powder behind, and condensed in needles, still
slightly yellowish, but differing little in appearance from com
mon osmic acid.       The inner surface of the original tube was
found coated with a thin, filmy, adherent crust, of a black colour
and considerable lustre. This was scraped off, and a portion of
it gently heated in a stream of dry carbonic acid gas until all
traces of adherent osmic acid were driven off.              After cooling,
the carbonic acid was replaced by dry hydrogen, and heat was
again applied.     Water condensed on the tube beyond the heated
part, thus proving that an oxide of osmium, not the metal, was
under examination.       Replacing again the hydrogen by oxygen,
osmic acid was produced and carried off with the stream of gas.
The black powder scraped off from the original tube was heated
with hydrochloric acid, and seemed to be but slowly acted on ;
the acid, however, assumed a green colour, and hence it is pro
bable that the osmium existed as protoxide.
    It is not easy to see, without further investigation, how os-
mious acid could have replaced in part osmic acid in the attempt
to prepare the latter as above described.           Is there a particular
stage   of the  decomposition   of  nitre   by   heat  at which osmium
may replace nitrogen in nitrite of potash (KO, NO3) ?               From
the relations of the two elements, to be noticed presently, this
would seem probable, and in fact Fremy has noticed the crystal
lization of osmite of potash from a solution in hot water of the
fused cake of nitre and iridosmium.             A reason for osmic acid
(OsO4)    being  usually obtained  from   the  latter, instead of osmious
 (OsO3), might perhaps      be found    in  the   fact that the chemists
who of late years have worked upon osmium recommend the
use of nitric or nitro-muriatic acid to neutralize the potash j sul
phuric acid, to which Wollaston had recourse in his early ex
periments, is now seldom employed.              Thomson, in his ' Che
mistry of Inorganic Bodies/ published many years ago, observes
that osmic acid has sometimes a tint of yellow.
    It does not seem likely that the cork closing the neck of the
flask used for distillation had anything to do with the production
of osmious acid, if such took place ; the cork itself did not show
any appearance of being acted on, and there was no blackening
of its surface until some time after the experiment was ended.
    The reduction of osmic acid generally results in the formation
of the basic oxides ; Berzelius, however, observed that on adding
sulphurous acid to a solution of osmic acid, the latter passed
                                  X2

296             Prof. J. W. Mallet on the Chemical and
through various shades of colour— yellow, orange-yellow, brown,
green, and at last blue ; he attributed these tints to the succes
sive formation of sulphates of the binoxide, sesquioxide, and blue
oxide: but may not the first step in the reduction have been
osmious acid, giving the yellow colour ?
    Another and altogether different view of the nature of the vola
tile yellow substance above described was suggested as possible
by some remarks of Claus, in a recent paper
                                                     " On the Tendency
to Reduction of Salts of Iridium " (Ann. der Chem. und Pharm.
August 1858, p. 129). This author has shown that the platinum
metals fall naturally into three groups, in each of which are con
tained two metals resembling in general habit and relations each
other more closely than members of the remaining groups. Pla
tinum and palladium constitute the first of these pairs, iridium
and rhodium the second, osmium and ruthenium the third. The
atomic weight of the first-mentioned member of each pair is
higher than (nearly double) that of the second.
    In the paper quoted, Claus remarks that the metal of lower
atomic weight in each of these groups is much more easily
reduced than the other from superior to inferior grades of com
bination with chlorine : thus the bichloride of palladium is re
duced with much greater ease to protochloride than is the corre
sponding compound of platinum ; and for the same reason, pro
bably, the bichloride of rhodium is not known, but only the ses-
quichloride, while both salts of iridium can be easily obtained.
On this same principle Claus explains the fact that no oxide of
ruthenium homologous with osmic acid has been obtained, while
he gives the following reasons for suspecting the existence of
such an oxide : — " Thjs opinion is based upon the fact, that in
my preparation of compounds of ruthenium, which can be ob
tained only by energetic processes of oxidation, the material
worked upon, notwithstanding all my care and economy, gra
dually diminished, and yet       I have never succeeded in collecting
a volatile product.       Once only, when       I had fused ruthenium
perfectly free from osmium, with          caustic potash and nitre, dis
solved the mass in water, and decomposed it with nitric acid,             I
observed a peculiar odour, quite distinct from that of osmic or
nitrous acid ; and afterwards, having covered the beaker, which
was smeared on the edge with tallow, with a plate of glass,               I
remarked an unmistakeable blackening of the tallow, caused by
the reduction of a volatile metallic compound."
    It seemed possible that the volatile yellow substance to which
the present paper refers might have been an acid oxide of ruthe
nium* — RuO3, RuO4, or RuO5 — and reducible with extreme
   *  If such a compound exist, an explanation may be found for the process
by which Fremy has obtained a lower oxide of ruthenium (probably the

facility, Claus and others having already noticed the reducing
effect of light upon salts of the platinum metals.                A portion of
the crust of yellow acid from the sides of the tube was carefully
examined for ruthenium, the various tests given by Claus, as
well as that recently proposed by Dr. Gibbs, being made use of ;
but no proof of the presence of this metal could be obtained.
    The properties of osmium and its compounds are very re
markable, and render it a matter of no little interest to trace the
analogies of this rare substance and fix its place among the other
elements.       It is described in most chemical works along with pla
tinum and its associated metals, — mainly on the ground of com
munity of origin ; for in many respects it is unlike the platinum,
palladium, rhodium, &c, with which it always occurs in nature.
All these metals are commonly thought of as very infusible, of
great density, very slightly affected by reagents, and very easily
reduced from their compounds to the metallic state ; when more
closely examined they are found to differ from each other in
many of their other properties.              The arrangement by Claus of
the platinum metals in three groups, each containing one metal
of high and one of low atomic weight, viz.
          Platinum,                 Iridium,               Osmium,
          Palladium,                Rhodium,               Ruthenium,
has been alluded to above ; the two members of each group are
more closely related to each other than to any of the rest.
Osmium and ruthenium are clearly the most electro-negative of
the series.      Graham has inferred the isomorphism of platinum,
palladium,    iridium,    and osmium, from the fact that their potassio-
chlorides all crystallize in the form of the regular octahedron :
the corresponding compound of ruthenium has since been added
to the list, while that of rhodium is still unknown.               The occur
rence of two salts under the same form, in the regular system, of
course does not of itself suffice to establish the relation of iso
morphism between them ; iridio-chloride of potassium seems how-
binoxide) in crystals.     He roasts the powder of platinum-residue in a stream
of air drawn through a porcelain tube at a bright red heat ; osmic acid volati
lizes, and is said to carry with it mechanically the oxide of ruthenium,
which deposits upon fragments of porcelain placed in the cooler part of the
tube.    But the oxide is in distinct crystals, and can therefore scarcely be
conceived of as a powder borne along in a merely mechanical way by a
stream of vapour ; and, moreover, there is no reason for oxide of ruthenium
only being so borne along, while other substances of no greater density re
main behind.      Is it not more likely that a volatile and very easily reducible
homologue    of   osmic   acid is formed, and almost immediately afterwards
decomposed, depositing the binoxide of ruthenium?

ever to be capable of crystallizing in all proportions with the
platino- and osmio-chlorides.
   The interesting fact has been discovered by Claus, that osmio-
cyanide and ruthenio-cyanide of potassium are strictly isomor-
phou8 with the well-known ferrocyanide, crystallizing with it in
all proportions, and even giving very similar precipitates with
various metallic solutions ; so that, in these double cyanides, os
mium and ruthenium are capable of taking the place of iron.
   In the greater number of its relations, however, osmium pre
sents itself as a member of the arsenic group of elements.        This
has been noticed by some recent authors, as by Prof. Dana in
the arrangement of the elements adopted in his ' System of Mi
neralogy/ and by Prof. Miller, who says in his lately published
' Elements of
                Chemistry/ that
                                    " it presents more analogy with
arsenic and antimony than with the noble metals."         Fremy, too,
compares   osmium     in  platinum ore  to arsenic in the native  arse-
niurets.
    Nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth are
generally recognized as forming a distinct and natural group of
elements ; and into this group it seems from many considerations
that osmium, and probably ruthenium, ought to be introduced.
They have some analogies with other natural families, just as
arsenic is allied to sulphur in native sulph-arseniurets, and nitro
gen and chlorine exhibit some resemblance in the nitrates and
chlorates ; but here appear to be their closest relations.     It may
be interesting to notice some of the principal points of resem
blance to or difference from this group.
   Iridosmine occurs in crystals closely related in form to those
of arsenic, antimony, and bismuth in the metallic state. The
analyses of iridosmine are not yet sufficiently numerous or ac
curate to enable us to decide upon its normal composition ; but
it seems probable that the two metals occur in variable propor
tions, and are in this mineral isomorphous, thus establishing, as
noticed by Dana, a connexion between the arsenic group and
that of the distinctly basic metals, as the arsenic and sulphur
groups are united through homceomorphous bismuth, tetrady-
mite and tellurium.       Dana places iridium in the same section
with iron, among the metals whose most stable grades of oxida-
dation are the protoxide and sesquioxide ; but the statement of
Claus, that the binoxide of iridium is the most stable and easily
prepared compound with oxygen, would remove this metal, as
also perhaps platinum and palladium, from the iron section to
that containing tin and titanium; and the propriety of this
transfer may be supported by the relationship of Fremy's cry
stallized oxide of ruthenium (doubtless the binoxide) examined
by Senarmont: this was found to be homceomorphous                 with

  stannic and (the rutile form of) titanic acid.        The bichloride of
  tin and potassium, too, is reported as crystallizing in regular
  octahedrons, like the corresponding salts of iridium, platinum,
  and palladium.
     The arsenic section, as given by Dana, includes nitrogen,
  phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, bismuth, osmium, and tellurium.
  The last-named is marked as doubtful, and should decidedly be
  placed with sulphur and selenium, to which it is analogous in
  by far the greater number of its compounds.
     In one of the interesting memoirs lately published by Dumas,
  on the numerical relations subsisting among the atomic weights
 of the elements, the arsenic series is thus given : —

              Bismuth                      14 + 1 7 + 1 76 = 207
 and the parallelism of this series with that of chlorine, iodine,
 &c., is supposed to be shown in the following lines : —

 in which    a common   difference of 5 is assumed between the two
 members in each of the vertical columns (a difference not strictly
 brought out in the case of phosphorus and chlorine), and in
 which a higher atomic weight is assigned to antimony than in
 the preceding Table.      Osmium is not included ; but in a supple
 mental note since published, we find it placed, with an equivalent
 somewhat higher than that usually adopted, in the sulphur group,
serving to complete the following two lines of equivalents : —
     Mg  (12-25)     Ca (20)     Sr (43-75)     Ba (68-5)      Pb (103-5)

is supposed to exist.

The atomic weights of ruthenium and osmium are here assumed
as 53 and 97 ; numbers not differing more widely from those
commonly received — 52-2 (Claus) and 99'6 (Berzelius) — than
do several of those assumed by Dumas.            Our knowledge of these
two equivalents is based upon very limited data, and can but be
looked on as merely approximative.          As regards osmium, Fremy
says that in several experiments      he   has   obtained an equivalent
number lower than that given by Berzelius ; and the vapour-
density of osmic acid, which we shall notice presently, points to
an equivalent close to 97.       A redetermination of this equivalent
is very much to be desired.
    Taking the series as given above, we find ruthenium and
osmium to fall in between phosphorus and arsenic, arsenic and
antimony, — the numbers from phosphorus to antimony increas
ing by 22 — 44—66 — 88, just as in the following group given
by Dumas : —
                                              Atomic weights.

                 Tungsten                    26 + 66 = 92
and we may arrange the two series in parallel lines,

    These numerical relations are of very little importance in
 themselves, when we employ the small numbers of the hydrogen
 scale of equivalents, and especially when we permit ourselves to
 alter the numbers themselves to any extent, however small ; but
 they acquire more interest when they present us with groupings
 of elements which we acknowledge on other grounds to be natu
 rally related.    In such cases, when the homology is distinctly
 marked, we may even be justified in taking some liberties for
 the moment with the numbers standing, often with but slender
 evidence to support them, for the equivalents of the less known
 elements ; and we may, perhaps, thus be directed to errors of
 determination which future experiments will clear away.
    The bodies named in each of the two lines just given are
 homologous in many respects besides that of atomic weight, and
 a connexion      between the two series, through vanadium, has
 lately  been   shown   by Schafarik.    There is a clear resemblance
 running through the formulae and properties of their oxides. In
 the chromium series — a very natural one— the most important
 oxides are the metallic acids of the composition MO3 ; we have
 also in each case a binoxide, MO2 ; but the sesquioxide is pro

MO5 with respect to the separate columns, the following facts

   In the column of the oxides of phosphorus, we have first the
very anomalous suboxide (P20), which          probably the only     is
marked exception to the homology running through the whole
table.   Before the discovery of red (amorphous) phosphorus                                     by
Schrotter, this substance was, no doubt, to some extent con
founded with phosphoric oxide, and may even now throw some
doubt upon the cases in which the latter seems to have been ob
tained pure and to have yielded      formula supported

      The existence of a distinct protoxide of arsenic, as of antimony
   and bismuth, is doubtful.      Arsenious acid is a feeble, volatile, me
              —
   tallic acid feebler in its relations as an acid than arsenic acid,
  and volatilizing at a lower temperature than the latter.            Arse
  nious acid, moreover, volatilizes at a temperature below that
  required by metallic arsenic.
      In the antimony column, the oxide SbO3 is usually viewed as
  a weak base, but seema also to be capable of uniting as a feeble
  acid to the alkalies, and even of expelling carbonic acid from
  their carbonates (Liebig).         The isodimorphism of SbO3 and
  AsO3 is well established.       SbO3 is volatile at quite a moderate
  temperature, while metallic antimony requires at least a white
  heat to vaporize it.      SbO5 is a body of distinctly acid properties.
  Both SbO3 and %hOh are converted by heating in the air into SbO*
  — the so-called antimonious acid, which seems therefore to be
  the most stable oxide when strong bases and acids are not pre
  sent.    It is most probable that, as Fremy maintains, SbO4 is not
  itself an acid, but that a so-called alkaline antimonite              is,

      In the bismuth column, the teroxide           homologous as

 with teroxide    of antimony,   but  shows  little  tendency  to play the
 part of an acid with even the strongest bases. This oxide and
 the metal itself are volatile at high temperatures.            BiO4 also
 seems to be devoid of acid properties          but the compound BiO5
                                                   ;

 salts of little stability.
     Comparing now ruthenium and osmium with the above recog

 metals form protoxides, which are feeble bases, as are probably
 the corresponding compounds of the other members of the gr.oup.

sesquioxide united to ammonia, which, dissolved in hydrochloric
acid, yields a brown compound, supposed to be the sesqui-
chloride of osmium and ammonium.           Neither of these, however,
can   be  crystallized, nor  has the   constitution assigned to either
been supported by an analysis.        The so-called ammonio- sesqui
oxide detonates when heated (sometimes with much violence, as
I  have noticed in removing by heat the deposit of this substance
which forms on the end of a retort-neck during the distillation
of osmic acid into a receiver containing ammonia), and hence is
probably analogous to fulminating platinum, containing perhaps
the binoxide of osmium.         The binoxide itself is a feeble base,
the characteristic colour of whose salts in solution is yellow, as is
the case with the corresponding compounds of iridium.          Similar
remarks apply to the binoxide of ruthenium        — probably the body
obtained, as we have shown, by Fremy in crystals.         The teroxide
of osmium is the body supposed to have been isolated in the ex
periment described at the beginning of this paper.         Its position
 as a feeble acid, capable, however, under some circumstances, of
playing the part of a base, its fusibility and volatility (greater
 apparently than those of osmic acid, as nitrous acid is more
 fusible and volatile than hyponitric), its probable crystallization
 in octahedrons of the regular system, in which arsenious acid
 and teroxide of antimony are also found, all tend to indicate
homology with the other teroxides of the arsenic group. The
 general relations of ruthenic acid, so far as these are known^
 place it in a similar position.     Just as we find hyponitric acid
 (NO4)   and  antimonious   acid (SbO4) to be the most stable of the
 higher oxides of nitrogen and antimony, so the well-known osmic
  acid (OsO4) seems to be the grade of oxidation which osmium
 most readily assumes and retains when not in contact with bases.
 OsO3 and OsO5 (the latter as described by Fremy) seem scarcely
 capable of existing in the separate state ; when set free from their
 salts they soon pass into OsO4 ; while it may as well be doubted
 that the latter ever exists as a distinct acid in combination with
 bases, as that NO4 or SbO4 does so.         No so-called osmiate has
 ever been analysed ; the saturating capacity of the acid, if it be
  such, is unknown ; when free and in solution in water, it has no
  acid reaction ; it does not displace carbonic acid from the carbo
 nates, and it is itself expelled by heat from most of its supposed
 compounds, and is separated in part by water even from potash
 and soda.     No compound of OsO4 with a base has been obtained
 in crystals, while Fremy states that he has crystallized the alka
 line salts of both OsO3 and OsO5.        RuO4 and RuO5 are as yet
 unknown.
     The tendency throughout the whole arsenic group is mani
  festly to the production of the acid compounds MO8 and MO5;

304            Prof.  J. W. Mallet on   the Chemical   and
the former the more fusible and volatile body, the latter the
stronger acid.       In addition, we have some cases of the prot
oxide (MO), a feeble base, and the binoxide (MO2), a body of
still more feebly basic properties, verging upon the acids.            All
other grades of oxidation, so far as they exist at all, may per
haps be correctly viewed as compounds of the preceding inter se.
The stability of the oxide (MO4) in the separate state is remark
able ; its formula is one of rare occurrence.
    The affinity of all the elements of the group for oxygen is
considerable ; it is so even in the case of osmium and ruthenium,
usually placed among the noble metals.         Dumas ( Traite de Ckim.
app.) states that osmium does not oxidize at common tempera
tures, nor even at 100° C. ; but      I have obtained conclusive evi
dence that oxidation may go on slowly even at the ordinary
atmospheric temperature.        The paper label and the cork of a
tube containing pure metallic osmium have "in the course of se
veral years become blackened, precisely as organic matter is by
the fumes of osmic acid, the black tint on the paper decreasing
from the mouth of the tube along the outside.          A piece of white
paper, in which some black platinum residue had been wrapped,
was strongly stained in the immediate neighbourhood of the pow
der in the course of a few weeks.        The same effect is distinctly ob
servable even upon the paper label placed inside a tube of native
iridosmine (Siberian) in the usual coarse grains — a specimen which
has lain among other minerals, and has never been placed near
any artificial preparations of osmium.        Osmium, like arsenic and
antimony,    is clearly capable  of slowly taking up oxygen at com
mon temperatures.         At a red heat, roasting in a current of air
affords, as is known, a good method of obtaining osmic acid from
the iridosmine of platinum residues — just as by similar roasting
arsenious acid is prepared from the native arseniurets.
    It would be a matter of much interest to compare osmium with
its supposed homologues under circumstances in which we should
expect it to play an electro-negative part.      Fremy has announced
his belief in the existence of an osmiuretted hydrogen ; but such a
body has not yet been isolated and described.            Compounds of
the metal with ethyle, methyle, &c, would be well worth exami
nation; and it is- not unlikely that such might be prepared from
a body which in some states of combination exhibits such a high
degree of volatility.
    The earlier experiments of Deville and Debray upon the pla
tinum metals seemed to have shown that both osmium and ru
thenium could be volatilized, at exceedingly high temperatures,
without previous fusion ; if this were confirmed, a strong point
of resemblance with arsenic would be made out ; but it appears
from a more recent paper, that osmium at least may be fused and

obtained as a perfectly compact mass, the apparent volatility of
the metal being due doubtless to previous oxidation, the cru
cibles used being permeable to air. We have seen, as regards
arsenic and antimony, that their oxides are more volatile than the
metals themselves.
   It was lately stated that osmium may be obtained in crystals by
the same means as those used for boron and silicon, but have    I
as yet seen no account of the form which it assumes.
   Deville has furnished another interesting fact with respect to
osmium, by determining the density of the vapour of osmic acid,
which he has found = 8-88.          This, if we take the generally
received atomic weight for osmium, gives the atomic volume
1.31 *6
 o'oo
     —  = 14-82, indicating   a condensation   to 2 vols.   If we now
calculate   back to the theoretical atomic weight, we get (14-57
 x 8-88)— 32 = 97 38,     a number closely approaching 97, which,
as we have seen, brings the equivalent of osmium into
                                                                simple
and harmonious relation with those of the other elements of the
arsenic group.
   The specific gravity of fused metallic osmium having been
lately determined by Deville = 21 -4, there can be little doubt
that all the metals of the platinum family possess the same atomic
volume when in the free state, about 46 or 4-7 : the specific
gravity of ruthenium is not yet known with accuracy, but such
experiments as have been made render it improbable that it will
prove an exception.     This number is about one-fourth the mean
of the atomic volumes of the long-recognized members of the
arsenic group; but these latter differ so widely among them
selves*, that the comparison is of little or no value.       It would
be desirable to get a good determination of the density of osmic
acid in the solid state, so that its atomic volume might be calcu
lated and compared with that of antimonious acid.
   The specific heat of osmium, so far as its value as a physical
character goes, opposes the introduction of this element into the
arsenic group.     It has been determined by Regnault = -03063 ;
multiplying now by the equivalent 97, we have the product
2'9711, thus placing osmium in the list of the elements (inclu
ding the majority), for which the product of specific heat          by

     It was not quite easy to obtain a sufficiently satisfactory experi
mental foundation for the diatomic nature of the second compound.
This substance presents an extraordinary degree of stability ; in its
general characters it is closely allied to the numerous monatomic
bromides, both of the nitrogen- and of the phosphorus-series, which
in the course of these researches have come under my consideration.
Lastly, the oxygenated derivative of the bromide resembles so per
fectly the monammonium- and the monophosphonium-bases, that
more than once during my experiments I was inclined to doubt the
 correctness of my interpretation.
     There is no direct proof of the diatomic character of the com
pound.        Why should we reject the simple formula deducible from
 experiment 1 The hydrocarbons Cn Hn are very prone to molecular
transformations without change of composition.            The idea suggested
 itself, that the diatomic saline molecule might be split into two
 monatomic saline molecules,
         [(C4 H5)6 (C4 H4)" P.]" Br2=2([(C4H5)3 (C2H2)' P] Br).
      It is true C2 H2 figures in this formula as monatomic, whilst we
 should expect it endowed with diatomic substitution-power.              But
 the connexion between composition and substitution-power is by no
 means finally settled ; in fact, we know of many cases in which,
 under conditions not sufficiently established, the atomicity of a mole
  cule changes : witness the radical " allyle," which is capable of re
 placing one or three equivalents of hydrogen.
      But without going this length, the scission of diatomic ethylene
 into two monatomic molecules may take place in many other ways.
 The transformation of dibromide of ethylene into bydrobromic acid
  and bromide of vinyle,
                       (C4H4)»Br2=HBr+(C4H3)Br,
  is a familiar example. The splitting of the ethylene-compound into
  bromide of formyle and bromide of methyle,
                   (C4  HJ" Br2= (C, H) Br+ (C2 H3) Br,
  has never been observed,     but did not appear altogether unlikely.
      Our analytical methods    are insufficient to distinguish between
             [(C4 H5)3 (C2 H2) P] Br and [(C4 H5)3 (C, H) Pj Br ;
  and what      I have represented as a diatomic ethylene-compound
  might have been, after all, a monatomic bromide — the bromide of
  formyl-triethylphosphonium,      the complementary methyle-compound
                           [(C4H5)3 (C2H3)P] Br
   existing possibly among the secondary products of decomposition.
       In the presence of these and several similar self-raised objections,
   bv which every observer endeavours to test the truth of his con
   clusions, I was induced again to appeal to experiment.
       The prosecution of this line of the inquiry has led me to the disco
   very of a new class of diatomic bodies, which, while it confirms incon-
   testably the correctness of my interpretation, appears to claim the
   attention of chemists for several other reasons.

 808                          Royal Society
     I have  established, in the first place, that the monatomic bromide
                          [(C,H,),(C4H,Br)P1Br
  may be readily converted into the diatomic bromide
                         [(C4H„)6(C4H4)»Pj''Br,
 by the simple addition of triethylphosphine.          Nothing is easier than
  to prove the transformation, the platinum-salt of the two bases pre
 senting a remarkable difference of solubility, and other differences
 not less striking.
     To remove every doubt, the bromide, obtained by treatment of the
 brominated bromide with triethylphosphine, was converted into the
 corresponding iodide, which in its properties and composition was
 found to be identical in every respect with the characteristic iodide,
 which    I have fully described in my last note upon this subject.
     The transformation of the monatomic into what I have represented
 as the diatomic compound being satisfactorily established, the con
 clusive experimental demonstration of the diatomic nature of the
 latter presented itself without difficulty in the conception of bromides
 containing at once phosphorus and nitrogen, the molecular expression
 of which would no longer admit of division.
    This class of dibromides actually exists ; they are readily produced
by submitting the bromide of the brominated body to the action of
ammonia or monamines instead of triethylphosphine.
    I  have formed as yet only three representatives of this new class of
bodies, which      I  propose to designate as phosphammonium-com-
pounds ; their examination is sufficient to fix the character of the
class ; it would have been easy to construct scores of similar bodies.

this body by the preparation and analysis of the platinum-compound.

  a  body   is  formed     of  the   composition C6 H5 02 CI, resulting from a

810                            Royal Society   : —
 the name of hydrochlorate of acroleine, is obtained in a mass of
 white crystals, presenting a texture like that of velvet.        It melts at
 32° C. into a thick oil, having a smell of slightly rancid fat.        It is
 readily soluble in alcohol or ether, on evaporation of which it re
 mains behind as a thick oil. When boiled with water, it remains, as
 far as can be seen, unchanged.        Dilute solutions of the alkalies ap
 pear not to act on it. Heated with solution of ammonia in a sealed
 tube at 100° C, it is decomposed, chloride of ammonium and acroleine
 ammonia being the result.         It does not combine with bichloride of
 platinum when in solution in alcohol, and very slowly reduces boiling
 ammoniacal solution of nitrate of silver.         Heated alone, it decom
 poses   into acroleine  and hydrochloric  acid.   By the action of concen
 trated hydrochloric acid acroleine is set free. Dilute sulphuric and
 nitric acids decompose it likewise, setting acroleine free.         Heated
 with hydrate of potash it gives off hydrogen ; and there distils at
 the same time an oily body, which solidifies into magnificent colour
 less crystals, analyses of which prove it to be an isomeric acroleine,
 for which the authors propose the name Metacroleine.
    Metacroleine as thus obtained is insoluble in water, but is capable of
 being recrystallized from alcohol or ether.        The crystals form very
 long needles, more especially when melted metacroleine before solidi-        „
 fying is allowed to flow about in a glass tube.             They resemble
 very much in appearance crystals of acetamide, possess a peculiar
 aromatic smell, and have a taste at first producing a cooling and
 afterwards a burning sensation. They are lighter than water. They
 melt at about 50° C, becoming solid at about 45°C.           Before melting
 they are somewhat volatilizable, on which account they can be
 distilled in the vapour of water. On being heated, metacroleine is
 changed into common acroleine.          Dilute alkalies do not effect any
 change in this substance.        By heating with mineral acids, common
 acroleine is set free. On leading dry hydrochloric acid gas over
 metacroleine in a bulb-tube, the metacroleine melts and combines with
 the acid, producing the already-named hydrochlorate of acroleine.
 From this behaviour, the authors believe the acroleine contained in the
 compound of hydrochloric acid to be metacroleine, and not common
 acroleine.    If metacroleine be viewed as C12 H8 04, the formula of the
 hydrochloric     acid  compound would then beC,2H804, 2HC1; and
 the formation of metacroleine may be assumed to take place accord
 ing to the following equation, C12H804> 2HCl+2KOHO=C12H804
  + 2KC1+4H0,           The evolution of hydrogen has been found to be
 the result of a secondary action.
                     2. Acroleine and Hydriodic Acid.
    These substances act very violently on each other if the acid in
the gaseous form be led into acroleine, producing a hissing noise, as
when red-hot iron is plunged into water.          The resulting substance is
insoluble in alcohol, ether, acids, and alkalies. Bisulphide of carbon
dissolves out a little free iodine.     Heated alone, iodine is set free.
                           3. Acroleine and Water.
    Acroleine mixed with two or three times its volume of water, and
exposed to the temperature of boiling water for eight days, under

  goes a gradual change.         Acrylic acid is produced, and a resinous
  substance,    soluble in ether, melting at about tiO°, and becoming
  solid at 55°C.      At common temperatures it is hard and brittle, like
 resin.    The per-centage composition of this resin, on analysis, was
 found to be the same as that obtained by Redtenbacher, and named
  Disacrylic resin*, viz. carbon 66-6, hydrogen 7*4.
                    4. Metacroleine    and Hydriodic Acid.
    When dry hydriodic acid gas is passed over dry metacroleine, the
 latter melts, and changes into a heavy yellow solution, resembling in
 smell and appearance the hydrochlorate of acroleine.                 It can be
 washed with water, and appears at ordinary temperatures to solidify
 into crystals ; placed over sulphuric acid to dry, it decomposes, be
 coming brown, and setting iodine free. From the analogy in its
 formation, this compound can be properly viewed as hydriodate of
 acroleine.
                                 II. Aldehyde.
                    1 . Aldehyde and Hydrochloric Acid.
    Lieben found that by the action of hydrochloric acid on aldehyde,
 a body of the composition C8 H8 02 Cl2 was produced, having a con
 stant boiling-point of from 116° to 117°Ct
    The authors confirm Lieben's statement as to the replacement of 02
 by Cl2 in two atoms of aldehyde, and have further obtained a new
 combination, analysis of it giving the formula as C12 H12 04 Cla, in
which two equivalents of oxygen are replaced by the same number of
 equivalents of chlorine in three atoms of aldehyde.          By the action of
 water, this compound, like that of Lieben, is resolved into hydro
 chloric acid and aldehyde.         By heat, it is broken up into aldehyde
and the body C8 H8 Oa Cl2.          The authors propose for it the name
protoxychloride      of aldehyde.
                     2. Aldehyde    and Hydriodic Acid.
    By  the action    of hydriodic acid on aldehyde a compound is pro
 duced that decomposes with water into the aldehyde and the acid
again, on which account it could not be purified.            On heating, it is
 suddenly decomposed at 70°         C,  leaving a black resinous residue,
which on distillation gave off vapours of iodine.             In its mode of
formation it is analogous to the bodies produced by the action of
hydrochloric acid on aldehyde.
             3. Aldehyde     and Sulphurous Acid — Elaldehyde.
    Dry sulphurous acid gas led into anhydrous aldehyde in cold water
is absorbed with great avidity, 1 1 grammes of aldehyde absorbing 19
grammes of the acid, whilst an increase of volume takes place. The
absorption-coefficient of aldehyde for this acid was found to be 1 '4
times greater than that of alcohol for the same, and seven times greater
than that of water for it.       No chemical combination appears to take
place, as, on passing a stream of carbonic acid through the fluid at a
slightly elevated temperature, almost all the sulphurous acid can be
driven out again.        It' aldehyde, saturated with sulphurous acid, be
left for about a week at ordinary temperatures in a well-stoppered

bottle, it suffers in this time almost a complete change into a body
for which the authors propose at present the name Elaldehyde.
To obtain it pure, the fluid is mixed with as much water as is neces
sary to dissolve it up ; -tba- acid is saturated by degrees with chalk,
and the fluid obtained is distilled so long as oily drops pass into the
receiver. The common aldehyde is separated in a resinous form by
digesting for some time with solution of caustic soda or potash. By
repeated distillation, the elaldehyde can be obtained free from every
thing but a little water. Analysis gives the formula of this aldehyde
as C4 H4 02.      It is therefore isomeric with common aldehyde. As
it was obtained in quantity by the foregoing method, its properties
were further examined.          Its boiling-point was found to be 124° C,
and solidifying-point       10° C.    Whilst solidifying it likewise starts
into crystals, the melting-point of which is also 10° C. The alde
hyde here described under the name Elaldehyde is identical with
that of Weidenbush*.          Its mode of production from common alde
hyde is the same ; its boiling-point likewise agrees with that of
 the aldehyde of Weidenbush.
    The elaldehyde of Fehling the authors believe to be identical
with that they have obtained, and also that obtained by Weidenbush.
That which goes far to prove the identity of the two latter is their
vapour-densities. That of Weidenbush's is given as 4-58, whilst that
 of Fehling's is 4-52 ; both are converted into common aldehyde by
 heating gently with dilute sulphuric acid, and both crystallize at low
 temperatures.      The only material discrepancy between them is the
 boiling-point of 94° C. given by Fehling for elaldehyde, whilst Wei
 denbush gives the boiling-point of his aldehyde as 125° C.
                         III.  Oil of Bitter Almonds,
           1.   Oil of Bitter Almonds and Hydrochloric Acid.
    This acid    does not combine with oil of bitter almonds.               Ex
 periments    made    in sealed   tubes,  heated    first to 100° C,  and after
 wards to 200°, gave no signs of a combination having been effected.
             2. Oil of Bitter Almonds and Hydriodic Acid.
    Much better results can be obtained when hydriodic acid is
 allowed to act on oil of bitter almonds.             The gas is absorbed, pro
 ducing an    increase   of  volume and of temperature, and at the same
 time a little water.     At the end of the operation two layers appear,
 of a dark-brown colour. The upper one, which is about a sixth
 part of the quantity of the under one, consists of concentrated hy
 driodic acid, whilst the under one, a heavy oil, is a compound of
 iodine and oil of bitter almonds.        To obtain the substance in a pure
 state, it was first washed well with water to remove excess of the
 acid ; next treated with moderately strong solution of sulphite of
 soda, to remove any excess of oil ; lastly, on washing with water, the
 salt was removed from it.          It can be dried rapidly over sulphuric
 acid at a temperature not higher than 20° C. A higher temperature
 produces gradual decomposition.           In the preparation of this sub
 stance, 6 grammes of oil of bitter almonds absorbed 1 1 grammes of
hydriodic acid gas.        Analyses of the substance lead to the formula

further decomposition had taken place in the case of hydrochloric
acid and acroleine, a body derived from two atoms of acroleine,

Cutaneous Absorption."         By Augustus Waller, M.D., F.R.S.
    " On   Spontaneous Evaporation."       By Benjamin    Guy Babington,
M.D., F.R.S. &c.
    The object of this communication is to make known certain powers
of attraction and repulsion, hitherto, as far as I know, unnoticed,
which are possessed by soluble substances in relation to their solvent,
and which, in the case of water (the solvent here considered), are
measured by the amount of loss, on spontaneous evaporation, in the
weight of solutions.'of different salts and other substances, as compared
with the loss of weight in water.
    The force which holds together the particles of a vaporizable
liquid is gradually overcome, if that liquid be exposed to air, by
 another force which separates, expands, and diffuses those particles
in the form of vapour ; and this separation takes place, even at a
 common temperature, so rapidly, provided the surface be sufficiently
 extensive, that an easy opportunity is afforded of determining the
 loss of weight by a common balance.
    A subject for investigation, possessing much interest, thus presents
 itself ; and in its pursuit some new and unexpected results are
 encountered.
    The method which        I  have pursued has been to expose to the
 atmosphere, for a definite period, solutions of different salts, and also
 pure water under like conditions of quantity and area, temperature,
 atmospheric moisture, and atmospheric pressure.
     Different salts and other soluble substances are thus found to
 possess, when in solution, different powers of retarding or accelerating
 evaporation, and hence, from its amount, as compared with that which
 takes place in pure water, we can estimate the comparative value of
 those powers.
     The powers themselves being established as facts, the next point
 is to endeavour to discover the cause or causes on which they depend ;
  and a wide field of inquiry is thus opened.
     The following are the instruments which have been employed : —
     1 . A balance, for one of the scales of which is substituted a flat
  metal plate, six inches square, on which the vessels to be weighed
  can be conveniently supported.       This balance will turn sensibly at a
  grain,  even with  a weight  of 4 lbs. on either side.
     2. A number of copper pans tinned within, all of the same size,
  being precisely 5 inches square inside, with perpendicular sides
  ^ths of an inch in height, also a number of earthenware pans of the
  same dimensions,      The area of 25 square inches has been chosen,
  partly  because  this size is convenient for manipulation, and partly
  because the results obtained can be easily represented in decimals.
  This facility of decimal calculation would be of importance should
  such pans come into general use as hygrometers, for which purpose
  they are well adapted.

     3. Specific gravity bottles and counterpoises.
     4. Thermometers of various degrees of delicacy and range, for
  ascertaining freezing, temperate, and boiling points.
     5. Test tubes for use, in connexion with these thermometers, as
 well in freezing mixtures as over the spirit lamp.
    6. A barometer.
     7. Various salts and other soluble substances, furnishing, when in
 solution, the materials for examination.
    The mode of procedure which I have adopted has been, to state
 my facts in the form of propositions, and to prove each of these
 propositions by experiments.
    The propositions are as follows : —
     1st proposition. —That in many aqueous solutions of salts and
 other soluble substances evaporation is retarded, as compared with
 the evaporation of water.
    2nd proposition. — That in solutions of salts which retard evapora
 tion, that retardation is in proportion to the quantity of the salt
held in solution.
    3rd proposition. — That different salts and other substances soluble
in water have different degrees of power in retarding its evaporation.
    4th proposition. —That the power of retarding evaporation does
not depend on the specific gravity of a solution.
    5th proposition. — That in aqueous solutions of salts, the power of
retardation does not depend on the base, whether we compare solutions
containing like weights of the salt, or solutions of like specific gravities.
    6th proposition. — That in aqueous solutions of salts, the power of
retarding evaporation does appear to depend upon the salt radical or
acid, although the retardation is not altogether independent of the
influence of the base.
    7th proposition. — That salts with two equivalents of an acid have a
greater power of retarding evaporation than salts with one equivalent.
There are, however, exceptions.
    8 th proposition. — That there are some salts which, being dissolved
 in water, do not retard its evaporation, and some salts which, so far
from retarding, actually accelerate evaporation.
    The truth or probability of the foregoing propositions is established
by numerous experiments, but in this abstract         Ishall, for the sake of
brevity, only state the result of one or two experiments in proof of each.
    The first proposition is proved by the fact that a solution of hydro-
chlorate of soda in the proportion of 480 grains to four measured
ounces of water, when exposed under the conditions already stated to
spontaneous evaporation, lost only 33 grains in weight after twelve
hours' exposure — while four ounces by measure of water lost 53grains,
— and after twelve hours' further exposure lost only 109 grains, while
the water lost 1 74 grains ; that       the water, as compared with the
                                       is,
solution, lost weight in the ratio nearly of to 3.5
    The second proposition    is   proved by the fact that     a  solution of
240 grains of hydrochlorate of soda in four ounces by measure of
water lost in twelve hours 73 grains         by
                                            evaporation, while four ounces
by measure of pure water lost      8    1grains, — this   isin a   proportion
of only about 8    of the latter to of the former whereas, when double
                                   7                  ;

316                          Royal Society     : —
the quantity or 480 grains of salt were dissolved, the pure water,
as compared with the solution, lost in the proportion of 5 to 3.
    The third proposition is proved by the fact that a solution of 480
grains of nitrate of potassa in 4 ounces or 1920 grains of water lost
in twelve hours 95 grains ; while a solution of the same strength of
hydrochlorate of soda lost only 70 grains ; and again, a solution of
loaf-sugar, in which 480 grains were dissolved in 1 920 grains of water,
lost in 20 hours 1 75 grains, while a like solution of hydrochlorate of
soda lost only 1 1 7 grains.
    The fourth proposition is proved by the fact that 480 grains of
gum-arabic dissolved in 1920 of water had a specific gravity of 1*072,
while a solution of hydrochlorate of soda of like strength had a spe
cific gravity of 1*149 ; after 11^ hours, the former had lost by eva
poration 71 grains, while the latter had lost only 50 grains.                Here,
therefore, the solution of the lighter specific gravity was less retarded
in its evaporation than the heavier solution.         In contrast with this
fact, a solution of hydrochlorate of ammonia of 480 grains to 1 920
grains of water, having a specific gravity of only P060, lost by evapo
ration, in 8 hours and 44 minutes, 1 7 grains, while a like solution of
hydrochlorate of soda lost 24 grains.            Here, then, the solution of
lighter specific gravity was more retarded in its evaporation than the
heavier solution. The conclusion is decisive that specific gravity has
no necessary connexion with the phaenomena.
    The fifth proposition is proved by the fact that in the following
solutions of salts of potassa, all of the same strength (namely 1 salt
to 10 water), a difference in the amount of evaporation in each will
be observed to have taken place ; and it must be borne in mind that
in solutions so weak we cannot expect that difference to be very great.
   The reason for employing weak solutions was the necessity for
having all of the same strength, one in ten being the extent to which

             Dr. Bahington on Spontaneous Evaporation.               317
    The sixth proposition is rendered probable by the following ex
periment, in which solutions are employed of acetic, nitric, sulphuric,
and hydrochloric acids, combined respectively with potassa, soda,
and ammonia, in the proportion of 100 grains of the salt to 1000
grains of water. After the expiration of 10 hours and 20 minutes,
the solution of the three acetates lost respectively, for the potassa
salt 35 grs., for the soda salt 35 grs., and for the ammonia salt
28 grs.       In the solutions of the three nitrates, the loss was re
spectively 24, 25, and 25.' In the solutions of the three sulphates,
the loss was 30 grs., 37 grs., and 29 grs. respectively, while in the
solutions of the hydrochlorates it was 17, 18, and 19 grains.
    The seventh proposition is proved by an experiment in which a
solution of 100 grains of carbonate of potassa dissolved in 1000
grains of water is compared with a like solution of bicarbonate of
potassa.      In ten hours the solution of the carbonate lost 45 grains,
while that of the bicarbonate lost only 36 grains.         In comparing
like proportions and quantities of sulphate and bisulphate of potassa,
the respective losses in 13 hours were, for the former 53 grains, for
the latter 45 grains.      Similar comparisons of the acetate and bin-
acetate of ammonia, phosphate and biphosphate, sulphate and
bisulphate of potassa, tartrate and bitartrate of soda show like
results.     In the course of investigating this proposition it was
remarked incidentally that in all the salts examined, with the single
exception of carbonate and bicarbonate of soda, the bin-acid solution
 (the proportion by weight of salt to water being equal) is of less
specific gravity than the mono-acid solution, though possessing a
greater pt>wer of retarding evaporation.
    The eighth proposition, which seems extraordinary and even
paradoxical, is proved by an experiment in which saturated solutions
of — 1, ferro-cyanate of potassa, 2, bitartrate of potassa, 3, sulphate
of copper, 4, chlorate of potassa, and 5, distilled water, were com
pared.      In 9 hours and 20 minutes, their losses by evaporation were
respectively 34 grs., 38 grs., 34 grs., 29 grs., and 29 grs., where we
perceive that in the chlorate of potassa solution there has occurred
no retardation at all, while in the following experiment, in which
 120 grains of each of the salts examined were dissolved in 1200
 grains of water, namely, — 1, solution of sulphate of copper, 2, solu
 tion of ferro-cyanate of potassa, 3, solution of carbonate of soda,
 and 4, distilled water, the number of grains lost by evaporation after
 15^ hours' exposure were,
                              — 1, 120 grs. ; 2, 113 grs. ; 3, 106 grs. ;
4, 103 grs.
     It is thus perceived that in all the three solutions a more rapid
 evaporation had taken place than in distilled water alone.
    One or two other propositions are in process of investigation.
    The paper concludes with a table of the freezing-points, boiling-
points, and specific gravities, as well of weak as of saturated solutions,
of the salts which have been submitted to examination.

  Esq., F.G.S., Director of the Geological Survey in Jamaica.
      On the north side of Plantain- Garden River, three miles west of
  Bath, shale and limestone overlie conglomerate.            The limestone
  contains Inoceramus, Hippurites, and Nerincea. Higher up the river
  similar fossiliferous limestone occurs in vertical bands, succeeded
  by conglomerates, which separate it from massive porphyries.
      On the medial ridge of mountains, also, at an elevation of 2500
  feet above the sea, Hippurite-limestone,     with black flints containing
   Ventriculites, rests on porphyry and hornblende-rock. These igneous
  rocks are interstratified with shales and conglomerates.
     2.  " On   the Occurrence of a mass of Coal in the Chalk of Kent."
  By R. Godwin. Austen, Esq., F.G.S.
     This piece of coal was met with in cutting the tunnel on the
  Chatham and Dover Railway, between Lydden Hill and Shepherds-
 well.     It weighed about 4 cwts., and was 4 feet square, with a thick
 ness of 4 inches at one part, increasing to 10 inches at another. It was
 imbedded in the chalk, where the latter was free from faults.          The
  coal is friable, highly bituminous, and burns readily, with a peculiar
  smell, like that of retino-asphalt.   It resembles some of the Wealden
 or Jurassic coals, and is unlike the true coal of the coal-measures.
 Mr. Godwin-Austen stated his belief that during the Cretaceous
 period some beds of lignite or coal of the preceding Jurassic period
 lay near the sea-margin, or along some river, so as to be covered by
 water ; and hence portions could be lifted off by ice, and so
 drifted away (like the granitic boulder found in the Chalk at
 Croydon) until the ice was no longer able to support its load.
     3.  " On some Fossils from the Grey Chalk near Guildford." By
 R.   Godwin-Austen,     Esq., F.G.S.
     In the cast of the body-chamber of a large Nautilus elegans, from
 the Grey Chalk of the Surrey Hills, near Guildford, the author
 found (the specimen having been broken up by frost) some lumps
 of iron-pyrites, and numerous specimens of Aporrhais Parkinsoni,
 with fragments of Turrilites tuber culatus, Ammonites Coupei, A.
varians, and Inoceramus concentricus.        These species are either rare
in the Grey Chalk or not known to the author as occurring in this
bed ; and he believes that the specimens referred to were accumu
lated in the shell of the Nautilus (possibly by the animal having
taken them as a meal shortly before death) at a different zone of sea-
depth to that in which the Nautilus and its contents sank and
became fossilized.      Mr. Godwin-Austen referred to these specimens
as being indicative of the contemporary formation of different
deposits with their peculiar fossils, at different sea-zones ; of the
transport of the inhabitants of one zone to the deposits of another ;
and as a possible explanation of the abundance of small angular
fragments of Mollusks, Echinoderms, and Crustaceans, in the midst
pf the very finest Cretaceous sediment.

              Mr.    S. V. Wood    on the Cretaceous Period.           319
    4. " On the Probable Events which succeeded the Close of the
Cretaceous Period."        By S. V. Wood, jun., Esq.
    The object of this paper was to show that the close of the Secon
dary period was followed by the formation of a continent having
a great extent from east to west, and at that time chiefly occu
pying low latitudes;         that this direction of continent prevailed
throughout the Tertiary period ; and that in certain portions of the
southern hemisphere, particularly in Australia and New Zealand,
there have been preserved portions of the Secondary continent with
isolated remnants of the Secondary Mammalia and Gigantic Birds.
These conclusions were arrived at by a consideration of the direction
of the principal volcanic axes in the Secondary and Tertiary periods.
The Secondary continent was (the author considered) mainly influ
enced in the northern hemisphere by volcanic axes which came into
action at the close of the Carboniferous, and continued through the
 Secondary Period.        These axes were that of the Oural, that of the
 north of England prolonged into Portugal, and that of the Alleghanies,
 having all a north and south direction, supervening upon volcanic
 axes having a direction at right angles to them, which had prevailed
 during the Newer Palaeozoic period.           From this circumstance an
 inference was drawn that the Secondary continents had generally a
 trend from north to south, governed by volcanic bands having
 this direction ; while, as the Secondary formations indicate a great
 extent of sea over the northern hemisphere, the bulk of the Secon
 dary continent lay in the southern hemisphere.
     The elevation of the bed of the Cretaceous sea, it was inferred,
 was due to volcanic forces acting from east to west ; and the author
 adduced evidence of this action having become perceptible during
 the later part of the Cretaceous period.           He considered that the
  direction  of all the  Post-cretaceous lines  of volcanic action governed
 the direction    of  the continent during the Post-cretaceous period,
  and pointed out that these were all in an easterly and westerly
  direction, coincident with the existing volcanic band which extends
  from the Azores to the Caspian, and thence (with an interval of
  intense earthquake-action between the Caspian and Bengal) extends
  to the Society Isles.    He concluded that they gave rise to a continent
  extending from the Caribbean Sea to the Society Isles — manyreasons
  uniting to show a land- connexion between America and Europe at
  the dawn of the Tertiary period, the submerged continent of Oceanica
  also indicating the easterly extension of Southern Asia ; and that,
  since this continent receded to the north at the dawn of the Tertiary
  period before the inroad of the Nummulitic Sea (which stretched
  from the south-east through Western Asia and Southern Europe,
   and was, as the author conceives, the oceanic equivalent of the
   Eocene basins of Europe), the greater portion of the deposits formed
   in the interval between Cretaceous and Eocene times must be now
   under the Southern Oceans.
      The author then adverted to the circumstance that the recent
   great wingless Birds and the nearest living affinities of all the
   Secondary Mammalia yet known occur only in the Southern hemi
   sphere.    From this, and from some considerations as to the

320                       Royal Institution :
Vegetation, he concluded that, while parts of the Secondary conti
nent yet remain in that hemisphere incorporated more or less into
the Post-cretaceous continent, other parts of it, such as Australia
and New Zealand, have remained isolated up to the present time to
an extent sufficient to preclude the migration of Mammalia and
wingless Birds. He inferred that the wingless Birds, excepting the
swift Struthionidas, have been preserved solely by isolation from the
Carnivora, which do not appear as an important family until the
Pliocene age ; and he instanced the Gastrornis of the Eocene (which
had affinities with the Solitaire and Notornis) as evidence that the
apterous birds had survived until that period.
   An inference was then drawn that the remains of the Secondary
continent, accumulated to the southward, caused cold currents to
flow to the southern shores of the Post-cretaceous continent, causing
the extinction of the bottom-feeding and shore-following Tetra-
branchiata, to which Mr. Wood attributes the destruction of the
Cestracionts which fed on them, and that of the marine Saurians
that fed on the Cestracionts. The preservation of the Dibranchiata,
on the contrary, was attributed to their being ocean-rangers.     The
extinction of the Megalosauria he attributed to the effect produced
on vegetation by the alternation of dry seasons during the year,
brought about by a great equatorial extent of land, — the extinction
of the herbivorous Megalosauria, by this cause, involving that of the
carnivorous.
   The author also alluded to the contiguity of volcanos to the seas
or. great waters, which he considered to admit of explanation by
every volcanic elevation causing a corresponding and contiguous
depression, which either brings the sea or collects the land-drainage
into contiguity with the volcanic region; and in conclusion he
alluded to the law of natural selection and correlation of growth
lately advanced by Mr. Darwin, in the soundness of which he
asserted his belief.

   March    9,  1860. — " On Lighthouse     Illumination — the Electric
Light." By      Professor  Faraday, D.C.L.,   F.R.S.
   The use of light to guide the mariner as he approaches land, or
passes through intricate channels, has, with the advance of society
and its ever increasing interests, caused such a necessity for means
more and more perfect, as to tax to the utmost the powers both of
the philosopher and the practical man, in the development of the
principles concerned, and their efficient application.    Formerly the
means were simple enough ; and if the light of a lantern or torch
was not sufficient to point out a position, a fire had to be made in
their place.    As the system became developed, it soon appeared
that power could be obtained, not merely by increasing the light,
but by directing the issuing rays : and this was in many cases a
morepowerfulandusefulmeansthan        enlargingthe combustion; leading
to the diminution of the volume of the former with, at the same time,
an increase in its intensity.    Direction was obtained, either by the
use of lenses dependent altogether upon refraction, or of reflectors
dependent upon metallic reflexion,       [And some ancient specimens

              Prof. Faraday on Lighthouse Illumination.                 321
of both were shown.]          In modern times the principle         of total
reflexion has also been employed, which involves the use           of glass,
and depends both upon refraction and reflexion.               In all these
appliances much light is lost : if metal be used for reflexion, a cer
tain proportion is absorbed by the face of the metal ; if glass be used
for refraction, light is lost at all the surfaces where the ray passes
between the air and the glass ; and also in some degree by absorp
tion in the body of the glass itself. There is, of course, no power
of actually increasing the whole amount of light, by any optical
arrangement associated with it.
    The light which issues forth into space must have a certain
 amount of divergence.      The divergence in the vertical direction
 must be enough to cover the sea from the horizon, to within a cer
tain moderate distance from the shore, so that all ships within that
distance may have a view of their luminous guide.          If it have less,
 it may escape   observation   where   it ought  to  be  seen;   if it have
more, light is thrown away which ought to be directed within the
useful degree of divergence : or if the horizontal divergence be con
sidered, it may be necessary so to construct the optical apparatus,
that the light within an angle of 60° or 45° shall be compressed
into a beam diverging only 15°, that it may give in the distance a
bright flash having a certain duration instead of a continuous light, —
 or into one diverging only 5° or 6°, which, though of far shorter
 duration, has greatly increased intensity and penetrating power in
 hazy weather. The amount of divergence depends in a large degree
 upon the bulk of the source of light, and cannot be made less than
 a certain amount, with a flame of a given size.        If the flame of an
 Argand lamp, -|ths of an inch wide and       lj  inch high, be placed in
 the focus of an ordinary Trinity House parabolic reflector, it will
 supply a beam having about 15° divergence : if we wish to increase
 the effect of brightness, we cannot properly do it by enlarging the
 lamp flame ; for though lamps are made for the dioptric arrange
 ment of Fresnel, which have as many as four wicks, flames 3 inches \
 wide, and burn like intense furnaces, yet if one be put into the
 lamp place of the reflector referred to, its effect would chiefly be to
 give a beam of wider divergence ; and if to correct this, the reflector
were made with a greater focal distance, then it must be altogether
 of a much larger size. The same general result occurs with the dioptric
apparatus ; and here, where the four-wicked lamps are used, they
 are placed at times nearly 40 inches distant from the lens, occasioning
 the necessity of a very large, though very fine, glass apparatus.
    On the other hand, if the light could be compressed, the necessity
 for such large apparatus would cease, and it might be reduced from
the size of a room to the size of a hat : and here it is that we seek
in the electric spark, and such like concentrated sources of light, for
aid in illumination.    It is very true, that by adding lamp to lamp,
each with its reflector, upon one face or direction, power can be
gained ; and in some of the revolving lights, ten lamps and reflectors
unite to give the required flash. But then not more than three of
these faces can be placed in the whole circle ; and if a fixed light
be required in all directions round the lighthouse, nothing better

 822                             Royal Institution.
 has been yet established than the four- wicked Fresnel lamp in the
 centre of its dioptric and catadioptric apparatus.           Now the electric
 light can be raised up easily to an equality with the oil lamp, and
 if then substituted for the latter, will give all the effect of the
 latter ; or by expenditure of money it can be raised to a five or
 tenfold power, or more, and will then give five- or tenfold effect.
 This can be done, not merely without increase of the volume of
 the light, but whilst the light shall have a volume scarcely the 2000th
 part of that of the oil flame.       Hence the extraordinary assistance we
 may expect      to  obtain    by diminishing the size, and perfecting the
 optical part   of  the apparatus.
     Many compressed intense lights have been submitted to the
 Trinity House ; and that corporation has shown its great desire to
 advance all such objects and improve the lighting of the coast, by
 spending, upon various occasions, much money and much time for
 this end. It is manifest that the use of a lighthouse must be never
 failing, its service ever sure ; and that the latter cannot be interfered
 with by the introduction of any plan, or proposition, or apparatus,
 which has not been developed to the fullest possible extent, as to the
 amount of light produced, — the expense of such light, — the wear
 and tear of the apparatus employed, — the steadiness of the light for
 16 hours, — its liability to extinction, — the amount of necessary
 night care, — the number of attendants, — the nature of probable
 accidents, — its fitness for secluded places, and other contingent
 circumstances, which can as well be ascertained out of a lighthouse
 as in it.     The electric spark which has been placed in the South
 Foreland High Light, by Prof. Holmes, to do duty for the six win
ter months, had to go through all this preparatory education before
it could be allowed this practical trial.            It is not obtained from
frictional electricity,      or from  voltaic electricity, but from magnetic
action. The first spark (and even magnetic electricity as a whole) was
 obtained twenty-eight years ago . (Faraday, PhilosophicalTransactions,
 1832, p. 32.)       If an iron core be surrounded by wire, and then moved
 in the right direction near the poles of a magnet, a current of elec
tricity passes, or tends to pass, through it. Many powerful magnets
 are therefore arranged on a wheel, that they may be associated very
near to another wheel, on which are fixed many helices with their
cores like that described.         Again, a third wheel consists of magnets
arranged like the first ; next to this is another wheel of the helices,
and next to this again a fifth wheel, carrying magnets.                All the
magnet-wheels are fixed to one axle, and all the helix wheels are
held immoveable in their place.            The wires of the helices are con
joined and connected with a commutator, which, as the magnet-
wheels are moved round, gathers the various electric currents pro
duced in the helices, and sends them up through two insulated wires
in one common stream of electricity into the lighthouse lantern.
So it will be seen that nothing more is required to produce the
electricity than to revolve the magnet wheels.                 There are two
magneto-     electric   machines   at the  South Foreland,   each being put in
motion by      a  two-horse power steam-engine ;          and, excepting wear
and    tear, the whole consumption        of  material  to produce the light is

 the coke and water required to raise steam for the engines, and car
  bon points for the lamp in the lantern.
     The lamp is a delicate arrangement of machinery, holding the two
 carbons between which the electric light exists, and regulating their
 adjustment ; so that whilst they gradually consume away, the place
 of the light shall not be altered. The electric wires end in the two
 bars of a small railway; and upon these the lamp stands. When the
 carbons of a lamp are nearly gone, that lamp is lifted off and an
 other instantly pushed into its place.       The machines and lamp have
 done their duty during the past six months in a real and practical
 manner.      The light has never gone out through any deficiency or
 cause in the engine and machine house ; and when it has become
 extinguished in the lantern, a single touch of the keeper's hand has
 set it shining as bright as ever.      The light shone up and down the
 Channel, and across into France, with a power far surpassing that
 of any other fixed light within sight, or anywhere existent. The
 experiment has been a good one.          There is still the matter of ex
pense    and  some   other circumstances to be considered ; but it is the
 hope and desire of the Trinity House, and all interested in the sub
ject, that it should ultimately justify its_full adoption.

 BORACIC ACID IN THE SEA-WATER ON THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA,
     'HE following interesting paper on boracic acid in the sea-water
        of the Pacific, on the coast of California, was read by Dr. John
 A. Veatch before the California Academy of Natural Sciences. The
 facts presented may lead to important results in various ways, and
 deserve attention from scientific men.        The Doctor said, —
    The existence of boracic acid in the sea-water of our coast was
 brought to my notice in July 1857.          I had, in the month of Janu
 ary  of the  previous year, discovered borate of soda and other borates
 in solution in the water of a mineral spring in Tehama county, near
 the upper end of the Sacramento valley.         Prosecuting the research,
 1 found traces of boracic acid — in the form of borates — in nearly all
 the mineral springs with which the State of California abounds.
 This was especially the case in the Coast mountains.             Borate of
 soda was so abundant in one particular locality, that enormous
 crystals of that salt were formed at the bottom of a shallow lake, or
rather marsh, one or two hundred acres in extent.              The crystals
were hexahedral with beveled or replaced edges, and truncated
angles ; attaining the size, in some cases, of 4 inches in length by
 2 in diameter, forming splendid and attractive specimens.           In the
same neighbourhood, a cluster of small thermal springs were observed
holding free boracic acid in solution.          A few hundred yards from
these a great number of hot springs, of a temperature of 212° Fahr.,
rose up through the fissures of a siliceous rock. These springs held a
considerable quantity of borax, as well as free boracic acid. Manyother
localities furnished similar indications, but in a less extensive form.
    In progress of the examination I found that the common salt
(chloride of sodium) exposed for sale in the San Francisco market,
and which, it was understood, came from certain deposits of that

824            Intelligence and Miscellaneous     Articles.
article on the sea-margin in the southern part of the State, also fur
nished horacic acid.     I was led to attribute it to the fact of mineral
springs emptying into the lagoons furnishing the salt.      It was there
fore a matter of no small surprise when, on a visit to the localities,
I found no trace of acid in any of the springs in the adjacent district.
This led to an examination of the sea-water, and a detection of an
appreciable quantity of boracic acid therein.       It was at Santa Bar
bara where I first detected it, and subsequently at various points,
from San Diego to the Straits of Fuca. It seems to be in the form of
borate of soda, and perhaps of lime. The quantity diminishes towards
the North.     It is barely perceptible in specimens of water brought
from beyond Oregon, and seems to reach its maximum near San Diego.
   This peculiarity seems to extend no great distance seaward.
Water taken thirty or forty miles west from San Francisco gave no
trace of acid.    In twelve specimens, taken at various points betwixt
this port and the Sandwich Islands, furnished me by Mr. Gulich, of
Honolulu, only that nearest our coast gave boracic acid. In ten
specimens kindly furnished me by Dr. W. O. Ayres, taken up by Dr.
J.  D. B. Stillman, in a trip of one of the Pacific mail steamers from
Panama to this place, no acid was observed south of theCortez Shoals.
   I have not as yet been able to obtain specimens of water south of
 San Diego, nearer the shore than the usual route of the mail steamers.
Neither have I been able to test the breadth of this boracic acid belt
any further than the fact above stated, of no acid being found at the
distance of thirty or forty miles west from the Golden Gate.             I
think it probable that it is confined within the submarine ridge run
ning parallel with the coast, the southern portion of which is indi
cated by certain shoals and island groups.        The source of the acid
is undoubtedly volcanic, and the seat of the volcanic action is most
likely to exist in this submerged mountain range. It strengthens
the probability of the eruptive character of the Cortez Shoals.
   I hope hereafter to be able to make more accurate and extended
examinations, unless some one more capable of doing justice to the
subject should take it in hand.       With this view, I solicited the at
tention of Dr.   J.  S. Newberry to these facts, while he was in this
city, on his way to join Lieut. Ives's Colorado Exploring Expedition,
hoping he might think it worthy of investigation during his stay on
this coast. With the same view, I now submit them to the Academy.

A NEW KIND OF SOTJND-FIGTJRES FORMED BY DROPS OF A LIQUID.
                               BY  F. MELDE.
   If  a drinking- glass, or   a funnel   of about 3 inches diameter at
the edge, be filled with water, or alcohol, or ether, and a strong note
be made by drawing a violin-bow on the edge, a sound figure will
be formed on the surface of the liquid, consisting of nothing but
drops of liquid.    If the vessel gives the fundamental note, the figure
forms a four-rayed star, the ends of which extend to the four nodal
points ; but if the note which the vessel gives be the second higher,
the star will be six-rayed ; and if the vessel gives still higher tones,
other more numerously rayed stars are produced. — PoggendorfF's

     On the Employment of the Stereographic Projection        of the
                       Sphere in Crystallography.
        the Philosophical Magazine for July 1859, it is shown that
 IN the     properties    of anharmonic ratios may be used with
advantage in constructing the gnomonic projection of the sphere
by which Neumann represents crystalline forms, and also in
constructing the projection applied to the same purpose by
Quenstedt.      I was unable, at that time, to extend the method
to the representation of crystalline forms, according to Neumann's
method, by the stereographic projection. S ubsequently, however,
I  have ascertained that it is equally applicable to the stereographic
projection, leading to a construction by which the centre of the
projection of any zone-circle may be readily determined.        Hence,
having given the centre and radius of the primitive, the radius
of the projection of a zone-circle may be found, being the hypo-
thenuse of a right-angled triangle one side of which is the radius
of the primitive, and the other side the distance of the centre of
the projection of the zone- circle from that of the primitive.      The
construction for finding the magnitude of a line or angle from
that of the anharmonic ratio into which it enters, will be found
in art. 1 3 of the paper in the Philosophical Magazine referred
to above.

The angle which the distance between the centres of any two of

   The symbol of any zone-circle may be used to denote the

to denote the straight line which is the locus of the centre of the

    It is easily seen that the centre of the stereographic projection
of  a  zone-circle is Quenstedt's projection of the corresponding
zone-axis, the nearer pole of the primitive being the fixed point
of Quenstedt's projection ; and that the straight line through the
centres of the stereographic projections of two zone-circles, is
Quenstedt's projection of the face having its pole in the inter
section of the two zone-circles.
         On the Measure     of the Dihedral Angles of Crystals.
   Euclid's definition of a dihedral angle takes no account of the
difference   in the nature of the matter on opposite sides of the
planes forming the dihedral angle;        therefore, though sufficient
for the purposes of geometry, it must be modified to suit the
requirements of crystallography.         The dihedral angle made by
two faces of a crystal, considered as planes separating matter of
one kind from matter of another kind, may be measured in two
different ways ; either by the angle between normals to the faces,
drawn from any point within the crystal towards the faces ; or,
by the supplement of this angle.          The latter measure, which
was unfortunately adopted by .the earlier crystallographers, leads
to the preposterous conclusion, that if two plane mirrors be
placed back to back, with their faces perpendicular to a given
straight line, the angle which the face of one mirror makes with
itself is 180°, and the angle which the face of one mirror makes
with that of the other, is 0°, though the mirrors are in the most
dissimilar positions, having their faces directed to points dia
metrically opposite.      It is scarcely possible that this measure
would have been adopted if the invention of the Reflective
Goniometer had preceded the crystallographic researches of Rome
de l'lsle.     In order to give an angle by a single reading, in
accordance with Carangeot's goniometer, Wollaston repeated the
numbering of the graduation in each semicircle (a source of
ambiguity in the recorded observations), instead of numbering
up to 360°, as is usual in circular instruments, and introduced
two stops and a spring which permitted the circle to turn only
in a direction contrary to that of the numbering, and enabled
the circle to be fixed nearly at 0° and 180°.        This contrivance
was but partially successful ; for it only gave the angle between
two faces one of which was observed at 0° or 180°, leaving the
other dihedral angles to be obtained by subtracting the difference
between the corresponding readings from 180° ; and in the most
carefully constructed instruments the adjustment of the stops
was too uncertain to fix the zero of the vernier at 0° or 180°,
without leaving an error too large to be neglected.       In the best
goniometers now constructed the stops are omitted, and the gra
duation is numbered up to 360°.        The difference of the readings

                Prof. Miller's Crystallographic Notices.           329
of the circle, corresponding to the observations by reflexion from
any two faces of a crystal, gives the angle between normals to
the faces, from a point within the crystal.    The data employed
in calculating dihedral angles, and the results of the calculations,
are expressed in the same measure.        The supplement of the
angle between      normals to  two  faces is nowhere used as the
measure of a dihedral angle, except in the lists of angles which
accompany the descriptions of mineral species.      An angle taken
from one of these lists cannot be compared with the direct result
of observation or of calculation, without first subtracting one or
 the other of them from 180°.       In order to avoid the needless
 trouble of subtracting angles from 180°, which from its frequent
 occurrence becomes extremely irksome, the editors of the last
 edition of Phillips's 'Mineralogy' ventured to measure a dihedral
 angle by the angle between normals to the faces containing         it,
 froma   point within the crystal. That they have not been over
 hasty in breaking through an inconvenient and unphilosophical
 convention, may be gathered from the fact that the same defini
 tion has since been adopted    by
                                 Beer, Dauber, Grailich, Guiscardi,
 Handl, Hess, v. Lang, Murmann, Rotter, Schroder, Sella,
 de Senarmont, and v. Waltershausen.
     The use of the angle between normals to the faces as the
 measure of the dihedral angle they make with each other,            is
 attended by some incidental advantages.      It enables the reader
 to apprehend more clearly the relative positions of the faces       by
 inspection of the recorded angles     employs fewer figures
                                         ;                     ; and
 in the descriptions of twin crystals, marks re-entering angles by
  giving them negative values.

  330       On   the Composition   of Water from    the Coal-strata.
          On   the doubly-refractive   character   of Thermophyllite.
      Some crystals of thermophyllite, a mineral of which an analysis
  by Mr. Northcote was published in the Philosophical Magazine
  for October 1858, were too imperfect to be measured, or to
  exhibit coloured rings when examined with a polarizing instru
  ment having three lenses of equal focal length, resembling the
  instrument contrived by the Astronomer Royal (Cambridge
  Philosophical Transactions, vol. iv. p. 199).               Norrenberg's
  newest polarizing instrument, in which the focal length of the
  eyepiece is many times that of the other two lenses, or com
  binations of lenses (Grailich, Krystallographisch-optische Unter-
  suchungen, p. 43), though it does not allow the positions of the
  optic axes to be determined with much accuracy, permits the
  use of a proportionably smaller slice of crystal.         With an instru
  ment constructed on this principle it was not difficult to make
  out the existence of two optic axes in thermophyllite, making
  with each other an angle of about 22° 30' in air. The position
   of the bisectrix with respect to the cleavage could not be measured
   on account of the curvature of the latter.             It appeared to be
   perpendicular     to the  cleavage.    It is therefore probable that the
   crystals belong to the prismatic system.
   XLIV.      On the Composition of Water obtained from the Coal-
       strata, Bradford Moor, Yorkshire, By Y< A. Abel, Esq.*
                         of a sample of water from the above source
   THEwas undertaken
              analysis
                                a short time since with the view to ascer
   tain whether it was adapted to general domestic purposes.            The
   results furnished by the examination appeared of sufficient in
   terest to warrant their publication.
      Two samples of the water collected at the mouth of a coal-pit,
   at an interval of about one month (the separate analyses of which
   furnished thoroughly concordant results), were submitted to me
   officially for examination by Lieutenant Colonel Hamley, Com
   manding Royal Engineer at York, who informed me that the
*
   Water, which is highly esteemed in the neighbourhood for drink
   ing and eulinary purposes, is raised from coal-pits, at a depth
   of about 200 feet beneath Bradford Moor, — an abundant and
   regular supply being obtained.
      The specific gravity of the water was 100078 at 60° F. Its
   reaction was powerfully alkaline, and its flavour was brisk and
  agreeable.

the largest proportion consisted of carbonate of soda.
   The alkalinity of the boiled water was determined by means
of standard sulphuric acid, and found to be equivalent to a pro
portion of 30-76 grains of carbonate of soda in an imperial gallon.
   The result obtained by the direct determination of the carbonic
acid, corresponded accurately to the proportion required by theory
to hold in solution the whole of the lime and magnesia in the
water, and to form bicarbonate with the amount of soda repre
sented by the number above quoted.

                    Wr   + W,         and           and  0X04
are similar functions, if the 15-ic in the V of Mr. Jerrard be
reducible to cubic factors, the 15-ics in 0x + 04 and 0}04, that is
to say in    f and 8, are so reducible.         But this is not the case.
 Under the most favourable circumstances in which we can form the
 cubic in £, the coefficients are unsymmetric. And the structure
 of the 15-ic in <y, which is reducible to a quintic and a 10-ic
 equation, discloses no means of attaining a cubic with known
 coefficients.     The most favourable combinations, those of the
 forms   7s/8sa5,  y^4au or    75/85/83*, are  unsymmetric.
    Further : the coefficients of the cubics of Mr. Jerrard are (see
 arts. 69, 94, 109, and 110 of his ' Essay f ') expressible rationally
in terms of xv xv . . x&, and the doctrine of similar functions
 shows that they are either symmetric or incapable of evaluation
 save by a quintic.        In the former case the five cubics are iden
tical ; in both cases the results are illusory.          It is a significant
fact that the soluble form of art. 96 of my ' Observations,' for
which the sextic in t degenerates into a cubic, is not irreducible J.
    The 'Essay' of Mr. Jerrard is of surpassing interest, but
these objections to the particular portion of it which relates to
the finite solution of quintics seem to me to be fatal.               A deep
admirer of his researches, and indisposed to regard as established
conclusions in which Mr. Jerrard does not concur,            I  may be per
mitted to express a hope that the promised sequel to the ' Essay '
will not be long delayed.
    Lastly : how can each one of the system of five cubics men
tioned in art. 110 (p. 84) of Mr. Jerrard's ' Essay ' be separated
from the rest save by a quintic ? How can this quintic be solved
unless it be an Abelian ? And how can it be an Abelian if the
given quintic be not an Abelian ? What evidence is there that
the four N's vanish as alleged by Mr. Jerrard ?

XLVI.        Note on    some Prismatic Forms of Calcite from Luganure,
         County    of   Wicklow.   By William K. Sullivan*.
        the first edition of his Traite de Mineralogie (Paris, 1801),
IN Haiiy       distinguished three kinds of prismatic carbonate of
 lime : — 1. Chaux carbonatee prismee, already described by Rome
 de Lisle, and which Haiiy supposes to be derived, in his mole
cular theory of decrements by the law dl. According to this, it
 would be the prism produced by modifying planes placed upon
the lateral edges of the primitive rhombohedron.          The second
he calls chaux carbonatee imitative, and considers to be the prism
obtained according to the law e2 by planes on the lateral angles
of the primitive. The third, which had also been before de
scribed by De Lisle, he named chaux carbonatee prismatique,
and considered to be also derived according to the law e2.        He
mentions four varieties of this form: a, alternating — having
three alternate wide faces and three intermediate narrow ones ;
b, compressed — with two opposite faces larger than the other
four; c, widened — with four faces wider than the remaining
two ; and d, lamelliform — in very short       e. in tabular) prisms.   (i.
Of the crystals of this form he says, " In certain crystals the
extremities are of       dull white, while the intermediate part
                         a                                                                     is
transparent. In others the opake part           situated towards the    is
axis and surrounded               by
                                transparent envelope.

a  few exhibited concentric hexagons, and one could even ob
serve the extremity of       small internal prism, rising above the
                                  a
whole prism."
   The forms he calls imitative and prismatic being obtained                                   by
the law      e2,
             contain the same prism the prismatic faces which

have been observed among the varieties of calcite belong,
therefore, to one or other of those prisms.    Dufrenoy, who uses
the nomenclature of Haiiy, as modified          Levy and himself,         by
represents the faces of the first prism, or that on the edges of
the rhombohedron,            by            of Haiiy), and the pris

 334                 Mr. Sullivan         on some Prismatic Forms             of
to be the limiting form of the rbombohedron, and is represented
by Mohs by the symbol R +                        x
                                  , and by Haidinger by ob R.
Zippe also adopts the latter.
   According to Haiiy d' or ooP is rare, and Dufrenoy states
that only some examples are known.     According to Zippe, it is
 frequent enough in combination as a secondary form, butseldomer
 as the dominant form.       Surmounted by the primitive rhombo-
hedron (R or P), it is noticed by Dufrenoy as "a very rare ex
 ample of the prism on the edges, associated with the primitive
rhombohedron*" from Cumberland.            He also mentions another
in which V or £R' (the equiaxe of Haiiy) replaces P or R, but
does not give the locality.      Further on he notices a third ex
ample    from  the  Samson  mine   in the Hartz, in which the hori
zontal edges of the prism are truncated by rudimentary planes
of the pyramid.
    The prism ooR or                e2,
                           although comparatively rare as      simple                 a
form,      very frequent in combination
           is                               according to Dufrenoy,
                                                           ;
indeed,     it  the only one found complete.        little before, he  A

                              a           and almost   always opake.
The base sometimes bears stria; parallel to the edges, which are
indications of cleavage.      Examples of ooR surmounted          ^R'                     by
or    from the Hartz, Cumberland, and the department of l'Isere,
      b1
have been described.
   The position of the rhombohedrons surmounting the prisms                                    is
different in each kind. In ooP the surmounting rhombohedral
faces lie so that the edges of combination with the prismatic
faces coincide with the lateral edges of the rhombohedrons          In
 ocR the edges of combination in three alternate faces are hori
zontal; the truncatures at either end of the prism alternating,
so that each face of truncature      parallel to one at the opposite
                                                 is
end.    The directions of the cleavages correspond perfectly with
the dispositions of the modifying planes, so that every alternate
basal edge of the prism coR or        may be removed e2
                                                             cleavage            by
with the greatest facility,      which     by

faces of the rhombohedron may be obtained.
   Although the prismatic faces ooR are sometimes dull, they
always, at least in all the crystals which    recollect to have seen,

possess   more lustre  than  the faces  ooP  associated  with them.
The former are, indeed, usually very bright in transparent
crystals.   This circumstance       noticed by Dufrenoy, who, in
                                                is

Says that the faces are dull and somewhat rough, as is frequently
the case with those prisms [" les faces en sont mates et un peu

              .  The difference in lustre between the faces of the
two kinds of prisms      characteristically seen in the dodecagonal
                         is
prisms (chaux     carbonatee   peridodecaedre     of Haiiy), which              is
the combination ooR, ooR, oP (dl          e9

                                                      ;
always very much more brilliant than ooP (d1).           This difference
of lustre   isone of the distinctions relied upon to distinguish the
faces of the two kinds of hexagonal prisms from one another.
Dufrenoy also notices this difference between the two kinds of
prismatic faces in the twelve-sided prisms.
    Several forms of the rhombohedral prism occur at the Lu-
ganure mines, County of Wicklow, which are worked for galena
in veinstone consisting chiefly of quartz, in granite country.

Among these may be mentioned ooP, oR (d1, a1), consisting of
small hexagonal prisms, with very bright prismatic faces.            One
half of the prism   is hyaline, and the other opalescent        the base
                                                                   j

       is       Another variety of the same form also occurs, con
sisting of crystals one centimetre high, and with basal edges one
centimetre long.      Each crystal has        sort of rude triangular
prismatic milky nucleus, surrounded            by a
                                                perfectly hyaline enve

lope, reminding one of the description of Haiiy given above.
Owing to the number of cleavage planes, some crystals are not
transparent.     The face oR          in most instances peculiarly
                                     is
striated, in others  it   is,
                            as  itwere, coated with       thin porcela-
                                                              a
neous layer.     These crystals may be easily cleaved parallel to
the alternate basal edges, which are sharp, and without any
trace of modifying planes.      The form oR, coR (a1,             e2)
                                                             also occurs
iu beautiful hexagonal plates, with very bright prismatic faces,
and composed of exceedingly thin alternating layers of white
 opake, and hyaline matter, the base oR being always opake,
dull, but beautifully white. Haiiy's description of the prismatic
kind embraces this variety likewise; in fact, the specimens
from Luganure here described illustrate perfectly Haiiy's de
scription.
 I    have lately, however, met with another form, consisting of
hexagonal plates, of from one millimetre to one and          half thick,
                                                                  a
with basal edges of from five to twenty millimetres.           The base
has    abright nacreous lustre, much brighter than what              have
                                                                        I
ever seen in any other specimen       ;striated and uneven, in conse
quence of the lapping of smaller plates.       The most of the tabular
prisms are, in fact, compound twins to the base oR (a1). Some
twins also occui- to the faces of the prism, and finally, to                    a*
rhombohedron. It         isowing to this twin structure that the
crystals are not generally transparent for in thin plates they are
                                           ;

 336               Mr. Sullivan         on some Prismatic Forms               of
 perfectly hyaline.    Except for the difference of form, a mass of
 these crystals, resting on crystalline quartz, resembles, in a strik
 ing manner, a mass of large crystals of chlorate of potash. Layers
 of growth in the direction of the secondary axes can be observed
 in some of the prisms ; in many of these the outer shell, about
 one millimetre thick, is frequently free from indications of
 cleavage, and perfectly transparent.     The prismatic faces are dull,
 exactly like the appearance of white wax when sufficiently thin
 to be translucent; they are also uneven.         These faces exactly
 resemble those of the prism ocP (a*1), in specimens which        have                    I
 seen from Andreasberg.      On this account,                        I
                                                   concluded, at first
 sight, that       I
                 had the combination oP, ooP, which would be not
 merely rare as an example of the pyramidal prism, but still more
 so as a tabular form of              it,
                              in which the base would impress its
 character upon the crystal, and of which             have not seen  I
 any example recorded.         found, however, that the alternate
                                      I
 edges were modified by rudimentary facets of          rhombohedron,      a
 which was placed in the same position, as regards the faces of
 the prism, that have before mentioned as characteristic of coR.

    Associated with the crystals just described, were sometimes

 others three or four millimetres thick, upon which were rudi

the important problem in molecular physics — the causes which produce

of such errors as Rovenagh and Borenagh for Bovevagh (pp. 54 and 88),

  It    true that no body belonging to the solar system can fall

into the sun so long as the laws that keep them in their orbits
are maintained.        body that has once rounded the sun in

parabola or elongated ellipse, will probably continue to do so,
unless in the rare case of the perihelion distance being so close
to the sun's surface that       slight perturbation from the other
                                    a
bodies of the system may bring         within the limits of the sun's

the perihelion  distance     less
                               is than the  sun's radius, the sun must
inevitably absorb it. We are thus certain that the velocity of                                     a
body that impinges on the sun must exceed 419 miles per second                                 ;
for such    the orbital velocity in the parabola that separates the
            is
lesser velocity in the ellipse from the greater velocity in the hy-.
perbola.
  With this velocity and Mr. Joule's unit         easy to compute it   is
the quantity of heat due   to the  conversion of the force    and                    j         if
the absolute zero of temperature coincide with —461° F„ the
zero of gaseous tension, the temperature attainable          known               by   a
substance under   such  conditions may also be exactly computed,
independent of any theory or hypothesis whatever.

Heat engendered by    the possible   Fall of a Meteor   into the Sun.   339
per second, the corresponding rise of temperature is 564°, in
creasing as the square of the velocity; and 419 miles per second
corresponds to 419 x 419 x 564 = 99,016,404°.
   A pound of iron under the same circumstances would acquire
the same force ; but that force converted would raise its tempe
rature nine times the above amount, because the same quantity
of heat has nine times greater effect in raising the temperature
of iron than it has on the same weight of water.
   A pound of mercury would have its temperature affected about
thirty times the above amount, and so on according to the specific
heat of the substance.     •
    Assuming that the specific heat of the body that impinges on
the sun is the same as glass, the rise of temperature correspond
ing to the velocity 419 miles per second is 565 million degrees
Fahrenheit.
    Thus the intensity of the temperature engendered depends on
the molecular constitution of the body : the quantity of the heat,
however, is independent of everything but the velocity and the
mass ; and each pound of any body whatever that strikes the sun
with the velocity 419 miles per second is endowed with force
sufficient to raise a pound of water 100,000,000 degrees of Fahr
enheit's scale.
    Has the mass of the sun been gradually collocated by matter
thus descending ? To estimate exactly the probability of this,
two other data are required, viz. the temperature of the sun's
surface, and the quantity of heat radiating from it in a given
time.    The first is unknown, but the second we know approxi
mately from the observations of M. Pouillet, also from those of
Herschel and Forbes. It is estimated that it suffices to melt
a stratum of about 2 feet thickness of ice at the earth's mean
distance in twenty-four hours.     This is equivalent to 1*04 foot
of ice per second at the sun's surface.      Now it is known thai;
ice requires 142° F. to melt        and each of those degrees
                                     it,                                 js
equivalent to the work expended in raising the weight of the ice
772 feet against the force of gravity at the earth's surface. We
thus deduce that weight equal to that of the ice arriving at the
                 a
sun with a   velocity of 2649 feet, or half mile per second (viz,
                                                a
the velocity acquired in falling through 142 x 72 feet),7     equiis
valent to the force emanating from the sun in one second.                Jf
the same amount of force     isbrought to the sun           by
                                                     matter moving
at the minimum velocity of 419 miles per second, the mass of
this matter must be less than the mass of the ice, in the ratio of
1  to the square of  twice 419.   Such massa        is
                                                  represented           by   a,
sphere of 11 "068 miles in diameter, of the density of water.
    Supposing the sun to have the same density and specific heat
as water, and comparing its volume with that of the sphere of

340     Mr.   J. J. Waterston   on the Heat engendered by the
11 miles    diameter, and allowing for the time, we find the
sun's annual loss of temperature to be 6°-125. This is a simple
arithmetical deduction from the fact that the sun's heat can melt
about 2 feet of ice daily.    The observations of Herschel and
Forbes fix it at 1-835 foot (Phil. Trans. 1842) ; those of M.
Pouillet at about one-third less (Taylor's Scientific Memoirs,
vol. iv.). If  we assume 1*6 foot as the correct thickness, the
yearly  reduction of temperature is 4°-59.    If
                                               the specific heat of
the matter of the sun corresponded with iron, this decrement of
temperature would have to be multiplied by 9, and so on for
other assumed values.    But it is convenient to found our ideas
of such quantitative relations on water as the standard most
familiar.
   Assuming the earth to have six times the density of water, we
may extend these calculations ; and comparing volumes and time,
we deduce 69 as the number of years that the sun takes to throw
out as much force as would accrue to it by the earth falling down
upon its surface.    The mechanical force thus supplied would be
equivalent to the expenditure of heat-force for 69 years ; and the
rise of temperature of the whole mass of the sun, supposing the
increment of heat uniformly diffused through its mass, would ap
proach as much nearer to the maximum limit 317° (=69 x 40,59)
as the temperature of the planet after impact exceeded the tem
perature of the sun.
   Again, if we suppose the planet after it has struck the surface
of the sun to settle into a disc of 60,000 miles diameter, having
the temperature of 100,000,000 degrees, the temperature of the
sun being 12 millions, we should have 255th of its disc shining
with eightfold lustre, giving out probably eight times as touch
                                                          .

heat as an equal surface in the normal state.      Thus           on =
represents the increment of solar heating power; and if we esti
mate the normal amount as what is required to keep the earth's
surface at a mean temperature of 60 F. or 521° absolute, we
         521
see that      = 17° nearly, is the increment of mean temperature
over all the earth that would arise from such a planet-fall.
   M. Pouillet infers from his observations on solar radiation,
that the temperature of the sun's surface is at least 2660° F.
If it do not exceed this amount, the rise of temperature in the
whole mass of the sun would be about 200° ; but           if,
                                                         as before,
we assume the planet to settle into      a disc 2'in diameter, we
have y^jyth of the sun's disc shining with 38,000 times the normal
force, so that  aplanet-fall of this magnitude would increase the
radiating power of the sun 171 times.

    Such extravagant conclusions only show the insufficiency of
our data, and demonstrate the uncertainty in which the subject
is involved, so long as an approximation to tbe actual tempera
ture of the solar surface is wanting.
   Is it possible to ascertain the temperature of the radiating
surface of the sun ? Ordinary observations give us the tempera
ture in the sun and in the shade.         Suppose the temperature of
the sun to be double its present amount, it is probable that the
absolute temperature in the shade and in the sun would also be
double the present amount; consequently, also, the difference
between them. We might thus expect this difference, when due
precautions are taken, to be a constant quantity, and to be a
function of the sun's absolute temperature.
   Suppose a thermometer to be enclosed in a vacuum and sur
rounded on all sides by matter having a uniform absolute tem
perature t : we may consider it to be the centre of a sphere, the
interior surface of which radiates heat to          and the balance of
                                                               it,

change of force in constant operation.                         If

                 is

of ray a in passing through the atmosphere.   It will be remarked
that t° is the difference of reading between thermometers in the
sun and in the shade taken with due precautions.
   Some years ago, when in India, I tried this by enclosing a
thermometer within three concentric boxes well protected from
external influences, and capable of being equally heated all round
to any temperature below 400°, by means of flues ascending
 from an Argand lamp.         The sun's rays, when near the meridian
 (having an altitude of about 70° and with the atmosphere per
fectly clear and calm), were admitted to fall, when required, on
the bulb of the thermometer through a narrow triplet glass par
 tition.      I
              found that 50° was the rise that took place in conse
 quence of exposure.       There being glass partitions on both sides,
the reading of the thermometer was very distinct by transmitted
light. Beginning at 80°, without applying the lamp, the ad
mission of the sun's rays caused the mercury to rise to 130°,
where it remained steady.        The lamp was then applied at low
power, so as to maintain the inner box at this temperature while
the sun was excluded. When perfectly steady, the sun's rays
were readmitted, and the mercury again mounted with the same
alacrity as before, until it reached 180°.        This continued step
by step up to 250°. No difference, either in the magnitude of
the step or the time taken to effect               it,
                                            could be detected.
     Thus, for   t°  we have the constant 50°, and n we obtain                     by
comparing the disc of the sun with the surface of the sphere.
At the earth's mean distance the sun's diameter               82' B"'6t is
hence    «=  183960 and #=918000°.
     If there no fault in this mode of proceeding, we may with
                  is
confidence estimate the solar temperature to be above 10,000,000
degrees, probably 12,000,000, allowing          reduction of one-third

three plates of glass.

t° seems wholly independent of the temperature of the medium

 adopted in the text, that this coefficient will be either
                          (m— n)yjr(a) or (m— »)F(o),

illogical.

      To    the  Editors   of the Philosophical Magazine       and Journal.
         Gentlemen,
  MY           attention has recently been drawn to the dynamical
              theory of the submergence of telegraphic cables, which
  has already been discussed both theoretically and practically, at
  some length and with considerable skill, by Messrs. J. A Long-
  ridge and C. H. Brooks, in a valuable paper read before the
  Institution of Civil Engineers, Feb. 16, 1858. The mathema
  tical theory originally laid down in this excellent paper has since
  been established, by a different form of process, in an elegant
  paper by Mr. G. B. Airy, the Astronomer Royal, inserted in
  your valuable Journal for July 1858. Independently of the
  practical importance of the subject as an engineering operation,
  the investigation of the several relations appertaining to it is not
  devoid of mathematical interest.                Indeed I have found the in
  quiry    to   be  so inviting     as  to lead  me   not only to simplify, but
  to extend the investigations of the general problem somewhat

further than is contained in these papers ; and having, moreover,
considered the subject in its more practical bearings, it is pre
sumed that the contribution I am now about to make may be
considered of sufficient value for publication.
   To avoid confusion we shall, as far as may be practicable,
retain the notation and general arrangement of the Astronomer
Royal, and for present convenience we shall here briefly state
the principal symbols employed, viz. —
   n the ship's velocity.
   m the velocity of delivery of the cable.

         from the bottom.

         same point,
      the radius of curvature.

      I. We    have first to discuss the problem on the hypothesis
    that the resistance and friction encountered ita passing through
    the water shall each vary simply as the velocity.

    cable perfectly flexible.

By resolving the resistance      and friction,                                     the total impressed

so that     shall be uniformly deposited at the same speed at

     It
      may be proper to observe that these conditions of steady
movement, on which the investigation         made to depend, can            is
only be accurate when the cable     paid out at the same speed as

evident that, whatever may be the initial disturbances, the move
ment will soon cause the cable to assume the permanence of form
here supposed.     The conditions will, however, approximately
subsist when m differs but slightly from n, as the form of the
curve will then only be subject to     very gradual change.   Buta
if m should differ much from n, we ought not to place much
reliance in the accuracy of the results*.

resistance and friction to each vaiy as the square of the velocity,
which supposition is more nearly in accordance with the actual
resistances as determined by experiment.     Let

 can arise when e=2, as they will only differ as regards the scale

    * The Astronomer Royal has tabulated the coordinates, for               the same
 value of e, on the hypothesis of the resistances varying simply as         the velo

                   as a is a very
practice   exceed the tensile strength of the cable, we conclude
that, if the depth of the sea be at all considerable, the inclination
(to), at the ship, must necessarily be very near to the limiting
angle, especially if that angle be small.
     Ifwe consider the nature of the formula (11), it is evident
                                                                                           1— a3

necessarily  be algebraically positive.   Therefore cos o>— a and
coso),—     must have like signs; that
              a.                            in any possible form of

the cable, the inclination a> must either be always less or always
greater than the limiting angle X. Let us briefly examine these
two cases separately.
   1. When <»      always less than the limiting angle, the values
                            is
of cos&> — a will be positive; and therefore the values of —                                          T   a
will be always positive.  Also, since the values of cos co — sin2 a                              e2
are positive,     follows from (3) that the radius of curvature
                      it                                                                                  is
always  positive.    Consequently the curve      everywhere concave     is
upwards and convex downwards.
   The equation (12) indicates that the radius of curvature in
creases rapidly when to approaches to the value of         and that                        X,
the upper portion of the cable i-apidly approximates in form to
that of    straight lime. Also the equation (14) shows that for
              a
a given value of      or at  given speed of the vessel, the contour
                             e,            a
of the curve will be given in species, the scale of measurement, or
unit, being the length of the radius of curvature at the lowest
point and this again will depend upon the amount of " stray
        " of cable payed out as compared with the

 (14) we have  then  p0=0,   and       (3) T0—a, which by   the least                      is
possible value of the tension at the lowest point.        But as the
curve should be continuous with the line of the deposited cable,
in order that this tension may be adequately sustained, we ought
not to pay out the stray length to the extreme limit, but only
until pQ becomes small for the prescribed movement of any por

at its extremities.
   The cable being traced        „, ^          _        - ^
upwards from the lowest
point soon assimilates to a
straight line, and when the
stray length is gradually in
creased the modifications of the curve will be as in the annexed
diagram, where B' D' is the direction of the ship's motion, and
A B, a c, a' d successive representations of the suspended cable.
The curves being similar, A B will be a prototype of the rapidly
decreasing portions a b, a'     and the diminished scale of mea
                                  b',

of the curve,    will evidently approximate to the right line mra
                 it
asa  limit, where p0 becomes evanescent.
   In each position of the curve we have               by
                                                (3) T0=a + p0, and

founding T— a with the tension          T,
                                    has presumed the non-existence
of tension at this point and subsequently Mr. Homersham Cox,
                             ;
in paper read before the British Association, after advancing
  a
the same assumption as an original principle, has adduced     some       a
what ingenious and elaborate proof of the dynamical necessity of
the descending cable taking the form of       straight line but,

be positive at all points.        Also the value of cos a> — e2sin9a>              is

                            p
                            is negative, and hence the curve      alwaysis
convex upwards.        But as the direction of the curve at the lowest
point (A')  is  not continuous with the line of cable previously de
posited,  there  cannot be any stay or reaction to support the re
quisite tension at that point, and the consequence will be                         a
distorted movement in this locality accompanied by an irregular
displacement and       a useless and extravagant waste of     portion of
                                                                    a

ing out of the cable; and other injurious consequences may
ensue from the friction occasioned              by
                                           the cable being dragged to              a
certain distance along      the  bed  of the  ocean before the tension
due to a   steady movement can be reinstated.
   If, therefore, Table be made out showing the weight, in water,
                  a
of any number of fathoms of cable,           will be an important and
                                                 it
valuable rule for practical guidance, always to moderate the paying
out so as to keep the tension certain proportion, say one-third
                                        a
or one-fourth, in excess of the weight corresponding to the

364                 Mr. M. Ponton on certain Laws
ascertained depth of the sea.       By so doing, the tension will be
kept within reasonable limits, the curve will always be slightly-
concave upwards, and there will be no waste.          We also conclude
that the mechanical structure and dimensions of the cable ought
to be such as to enable it to bear a tensile strain of not less than
three times the maximum depth.
    In calculations of distance, it will naturally occur that an
additional length of cable will be needed to accommodate the
irregularities of the bed of the ocean ; and it may not be un
reasonable to entertain a conjecture as to whether or not any
extensive fissures or chasms may exist at great depths, which can
only be ascertained by repeated soundings.
   Note. — The mechanical or dynamical conditions which deter
mine the subsistence of both branches of the curve of steady
movement, may be comprehended by conceiving two vessels, B' B,
to be sailing with equal velocities in the direction B' B, and that
the suspended cable curve B' A B is payed out from B and at the
same time wound up to B' with the same velocity, so as to keep
the lowest point A just on the verge of contact with the ground.
The curve will be nearly the same in form whichever of the two
be the paying out vessel ; and when B and B' are supposed to
coincide, the two branches of the curve will become duplicates of
the limiting line m n.

           L.    On certain Laws   of Chromatic   Dispersion.
                    By Mungo Ponton, F.R.S.E.
                          [Concluded from p. 272.]
          difference between the view of M. Cauchy, then, and
THE     that arising out of the foregoing investigation, may be
shortly stated thus : — According to the former, the refractive
index of the wave corresponding to each of the fixed lines is a com
pound quantity consisting of two terms, one constant for the me
dium and temperature, the other variable and inversely propor
tional to the squares of the normal wave-length.           According to
the latter view, the refractive index is still a compound quantity,
but consisting of three instead of only two terms. One is constant
for the medium and temperature.          The second is variable — not,
however, in inverse proportion to the squares of the normal
wave-lengths. It corresponds to a further shortening of the
wave-length beyond that corresponding to the constant portion
of the index ; and these further shortenings are in strict inverse
proportion to the primary normal wave-lengths, or to the initial
forces by which these are generated.         The third portion of the
index is also variable, and is that corresponding to those varia

                      of Chromatic Dispersion.                    365
tions in the wave-lengths which are rendered manifest by the
displacement of the fixed lines from their normal relative positions
in the unrefracted spectrum, and which are attendant on the
irrationality.     The first, or constant, portion of the index indi
cates the state of compression of the asther in the pores of the
medium. The variable fragment consists of two portions, — one
depending for its magnitude on the specific action of the pon
derable molecules of the medium on the aether within its pores,
the other apparently depending on a specific action of the vibra
tions of the ponderable molecules of the medium on certain defi
nite waves passing through the sether in its pores, in virtue of
which some of these waves are slightly lengthened, and others
slightly shortened, but always in a certain symmetrical manner.
    To place the matter in a popular point of view : — Let the
sether be regarded as a universally diffused elastic fluid, and
each portion of it as comprising numerous centres of elastic or
repulsive force.      Since force cannot exist as a simple abstraction
 (for we  cannot   conceive  of force as being exerted by nothing, or
by   mere  space),  it is needful  to suppose these centres to be each
occupied by a something which exerts the force, and which may
            ' an aethereal
be called                   particle.' These particles must be sepa
rated from each other by certain minute but variable distances,
otherwise there could be no movement of the particles.             Each
particle must be conceived to occupy a certain normal position
in absolute space, from which it never departs except under the
influence of some applied external force, and to which it always
returns when that applied force ceases to act upon it. In the
free aether, each particle is retained in its normal position with
a certain persistence, in virtue of the forces exerted upon it by all
the other aethereal particles by which it is surrounded. The force
required to induce any given amount of motion in an aethereal
particle must be proportional to the degree of this persistence.
    Assume, for the sake of illustration, that in the wave corre
sponding to the fixed line B in the free aether there are em
braced in the direction of its length 1,000,000 of such par
ticles, that is,  the moving force has time to progress onwards,
and more or less to affect ,000,000 particles in
                            1                         a   right line in
the direction of propagation, during the period occupied          by   a
single particle in performing its individual motion in this par
ticular wave.      On this assumption, the wave corresponding to
the fixed line H must similarly embrace, in the direction of its
length, 570,655 such particles.         Suppose now  a  portion of the
aether  to be,  from   any cause, so compressed  as to halve  the inter
vals between its particles. When the waves       B    and H  enter this
compressed portion,   B     ought still to embrace 1,000,000, and   H
570,655 particles in their respective lengths; but the intervals

 366               Mr. M. Ponton on certain Laws
 between the particles being halved, each of those waves would
 now be reduced to one-half of its original length. When the
 aether is compressed in the pores of a refracting medium, how
 ever, this rule does not hold.    The B wave now appears to em
 brace in its length less than 1,000,000, and the H wave less
 than 570,655 particles.      If the B wave thus seem to lose, say
 50,000 of its particles in  the direction of its length, the H wave
 will seem to lose exactly the same number; so that this loss
 tells very differently on the lengths of these two waves.        The
 H wave becomes proportionally more shortened by this loss than
 the B wave ; so that the motive force progresses more slowly in
 the H wave, in proportion to its rate of progress in the B wave,
 than it did before entering the medium.      Hence to keep up with
 its more rapid neighbour, and present a straight front to the
 observer, the H wave takes a shorter cut in passing through the
 medium.      It pursues a different path ; the two waves become
 more or less separated, and thiB constitutes dispersion.
    Now this want of power in the motive force to extend to its full
number of particles during the period of the individual excursion of
 each particle, must be due to an increase in the persistence of th«
particles in their normal positions. This persistence will of course
be increased by the greater proximity of the particles ; but the
increase of persistence thence arising exhibits itself in the general
shortening of the wave-length, in proportion to the compression
of the aether. Were the additional loss of length which mani
fests itself in the dispersion of the waves due to this cause alone,
then would the dispersive power of every medium be proportional
to the density of the sether in its pores, or to its general refract
ive power.     But this is far from being the case. The oil of
cassia, for  example, which exerts a smaller compressing force on
the aether than does crown-glass, has nevertheless a much higher
dispersive power; so that the latter must be due to some other
force than that which causes the refraction.
    Suppose now a medium in which the value of ae is 0'05, and
that of e 1*5, so making the density of the sether one-half more
than it is in the planetary spaces, the intervals between the
sethereal particles being thus reduced in the proportion of 0'66
to 1. Were there no other cause operating than this greater
proximity of the particles, and if the wave-length continued to
embrace its primary number of particles, each wave-length ought
to be diminished in this same proportion, at least very nearly so ;
for some little allowance must be made for the size of the par
ticles as compared with that of the intervals.       But it is found
that, leaving out of view that peculiar property of the medium
which exhibits itself in the irrationality, and confining attention
to its dispersive power alone, the number of particles embraced

                      of Chromatic Dispersion.                   367
in the B wave on entering such       a medium will appear to be only
950,000 instead of 1,000,000, while in the H wave the number
will appear to be only 520,655 instead of 570,655; so that each
of these waves has had its length curtailed by the space which
50,000 aethereal particles would occupy in this medium, in ad
dition to the curtailment, in the proportion of 0"66 to 1, due to
the increased density of the aether.      Now this must be owing to
the circumstance that the molecules of the medium exert on the
aethereal particles in its pores an influence such as to increase
their tendency to remain in their normal positions, to a certain
extent beyond the measure in which that tendency is increased,
by the mere approximation of the sethereal particles themselves.
By the operation of this force, the B wave has its length dimi
nished in the proportion of 0-95 to 1, but the H wave in the
proportion of nearly 091238 to 1 ; so that in the case of the B
wave the loss is in the proportion of 0'05 to 1, but in the H wave
it is 0*08762 to 1, these losses standing to each other in inverse
proportion to the initial moving forces ; and the like may be
 proved with respect to all the other wave-lengths.         Thus the
loss of length arising from that peculiar action of the ponderable
 molecules of the medium on the aether in its pores, in virtue of
 which it increases the persistence of the aethereal particles in
 their normal positions, is in exact inverse proportion to the
 amount of the primary force by which the undulation is excited ;
 and this is precisely what ought to be expected.        The absolute
loss of length sustained by each wave from this cause is the
 same, but its relative loss is in inverse proportion to its primary
 length.   Thus dispersion arises from the operation of a force in
 virtue of which the ponderable molecules of the medium com
 municate to the aethereal particles, which are for the instant
 associated with them, a certain amount of persistence in their
 normal positions beyond what is due to the increased proximity
 of the particles themselves.     It is constant for the medium and
 temperature ; but it is specific, and independent of the size of
 the pores of the medium in which the aether is momentarily
 more or less compressed;      so that a high dispersive power may
 consist with a low refractive power, or vice versa ; although in
general the greater the compressive power of the medium, the
 greater the amount of this peculiar force.
    This, then, accounts for the larger proportion of the variable
 quantity which remains after deducting from the indices corre
 sponding to the fixed lines the constant which represents the
 density of the aether in the pores of the medium. That variable
 portion corresponds to a loss of wave-length inversely propor
 tional to the primary wave-length, and may be found by multi
 plying the index by this loss, as already pointed out in the case

368                 Mr. M. Ponton on certain Laws
of bisulphuret of carbon.         But the indices thus obtained are
subject   to  a further correction, by the addition or subtraction of
that portion which is due to the extrusion of the fixed lines
attending the irrationality of the spectrum.
    The remaining portion of the variable part of the index cor
responds to this extrusion of the fixed lines from their normal
positions, in consequence of which their mutual distances are
altered from what they are in the unrefracted spectrum.          This
is quite a distinct phenomenon from dispersion, which is simply
the greater or smaller expansion of the coloured spaces, and the
consequent greater or smaller length of the spectrum which the
medium presents.        Besides the shortening of the wave, attribu
table to the increased density of the aether within the medium,
and the further shortening which it undergoes by losing a defi
nite number of the particles embraced in its length, it may be
 still further modified by an alteration in the period of vibration
 of each of its component sethereal particles, — an alteration which
 will cause a corresponding small variation in the length of the
 wave, and in the position of the fixed line corresponding to it.
 These alterations, it has been shown, always take place accord
 ing to certain determinate laws ; and the total amount of the
 positive and negative extrusions is so related to the dispersive
 power, that, by means of the ratio between these two, there may
 be always found for the normal wave-lengths an exponent at which
 the extrusions are reduced to zero, this exponent being the above
 ratio multiplied by 10 8 and added to unity.        By applying this
 exponent to the normals, the indices of refraction become reduced
 to two terms instead of three, as already pointed out.
     In explanation of the irrationality two views may be suggested.
  The displacement of the fixed lines is obviously due to the cir
  cumstance that the waves corresponding to the central lines D,
  E, and F are le3S refracted ; while those corresponding to the
  extreme lines B, C, G, and H are more refracted than they
  would otherwise be.       There is thus a transfer of motive energy
  from the extremes to the central region of the spectrum. Now
  this distribution corresponds to that of the brightness ; for all
  spectra are brighter towards the centre than towards the extremes.
  The brightness being proportional to the squares of the ampli
  tudes of the individual vibrations embraced in the wave-length,
  it follows that, at the recipient surface, the amplitudes of those
  vibrations are greater towards the centre than towards the ex
  tremes of the spectrum.       This correspondence raises a presump
  tion  of there  being  some   connexion between these two phamo-
  mena.      The medium may be supposed to produce a certain effect
  on the amplitudes of the vibrations, decreasing them by a certain
  definite amount, and increasing the rapidity of the vibration and

                      of Chromatic Dispersion.                   369
the refrangibility of the wave by a like definite amount, as a
consequence of the curtailment of the amplitude.        This curtail
ment being absolutely the same for all the waves, will produce
the greatest rateable effect on those undulations whose vibrations
have the least amplitude, namely those at the extremes of the
spectrum. Hence these will have their refraction increased from
the operation of this cause in a higher proportion than will the
central waves, and so produce a displacement of the fixed lines
from their normal positions in the manner observed.
     Or again, the slight alterations in the rapidity of the indivi
dual vibrations of the sethereal particles comprised within the
wave-length, and which manifest themselves by the displacement
of the fixed lines, may be due to    a sympathetic   action between
the vibrations of the ponderable atoms of the medium and
those of the sethereal particles, somewhat resembling the sym
pathy of vibrating pendulums ; and in virtue of this sympathy
some of the sethereal vibrations may be slightly increased, and
others slightly diminished in their rate of rapidity beyond what
they would otherwise be. These views, however, are merely
thrown out as hints for consideration.
     While one of the objects with which the foregoing investiga
tion is submitted to the British Association is to call the atten
 tion of its members to the curious laws governing the displace
 ment of the fixed lines, and their use in detecting errors of ob
 servation, and to bring under their notice the advantages of the
 exponential law as furnishing a method of calculating accurate
 indices of refraction from tolerably correct observations, the chief
 purpose is to awaken those who take a lead in the proceedings
 of the Association to the necessity which exists for a careful repe
 tition of those observations that have been found most deficient
 in accuracy, and for an extension of the observations generally.
 It would be particularly interesting to accumulate observations
 at different temperatures, so as further to illustrate the law of
 the variation of the index of elasticity, viewed in relation to the
 contractions and expansions of the medium under the influence
 of changes of temperature, and also in relation to the capacity
 of the medium for heat.      It is not improbable that, out of an
 experimental investigation carefully conducted in this direction,
 some highly interesting and important results might arise.
     It is only under the direction and auspices of such a body as
 the British Association that there is any likelihood of an experi
 mental investigation of such a nature being undertaken ; and
 it is hoped that, when its importance to the science of physical
 optics shall have been duly weighed by them, they will not fail
 to place the matter in the hands of competent and careful ob
  servers, so that an enlarged store of trustworthy experimental
  data may be obtained.

                  has   described   *  some    methods for obtaining a
DEBRAY   number of artificial phosphates and arseniates, many of
them identical in form and composition with known minerals,                j
    Wben an    insoluble   carbonate   is treated with  excess  of aqueous
phosphoric acid, or arsenic acid, the carbonate is usually changed
into a crystallized phosphate or arseniate.            The proportion of
water of hydration varies with the temperature.                With phos
phoric acid and carbonate of lime, a phosphate of lime is ob
tained of the composition P05,2CaO, HO +4 HO.                    At a teni-  -
perature    of 100°   the  phosphate    PO5,  2CaO,   HO   is  obtained.
    Arsenic acid and carbonate of lime at the ordinary tempera
ture give the body AsO5, 2CaO, 4 HO, which is the mineral
Haidingerite.
   In a similar manner the following bodies have been obtained : —

    „ 70° arseniate of copper . . AsO5, 2CuO, HO, 3HO
    „ 70° phosphate of manganese PO5, 3MnO, 4HO.
    By acting on the insoluble phosphates of lime, magnesia, &c.
with a metallic nitrate or sulphate, crystallized compounds are
obtained, the composition of which varies with the temperature.
At 70° phosphate of lime, PO5, 2CaO, HO, and arseniate of lime,
AsO5, 2CaO, HO, give with nitrate of copper the phosphate
P05,3CuO, 3 HO, and the arseniate AsO5, 3CuO, 4HO ; and

    The phosphate of copper, PO5, 4CuO, HO (libethenite)j
    The arseniate of copper, AsO5, 4CuO, HO (olivenite).
    These latter bodies, which have the form as well as the com
position of the native minerals, are better obtained when the                 •
reaction is effected in a sealed tube at 140°— 150°.
    At high temperatures (250°—270°) water transforms certain
phosphates      and arseniates into other well-crystallized species.
 Blue phosphate of copper, PO5, 3CuO, 3 HO, is transformed
 into magnificent crystals of libethenite ; and arseniate of copper,
 AsO5, 3CuO, 4 HO, is changed into olivenite.

 solutions of acid phosphates with metallic solutions. A solution

       M. Chancel  on the determination  of Phosphoric Acid.       881
                                                                       "
 uranium, yields chalcolite, PO5, 2CuO + P05 (Ura 03)4 + 16HO,
or double phosphate of copper and uranium.
    Chancel proposes* the following method of separating and
estimating phosphoric acid in the presence of bases : it depends
on the insolubility of phosphate of silver, 3 AgO, PO5, in a neutral
liquid.
    The substance taken is dissolved in the least quantity of dilute
nitric acid, and the solution diluted with water.           The clear
liquid is mixed with a sufficient quantity of nitrate of silver,
and then with a slight excess of carbonate of silver. This opera
tion must be performed in the cold when the liquid contains
any substance, such as manganese, which is precipitated by the
application of heat.
    The phosphoric acid soon separates as yellow phosphate of
silver ; the precipitation is complete when the liquid no longer
reddens blue litmus paper ; the precipitate is then filtered, care
fully washed, introduced into a flask, and dissolved in nitric
acid. The silver is now precipitated by means of hydrochloric
acid and the filtered liquid supersaturated with ammonia, and
the ammoniacal phosphate precipitated with sulphate of mag
nesia in the ordinary manner.
    The advantages which silver salts have in this separation of
phosphoric acid, consist greatly in the readiness with which the
silver is removed from the solution ; but they have the great
disadvantage that, when the phosphoric acid is in combination
with alumina, oxide of iron or chrome, it is not separated from
these bodies, but merely precipitated with them.           The use of
bismuth compounds which Chancel proposes        f  is not amenable to
these objections; it furnishes an exact and easy method, one
susceptible of the widest application.
    The method depends on the insolubility of phosphate of
bismuth in liquids which contain even a considerable propor
tion of free nitric acid.     The acid nitrate of bismuth is pre
pared by dissolving one part of pure subnitrate of bismuth
 (BiO3, N05+ Aq) in four parts of nitric acid of sp. gr. 1*86.,
and adding to the solution thirty parts of water. Thus prepared,
the solution is not made turbid either by boiling or by the
 addition of any quantity of water.       The substance to be de
termined is dissolved in distilled water; if necessary a small
quantity of nitric acid is added, care being taken to avoid excess,
and the solution diluted with water.       If the solution contains
sulphates or chlorides they must be removed, the former by
adding nitrate of baryta, and the latter by nitrate of silver. The
solution of acid nitrate of bismuth is then added, as long as a

 precipitate is formed.        The precipitate which separates is of a
 beautiful white, is very dense, and settles readily, more especially
  when warmed ; the whole liquid is heated to boiling, filtered and
 washed with boiling water.           It is then dried and heated. It
 has the composition BiO3, PO5, which is that of a neutral phos
 phate, for bismuth is triatomic, and replaces three atoms of water
 in tribasic phosphoric acid.
     Pyrophosphoric acid is also precipitated by acid nitrate of
 bismuth as neutral pyrophosphate of bismuth, 2 BiO3, 3pPOs*.
 The precipitate is white, but much more voluminous than with
 tribasic phosphoric acid.         Metaphosphoric acid is likewise pre
 cipitated by    nitrate of bismuth.     Both these precipitates, however,
 are converted into the tribasic phosphate of bismuth when boiled
 with excess of the bismuth solution ; the metaphosphate requires
 a somewhat more prolonged ebullition.              It is therefore of little
 importance in what modification the phosphoric acid exists in
 the solution to be determined.
    This method affords a very delicate means of determining
 phosphoric acid.       Chancel was able to determine and separate a
 milligramme of phosphoric acid in the presence of 120 milli
 grammes of alumina ; and the precipitation is so rapid that it
 will be possible to estimate phosphoric acid by means of a
 standard solution of acid nitrate of bismuth.
    To estimate magnesia in the presence of the alkalies, Scheerer           f
proceeds as follows : —
    The mixture of magnesia and the alkalies being given, is con
verted into neutral sulphates and weighed.                This mass is dis
solved in a small quantity of water, and              the   solution divided
into two parts of known weight. In the one the magnesia is
determined by the addition of phosphate of soda, and in the
other the potass is precipitated by bichloride of platinum. The
soda is estimated from the difference.
    According to Rose J, when silica of the density 2*2 is mixed
with fluoride of ammonium and the mixture heated, the silica is
completely volatilized as fluoride of silicon.            With quartz and
sand the action is less energetic.           Rose recommends the use of
fluoride of ammonium as convenient for decomposing silicates.
It may readily be prepared by adding ammonia in excess to the
commercial acid, and then a little carbonate and sulphide of
ammonium.         The liquid is allowed to stand, the clear liquid

               represents ordinary or tribasic phosphoric acid as PO', bibasic
phosphoric or pyrophosphoric       acid as pPO5, and monobasic or meta
phosphoric   acid as mPO5.

decanted    and evaporated to dryness in a platinum crucible ; a
small quantity of carbonate of ammonia is added occasionally
during the evaporation, and when the mass becomes pasty, it is
stirred with a platinum spatula.         The dried salt may be kept in
vessels of platinum, silver, or gutta percha.
     In order to decompose a silicate, it is mixed in a state of fine
powder with six times its weight of fluoride of ammonium, a
small quantity of water added, and the mixture heated at first
          and gradually )to redness as long as vapours are given off.
fently,
   Isually one operation is sufficient ; the residue is treated with
sulphuric acid, and the excess of this acid driven off. Where
the sulphates formed do not completely dissolve in water con
taining a little hydrochloric acid but leave a residue, the inso
luble part is again treated with fluoride of ammonium.
     The temperature must not be raised too high in the operation
for if the silicate contained alumina a fluoride of aluminum
might be formed, difficult to be decomposed by sulphuric acid.
      Hyposulphite of soda, according to Lowe*, dissolves sulphate
of lead, which may in this way be separated from sulphate of
baryta. A concentrated solution of hyposulphite is poured on
 the mixture of the two salts, and the whole digested between
 15° and 20°.       At a higher temperature a sulphide of lead inso
 luble in hyposulphite of soda might be formed.                The residual
 sulphate of baryta carefully washed is weighed, and as a control
 the lead in the hyposulphite may also be determined.
      For the preparation of permanganate          of potash, Bechamp     f
 recommends      the following method.        In an iron basin ten parts
 of powdered binoxide of manganese are mixed with twelve parts
 of fused caustic potash ; a little water is added to the mixture,
 which is rapidly dried, and introduced while still hot into a tubu
 lated stoneware retort, and a current of pure dry oxygen passed
 into it. To the neck of the retort a tube is fitted just dipping
  under mercury. The absorption of oxygen is very rapid ; it is
  complete when it bubbles through the mercury.                 The cooled
  mass is then exhausted with hot water, and a current of carbonic
  acid passed through the solution, by which the manganate is
  transformed into permanganate.            When the solution has the
  characteristic colour of the permanganate the current of gas is
  stopped, the oxides of manganese are allowed to settle, the clear
  solution rapidly evaporated and allowed to crystallize ; the mother-
  liquors yield a further crop of crystals.        In general a pound of
  binoxide gives     five to six  ounces  of   permanganate at the first
  crystallization.

   Lactic acid is regarded by Kolbe as oxypropionic acid, that
as propionic acid in which an atom of hydrogen in the radical
replaced     by
             peroxide of hydrogen, just as chloropropionic acid
propionic acid containing an atom of chlorine in the place of an
atom of hydrogen.
In  accordance with this view     might be expected that
                                           it                hydro              if
gen could be directly substituted for the group HO4, propionic
acid would be regenerated, and this mode of regarding lactic acid
would receive additional support. Lautemann* has made                                      a
series of experiments in this direction.

886                  M. Heinz   on two New Series     of Acids,           \*
    The monochloracetic acid was prepared by Hoffmann's method,
which was found very convenient.            A quantity of sodium was
then dissolved in anhydrous methylic alcohol, and a correspond
ing quantity of chloracetic acid added.          The action was very
energetic, each addition of the acid being attended with a hissing
sound.     When the action was complete, the mixture was heated
for some hours to a temperature of 100° ; the alcohol was then di
stilled off, hydrochloric acid added in slight excess, the mixture
rendered feebly alkaline with soda, and evaporated to dryness.
This mass was exhausted with alcohol, the alcohol distilled off,
and the aqueous solution of the residue mixed with sulphate
of zinc and evaporated to dryness.          On treating this mass with
alcohol a zinc-salt was dissolved out, which was deposited from
the alcoholic solution in large, colourless, acute rhombic octa-
hedra.     The analyses gave for the formula of this salt, dried in
the air, CH^nC^-l-SHO : the water is given off at 100° C.
    To obtain the free acid from this salt, it was dissolved in water,
the solution saturated with sulphuretted hydrogen, and filtered
from the sulphide of zinc ; on evaporating the filtrate, acid
vapours were given off; it was accordingly distilled.       The tempe
rature gradually rose to 198°, at which point it remained con
stant. What now passed over consisted of the free acid, which
is a colourless viscid liquid of the sp. gr. 1*18.           It has an
acid, but not unpleasant taste; its boiling-point is 198°; it is
very soluble in water, and readily attracts moisture from this
atmosphere.      It burns, when it is inflamed, with a blue non-fuli
ginous   flame.    By saturating the acid with carbonate of zinc,
filtering and evaporating, a zinc-salt was obtained identical with
that obtained at first.
    The acid, though isomeric with lactic acid, differs widely from
it,  and also from sarcolactic acid.      The new acid     volatile    its
                                                              is is

zinc-salt crystallizes readily in large crystals, and     very soluble.
Its potash and baryta salts readily crystallize its lime-salt does

silver salt melts at 100°, and does not fuse. In all these points
there is    wide difference from the corresponding compounds of

    The acid      derived from glycolic acid
                 is                                   by
                                                    the substitution of
methyle.     Glycolic acid     bibasic, and, according to Socoloff and
                                is
Strecker, contains two atoms of replaceable hydrogen, one of
which   is  more readily replaced       by metal, and the other
                                             a                         an      by
acid radical. If this acid were glycolic acid in which the basic
hydrogen        is
                replaced        by

glycolate of methyle, and would yield, when treated with an
alkali, an alkaline glycolate and free methylic alcohol.            But

Heinz found that, when treated with caustic soda, it yielded                 a
soda salt which was not glycolate of soda. Another supposition
is that it is glycolic acid in which the atom of hydrogen more
readily replaced by an acid radical is replaced bymethyle; on which
view its constitution would be represented thus, C4H209\ n4
                                                                          U   '

Heinz found that the acid, when treated with benzoic acid, did
not form benzoglycolic acid, as might have been expected on
this view.
    Heinz considers that the acid is oxacetic acid (glycolic acid)
in which an atom of methyle is contained in the radical. He
writes the formula thus,' C6H5041 ™                 j          ..      .,

acetic acid to express this mode of deriving it. The homologous
acids, formed by the same reaction, receive the names ethoxacetic
(icid, amoxacetic acid, &c.
    Heinz has described several of the salts.          Methoxacetate of
ammonia forms a mass of radiating crystals which are very
deliquescent.        Methoxacetate of baryta, BaO C6 H5 O5, forms
colourless, transparent, prismatic crystals, readily soluble in
water, but difficultly so in alcohol.         Methoxacetate of copper,
CuO C6H505 + 2HO, forms bluish-green, transparent, acute
rhombic prisms with good reflecting surfaces.             They are per
fectly  soluble   in  water, but little so in alcohol.    Methoxacetate
of  lime forms   a  syrupy  solution which  does  not crystallize   ; but if
evaporated over sulphuric acid, it dries up to a solid mass,
which gradually becomes crystalline. Methoxacetate of potash,
KOC6H505+8HO, forms large colourless transparent prisms
permanent in the air. They are readily soluble in alcohol.                On
the addition of ether to this solution, a salt of the formula
KOC6H505 + 6HO is precipitated.                 Methoxacetate     of lead,
PbO C6 H5 O5, forms a solid, white, crystalline mass like Wavel-
lite. Methoxacetate of silver, AgO C6 H5 O5, forms fine needles,
which are somewhat soluble in cold and readily so in hot water.

in water, but miscible in every proportion with alcohol and ether.
Heated in a platinum spoon it takes fire, and burns with a clear
flame.
    Neither the zinc nor the baryta salts crystallize. The potash
Salt crystallizes in a wavellite-like mass. The copper salt forms
microscopic blue needles.
    By the action of chloracetic acid on the soda compound of phe-
nylic acid, Heinz obtained a new acid, phenoxacetic acid,
    The new acid is isomeric with the next higher homologue of
salicylic acid, C14H606, or, as is more probable, with Gerland's
 oxybenzoic acid.
    Phenoxacetate of baryta, Cl6H7Ba06 + 3HO, is obtained by sa
turating the free acid with baryta water.       It crystallizes in very
large, thin laminae. Phenoxacetate of copper, C16H7Cu06 + 2HO,
forms small tabular or prismatic cserulean crystals, which are
very little soluble in water.     Phenoxacetate of lead forms small
microscopic granules. Phenoxacetate of silver, C16 H7 AgO6, forms
 small, flat prismatic crystals, which are frequently arranged in
groups.

may be obtained from any of its soluble salts by the addition of
 a strong mineral acid.        According as the decomposition is
 effected in the warm or in the cold, the acid is precipitated as
 an oil, or as an amorphous powder, which by agitation becomes
 crystalline.   In the temperature of the water-bath it gradually
 disappears.
    The brown liquid produced by the direct action of chlorine on
 sulphur has been found by Carius to be a mixture of subchloride
of sulphur, S2 CI, with bichloride of sulphur, S CI2. Niemann *
 has tried the action of ethylene gas on this body.          When the
 dried gas was passed into the chloride, it was rapidly absorbed
 with disengagement of heat, and the colour changed from a
 brown to that of the pure bichloride. When this change of
 colour was complete, the absorption ceased; for ethylene gas has
 no action on bichloride of sulphur. The product was then treated
 with dilute soda ley, by which sulphur was deposited.          A large
 quantity of water was added, and the whole submitted to distil
 lation. A yellowish oil passed over, which was washed with water,
 and dried over chloride of calcium.      It seemed to boil at about

190 —200°, but could not be distilled without decomposition,
and its purification was therefore very difficult. It is insoluble in
water, but is partially soluble in alcohol and in ether. Its alco
holic solution yields a precipitate with chloride of gold, and with
protonitrate and pernitrate of mercury.
   The most peculiar property of this oil, is that of causing a
painful burn when it comes in contact with the hand, which
heals with difficulty.   The substance analysed was evidently not
quite pure; but the results obtained agree best with the formula
C4 H4 CIS9, which would represent a bisulphide of chlorinated
ethyle.
    Bussenius and Eisenstiick* have investigated a rock oil which
is obtained from some lias shales near Hanover. The crude oil is
distilled with high-pressure steam, and the oil which distils over
is treated with sulphuric acid, which removes from it a peculiar
bituminous smell.        Thus purified it comes into commerce;
hut the oil for this investigation Bussenius and Eisenstiick
took as it distils over with the steam, dried           and submitted

                                      It
temperature gradually rose to 270°.         The distillate below 180°
was further examined.         It was found to be composed mostly of
hydrocarbons     of  the   general   formula C„H„, and apparently
ranging    from  C12 H12   to  C18 H18.  Notwithstanding very great
labour,   it was not found possible to isolate these      nor were the

   Besides these hydrocarbons, the oil contained     new hydro     a

acid by the oxidation of milk-sugar by nitric acid.       He discusses
the mode of occurrence and constitution of tartaric acid, and
several allied vegetable acids, and mentions an experiment in
which he tried the action of aldehyde on cyanogen dissolved in
water in the expectation of effecting the synthesis of malic
acid.    It gave, however, an unexpected result. A flask contain
ing about two quarts of water was saturated with cyanogen,
about an ounce of aldehyde added, and the whole left in a
cool place. The fluid remained clear and colourless ; but gradually
a mass of white crusts separated at the bottom of the flask, which
were found to be oxamide.          The liquid, saturated for a second
and third time with cyanogen, yielded fresh quantities of oxa
mide.     On distilling the liquid some more oxamide separated,
and it appeared as if the aldehyde had formed a combination
with oxamide which was decomposed by boiling. The aldehyde
which distilled over contained some acroleine. The mother-liquor
from which the oxamide had deposited contained oxalate of
ammonia.
    The aldehyde in this experiment, either by its mere presence
or by its cooperation, promotes the combination of cyanogen with
water, to form, according as it combines with two or four equiva
lents of water, oxamide or oxalate of ammonia. The aldehyde
acts as a sort of ferment; while any other affinity of the cyanogen,
for the hydrogen or for the oxygen of the water, appears to be
quite suppressed.

THE "following
            On Recent      Theories and Experiments regarding Ice at or
near its Melting-point."          By Professor James Thomson, Queen's
 College, Belfast.
    My object in the following paper is to discuss briefly the bearings
of some of the leading theories of the plasticity and other properties
of ice at or near its melting-point, on speculations on the same sub
ject advanced by myself*, and, especially, to offer an explanation of an
experiment made by Professor James D. Forbes, which to him and
others has seemed to militate against the theory proposed by me, but
which, in reality,   I  believe to be in perfect accordance with that theory.
                                         f
    In the year 1850, Mr. Faraday invited attention, in a scientific
point of view, to the fact that two pieces of moist ice, when placed in
contact, will unite together, even when the surrounding temperature
is such as to keep them in a thawing state. He attributed this pheno
menon to a property which he supposed ice to possess, of tending to
 solidify water in contact with it, and of tending more strongly to so
lidify a film or a particle of water when the water has ice in contact
 with it on both sides than when it has ice on only one side.
    In January 1857, Dr. Tyndall, in a paper (by himself and Mr.
 Huxley) read before the Royal Society and in a lecture delivered
 at the Royal Institution, adopted this fact as the basis of a theory
 by which he proposed to explain the viscosity or plasticity of ice,
 or its capability of undergoing change of form, which was pre
 viously known to be the quality in glaciers in virtue of which their
 motion down their valleys is produced by gravitation.             Designating
 Mr. Faraday's fact under the term " regelation," Dr. Tyndall de
 scribed the capability of glacier ice to undergo changes of form, as
 being not true viscosity, but as being the result of vast numbers of
 successively occurring minute fractures, changes of position of the
 fractured parts, and regelations of those parts in their new positions.
 The terms fracture and regelation then came to be the brief expres
 sion of his idea of the plasticity of ice. He appears to have been led
 to deny the applicability of the term viscosity through the idea that
 the motion occurs by starts due to the sudden fractures of parts in
 themselves not viscous or plastic.         The crackling, he pointed out
 might, according to circumstances, be made up of separate starts
 distinctly sensible to the ear and to the touch, or might be so slight

referred   to slight irregular   variations  in the  bending  motion  of  the
line marked by a row of pins on a glacier by Prof. Forbes, as being
an indication of the absence of any quality that could properly be
called viscosity, and of the occurrence of successive fractures and
sudden motions in a material not truly viscous or plastic. I can only
understand his statements on this subject by supposing that he con
ceived the material between the cracks to be rigid, or permanent in
form, when existing under strains within the limit of its strength, or
when strained less than to the point of fracture,,

 but which, up till the date of the paper referred to, had only been
 described to    a few friends verbally.      That theory of mine may be

 point, pressures   tending  to change   its form   be applied, there will be
a   continual succession of pressures applied to particular parts —
 liquefaction occurring in those parts through the lowering of the
 melting-point by pressure —evolution of the cold by which the so
 melted portions had been held in the frozen state — dispersion of the
 water so produced in such directions as will afford relief to the
 pressure — and recongelation, by the cold previously evolved, of the
 water on its being relieved from this pressure and the cycle of    :
 operations will then begin again for the parts re-congealed, after
                                            ;
 having been melted, must in their turn, through the yielding of other
 parts, receive pressures from the applied forces, thereby to be again
 liquefied and to proceed through successive operations as before.

views seems the best argument     I   can adduce against them, still    I  would point to
one special objection to his theory. No matter how fragile, and no matter how much
fractured material may be, yet
          a                        if  its separate fractured parts be not possessed of
some property of internal mobility,     1  cannot see how      succession of fractures
                                                                a                       is
to be perpetuated.    A   heap of sand or broken glass will either continue standing,
or will go down with sudden falls or slips, after which         position of repose will be
                                                                a

to reiterate the fractures after such position of repose has been attained.          When
these ideas are considered in connexion with the fact that while ice        is  capable of
standing, without immediate fall, as the side of        precipitous crevasse, or of lying
                                                        a

                                                                        a        itcan also
glide along, with its surface nearly level, or very slightly inclined,      I    think the
improbability of the motion arising from        asuccession of fractures of  a   substance
having its separate parts devoid of internal mobility will become very apparent.
 If, on the other hand, any quality of internal mobility be allowed in the fragments
 between the cracks,  a   certain degree at least of plasticity or viscosity  is  assumed,
 in order to explain the observed plasticity or viscosity.         That fractures — both
 large and exceedingly small — both large at rare intervals, and small, momentarily
 repeated — do, under various circumstances, arise in the plastic yielding of masses
 of ice, is, of course, an undoubted fact   :   but
                                                    it
                                                    is    one which     regard not as the

 cause, but as  a   consequence, of the plastic yielding of the mass in the manner
 supposed in my own theory.        It yields by its plasticity in some parts until other
 parts are overstrained and snap asunder, or perhaps also sometimes slide suddenly
 past one another.

Prof.    J. Thomson      on Theories and Experiments regarding Ice. 393
cation of this theory, appears to adopt it to some extent, and to endea
vour to make its principles cooperate with the views he had previously
founded on Mr. Faraday's fact of so called " regelation "*.
    Professor James D. Forbes adopts Person's view, that the dissolu
tion of ice is a gradual, not a sudden process, and so far resembles
the tardy liquefaction of fatty bodies or of the metals, which in
melting pass through intermediate stages of softness or viscosity. He
thinks that ice must essentially be colder than water in contact with
it ; that between the ice and the water there is a film varying in
local temperature from side to side, which may be called plastic ice,
 or viscid water ; and that through this film heat must be constantly
passing from the water to the ice, and the ice must be wasting away,
though the water be what is called ice-cold.
    There is a manifest difficulty in conceiving the possibility of the
state of things here described : and           I   cannot help thinking that
Professor Forbes has been himself in some degree sensible of the
difficulty ; for in a note of later date by a few months than the paper
itself, he amends the expression of his idea by a statement to the
effect that if a small quantity of water be enclosed in a cavity in ice,
it will undergo a gradual " regelation ; " that          is, that the ice will in
this case be gradually increased instead of wasted. In reference to
the first case,     Iwould ask, —What becomes of the cold of the ice,
supposing     there    to be no communication with external objects by
which heat might be added to or taken from the water and ice
jointly considered       ?  Doesit   go into the water and produce viscidity
beyond    the  limit  of   the  assumed   thin film of viscid water at the sur
face of the ice     ?   Preciselya    corresponding question may be put re
latively to the second case      —  that of the large quantity of ice enclosing
a  small quantity of water in which the reverse process            isassumed to
occur.     Next,   let   an intermediate case be considered     —  that of mea
 dium quantity of water in contact with medium quantity of ice, and
                                               a
in which no heat, nor cold, practically speaking,           is communicated to
the water or the ice from surrounding objects.              This, it   to be ob
                                                                        is
 served,  isno mere theoretical case, but       a  perfectly feasible one. The
result, evidently,       the previously described theories be correct, ought
                        if
to be that the mixture of ice and water ought to pass into the state
of uniform viscidity.          Prof. Forbes's own words distinctly deny the
permanence of the water and ice in contact in their two separate
states, for he says, " bodies of different temperatures cannot continue
so without interaction.          The water must give off heat to the ice, but
it  spends     itin an insignificant thaw at the surface, which therefore
wastes even though the water be what           is  called ice-cold."    Now the
conclusion arrived at, namely, that      a    quantity of viscid water could be
        suppose the term regelation has been given by Prof. Tyndall as denoting the
 *   I
 second, or mending stage in his theory of "fracture and regelation."       Congela
tion would seem to me the more proper word to use after fracture, as regelation
implies previous melting. If my theory of melting by pressure and freezing again
on relief of pressure be admitted, then the term regelation will come to be quite
suitable for   part of the process of the union of the two pieces of ice, though not
               a
for the whole, which then ought to be designated as the process of melting and
regelation.

all experience. No person has ever, by any peculiar application of
heat to, or withdrawal of heat from,       a   quantity of water, rendered          it

theory given by      me,  that  the  regelation  is   consequence of the low

                                                                      a
ance of proving the influence of the ice in solidifying the water, to be
not essentially dependent on pressure. This experiment, however,                    I
propose to discuss and explain in the concluding part of the present
paper.
    Professor Forbes accepts my theory of the plasticity of ice as being
so far correct that   it  points to some of the causes which may reason
ably be considered, under peculiar circumstances, to impart to a
glacier    aportion of its plasticity.     In the rapid alternations of pres
sure which take place in the moulding of ice under the Bramah's press,
it  cannot, he thinks, be doubted that the opinions of myself and my
brother Professor Wm. Thomson are verified                   *.
    Mr. Faraday, in his recently published Researches in Chemistry
                                                     '
and Physics,' still adheres to his original mode of accounting for the
phenomenon he had observed, and for which he now adopts the name
"regelation;" or, at least, while alluding to the views of Prof.
Forbes as possibly being admissible as correct, and to the explanation
offered by myself as being probably true in principle, and possibly
having     acorrect bearing on the phenomena of regelation, he consi
ders that the principle originally assumed            by
                                                       himself may after all be
the sole cause of the effect.         The principle he has in view, he then
states as being, when more distinctly expressed, the following — " In     :
all uniform bodies possessing cohesion,         i.e. being either in the liquid
or the solid state, particles which are surrounded by other particles
having the like state with themselves tend to preserve that state, even
though subject to variations of temperature, either of elevation or de
pression, which,    if the particles were not so surrounded, would cause
them instantly to change their condition."               Referring to water in
illustration, he says that     it   may  be  cooled  many degrees below 32°
Fahr., and still retain its liquid state yet that
                                           ;                  piece of the same

chemical substance —ice — at        a higher temperature     be introduced, the
cold water freezes and becomes warm.             He points out that       itceris
tainly  not  the   change  of  temperature    which   causes  the  freezing  for
                                                                               ;
the ice introduced    is warmer than the water and he says he assumes

Glaciers), February 1859.

 Prof.  J. Thomson on Theories        and Experiments regarding Ice.       395
 causes the change. Exemplifying, in another direction, the principle
 he is propounding, he refers to the fact that water may be exalted to
 the temperature of 270° Fahr., at the ordinary pressure of the atmo
 sphere, and yet remain water ; but that the introduction of the
 smallest particle of air or steam will cause it to explode, and at the
 same time to fall in temperature.         He further alludes to numerous
other substances — such as acetic acid, sulphur, phosphorus, alcohol,
 sulphuric acid, ether, and camphine — which manifest like phenomena
 at their freezing- or boiling-points, to those referred to as occurring with
 the substance of water, ice, and steam ; and he adverts to the ob
served fact that the contact of extraneous substances with the parti
cles of a fluid usually sets these particles free to change their state, in
consequence,      he says, of the cohesion between them and the fluid
being imperfect ; and he instances that glass will permit water to
boil in contact with it at 212° Fahr., or by preparation can be made
so that water will remain in contact with it at 270° Fahr. without
going off into steam ; also that glass can be prepared so that water
will remain in contact with it at 22° Fahr. without solidification, but
that an ordinary piece of glass will set the water off at once to freeze.
    He afterwards comes to a point in his reasoning which he admits
may be considered as an assumption.           It is " that many particles in
a given state exert a greater sum of their peculiar cohesive force
upon a given particle of the like substance in another state than few
can do ; and that as a consequence a water particle with ice on one
side, and water on the other, is not so apt to become solid as with
ice on both sides ; also that a particle of ice at the surface of a mass
 [of ice] in water is not so apt to remain ice as when, being within the
mass there is ice on all sides, temperature remaining the same."
This supposition evidently contains two very distinct hypotheses.
The former, which has to do with ice and water present together, I
certainly do regard as an assumption, unsupported by any of the
phenomena which Mr. Faraday has adduced.               The other, which has
to do with a particle of ice in the middle of continuous ice, and
which assumes that it will not so readily change to water, as another
                                           I
particle of ice in contact with water, think is to be accepted as pro
bably true.     I think the general bearing of all the phenomena he has
adduced is to show that the particles of a substance when existing all
in one state only, and in continuous contact with one another, or in
contact only under special circumstances with other substances, ex
perience a difficulty of making a beginning of their change of state,
whether from liquid to solid, or from liquid to gaseous, or probably
also from solid to liquid : but      I do not think anything has been ad
duced showing a like difficulty as to their undergoing a change of
state, when the substance is present in the two states already, or
when a beginning of the change has already been made.                 I think
that when water        and   ice are   present together, their   freedom    to
change their state on the slightest addition or abstraction       of  heat, or
the slightest change of pressure, is perfect.            I therefore cannot
admit the validity      of  Mr. Faraday's mode of accounting for the
phenomena of regelation.

 396                          Royal Society : — ¦
     Thus the fact of regelation which Prof. Tyndall has taken as the
 basis of his theory for explaining the plasticity of ice, does in my
 opinion as much require explanation as does the plasticity of ice which
 it is applied to explain. The two observed phenomena, namely the
 tendency of the separate pieces of ice to unite when in contact, and
  the plasticity of ice, are indeed, as 1 believe, cognate results of a com
 mon cause.      They do not explain one another. They both require
 explanation ; and that explanation,       I consider, is the same for both,
  and is given by the theory I have myself offered.
     I now proceed to discuss the experiment by Prof. Forbes, already
 referred to as having been adduced in opposition to my theory.                He
 states that mere contact without pressure is sufficient to produce the
 union of two pieces of moist ice * ; and then states, as follows, his
 experiment by which he supposes that this is proved : — Two slabs
                                                                     "
 of ice, having their corresponding surfaces ground tolerably flat, were
 suspended in an inhabited room upon a horizontal glass rod passing
 through two holes in the plates of ice, so that the plane of the plates
 was vertical. Contact of the even surfaces was obtained by means of
 two very weak pieces of watch spring.            In an hour and a half the
 cohesion was so complete, that, when violently broken in pieces, many
 portions of the plates (which had each a surface of twenty or more
 square inches) continued united.        In fact it appeared as complete as
 in another experiment where similar surfaces were pressed together
 by weights."      He concludes that the effect of pressure in assisting
 ' regelation' is principally or solely due to the larger surfaces of con
 tact obtained by the moulding of the surfaces to one another.
     I have myself repeated this experiment, and have found the re
 sults just described to be fully verified. It was not even necessary to
 apply the weak pieces of watch-spring, as I found that the pieces of
ice, on being merely suspended on the glass rod in contact, would
 unite themselves strongly in a few hours. Now this fact I explain by
 the capillary forces of the film of interposed water as follows : — First,
 the film of water between the two slabs — being held up against gravity
 by the capillary tension, or contractile force, of its free upper surface,
 and being distended besides, against the atmospheric pressure, by the
 same contractile force of its free surface round its whole perimeter,
 except for a very small space at bottom, from which water trickles
 away, or is on the point of trickling away — exists under a pressure
which, though increasing from above downwards, is everywhere, ex
cept at that little space at bottom, less than the atmospheric pres
 sure. Hence the two slabs are urged towards one another by the ex
cess of the external atmospheric pressure above the internal water
pressure, and are thus pressed against one another at their places of
contact by a force quite notable in its amount.            If, for instance, be
tween the two slabs there be a film of water of such size and form as
might be represented by a film one inch square, with its upper and
lower edges horizontal, and with water trickling from its lower edge,
it is easy to show that the slabs will be pressed together by a force

square film with its sides 4 inches each, the slabs will be urged toge
ther by a force equal to the weight of half a cube of water, of which
the side is 4 inches; that      the weight of 32 cubic inches of water or

water existing, as     does, under less than atmospheric pressure, has
its freezing-point raised in virtue of the reduced pressure and would                          ;          it
therefore freeze even at the temperature of the surrounding ice,

                                      " vand " lies are parts of one great
 chasm, with perpendicular sides, often thousands of feet high.          The
 valley generally shows traces of the former existence of a glacier,
 and is now traversed by a rapid river, which falls into a vand or lake
 six or seven miles long, rarely a mile wide, and very deep.             The
 lake is separated from the fjord by a mass of rolled stones, shingle,
 and coarse sand roughly stratified, and sometimes rising 120 feet
 above the lake.     Through this an outlet has been cut to the fjord,
 a distance varying from about one to four miles.                On the side
 towards the lake this mound is terraced ; and at the upper end of
 the lake similar terraces are sometimes seen.             The author, with
 some doubt, attributes the accumulation of this terraced barrier to
 glacial action.

     2. *'
           On the Drift and Gravels of the North of Scotland." By
 T. F.  Jamieson, Esq.     Communicated by Sir R. I. Murchison, F.G.S.
     In a former communication the author gave an account of some
  features of the Pleistocene deposits along the coast of Aberdeenshire,
  showing that in certain localities remains of marine animals occur, of
 a character similar to those met with in the later Tertiary beds of the
  Clyde district, and, like them, indicating the presence of a colder
  sea. In the present paper the author treated of the Drift of the higher
  grounds in the interior of the country, more especially as regards
  that part of Scotland lying between the Moray Firth and the Firth
  of Tay. The following phenomena were more particularly de
  scribed : — 1. The upper gravels, their distribution and origin ; 2.
  the marine drift of the higher grounds and of the highland glens ;
  3. the striated and polished rock-surfaces beneath the Drift ; 4.
  the high-lying boulders, and the dispersion of blocks from the Ben
  Muic-Dhui Mountains.         The probability of extensive glacier-action
  before the formation of the Drift, the extinction of the land-fauna
  preceding the Drift, and the sequence of events during the Pleistocene
  period were then dwelt upon ; and the author expressed his opinion
  that the following course of events may be supposed to have occurred
  in the Pleistocene history of Scotland.          1st. A period when the
  country stood as high as, or probably higher than at present, with
  an extensive development of glaciers and land-ice, which polished
  and striated the subjacent rocks, transported many of the erratic
  blocks, destroyed the pre-existing alluvium, and left much boulder-
  earth in various places.     2ndly. To this succeeded a period of sub
  mergence,   when   the  sea  gradually advanced until almost the whole

400                       Geological Society   : —
country was covered. This was the time of the marine drift with
floating ice. The beds with arctic shells belonged to it, and some
of the brick-clays are probably but the fine mud of the deeper
parts of the same sea-bottom.       3rdly. The land emerged from the
water, during which emergence the preceding drift-beds suffered
much denudation, giving rise to the extensive superficial accumula
tions of water-rolled gravel that now overspread much of the sur
face.   This movement continued until the land obtained a higher
position than it now has, and became connected with the continent
of Europe.     Its various islands were probably also more or less in
conjunction.     The present assemblage of animals and plants gra
dually migrated hither from adjoining lands.         Glaciers may have
still been formed in favourable places, but probably never regained
their former extension.     4thly. The land sank again until the sea
in most places reached a height of from 30 to 40 feet above the
present tide-mark.      Patches of forest- ground were submerged along
             The clays and beds of silt, forming the " carses
                                                                 " of the
the coast.
Forth, Tay, and other rivers, were accumulated, as well as the post-
tertiary beds of the Clyde, &c, described by Mr. James Smith, the
shells of which agree with those of our present seas.          5thly. An
elevation at length took place, by which the land attained its present
level.   As Mr. Smith has shown, this probably occurred before the
Roman invasion : but that man had previously got into the country
appears from the fact that the elevated beds of silt near Glasgow,
contain overturned and swamped canoes with stone implements.

   The following communication was read : —
   " On the Lower Lias of the South of England." By Dr. T.
"Wright, F.G.S.
   The author first stated that the uppermost beds of the Lower Lias
are those containing Hippopodium ponderosum, and that the lowest
beds are those with Ammonites Planorbis, overlying a series of strata
containing Estheria, &c, which he separates from the Lias, under
the name of the Avicula contorta beds. The last rest on the grey
and red marls of the Keuper.
   Dr. Wright then proceeded with the description of the A. con
torta beds, including the " Bone-bed," having first enumerated the
authors who have written on these and the equivalent strata (Kos-
sener Schichten, &c.) on the Continent.          The sections at Garden
ClifF, near Westbury on the Severn, at Wainlode Cliff, at Aust Cliff,
at Penarth near Cardiff, at Uphill near Weston-super-Mare, at Cul-
verhole near Axmouth, at Wilmcote and Binton near Stratford-on-
Avon, were described in detail as illustrating this series ; and General
Portlock's section of these beds in the North of Ireland was also
alluded to. Pecten Valoniensis, Cardium Rhteticum, and Avicula con
torta are the chief molluscan fossils of this zone.
   The next group of strata are those with Ammonites Planorbis and
Am, Johnstoni.      Some of the foregoing sections expose these beds,
such as those at Uphill and Wilmcote ; but they can be still better
studied at Street in Somersetshire, where they have yielded so

     Dr. Wright on     the Lower Lias of  the  South of England.    401
many fine Enaliosaurian fossils.      These beds are also well exposed
at Brockeridge and Defford in the Vale of Gloucester, and at Bin-
ton in Warwickshire.
     Isastreea Murchisonee occurs in this zone, and Ostrea liassica is
very characteristic of some of its lower beds.     Ichthyosauri and Ple-
siosauri of several species are found in this series ; the latter chiefly
in the lower part.         Of the two known specimens of PL mega-
cephalus, one was found in these beds near Street, Somerset, and
the other at Wilmcote, Warwickshire.
     The Ammonites Bucklandi characterizes the next higher group of
strata, which are also known as the Lima-beds.            These are well
seen at Lyme Regis, at the Church Cliff and from the Broad Ledge
to the shore, and yield several species of Ichthyosaurus, also Am.
 Conybeari, A. rotiformis, A. angulatus, A. Greenoughii, and A. tor-
tilis.
     The Am. Turneri beds are next, and can also be studied at Lyme
Regis ; they have yielded three species of Ichthyosaurus. Am. semi-
 costatus and   A. Bonnardi   belong to this zone.
     The Am. obtusus beds succeed, between the Broad Ledge at Lyme
 and Cornstone Ledge near Charmouth; they apparently have no
 saurian fossils. A. Brooki, A. stellaris, A. planicosta, and A. Dudres-
 sieri accompany^, obtusus.
      The next zone is that of the Am. oxynoius, with A. bifer and A.
 lacunatus.     The beds with Am. raricostatus comprise (in ascend
 ing order) the Ammonite-bed, the Hippopodium-bed,             the coral-
 band, and the Gryphaea-bed. This zone is well seen near Chelten
 ham, at Lyme, and at Robin's Hood Bay in Yorkshire. Am. ar-
 matus, A. nodulosus, and A. Guibalianus belong to the A. raricos
 tatus beds.
      Dr. Wright then pointed out that the Avicula contorta beds, like
 the Kossen beds, contain a fauna special to themselves, and might as
 well be classed with the Trias as with the Lias.           They have a
 wide range in the South of England, South Wales, the Midland
 Counties, and the North of Ireland.         After some remarks on the
 more important features of the several Ammonite-zones of the Lower
 Lias, the author concluded by remarking that, as Quenstedt and
  Oppel had observed, the Middle Lias could be similarly subdivided
 by means of the Ammonites peculiar to its several stages.

      As the Lingula Credneri of Geinitz, formerly known only in the
  Permian rocks (Lower Permian of Germany ; Marlslate of Durham
  and Northumberland), has of late been found by Mr. Kirkby in the
  Coal-measures at the Ryhope Winning, near Sunderland, he offers
  this notice as of interest both as to the discovery of another species

Permian sandstone. From the preceding list of Carboniferous spe
cies found also in the Permian strata of Durham, we are able (says
the author) to see at a glance the specific relationship (so far as at
present known) which exists between the life-groups of the later
palaeozoic periods.    The generic affinity of these groups has long
been noticed.     This affinity and other apparent indications of a
want of systematic difference originated the proposal that the Per
mian should be included in the Carboniferous system ; and Mr.
Kirkby considers that the existence of the several recurrent Carboni
ferous species in the Permian rocks strongly supports this view,
and that " Permian
                      " should be retained
                                            only as a subordinate term.

   After noticing generally the mica-schist of the district, with its
limestone or calcareous schist, and occasional roofing-slate, the au
thor proceeded to describe first the porphyry- vein (half a mile wide),
containing silver-ore, copper-pyrites, grey copper-ore, iron-pyrites,
and molybdena, and crossing a vein of non-metalliferous greenstone,
at Tomnadashan, on Loch Tay opposite Ben Lawers.               He then
pointed out the probable connexion of the existing great valleys
with lines of fracture due to igneous violence. The veins at Ard-
tallanaig, containing heavy spar, and ores of zinc, copper, and iron,
were next noticed.      At Correbuich there are two sets of veins in
the calcareous schist ; those having a North and South direction
contain argentiferous galena and traces of gold.      The most eastern
hills on Loch Tay, in the neighbourhood of Taymouth abound with
quartzose veins containing copper-pyrites, iron-pyrites, and galena.
The iron-ore of Glenqueich, and the serpentine and chromate of iron
at Corycharmaig, where graphite and rutile also occur, were next
noticed.    At Lochearn Head there are galena-veins in calcareous
schist ; here, too, some auriferous arsenical pyrites has been found.
Lastly the author described in some detail the lead-bearing veins at
Glen Fallich and Tyndrum, which have been worked for many years.

ON THE PRODUCTION OF OZONE BY MEANS OF A PLATINUM WIRE
MADE INCANDESCENT BY AN ELECTRIC CURRENT. BY M. LE ROUI.
    If a platinum wire, not too large, be made incandescent by an elec
tric current in such a manner that the ascending flow of hot air which
has surrounded the wire comes in direct contact with the nostrils, an
 odour of ozone is perceived. The experiment may be made in the
 following manner : — A very fine platinum wire (-^yth to -%-gth. of a
 millimetre) 20 centimetres long is taken ; it is formed in any
 shape, and supported in an almost horizontal position in any suit
able manner.       A glass funnel of 2 or 3 litres is placed over this,
 so that the air has sufficient access to the wire. As the neck of the
funnel is usually too narrow, it is cut so as to leave an aperture
 2 or 3 centimetres in diameter, on which is adjusted a glass chim
 ney of a suitable length ; the object of which is to cool the gases
 heated by the wire.       The wire is then made incandescent by means
 of twelve or fifteen Bunsen's cells. The gas issuing from the chim
 ney is found to have the odour of ozone ; iodized starch-papers are
 altered in a few minutes when placed over the chimney.               In this
 case the air passing over the incandescent wire undergoes         a peculiar
 modification by which it acquires the properties of ozone ; but whe
 ther this is effected by the electricity acting as a source of heat, or by
 its own proper action, must be reserved for further experiments. —

      OBSERVATIONS ON THE USE OP INSOLUBLE COMPOUNDS
             IN VOLTAIC PILES. BY M. BECQUEREL.
   In the decompositions announced in 1837, effected on insoluble
substances placed in contact with the negative pole of a couple or
battery, I was able to reduce large quantities of different metallic
substances, more especially chloride and sulphide of silver, and sul
phate and phosphate of lead. These effects are analogous to the
decomposition of fused chloride of silver, which takes place when
this substance is immersed in acidulated water in contact with a
plate of zinc.
   Many years afterwards I recurred to the subject, and showed the
advantage to be derived from the use of insoluble substances in the
construction of voltaic couples. The couples might be composed of
an oxidizable metal (zinc or iron), a single liquid, generally saline
water, and a conductor of tin, surrounded by one of the substances
mentioned — such as silver, lead, or copper minerals, and in particular
sulphate of lead.
   One of the most important applications of these effects was the
electro-chemical treatment of silver and lead ores*, using in this
case the remarkable action produced by an oxidizable metal on
sulphate of lead in presence of saline water.      Since this time I have
frequently   used  these  sulphate  of lead batteries in my electro-che
mical researches. They were piles with one liquid ; the oxidizable
metal was zinc placed in a sailcloth bag, or in a permeable vessel filled
with saturated solution of salt. The second conductor consisted of
a bar of charcoal, or a plate of copper, lead, or tin, in contact with
brine saturated with sulphate of lead, or holding it in suspension.
The contents of the vessel in which this latter solution was placed
was often 3000 litres. Six such couples, united as a battery, gave
pretty strong sparks.      The intensity of their action depends on the
depolarization of the negative plate by the sulphate of lead which
is reduced, and by which the disengagement of hydrogen is pre
vented. Besides, the liquid contains sulphate of lead in solution as
•well as diffused ; for it is soluble in about fifty parts of the saline
solution.    The permeable diaphragm serves to prevent the closing
 of the circuit and the destruction of the effect of the pile, by the
precipitation of lead on the zinc when solution of salt is employed.
   It is to be observed that the electromotive force of the couple is
the difference of the effect produced by the liquid on the zinc and
on the reduced lead, and that hence it is sufficient to have a rod or
plate of tinned iron or of lead, as negative conductor in contact with
the sulphate of lead.      For some years, masses of sulphate of lead,
produced in the manufacture of sulphuric acid at Dieuze, and sold
at a low price, have thus been reduced to the metallic state. In the
fusion of the lead it is necessary to take suitable precautions, as it
frequently contains a little sulphate. — Comptes Rendus, April 2, 1860.

LIV.    Crystalline Form not necessarily an indication of definite
    Chemical Composition ; or, on the possible Variation of Con
   stitution in a mineral Species independent of the Phenomena of
   Isomorphism.       By Josiah P. Cooke, Jun., A.A.S., Professor
   of Chemistry and Mineralogy in Harvard College, United
    States of America *.
       a memoir     presented to the American Academy of Arts and
IN Sciences                                  I
                   in September 1855 \, described two new com
pounds of zinc and antimony, which          I  named stibiobizincyle and
stibiotrizincyle,   on   account  of  their analogy in composition to
the metallic radicals of organic chemistry. The symbols of these
compounds are Sb Zn2 and Sb Zn3; and they are distinguished
by the high perfection of their crystalline forms, the last being
still further characterized by a most remarkable property of de
composing water quite rapidly at 100° C.           I stated in the same
memoir that crystals of these two compounds could be obtained,
containing proportions of zinc and antimony differing very widely
from those required by the law of definite proportions; and         I also
traced out the relation between the composition of the crystals,
and that of the menstruum in which they are formed.              It is my
object in the present paper to consider the bearing of these facts,
already fully described, on the idea of mineral species, and to
offer a few suggestions which I hope may be of service in de
termining the true chemical formulae of many minerals, and thus
in simplifying the science of mineralogy. But in order to render
myself intelligible, it will be necessary to recapitulate very briefly
the facts in question, referring to the original memoir for the full
details.

     The crystals both of Sb Zn2 and Sb Zn3 can be obtained with
 great readiness.        It is only necessary to melt together the two
  metals in the atomic proportions, and when the metals are fully
  alloyed, to proceed exactly as in crystallizing sulphur. The melted
 mass is allowed to cool until a crust forms on the surface, which
 is then broken, and the liquid metal remaining in the interior
 poured out. On subsequently breaking the crucible, the interior
 is found lined with magnificent metallic crystals, which, when not
 tarnished by oxidation, have a silver-white lustre. In the course
 of my investigations on these compounds, crystallizations were
 made, or attempted, of alloys differing in composition by one
 half to five per cent., according to circumstances, from the
 alloy containing 95 per cent, of zinc, to that containing 95
 per cent, of antimony ; but only tivo crystalline forms were ob
 served, that of Sb Zn2 and that of Sb Zn3.            The crystals of the
 two compounds both belong to the trimetric system ; but they
 differ from each other, not only in their crystallographic elements,
 but also in their whole "habitus."          Stibiotrizincyle crystallizes
 in long acicular prisms, which group themselves together into
 larger prismatic aggregates ; while stibiobizincyle crystallizes in
 broad plates, which twin together on an octahedral face, and
 form a very characteristic cellular structure. This very striking
 difference in the character of the crystals proved to be an im
 portant circumstance in the investigation, as it enabled me to
 distinguish with certainty between the two compounds, even
 when the faces of the crystals were so imperfect that a measure
 ment of angles was impossible.
     The most remarkable result of the investigation, and the one
to which      I  wish to direct especial attention, is the fact that
each of the two crystalline forms was found to be constant
under very wide variations in the per-centage composition of the
crystals.     As this is a point of great importance, it will be
necessary to enter more into detail, considering in the first
place the crystals of Sb Zn3.         The crystals of this compound are
obtained in the greatest perfection from an alloy containing the
two metals in just the proportions represented by the formula,
namely, 42-8 parts of zinc, and 57*2 parts of antimony.                They
are then comparatively large, generally aggregated, and, as the
three analyses cited in the accompanying Table indicate, they
have the same composition as the alloy.

 to 48'7, the crystals continued to have the composition of the
 alloy ; and the only difference which could be observed in their
 character was that they were smaller, and more frequently
 isolated.     Between these limits the whole mass of the alloy ex
 hibited a strong tendency to crystallization ; and by pouring             it,
 asit    cooled, from one vessel to another,       it  could be crystallized
 to the last drop. On increasing the amount of zinc in the alloy
 to 507 per cent., the amount of zinc foimd in" the crystals was
 uniformly less than     it   was in the alloy     ; but no closer relation
 between the two could be detected, owing, undoubtedly, to the
 unavoidable irregularity in the crystallization of the alloys which
 contained more than 50 per cent, of zinc. This arose from                 a
 peculiar pasty condition which the liquid mass assumed at the
 point of crystallization.        Definite crystals, however, were ob
 tained from an alloy of 60 per cent, zinc containing 55 per
 cent.
     ;     above this the crystals became less and less abundant,
 and gradually faded out, although the alloy of 86 per cent, of
zinc exhibited radiated crystalline texture
                 a                                     ; and     trace of this
                                                                 a
structure could still be discovered even in the alloy containing
only 4     per cent, of antimony.       It was very interesting to trace
the gradual fading out of the crystalline structure, as the cha
racter of the phsenomenon was entirely analogous to that which
may be noticed in many crystalline rocks.
    Finding that the crystalline form of Sb Zn3 was constant under
so great an increase of the proportion of zinc in the crystals,           it
might be supposed that, on returning to the alloy of 42*8 per
cent, of zinc and increasing the amount of antimony, we should
obtain crystals containing an excess of antimony but so far  ;             is
 this from being true, that the slightest excess of antimony en
tirely changes the character of the crystallization.              On crystal
lizing an alloy containing 41 '8 per         cent,  of zinc, not trace of
                                                                     a
 any    prismatic  crystals  could   be  seen
                                            ;    but   in their place there
 was   founda    confused  mass   of  thin metallic   scales, which, as will
 soon be shown, are imperfect crystals of Sb Zn2.            Thus    it
                                                                      appears
that, although perfectly formed crystals of Sb Zn8 can be obtained
containing 55 per cent, of zinc (that        is,   12 per cent, above the
typical proportions), they cannot be made to take up the slight
est excess of antimony.
    Let us pass now to the crystals of Sb Zn2. In order to obtain
crystals having the exact typical constitution,             itwas found ne
cessary    to crystallize an  alloy  containing    not  more  than 31*5 per
cent, of zinc. At this point large compound crystals are obtained,
corresponding to the large crystals of Sb Zn3 and the same was
                                                        ;
true of alloys down to 27 per cent, of zinc.             Between these two
limits (namely, alloys     of  31-5   and  27  per  cent,  of zinc) the cry
                                    2E2

408      Prof.  J. P. Cooke   on the  Variation of Constitution in a
stals formed were found to have the theoretical composition of
Sb Zn2, indicating of course a tendency towards this point ; but
on increasing or diminishing the amount of zinc in the alloy
beyond these limits, the composition of the crystals immediately
began to vary in the same direction as that of the alloy.           The
crystals   of  Sb  Zns  containing   an excess  of zinc are smaller  and
more frequently isolated than those having the exact theoretical
composition. A similar fact, it will be remembered, is true of
the crystals of Sb Zn8.
   At the alloy of 33 per cent, of zinc, the definite crystals of
Sb Zn2 begin to disappear, and are succeeded by thin metallic
scales, which are obviously imperfect crystals of the same form.
This was established, not only by the obvious law of continuity
noticed in the different specimens (the perfect crystals gradually
passing into the scales), but also by the peculiar mode of twin
ing, which was the same with the scales as with the large cry
stals, forming the peculiar cellular structure already referred to.
Moreover, the angle between two scales thus united was found
to be equal to the basal angle of the perfect crystals, at least as
nearly as could be measured.         These scales continue up to the
alloy  of 41*8   per  cent, of zinc, becoming, however, less abundant
and less distinct. Several specimens of them were analysed ; but
no regularity could be detected in their composition, except that
they all contained a much larger amount of zinc than the alloys
in which they were formed.
   Crystals of Sb Zn2 containing an excess of antimony were readily
obtained from alloys containing less than 27 per cent, of zinc.
They became more and more imperfect as the excess of antimony
increased, and finally faded out altogether in the alloys below
20 per cent, of zinc. It is evident, therefore, that definite and
perfect crystals of Sb Zn2 can be obtained with a large excess
either of zinc or antimony above the theoretical composition. It
is also evident that, of the two compounds, Sb Zn2 is the most
stable, — first, because it is formed to the exclusion of Sb Zn3 in
all alloys containing less zinc than the amount corresponding to
the typical composition of the last compound; and secondly,
because the crystals retain the typical composition under quite a
wide variation (viz. between 31-5 and 27 per cent.) in the com
position of the alloy.
   The facts above stated are fully illustrated by the following
Table, which gives the results of a large number of analyses of
crystals of both compounds formed in alloys containing different
proportions of the two metals : — ••.

    The relation between the composition of the crystals Sb Zna
and that of the alloy in which they are formed, is discussed at
length in the memoir already referred to.       It is there shown to
be a very simple function of the mass of metal which is in excess
in the alloy, and of the force which determines the union of the
elements in definite proportions.       The whole order of these
phsenomena seem to the author to point to the existence of a
power in the mass of metal which is in excess in the alloy, to
disturb the action of the force, whatever it may be, which tends
to unite the elements in definite proportions.       There     in the                                 is,
first place,   strong tendency
                     a          in the  elements   to unite and  form
crystals having the exact typical composition          and secondly,                 ;
this tendency       only overcome
                             is                              by
                                           certain excess of either a
metal in the alloy. Then, again, the crystals of one compound
obviously interfere with those of the other.       This certainly has
the appearance of one force interfering with the action of another,
— the force of mass         may so call (if
                                          I perturbing the action ofit)
the chemical force.    But       not my object at present to enter
                                               it   is
into    discussion on the cause of this variation.
         a                                            Moreover, since

 410     Prof. J.  P. Cooke on the Variation of Constitution in  a
 such a discussion must be based on purely hypothetical grounds,
 we could not expect to arrive at any definite conclusion.         The
 facts will be viewed differently according to the theory which
 may be adopted in regard to that long-controverted subject, the
 essential constitution of matter.     Leaving, however, all theore
 tical considerations aside, there are certain practical bearings of
 the observed facts on the science of mineralogy which are of
 immediate application.
     Here are two beautifully crystallized products, as well crystal
 lized as any that occur in nature, and yet the different specimens
 of the crystals differ from each other so widely in composition
 that any single analysis might lead to an entirely erroneous con
 clusion in regard to the general formula of the substance. Were a
 chemist to analyse accidentally solely the crystals obtained from
 an alloy containing 58*0 per cent, of zinc, he would at once de
 termine that the formula of the compound was Sb Zn4 ; and by
 a like accident he might be led to any other formula between
 this and Sb Zn3 : in fact, by an analysis of a number of spe
 cimens of needle-shaped crystals obtained from alloys of copper
 and tin, Rieffel was led to several just such improbable for
 mulae; and in my own investigations it was not until          I   had
analysed a whole series of crystals, that the real nature of the
phsenomena became apparent, and the true constitution of the
compounds determined.        If, then, such great variations in com
position   are compatible with a definite crystalline form in these
furnace products, may not similar variations occur in the cry
stalline minerals formed in nature ?
    It is not necessary to make an extended investigation in order
to answer this question ; for the materials at our hands are suf
ficient to give us a satisfactory reply.
    There is a compound of antimony and silver called Discrasite,
which occurs in many localities crystallized in trimetric prisms
homceomorphous with Sb Zn8.           The formula of the mineral is
therefore probably SbAg8, which would require 71"5 per cent,
of silver ; but the per cent, as given by analysis varies between
75-25 and 78 per cent., and one analysis gives the per cent, as
high as 85.       Further analyses of this mineral are required in
order to determine its constitution, but there can be no doubt
that it varies in composition like Sb Zn3.
    Silver-glance is another highly crystalline mineral. Theore
tically it should contain 87*1 per cent, of silver and 12-9 per
cent, of sulphur ; but in a specimen analysed by Klaproth, the
proportions were 85 and 15.
    Again, the analyses of pyrrhotine (magnetic pyrites) give
results varying between 38'78 per cent, sulphur, 6052 per cent,
iron (variety from Bodenmais), and 43*63 sulphur, 5637 iron

mineral species independent  of the Phanometta of Isomorphism.     41.1
 (variety from Bareges). The constitution of the mineral is still
uncertain ; but its true formula is probably Fe S, which would
require 36-4 per cent, sulphur and 63'6per cent. iron.        Lastly,
the analyses of antimony-glance give results varying between
            Antimony 74*06,           ,    Antimony 73-5,
                                   ana
            Sulphur     25-94,             Sulphur    26-5.
The true formula of this mineral is undoubtedly Sb S3, which
would require only 72-88 per cent, of antimony.
    Similar examples might be very greatly multiplied.          Those
just cited were selected at random from the first few pages of
Dana's ' System of Mineralogy/ They are all examples of binary
compounds which occur almost chemically pure in nature ; so
that the phenomena in question are not complicated by those
of isomorphism.
    When we pass to minerals of more complex constitution, the
same phenomena can be made evident, although not quite so
easily, on account of the introduction of the phsenomena of sub
stitution by isomorphous elements.          It will not, however, be
 necessary for me to cite examples ; for it is a fact perfectly well
known to all mineralogists, that, after making allowances for the
substitution of isomorphous elements, the various analyses of
such minerals as mica, hornblende, garnet, and tourmaline differ
very greatly from each other, — a difference, moreover, which no
mere error of analysis will explain, and which must therefore be
referred to an actual variation in composition.       In the silicates
this variation in composition is made evident by the variation of
 what is termed the "oxygen ratios;" and it is well known to
mineralogists that in many species this variation is very large.
For example, in mica the following ratios between the oxygen in
 the base and acid have been observed in merely the Muscovite
 variety:
          — 13 : 16, 13£ : 16, and 14f : 16; and similarly wide
variations might be pointed out in other well-known species.         It
is in consequence of such variations as these that the general
 chemical formula? of some of the best-known mineral species,
 such as mica and tourmaline, are still uncertain ; and in other
 cases, where the true formula is probably known, the constitution
 of the mineral has been determined quite as much from other
 considerations as from the chemical analyses.
    Sufficient has been said,   I  think, to show that variations in
 composition similar   to those which I have observed in zinc and
 antimony occur in many minerals; and I trust that the results
 of my investigation will serve to throw light on this whole class
 of phenomena, which have so greatly perplexed mineralogists,
 and rendered all strictly chemical classifications of mineral spe
 cies so unsatisfactory.   This investigation has shown that a defi

412      Prof. J. P. Cooke on    the   Variation of Constitution in a
nite crystalline form is compatible with quite a wide variation of
 composition, and has in this way pointed out an explanation of
the variation observed in the mineral kingdom.            But more than
this, the investigation has also indicated a method by which,
amidst all this variation, the true constitution of the mineral can
 be determined.
    In the compounds of zinc and antimony, although the definite
 crystalline form was compatible with a wide variation in the
proportions of the constituent elements, yet the point corre
sponding to the typical composition was marked by several un-
mistakeable properties, which clearly enough indicated the true
formulae of the compounds.           These properties are discussed at
length in my original memoir, and need therefore only to be
alluded to in this connexion.
    It has already been stated that the crystals, both of Sb Zn3
and Sb Zn2, having the theoretical composition are, as a rule,
larger and more generally aggregated than those containing an
excess of either metal. Moreover, in Sb Zn* the general character
of the crystals appears to be modified by the change of compo
sition, although the crystallographic elements remain the same.
Thus in the crystals having the theoretical composition, the
octahedral planes are greatly developed, giving to the crystals
the general appearance of a truncated octahedron *.             But as the
crystals   take  up   an excess either   of antimony   or zinc,  the basal
planes   become   more    and more    dominant,  and  the  crystals are at
last reduced to thin plates. In fact, so marked are these changes,
that, after a little experience, a person could tell the approxi
mate composition of the crystals from their general appearance.
Similar changes in the appearance of many minerals are familiar
to the mineralogist. They are seen in calcite, heavy spar. Angle-
site, and others, and may serve as guides in tracing variations of
composition.
    Again, the specific gravity of the crystals, both of Sb Zn2 and
Sb Zn3, was taken with great care through the whole series, and
the results are tabulated below.         The union of the two elements
is attended with an increase of volume, and this increase is at a
maximum at the points corresponding to the theoretical composi
tion. These points would therefore be marked in a set of crystals
by being points of minimum specific gravity ; and they could be
determined with great accuracy by means of this property, even
in a series of alloys of the two metals which had not been cry

                        { Point of typical composition of Sb Zn2.
   The point of typical composition in the case of the crystals of
Sb Zn3 was still further marked in a most decided manner by a
very remarkable property.                 It has already been stated that this
compound has the power of decomposing water with rapidity at
100° C. ; but this is true only of those crystals which have ap
proximately the theoretical composition. During the course of
                           I
my investigation determined the quantity of hydrogen evolved
by alloys of different composition during a given time, taking
care, of course, that the circumstances should be the same in all
cases ; and      I  found that with the alloy containing 43 per cent, of
zinc, there is an immense maximum, confined at most between 2
per cent, on either side, the alloy of 43 per cent, yielding over

  414     Prof.  J. P. Cooke on    the Variation  of Constitution in  a
 nine times as much gas as an alloy of 50 per cent., although the
 crystals of the last were fully as definite as those of the first*.
    It is evident from the above facts, that the points corresponding
 to the theoretical composition of the two compounds of zinc and
 antimony, are also points of maxima and minima of various pro
 perties.     Now   I have no doubt that the same truth will be found
 to hold in the mineral kingdom.           In a mineral like tourmaline
 or mica, for example, the specimen having the exact theoretical
 composition may probably be discovered by examining a large
 number of specimens, and discussing their various physical pro
 perties.     All the physical properties may be of value in this
 connexion,     such as lustre, hardness, specific gravity, specific
 heat,  &c.  ; and   no mechanical rules can be laid down.           Much
 must depend on the discretion of the observer ; and in any cases
 such properties will be selected as are best adapted to the cir
 cumstances of the case.        In comparing different crystals of the
 same mineral, it is obviously important to select such as have
 been formed in a different matrix ; for it is only with such that
 we should be led to expect great variations of composition.             It
 is also evident that the phenomena would be complicated when
there has been a substitution of isomorphous elements; and until
the effect of such substitution on the physical properties can be
traced, it will be necessary to select specimens of as uniform a
constitution as possible.
    With one other consideration        I  will close this paper. The
principle which has been here discussed must modify materially
our notion of a mineral species. The idea of a mineral species
has hitherto involved chiefly two distinct characters : —first, a de
finite crystalline form ; second, a constant general formula ; and
any important variation in either of these characters has been
regarded as equivalent to a change of species. Rutile and anatase
are regarded as different species, because their crystalline forms
are slightly different, although both minerals have identically
the same constitution; and again, magnetite and Franklinite,
which have the same form, are regarded as different species,
because they have a slightly different composition.             It is true
that the actual composition of a mineral may vary very greatly
by the substitution of isomorphous elements, and yet, if the ge
neral formula remains constant, the species may not be changed.
But the extent to which such substitution can be carried without
changing the species is not so well settled among mineralogists
as could be desired, and the same rule is not applied to all species.
The difference between the varieties of garnet, for example, is as
great as that between the species magnetite             and Franklinite.
Leaving, however, this point undetermined, all mineralogists
                   * See Table in the memoir before
                                                    cited.

mineral species independent of the Phenomena   of Isomorphism.   415
have agreed that any essential change in the general formula was
inconsistent with the idea of the same species.     The result, how
ever,   of my investigation is to  show that the  general formula of
a mineral species may vary also, or, as I should rather say, the
general formula is not necessarily the actual formula of each given
specimen, but only the typical formula of the ¦species towards
which the mineral tends, and which it would unquestionably
reach if it could be several time3 recrystallized.
    According to this view, the general formula represents not the
actual constitution of the mineral, but only a certain typical com
position, which perhaps is never realized with any actual spe
cimen.      The fact that the composition of a mineral species
may be modified by the substitution of isomorphous elements,
was first established by Mitscherlich, and has long been an ad
mitted principle in mineralogy. We must now, as I think, still
further expand our idea of a mineral species, and admit that its
composition may be modified by an actual variation in the pro
portions of its constituents. Thus it is that in mineralogy, as
in other sciences, we are led to admit the truth of that maxim
which every advance in true knowledge seems to verify, " Natura
non facit saltus."
    While the results of my investigations thus serve to render
the idea of a mineral species less definite than before, I cannot
but hope that they will tend ultimately to simplify the whole
 subject of mineralogy ; for not only may we expect to reduce the
number of mineral species, but also, by simplifying the general
 formulae of those which remain, to classify the whole with a
 greater precision than is now possible.      To do this, however,
 implies a careful revision of the whole subject-matter of mine
 ralogy on the principles above given, — a labour of which few can
 appreciate the extent, except those who are familiar with the
 methods of physical research.      The work cannot be done by any
 one person; and it is the chief object of the present paper to call
 the attention of mineralogists to the importance of the subject.
    I  have not thought it necessary to dwell in this paper on the
 obvious distinction between the phaenomena here in consideration,
 and those of isomorphism.       It was shown in my previous me
 moir, that the variation in the composition of the crystals of
 Sb Zn3 and Sb Zn2 could not be explained by this principle ; and
 the distinction between the two classes of phsenomena has been
 still further illustrated by a recent investigation on the crystals
 formed in alloys of copper and zinc, made in my laboratory by
 Mr. F. H. Storcr. These crystals, which are undoubtedly mix
 tures of isomorphous elements, give no indications whatever of
 points of typical composition, — thus illustrating not only the
 characters of an isomorphous mixture, but also the distinction

 416          Dr. Lamont on Phenomena observed during
 between such a mixture and a true chemical compound.                Ad
 mitting, then, the possibility of a variation of composition in a
 mineral species, independent of the phenomena of isomorphism,
 it becomes of importance to distinguish this new class of pheno
 mena by a separate term ; and        I would propose for this purpose
 the word Allomerism. By this word I would designate a variation
 in the proportions of the constituents of a crystallized compoundwith-
 out any essential change in the crystalline form.      If, then, we also
 use the word typical to indicate the condition of definite composi
 tion, we may speak of those specimens of a mineral species which
 contain an excess of one or the other constituent, as allomeric
 variations from the typical composition.      The degree of allomerism
 would then be measured by the excess of the allomeric con
 stituent above the typical composition.           Thus the crystals of
 Sb Zn3 containing 42 -3 per cent, of zinc would be said to have
 the typical composition ; while those containing 55 per cent, of
 zinc would be distinguished as an allomeric variety, the degree
 of allomerism in this instance amounting to 12 per cent., and
 zinc being the allomeric constituent.             In the case of the
 mineral Discrasite, it is probable that no specimen having the
typical composition has yet been analysed.             Those specimens
 whose analyses are given in Dana's ' System of Mineralogy/ are
 all probably allomeric varieties of the mineral, silver being the
 allomeric constituent, and the degree of allomerism varying
 from 4 to 7 per cent.      It is unnecessary, however, to multiply
 examples,   as the above  are  sufficient to illustrate the use of the
term.

        my yearly report for 1854,       I have endeavoured to give a
 IN    novel explanation, and one that differed from all the views
hitherto entertained, of the violet prominences that are noticed
in total solar eclipses. According to the explanation there set
forth only in general terms, the phenomenon is produced by
little masses of clouds which become condensed in our atmo
sphere in the cone of the moon's shadow, owing to the depres
sion of the temperature which takes place there.           From the cir
cumstance of there occurring in 1860 in Spain a total eclipse of
the sun which may be observed under very favourable conditions,
and the opportunity there will then be afforded for arriving at data

to the subject, and to discuss more fully the details contained
in recent reports upon this matter, without, however, touch
ing upon the fundamental principles set forth at page 8 of my
Yearly Report for 1854, with which I assume the reader to be
familiar.
                       I
     At the outset must remark that when in a dark room an
opening in a window-shutter, a1 b' (Plate I. fig. 1), is observed
from c through a film of vapour A B, the visibility of the vapour
depends on the brilliancy of the entering light*.               If the bril
liancy i3 very considerable, the light from a b falls on the whole
 breadth of de, and is reflected to the eye from all points of the
vapour, thus rendering the entire film of vapour visible, though
 with very unequal intensity.          The intensity will diminish from
/   to d and from g to e, because the angle of incidence and re
 flexion is more and more inclined ; the greatest intensity will be
                                 /
 manifested in the space g, where the light passes from the
 opening direct through to the eye. The more the brilliancy of
 the light that enters at the opening in the shutter diminishes,
 the more must the visibility of the vapour decrease, beginning
 from d and e ; and a limit is soon reached where the side portions
fg snide disappear altogether, the part fg alone remaining
 visible. We see from this, that when a surface of light of very
 low intensity is observed through a mass of vapour, only that
portion of the vapour can be perceived which is between the eye and
 the luminous surface.
      If the opening a b is so disposed      that the light beginning at a
 goes on decreasing towards b, then in like manner the visibility
                                           /
 of the vapour will diminish from towards g, and will only be
 extended over a certain portion of the space fg.
      To render what has been stated applicable to the phsenomenon
 of total solar eclipses, it is requisite, in the first place, to form
  a precise notion with regard to vapour.           On examining carefully
  the formation of clouds, especially as they frequently present
 themselves to us in summer, it will be remarked that the vapours
  which congregate together form no regular covering, but a ragged
  interwoven mass (fig. 2), consisting of thicker parts, and parts
  growing less dense till they vanish altogether.            It will further
  be noticed that very frequently the vapour disappears at one
  side or at a corner — melts away as it were — and is deposited on
  another side.
      As far, moreover, as the light is concerned which serves for
  rendering objects visible during total solar eclipses, it consists of
     *  If an uncoated looking-glass is besprinkled with alum-water and then
  allowed to dry, a fine coating is formed thereon, on looking through which
  the same appearances are presented as through a mass of vapour.        This
  arrangement is suitable to the experiment in question.

  418          Dr. Lamont on Phanomena observed during
 a  bright ring encircling the edge of the moon, and which at the
  edge itself is tolerably intense, but the intensity of which dis
  appears very rapidly outwards.      It is moreover to be remarked
 that the light may render the masses of vapour visible in different
 manners. With a certain density of the vapour, and with a certain
 intensity (always tolerably subdued) of the source of light, the
 transmitted light appears coloured reddish; with a greater den
 sity of the vapour, the light appears white ; and when the vapour
 has attained a cloud-like density, the light becomes entirely
 stopped, the mass of vapour appearing black.
     Let us now take into consideration, laying aside entirely at
 first all that relates to motion, what phenomena a mass of vapour
 between the observer and the ring of light attending a total
 solar eclipse   will produce.
     First, let a portion of the moon's edge be covered with a mass
 of vapour (fig. 3), abed; in that case the portion situated within
 the disc of the moon disappears for the observer, as does also
 that portion extending out beyond the ring of light, and there
 remains nothing but an elevation between a and b, the height of
 which depends on the width of the luminous ring, while its
 colour is dependent on the'eircumstances stated above.
     Suppose we have (fig. 4) a mass of vapour, a b, a corner of
 which juts out beyond the edge of the moon, we shall then have
 a mountain-shaped prominence produced, as the figure shows.
    If we have (fig. 5) a mass of vapour, a, touching the edge of
the moon with one corner, there will be seen at the moon's edge
 a projection with small isolated spots.
    Let us now examine also the motion. The motion is here
threefold.
    1. A motion of the earth on its axis, whereby the whole atmo
 sphere, and consequently the masses of vapour suspended therein,
are carried along over the moon's disc from west to east.
    2. A movement of the clouds in the atmosphere, brought about
by currents of air, whose direction, speaking in a general way, is
not subject to any rule.
    3. A motion due to the vapour becoming dissolved or de
posited.
    The first of these three motions is alone regular ; and its con
sequence would be that the masses of vapour would apparently
become covered up by the western limb of the moon, and would,
on the contrary, make their appearance again on the eastern
limb.
    With respect to the second motion, only thus much can be
said, — namely, that it follows the course of the current of the air.
When, therefore, the mass of vapour takes its origin in the lower
current of air, its motion coincides with the direction of the wind;

                         Total Eclipses of  the  Sun.                    419
 but when the vapour forms in the upper current, its motion will
probably be contrary to that of the lower one ; this latter point,
 however, is very uncertain.
     With regard to the third motion, nothing can be laid down
 theoretically respecting it.        In a general way the consequence
 is that the apparent motion, considered as forming a part of the
 three mentioned above, will, both in amount and also in direc
 tion,, be accidental.       Nor are we able to lay down anything
 more definite relative to the changes of form originating in the
 motion.       If in a cloud of uniform density (fig. 3) the motion
 takes place in the direction c d, the elevation on the moon's limb
 will remain tolerably steady, with the exception of its extension,
 which alters with the breadth of the cloud. A projecting point
 (fig. 4) apparently      disappears behind the moon's limb if the
 motion is from a towards b; a projection becomes converted
into a mountain-crest when the mass of vapour approaches
 towards the moon's centre.
     Some kind of motion, however, is always to be looked for ; for
it would be a most improbable case that all the three motions
mentioned above should just counteract each other.
    If we compare the theoretical views hitherto promulgated with
observation, it will be seen that, generally speaking, observers
have not directed their special attention to the circumstances
that were essential to arriving at a decision ; nevertheless many
particulars in confirmation of my explanation may be derived
from the great number of reports and sketches that we have
before us.       The sketch by Fearnley of the solar eclipse of the
28th of July, 1851, as observed by him at Rixhoft, seems to me
to be especially characteristic.         See fig. 6 for a copy thereof.
 The form proper to clouds is here so distinctly pronounced,
and extends so far away from the moon's edge, that it seems to
me impossible to look for the origin of the phaenomenon any
where but in our atmosphere.
    I select the following circumstances from the very instructive
report of Schmid, who observed the same eclipse at Rasten-
berg.
    In the first   seconds of the totality, he at once perceived in the
corona     " several brighter places of imperfectly defined form, some
thing   like  separate,  white, very nebulously-blurred     little clouds."
When     the   sun  broke  forth in the form  of a fine crescent   of light,
he examined carefully the remaining part of the moon's edge,
which disappeared altogether after 1 minute and 55 seconds,
after being 40 seconds previously partially interrupted, so that
there yet remained only separate portions of the arc which repre
sented the curvature of the moon's edge.
    Schmid did not remark any protuberances at all during the

420      On Pfianomena    observed during Total Eclipses  of the Sun.
 first 7 to 10 seconds;    it was not till after that interval that   a
red protuberance declared itself of a sudden on the north-east,
precisely at   the place where, before, a nebulous white spot had been
seen.    This   protuberance did not proceed from within outwards
from the moon's limb, but was formed suddenly, as if " the red
 of the protuberance had had a whitish nebulous covering removed
 from off it." It was distinctly remarked how the disc of the
 moon advanced over this protuberance and completely         covered it
 over  in  a few seconds.    A  second protuberance became visible
 shortly after the first one, but somewhat more to the north, and
 it disappeared simultaneously with the first one. A third pro
 tuberance towards the south-east remained visible only during
 two seconds.       On the western limb there appeared gradually
three larger and one very small protuberance, which all increased
 in size by degrees, and so changed their shape that there is
hardly any way of explaining it but on the assumption that a
ragged mass of vapour traversed the moon's disc in a westerly
 direction. The wind on the surface of the earth had a general
westerly course, but varied both in its direction and force. We
 must therefore assume that the masses of vapour were formed in
the upper regions of the air, and were borne onward in a direc
tion opposed to that of the lower current.
    In the report of Dr. Moesta, who observed the total solar
eclipse of November 30, 1853, to the south of Pisco in Peru,
it is especially worthy of remark that, fifteen minutes prior to the
sun being totally eclipsed, the yet existing crescent of the sun
became suddenly "invested with a dark rose-coloured nebular
substance." The intensity of this covering kept on increasing,
so that at last the edges of the sun and moon could only be in
distinctly made out.        After the commencement of the total
eclipse, there was seen on the western edge of the moon a rose-
coloured elevation which had a southerly motion, and which dis
appeared in a minute and twenty seconds, its colour having first
passed to orange and then to yellow.         In addition thereto there
were observed on the northerly edge two completely dark protu
berances, which were without doubt masses of vapour of greater
density.     The sketch made by Moesta is shown in fig. 7.
    On the occasion of the total solar eclipse of September 7, 1858,
which was observed by a commission of astronomers at Paranagua
in Brazil, there were seen on the eastern edge of the moon two
white prominences with a black border, and one prominence
entirely white, which were apparently hidden by the moon as it
advanced : three prominences of a reddish colour made their ap
pearance by degrees on the western edge, and they would seem
to have increased slowly in size. Here also, therefore, we should
have to assume a motion of the vapour from east to west.

              On the Vertical Currents  of the Atmosphere.         421
Among the meteorological       notices, we find it stated that about
three-quarters of an hour after the total eclipse, clouds approached
the sun from the eastward, which harmonizes with what we have
assumed above ; it must not, however, be overlooked that in the
morning rain-clouds came up from the west ; so that here, again,
the direction of the current of the air remains undecided.
    It would be easy to gather from the reports before us on the
total solar eclipses that have been observed, many more addi
tional hints that coincide with and support my explanation of
the red prominences; but        I confine myself to what has been
stated above, and this the more from my being of opinion that
decisive facts have first to be arrived at by future observations.
It will be especially advisable to follow up the masses of vapour
that condense in the cone of shadow, — and to do so not only at
the moon's edge, but likewise in the aureole as far outwards as
the light extends, determining at the same time their magnitude
and the direction of their motion ; perhaps, indeed, it might be
practicable to gain some information upon this head immediately
previous to the disappearance of the sun, and immediately sub
sequent to its reappearance.         The visibility of the masses of
vapour depends mainly       on their density ; and that they are not
unfrequently of considerable density is proved by the occurrence
of prominences that ai"e black, or which at least are bounded by
a black border.
 LVI.    On  the Vertical Currents of the Atmosphere.      By Henry
    Hennessy, F.R.S., M.R.I. A., Professor of Natural Philosophy
    in the Catholic University of Ireland*.
 1.   TT has long been recognized that, although currents of wind
     A in a direction nearly parallel to the horizon are those which
 usually prevail, the atmosphere is frequently subjected to vertical
 and oblique motions among its particles.
     Under favourable conditions these motions may acquire such
 a development     as to force themselves upon the attention of
 observers, and thus become objects for meteorological inquiry.
 The interesting researches of M. Fournet upon the vertical cur
 rents of mountains, appear to have arisen from the opportunities
 enjoyed by that physicist of studying such phsenomena among
 the Alps. Among the deep ravines and valleys, as well as along
 the elevated slopes and escarpments of the Alps, a regular
 periodicity in the action of vertical winds has frequently been
 observed during the course of twenty-four hours, which has led
to the conclusion that their development depends upon changes

422            Prof. Hennessy on         the   Vertical Currents
of temperature resulting from the presence and absence of the
sun.    As it is now well established that the distribution and
changes of temperature in these islands are dependent upon other
influential causes besides the direct action of the sun*, we can
not, in general, expect to find in our climate a similar diurnal
periodicity so distinctly defined as that observed in the centre
and south of Europe. Here, as well as on the Continent, moun
tains are favourable to the production of inequalities of tempe
rature, moisture, and density among the aerial strata, which
thus become liable to a multitude of disturbances, and especially
to the action of vertical currents.           It seems to follow, that in
mountainous countries vertical currents have well-marked rela
tions with the changes of the weather.
    If,as usually happens, lakes exist among the mountains, the
mysterious occurrence called the

always proceeds from       a   side of the lake bordered      by

tains, immediately suggests such an explanation.              Although        a
similar idea has occurred to other inquirers,            may be permitted

                                     a
mef   of the  efficiency   of vertical currents
on the surface of one of our Irish lakes.            The fact that such       a
sudden wave usually preceded             achange of the weather in the
district surrounding the lake, led me to think that the study of
the effective cause of the bore itself might become of importance
in meteorology.        But to do this, we should possess means for
observing    the    actual  direction and,      possible, the force of the

    X Some time after the anemoscope had been devised, my attention was
called by my friend the Rev. Dr. Robinson, to    passage among the notes
                                                    a

                                 Botanic Garden,' wherein the writer indi
cates such an instrument  ; but he seems never to have realized this idea,
and the apparatus which he proposed was essentially different from mine.

 ment. A pair of flanges were attached to this disc in such a
 manner that, when the whole was at rest and the air free from
 motion, the flanges would he horizontal.     "With perfectly hori
 zontal currents, the flanges would still continue in the. same
 position, although the head of the vane would as usual move
 about in azimuth. But if a current happened to be inclined to
 the horizon, the flanges would be pressed upwards or downwards,
 showing the direction and amount of the inclination, precisely as
 the position of the head or tail of the ordinary vane shows the
 direction and inclination of a current with reference to the meri
dian. When we know the inclination of a given current to the
horizon, we can readily estimate its absolute force from its hori
zontal force, as can be easily shown.
    3. Let the origin of coordinates be at the centre of the axis
of the vertical disc ; ydx will represent an element of the area
of the flange.    Let 6 represent the angle of inclination of the
flange, H the pressure exercised by the wind in a horizontal
direction upon a square unit of surface, and V the vertical pres
sure exercised upon a similar unit.    The entire moment of the
horizontal forces acting on the entire flange will be
                                   J

and the moment of the vertical forces will be
                                 V Jcos   Qxydx.
   Both of these moments tend to cause a rotation of the disc,
but in contrary directions : hence when the disc is in equilibrium
they must be equal, and therefore, because 6 is independent of
x   and y, we shall have
                   Hsin0=Vcos0, V=Htan0;                   .   .   .   .   (1)

the atmosphere, or which afforded sufficient leisure for continued

attention. A journal was kept, from which make the following
extracts.    Before doing so, it is proper to remark that by the term
" vertical currents " in these extracts, as well as in the title of this
paper,   I do not mean currents actually perpendicular to the
horizon, but rather oblique currents with an upward or down
ward tendency.
   " June 28, 7 a.m. — Air perfectly still, flanges horizontal, head
of vane towards the east.            7.30 a.m. — Breeze with slight
vertical currents until after 8. The currents were upward from
the ground.      The flanges were often perfectly horizontal, and
their mean angle of inclination was small. About 10 a.m., a few
fine scattered clouds (cirro-cumuli) were observed to move in a-
direction contrary to the wind as observed near the earth.
   " From 3 p.m. to 3.45. —Wind extremely gentle from E.S.E.
 Upward current, angle of inclination estimated at about 5°.
The upward currents often continued for several minutes to
gether.     The angle was sometimes almost imperceptible. The
sky  became    gradually overcast towards evening.
   "June 30,10 a.m. — Sky completely overcast, strong wind from
E.S.E., rapid oscillations of the disc during the greater part of
the day.     About 6 p.m., the wind blew in violent gusts from the
east, and the disc showed alternations of upward and downward
currents with occasional short intervals.           These observations
led me to conclude that rapid currents of air cannot generally
advance with the same steadiness as currents of water; the greater
mobility and elasticity of the former fluid probably allow its
movements to easily acquire a species of undulation . Thus we may
account for the motions of the branches of trees, which generally
swing backwards and forwards, showing rapid variations in the in
tensity of the wind. During breezes composed of a succession of
strong sudden gusts, it was difficult to estimate the inclination
of the flanges, as each fresh impulse drove the flange beyond the
 angle due to the pressure, and before it had been sufficiently long
oscillating about its true position to allow a correct observation, a
fresh gust would perhaps drive it in a different direction.
   " July 1,9 a.m. — Wind N.E., strong breeze with vertical cur
rents. The position of the flanges was sometimes steady for
many minutes, with a very small inclination; upward currents
appeared to predominate in duration.
   "July 2, before 9 a.m. — Air still and warm, head of vane di
rected to S.E.      After 9 a gentle breeze from E. and E.S.E.,
with an upward tendency.        The disc remained steady at a small
angle,  sometimes    for two minutes    together.    Towards noon the

disc was more steadily upward, while the breeze still continued.
The clouds were observed to move from W.N.W.            At 6.30 p.m.,
a gentle breeze from W.S.W. ; sky covered with light clouds;
steady upward tendency of the current; very little waving of
trees.    The flanges sometimes retained the same inclination for
a quarter of an hour.           8.30 p.m., wind more brisk from
the west, but the disc still steady; sky beginning to become
overcast.
   "July   3, 8 a.m.— Wind S.W. and S. ; air filled with heavy
clouds, floating at comparatively short distances from the earth.
Strong breeze with alternate up and down currents, the down
ward currents lasting but for very short periods.         9.15 a.m.,
wind S.S.E. with light rain. Just before the rain the down
ward currents became more prominent, the clouds moved from
S.W. 10.30 a.m., wind S.S.W. with alternate upward and
downward currents.
   " July 5. — Fine morning, clear
                                        sky, with a few scattered cu
muli ; gentle breeze from S.W., alternating currents upward pre
dominant.      2 p.m. — Cloudy sky, with the air almost still ; slight
vertical currents. Rain from four to seven o'clock. 9 p.m. —
Wind N.N.W., clearing the sky ; temperature rapidly falling,
with downward currents.            Towards midnight the sky was
almost perfectly clear, and the wind more westerly.
   "July 6, 9 a.m. —Very strong breeze from N.W., with vertical
currents and rain. The alternations were sometimes rapid, and
the apparent angle of inclination very great; the disc rarely
continued steady in an inclined position, although it sometimes
remained for long intervals in a perfectly horizontal position,
with a strong wind.      Rain appeared to produce no remarkable
effect on the flanges, for it seemed to be shaken or blown off.
About 3 p.m., the wind was strong and steady from N.N.W.; the
movements of the flange were as follows during the course of a
few minutes : —Downward, 1 1 minute ; upward, 3 niin. ; level, £

with broken masses of cumulo-stratus clouds.        As they appeared
to approach the earth, downward oscillations of the flange be
came more manifest.        Approaching four o'clock the wind blew
irregularly,  with violent and sudden gusts of short duration. At
6£ p.m.,   a strong breeze, with currents having a downward ten
 dency ; towards seven the sky became a little more clear, and the
 currents appeared to be alternately upward and downward, with
 short intervals of 10 or 12 seconds.        At 7.15 p.m. the wind
 was from N.W., with alternate currents, the upward predomi
 nating, while the sky was becoming perceptibly more clear.

426            Prof. Hennessy on   the Vertical Currents
The upward currents were decidedly longer in duration than
at 6 p.m.
   "9^ p.m. —Wind still from N.W. ; upward currents, with
alternating currents at intervals of about one minute.
   " July 1 1 . — Wind W. A beautiful day, with a few light clouds
scattered over the sky.     During the afternoon, up to 5 p.m., a
strong breeze, with very decided upward currents. At short
intervals the disc oscillated, showing a downward tendency.
    "July 14. —Before 9 a.m., the wind was E.S.E. ; a moderate
breeze with downward tendency.         Light clouds were observed
to move in a direction opposed to the wind at the earth's surface.
10.30 a.m., wind S.E. ; an increase of clouds (cumuli); both
vane and disc were oscillating ; downward tendency of currents
was marked.       At 1 o'clock in the afternoon, a fog was seen out
at sea, which, as it approached the shore, ascended in clouds over
Howth.
    " August 6, 10 a.m. —Wind N.E. ; alternate currents, down
ward predominating.        The sky was covered with light clouds,
and the temperature comparatively low.
    " August 20. — An extremely fine and warm day, with a clear
 sky. The air was nearly still ; and the disc continued to indicate
faint and steady upward currents j for the flange continued at an
upward inclination of a few degrees for long intervals, sometimes
exceeding one hour.       The movements of smoke that could be
observed at the same time showed a similar tendency.
    " August 21, 7 a.m. — Wind E.S.E., with no vertical currents ;
after 8, the disc began to move, and the flange was some
times inclined upwards at a very small angle.       It frequently re
mained perfectly level, although a very perceptible breeze was
blowing.     After 10 a.m. the upward tendency became more
manifest, and it generally remained for long intervals inclined
at an angle of from about 5° to 8°.
    " August 24, 5 p.m. —
                             Before and during a heavy shower the
disc exhibited the presence of downward currents.
    " September 3, 8 a.m. — Wind blowing in sudden gusts from
N.E. ; the disc showed vertical currents, chiefly with a downward
tendency; rain followed at about half-past nine."
   5. The few results which were thus recorded seem to show that
the study of the non-horizontal motions of our atmosphere is
desirable, not only among mountainous districts, but that it may
form a portion of our general inquiries under all local circum
stances whatever.     It appears that the wind rarely blows parallel
to the surface of the earth, and that the air, while in rapid motion,
is always undergoing a process of undulation, whereby the direc
tion of the axis of a current at any point above the earth is
changed alternately, so as to be more or less inclined upwards or

                            of   the Atmosphere.                        427
downwards, just as the direction of the wind in azimuth is fre
quently observed to slightly oscillate about its mean position.
We may conclude, therefore, from sect. 3, that the absolute force
of the wind is always a little greater than its horizontal intensity,
as exhibited by the anemometers.
    While such an undulatory motion of the atmospherical currents
may be generally due to the elasticity of the air and the mechani
cal influence of terrestrial irregularities, many of my observations
were such as to clearly show the existence of true upward and
downward currents. In no other way can we account for the
steady inclination of the flanges of the anemoscope at times
when scarcely any horizontal wind was perceptible.         When true
upward     currents   were  prevalent,   the temperature of the air
was usually increasing and the weather fine.          Downward cur
rents seemed to be usually preceded or accompanied by a sudden
decrease of temperature, and these currents themselves usually
preceded rain or unfavourable weather.        Regular alternations of
both classes of currents were usual about noon or the forenoon
of clear days. The explanation of the last circumstance is ex
tremely simple.      It depends upon the manner in which the at
mosphere acquires the greatest part of its heat during the day.
A small portion of the solar heat is immediately absorbed in
passing through the air, but the greater part reaches the ground,
whence it is imparted to the atmosphere immediately touching
jt.   The air so heated expands, and consequently, from its re
duced density,   it tends to penetrate upwards in currents through
the overlying strata, which at the same time fall downwards to
fill up the vacancies.    A  species of convection, analogous to that
seen in  a  boiling or heated mass of liquid,       thus developed in
                                                   is
the air. The trembling of the air, often noticed over steam-
boilers, close to the chimneys of steam-vessels, and even on walls
and gravelled walks heated         by
                                    the mid- day sun,    undoubtedly
                                                          is
 due to the same minute and rapid currents which take part in
this process of aerial convection.
    6. That there are more important vertical currents engaged
 in promoting exchanges between the upper and lower strata of
the atmosphere, within      a short distance from the earth, appears
 manifest from experiments made           me in May 1858*.

 mometers were suspended at different heights, and under different
circumstances of exposure to the supposed currents.           On days
 when the sky was clear, and when, consequently, the direct               in
 fluence of the sun in heating the ground was most decided,- ob
 servations were made every minute, and sometimes every half
 minute, during short intervals. More or less rapid oscillations

428            Prof. Hennessy on   the Vertical Currents
of the mercury were observed. In thermometers freely exposed to
the air, the mercury sometimes rose or fell three degrees Fahren
heit in three minutes. The longest fluctuations did not occupy
more thau six minutes.       The fluctuations diminished the more
the thermometers were protected from the influence of the cur
rents  of air.
    A further confirmation of   these results is found in the Report
 of the Director of the Radcliffe Observatory at Oxford, relative
to the meteorological observations during the year 1857.
    The thermometrical curves exhibited a remarkable serration
during the day-time of the most brilliant months of the year.
This serration entirely ceased during the winter, and on gloomy
days at every season : its intensity seemed to increase with sun
shine.    It is readily explained by the action of small atmosphe
rical currents alternately ascending and descending, the former
producing a sudden and brief elevation of the mercury, and the
latter a sudden and short depression.        The curves referred to
were obtained at the Radcliffe Observatory, by a very beautiful
application of the waxed-paper photographic process ; and the
results here noticed would probably never have been exhibited
by the ordinary observations at stated hours.       I cannot refrain
from remarking that the success which has attended this portion
of the application of photographical registration to meteorology,
has much increased my confidence in its trustworthiness, while
it has inspired a feeling of deep regret at the loss which science
has sustained by the death of Mr. Johnson, to whose able
management and indefatigable labours these and many other
results are mainly due.
    7. To such small currents we may attribute whirlwinds of
more or less magnitude, from those which we often observe on
dusty roads, to the grand and frequently dangerous phsenomena
of the desert.     Mr. Belt, who writes in the Philosophical Maga
 zine for January 1859, presents some very instructive observa
tions on this subject. The ascending currents over dry ground
in the interior of Australia, were frequently observed by him to
carry leaves and dust to the upper regions of the atmosphere.
Often, when travelling over parched plains, this observer saw the
air quivering over the hot ground as if close to the wall of a fur
nace ; suddenly a miniature storm arises, and after a few minutes'
violence it as suddenly ceases, while the quivering of the air is
no longer seen and the atmosphere does not feel oppressive.      All
these phenomena are obviously the results of more or less ener
getic interchanges between masses of air possessing different
temperatures.      The process of convection in this case is not of
a gentle and gradual nature, but takes place with fitful violence.
The phenomena here referred to seem to present on a small

                         of the Atmosphere.                       429
scale the principal features of cyclonic storms and hurricanes.
These are always preceded by inequalities of temperature in the
regions where they occur ; and it is extremely probable that such
inequalities take place in a vertical as well as in a horizontal
direction.   The distribution of watery vapour must at the same
time be affected ; and this would again react upon the equilibrium
of the atmosphere, so as to favour the existence of ascending and
descending currents.      The rapid oscillations of the barometric
column which usually precede hurricanes are thus doubtlessly
connected, not only with variations in the statical pressure, but
also with the irregular influence of vertical and oblique currents,
which at such times disturb the equilibrium of the atmospherical
column over the barometer.
    8. The duration and energy of many of the vertical currents
which came under my observation, were such as to show that
currents of a greater order than those which take place by the
influence of the heated ground immediately beneath are some
times developed among the overlying atmospheric masses. Such
currents being of much greater magnitude than those which would
account for the rapid fluctuations of the thermometer already
noticed, we may refer to them not only great interchanges of
temperature in different strata of the atmosphere, but also a very
efficient part in the production of ordinary winds.     If  an exten
sive portion of the earth's surface becomes more heated than
other surrounding portions, the air will ascend and overflow
above the cooler air resting upon the unheated surfaces.          The
cold air at bottom will at the same time tend to rush inwards, so
as to fill up the vacuum which the ascending currents would
have left above the surface of the heated ground.         As the air
that overflows above does not rush into a vacuum, but penetrates
and mingles with masses of cooler air possessing nearly the same
density, its progress is considerably retarded, while at the same
time some of the vapour which it may contain is condensed so
as to assume a vesicular cloudy form.       A corresponding retar
dation in the motions of the air rushing in from the colder to the
warmer surface below, is also produced from the resistance of the
air lying over the latter. The production of sea- and land-breezes
furnishes a complete and instructive illustration of these remarks.
Many of the upward currents which I observed with the anemo
scope during the summer mornings, were undoubtedly the pre
cursors of the sea-breeze.    Such currents continue to accompany
the production of the land- and sea-winds in a manner that     I have
sometimes been     able to  observe by the  smoke  of  steam-vessels
near the coast. Thus, on a warm day in June 1857,         I observed
the simultaneous existence of the sea-breeze at Kingstown and a
slight motion of a few light clouds from the interior towards the

coast.    A  steam-ship far out at sea was proceeding towards
England, and the smoke was drawn by the gentle breeze into a
streamer extending for miles behind the boat.             The streamer of
smoke appeared straight and perfectly horizontal over the surface
of the water, until it arrived at a point about a quarter of a mile
from the Hill of Howth, when it rose upwards with a gracefully-
curved outline, and it appeared to be gradually diffused in the
air situated vertically over the hill.
   The influence of vertical and oblique currents in the atmo
sphere is not only thus manifest in the comparatively limited and
local phenomena of sea- and land-breezes, mountain winds, and
whirlwinds, but it has also been appealed to in order to explain
the circulation of the great winds of the earth.          Thus Maury, in
his attempt to exhibit the general laws of the great winds, pre
sents a diagram in which ascending and descending currents are
distinctly indicated over different regions of the globe.           Their
agency is also appealed to by other inquirers ; and their principal
seats of action seem to be indicated as the calm regions, that is
to say, the regions where horizontal winds blow with least in
tensity.    Observations with the aid of the anemoscope in the
regions of equatorial and tropical calms would therefore probably
serve to test the accuracy of the general views here alluded to.
The systematic study of the non-horizontal movements of the
atmosphere has scarcely been commenced ; but what little know
ledge we possess of such movements shows that they are so closely
connected with some of the most important phenomena of the
weather, that their further investigation is certain to be attended
with interesting and valuable results.

1.  TN     the very special cases hitherto treated f, we supposed
    A     that the motion of the body was due to the impulse of
a single force P having a certain direction, and we merely deter
mined the percussion Q which the body was capable of producing
against a fixed point presented to it in a peculiar manner.
   It now remains to treat the general question where the motion
of the body is due to the action of any given forces whatever, and
where the percussion is required which this body can produce,
by any one of its points, against any fixed obstacle which it may
encounter.

                         General Problem.
   2.  A free  solid body being animated by given forces, any one of
its points C   suddenly encounters a fixed point which compels the
body to change its motion ; required the direction and magnitude
of the percussion which will be produced upon this obstacle.
   8. The solutionis not difficult to find ; for if we represent the
percussion on the fixed point by Q, it is evident that a force — Q,
equal and contrary to Q, applied to the body at the moment of
the shock, would at that moment precisely destroy the velocity
of the point C.
   In order to obtain the equations of the problem, therefore, it
will suffice to express the condition that, under the influence of
all the given forces, and of the unknown force — Q applied at the
point C, this point of the body acquires a Telocity equal to zero ;
this sole condition being developed, will supply all that is neces
sary for the determination of the magnitude and direction of the
required percussion Q.
                   Development     op  the Solution.
   4. Let us make the three principal axes of the body which
pass through its centre of gravity G our coordinate axes; and
represent by m the mass of the body; by ma.2, m/82, my2 its
three principal moments of inertia ; and by x, y, z tbe coordi
nates of the point C.
   The given forces may be reduced to three forces,
                            ¦^oj   Y0,      Z0,
directed along the three axes,     and to three couples
                            Lq,    M0, N0,
in planes perpendicular to these axes.
   Similarly the unknown force — Q, applied at the point C, may
be decomposed into three forces,
                             X,    Y,    Z,
applied at the centre of gravity G and directed along the three
axes, and into three couples around these axes, whose moments
will be expressed by
                   Yz-Zy,      Zx-Xz,         Xy-Yx.
   5. The system of all the forces is thus reduced          to the three
forces
                     X0+X,       Y0+Y,        Z0+Z,
applied at the centre of gravity along the       axes, and to the three

    6. We have now to find the velocity of the particular point C
under the influence of these forces and couples.
    7. In the first place, the three forces applied to the centre of
gravity impart to every point of the body, and therefore to C,
                                Y0 + Y
the velocities              X

                                                                          v '
along the coordinate axes of x, y, z respectively.
    8. In the second place, the three couples tend to cause the
body to turn around these axes with angular velocities whose
respective values are
      L0+Zy-Y*                Mp+Xg-Zg                N0 +    Y*-Xy

    But it will easily be seen that, in virtue of these three rota
tions, the point C will have, in the directions of the axes of
x, y, z, the velocities
respectively.

 by the given forces which animate the same, combined with the
 unknown force — Q supposed to be applied at the point C itself.

 of the point C, and consequently each of the components x, y, z
 of this velocity will become zero.

 the preceding values of N„ Ny, Nr, D be substituted, the required
 percussion Q will be obtained as a function of the data of the
 problem ; that is to say, of the three arms a,                 inertia of
                                                                       /S,   y    of
 the body, of the given forces and couples X0, Yq, Z0, L0, M0, N0
 which animate           and of the three coordinates x, y, z of the
                         it,
 point   C of  the  body where the obstacle             is
                                                 presented.
    13. The form of the above expressions shows that, in virtue
 of the applied forces and couples, the actual percussion of the
 body     composed of the percussions which would be produced
         is
 upon   the   same point       each of these given forces and couples
                                    if
acted separately, and this should clearly be the case.
    It may also be remarked, that all these general formulae may
be verified         by
                    applying them to the particular cases treated in
the first two chapters.         By so doing the reader may convince
himself of the perfect accordance between our results.
    In conclusion,         will be well to add
                          it                        short remark with
                                                             a
respect to the precise nature of the obstacle considered in the
problem which has just been solved.            It simply fixed point
                                                             is                   a

           supposed     to be capable of suddenly and totally arresting
the point      C of the body which strikes        that it;to say, of reis
taining     for
           it     an  instant  in the same position  in space, just as                      if
this point       of the body had, for an instant, fallen into the. inte
                   C
rior of hollow and resisting sphere of infinitely small radius.
          a
It  must also be borne in mind that, after the shock, this obstacle
is  supposed to disappear entirely; for after the shock the body
merely retains          rotation around
                         a                   spontaneous axis passing

                and therefore becomes incapable of striking an ob
stacle presented at this point.
    By means of its new motion, however, the body             capable of          is
striking with any other point C and the new percussion may be
                                              ;
found from the same formulae on replacing the old forces              the              by
new ones we are thus led naturally to the theory of the singular

of the Dynamical Theory of Gases," in which occurs (see
Prop. X.)    result opposed to an assertion made
               a                                     me in     pre           by        a
viously published paper*.    Having waited in vain for the pro-
                          *     Phil. Mag. February    1859.

        Prof. Clausius on           the   Dynamical Theory             of Gases.        435
mised continuation of Prof. Maxwell's paper,                       I beg   now to forward
my reply.
   In  my paper            I
                     consider the following question : a molecule fi
of a gas moves with a certain velocity in a space which already
contains many other molecules m, m1, m2, . . . , and in so doing
occasionally strikes against and rebounds from the latter;
required the number of collisions made by fi in the unit of time,
or what is equivalent, the magnitude of the mean length of path
between two consecutive points of collision.        In my solution                        I
confined myself to the case where the molecule fi moves, and the
others m, ffi„ . . . remain at rest ; but at the same time asserted                 I
that in the case where the latter molecules also move with the
same velocity as n, the number of collisions increases in the ratio
of 1 :      Idid not prove this assertion, because for the object                         I
then had in view it was not necessary to enter into such parti
culars. Since Prof. Maxwell, however, in his treatment of the
same subject, arrives at the ratio 1 :       instead of 1 : \, I feel
myself called upon to prove the accuracy of my former statement.
   Let us first assume that ft alone moves, whilst m, mv m2 . . .
remain at rest ; and let v be the velocity of fi, N the number of
molecules at rest in the unit of space, and s the magnitude to
which the distance between the centres of /x and any other mo
lecule must be reduced before a collision can occur.   The number
of collisions during the unit of time will then be
                                          V7TS2N.
   If we now assume that the molecules m, mlt ?ns . . . also move,
we must replace the actual velocity v by the relative velocities of
the molecule    with respect to the molecules m, m„ mi...; and
                     //.
since these relative velocities differ from each other, the arith
metical mean of all their values must be taken.      Representing
this mean       by
                 the number of collisions will be
                     r,
                                          r7rs2N,
and consequently the ratio of the number of collisions in the two
cases will be    r.
                 v    :
   Thus far Prof. Maxwell and        agree, so that
                                             I          will not be        it
necessary  to enter  here into the demonstration of the  above for
mulae; we differ only in the determination of the mean value r.
Let u be the velocity of any molecule m, and    the angle between  S
the direction of its motion and that of the molecule       the rela         fi  ;
tive velocity between     and m will then be
                               fi
                                \/uijs-vi— 2uv            cos S.
When the molecules             m,   mv mt   .   .   .   all move with the same velo

city, in other words, when u is constant, and ¦& alone variable
from one molecule to another, the mean value can be easily cal
culated.   According to Prof. Maxwell, the value in question is
                                         r=       •</   u2   + vi;
whence, when u=v, follows r=v^2.           This value    incorrect,                  is
however, as will be seen from the following considerations.
   Since all directions are equally probable for the molecules m,
m„ mv .    .

                ,

                               §    +                   moves will                  fi
have to the whole number of molecules the same ratio that a
spherical zone with the polar angle        and the breadth d§ has  S
to the whole surface of the sphere, in other words, the ratio
                                     2tt sin     S      dd    :   4fir.
The number of such molecules                                 in the unit of volume           is   con
sequently
                                         N   \

In orderto obtain the required mean value      the last expression         r,
must be multiplied             by
                      the relative velocity which corresponds to
it,
  the product integrated between the limits       and nr, and the               o

LIX.     On the Law of the Wave-lengths corresponding to certain
   points in the Solar Spectrum. By Mungo Ponton, F.R.S.E.*
        E first  attempt to find a law regulating the wave-lengtha
         corresponding to definite points in the solar spectrum was
made by Sir Isaac Newton, who chose for investigation the
boundary lines of the seven colours, being the only determinate
points then known.        He adopted as the basis of his law a series
deduced from certain divisions of the musical chord.         The same
series, however, may be obtained in a more palpable manner
from the following geometrical construction.
   Round the point 0 describe a circle, and inscribe the equila
teral triangle J? AD. Draw the diameter AE bisecting the tri-
                                     A
                                    E
angle, and perpendicular to this diameter draw another, X Y.
Draw 0 B bisecting the arc A Y.          Make A C equal to the side
of a pentagon inscribed in the circle, and then divide the arc
A F into three equal portions by the points G and Z.
   Regarding the whole circle as divided into 360 degrees, add
to this amount successively the number of degrees in the arcs
AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FG, and GA, these arcs measuring re
spectively 45, 27, 48, 60, 60, 40, and 80 degrees, thus produ
cing the series 360, 405, 432, 480, 540, 600, 640, 720.           Then
divide this series by the last term, and we obtain the following :
0 5, 0 5625, 0 6, 0-66', 0-75, 0-833', 0 88', and 1, a series from
which the ratios may be deduced in reference to the longest
wave as 1.
   But it is more convenient so to alter the series as to make
1 = the mean wave.         For this purpose draw the diameter z M,

 438          Mr. M. Ponton on        the  Law of the Wave-lengths
 and to 360° add 200, being the number of degrees in the arc
 A M,      bo making 560 ; then dividing, as before, by 720, there
 results 0-77' as the fraction corresponding to the mean wave in
 the foregoing series, which must accordingly be divided by this
 fraction. The quotients, taken in their reverse order, stand
 thus: 1-2857, 1-1428, 1-0714, 0-9643, 0-8571, 0-7714, 0-7232,
 0- 6429, the mean wave being =1.
     The relative wave-lengths, however, as determined by Newton,
 are represented, not by these numbers themselves, but by the
 cube roots of their squares.           The series then becomes 1*1824,
 1- 0931,     1-0470, 0-9761, 0 9023, 0 8411, 0-8057, 0-7449, the
 length of the mean wave being =1.                  The ascertained length of
 this last in air is 0-00002247 decimal parts of an English inch ;
 and the lengths of the others are found by multiplying by this
 quantity the above numbers ; so producing the following series,
 which represents, according to Newton's estimate, the extreme
 wave-lengths between which the different tints of the solar spec
 trum lie, in decimal parts of an English inch :¦—

     This accordingly is the estimate given of these wave-lengths
in all the English works on physical optics.
     The next step in this inquiry was made by Fraunhofer, when
he discovered the fixed lines of the solar spectrum, and deter
mined the wave-lengths corresponding to the points occupied by
the. seven principal lines, which he designated by the letters
B, C, D, E, F, G, H.            His observations are understood to have
been made with most careful accuracy ; and he left on record
two sets of values of these wave-lengths, agreeing as respects B
and D, but differing slightly as respects the other five.                 These
two sets of values, stated in decimal parts of a French inch, the
standard employed by Fraunhofer, are as follow :—

        In the first set this relation does not subsist with nearly the
    same degree of accuracy.
        There     is,
                  however,     relation of more importance which may
                                          a
    be established              by
                           very slight alteration upon the values of
                                     a                                                                   B
    and D. Although the observed values of these two agree in
    both series, neither of them can be regarded as correct to within
    a  ten thousandth part of its magnitude.      Now     altering each                    by
    to  a smaller amount than this proportion, we may establish the
    remarkable relation B5=D6.          Thus the observed value of B5
     (taking seven effective numbers)       1594052               is
                      And that   of  D6     1593953              is

    Dividing this difference, we make each 1594025, which gives
    B = 2540844 (log 404 9780), differing from the observed value
    by  only -0000156, and D =2175112 (log 3374816), differing
    from the observed value       only •0000112.   by                                 As these alterations
    are so trifling, and this relation of BS=D6'                                      isvery convenient,
    there need be no hesitation in adopting                                     it,   and regarding the
    above as the settled values of     and D.               B

too striking to be overlooked, and too important to be thrown
aside, — the more especially as,             in

alterations required to make this progression perfect are very
slight — second advantage which enjoys over its rival. Further,

if in each case we take the sum of the first and middle terms, or

    Thus in both cases the sum is very nearly 3, but considerably
nearer in the first than in the second ; and as o + t=3 is a very
convenient relation, this may be viewed as a third advantage
presented by the first series, which requires only a trifling altera
tion to make it fulfil this condition, as well as that of having
o, 7T, o-,         in arithmetical progression.          These advantages
afforded by the first series overweigh the single advantage fur
nished by the second, of presenting the before-mentioned rela
tion of Fr=£(B? + H?), which is of little comparative value;

442       Mr. M. Ponton on          the Law of  the Wave-lengths
   These differences are so far within the limits of probable errors
of observation, being all of them less than the least of the differ
ences between the- corresponding members of the two observed
series, that there need be no hesitation in admitting them for
the sake of obtaining a series so regular as the foregoing, and
presenting the peculiar advantage of rendering the whole of the
wave-lengths deducible from that of either B or D.
   In all calculations involving these wave-lengths, it will be
found more convenient to adopt, instead of the actual lengths
corresponding to any standard of mensuration, the relative wave
lengths referred to that of B as unity, stating the others in frac
tional parts; thus keeping the numbers independent of any
standard of linear measure.           The wave-lengths and their loga

     This Table shows that the Newtonian values are not recon-
cileable with those of Fraunhofer ; because they make the line B
lie beyond the red, and the line H beyond the violet end of the
 spectrum.     The cause of this discrepancy is traceable to New
ton's having made his observations on an impure spectrum;
 Fraunhofer having been the first to obtain the pure spectrum,
produced by numerous fine equidistant lines, and from which
his wave-lengths were determined.
    It is remarkable, however, that if we adopt Newton's primary
series without subjecting              it,
                              as he did, to the operation of taking

 LX.    On  the Thickness       of the Gust of the Earth. By the Rev.
     Samuel Haughton, F.R.S., Fellow of Trinity College, and
    Professor of Geology in the University of Dublin.
     To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       Gentlemen,
        the April Number of the Philosophical Magazine, Arch
 IN    deacon Pratt replies to my communication published in
December, 1859.
     So far as the controversy           is personal between us, it turns on
 a very simple mathematical question, which                  I   am quite willing
 to leave for the decision of mathematicians.                 I   regret that my
 statements on this subject have not been sufficiently clear, though
 I  endeavoured to make them so, and must therefore beg the
 favour of a few lines on the matter, before entering on the
 other question raised by the present controversy.
              I.   The supposed      "fallacy" in my reasoning.
    For the convenience of reference, I shall call the two equations
 in dispute (A) and (B). Archdeacon Pratt makes the following
statements     : —
            May, 1859.                                     April, 1860.
    " Equation
                  (B)  does   not follow
                                                 " Professor Haughton     ....   re

 In fact equation (B) assumes that            that he has differentiated equation
 the law of density and elliptieity is        (A) right. This      I never called in
 continuous    throughout the whole           question."
 mass, solid and fluid, the solid
 parts lying in strata of the form
 and density they would have if they
 were wholly fluid."
    Archdeacon Pratt now admits that equation (B) may be ob
 tained from equation (A) by differentiation, but he has omitted
 to see that     I  expressly state that equation (B) can only be ap
 plied to the fluid nucleus of the earth, and that                 I so apply it in
 order to diminish by one, the total number of unknown quantities,
 which must become known before the thickness of the earth's
 crust can be determined.             My words are,—
     [Equation B]      "determines        the relation which necessarily exists
 between the law of density and elliptieity of the fluid portions
 of the earth*."
     To prevent further misconception,             I  shall here briefly repro
  duce my argument, intended to show that our speculations on
 the thickness of the earth's crust, if it have a crust at all, are
 essentially hypothetical.

The first of these equations (A,) gives Clairaut's theorem, but
teaches us absolutely nothing of the structure of the interior of

These integrals extend through the fluid nucleus, and are un

446            The Rev. S. Haughton     on the Thickness   of
known, because they depend on its mass, and moments of inertia.
If we assume the law of density, they will both become known,
or at least capable of evaluation, because the ellipticity is a
function of the density, by virtue of equation (B), which belongs
to the fluid nucleus, and to it only.
This integral extends through the crust, and is unknown.              It
can only become known by our being acquainted with the law
of density, and also the law of ellipticity of the layers of the crust,
which are not connected with each other by an equation, as is
the case in the fluid portion of the earth.
   Ifthese preliminary difficulties were overcome, and the values
of the definite integrals known in terms of ax and known
numbers, since ej is also a function of aj (because it is included
 in equation (B) as part of the fluid nucleus), the equation (A2)
would become simply a function of a, and this unknown
 quantity, the radius of the fluid nucleus, might be easily found.
    The hypotheses requisite are the following : —
    1st. The law of density of the fluid portions of the earth.
    2nd. The law of density of the solid portions.
    3rd. The law of ellipticity of the solid portions.

    Of these three essential laws, maintain that we are in igno
rance, and must be content to remain so; and               Ichallenge
Archdeacon Pratt, or any       other person possessed  of " positive"
knowledge of the interior of the earth, to state what these laws
are.     Iam, indeed, well aware that a chance guess of Laplace's as
to the first law, has been considered by some almost an established
law of nature, and     I  would therefore offer a few observations
upon     it,
           to show how improbable       it  that
                                             is    itshould be even
an approximation to the real law of density that prevailed
the layers of earth when altogether fluid, or in the layers of       it in
that are still fluid,if  there be any such.
   Legendre     first applied the following law of density to the
determination of the earth's figure,
                              A
                           p= — sin
                                 .
                                      na,
where —
                               a
        = density of any layer,
  a p   = the equicapacious radius, and
  A, n are constants to be determined.
   Laplace knew well what the meaning of this law was for in    ;
discussing    in the Eleventh Book of the Mecanique Celeste,
               it
he says, " Je vais presentement considerer        la
                                              figure de   terre,la
en la supposant formee  d'un seulfiuide compressible" (Mec< Cel.

                        the Crust of the Earth.                     447
torn. v. p. 48). Mr. Hopkins and Archdeacon Pratt have adopted
this law, although, as it appears to me, it is utterly inconsistent
with the little we do know of the interior of the globe.
    It is in the highest degree probable that the specific gravities
of the successive layers of the globe depend almost altogether
on their chemical composition, which is very varied, and only in
a very slight degree on the pressure to which they are subject ;
and that, consequently, a theory like that of Laplace, which
supposes the chemical composition uniform, and the density to
depend on an assumed law of compressibility, must be rejected,
as a matter of course, by every mathematician who wishes to have
a positive basis of fact for his speculations.       For this reason, I
believe the charge which Archdeacon Pratt has brought against
me, of having attempted
                             " an algebraical, not a physical problem
of densities," might with more fairness be brought against his
own, unauthorized assumption of Laplace's law, which he con
 siders " in itself a very probable law."
     From a consideration of the igneous rocks of various ages of
 the crust of the earth, many geologists have come to the conclu
 sion that the two outer layers of that crust are composed of
 siliceo-felspathic rocks and ferro-calciferous eruptive rocks,having
 average specific gravities of 2*55 and 3'00.         The difference in
 specific gravity of these layers is evidently due to the presence
 of iron in the latter, and has no relation whatever to the pressure
to which they have been subjected.          Such facts as this are com
 pletely ignored by the mei-ely mathematical assumption that the
 whole earth is composed of a homogeneous mass of fluid following
 a supposed law of compressibility.        I believe, therefore, that   I
 am entitled to deny, as a matter of fact, that we possess any
 positive knowledge of the interior of the earth ; and        I shall re
 tain my conviction that     such  knowledge is beyond our reach,
 until it is acquired by some process more legitimate than un
 founded hypotheses, which are contradicted by the few facts that
 actually do come under our observation.
     Before leaving this subject, it is worth while observing that
 Archdeacon Pratt's logic is as peculiar as his mathematics ; for
 while he supposes that he has disposed of my sceptical argument
 by the detection of a supposed fallacy in my mathematics, he
                               I
 omits to perceive that, if were really guilty of the fallacy, it
 would strengthen my argument against our positive knowledge
                                                          I
 of the interior of the globe, as it is plain that if am not en
 titled to use the equation (B) to establish a relation between the
 ellipticity and density of the fluid portion of the globe,      I must
 make an additional hypothesis,          and therefore be forced to
 discuss equations involving four unknown quantities instead of
 three.

448            On the Thickness   of the Crust of the Earth.
II.   Archdeacon   Pralfs   demonstration that the crust   of the earth
                          cannot be very thin.
   Before discussing this question, I would premise that          I am
not an advocate for the idea, held by many physical geologists,
that the earth has a crust, and that its crust is very thin.          I
believe it to be as unphilosophical to maintain it to be thin, as
to hold it to be thick, and that no good reason can be given for
either opinion.
   The following idea of the interior of the earth is one which       I
entertain myself with, but which I have no right to force upon
another, viz. that the earth is cornposedof three layers — of granite,
basalt or diorite, and meteoric iron and nickel, with an immense
cavity in the centre caused by centrifugal force — and that it is
completely solid at present.       This, however, is a speculation, as
unfounded as any of those       I  have attacked; and   I must return
to the demonstration that the earth's crust cannot be very thin.
    This demonstration consists of three parts : —
    1. If very thin, the mountains would fall through.
    2. If very thin, the floor of the oceans would be forced up.
    3. If very thin, a semi-diurnal fracture would be caused by
the tides of the fluid nucleus.
    I  have already shown that Archdeacon Pratt's mode of con
sidering the first of these questions is mechanically erroneous, as
he supposes the mountain mass to be in a state of tension,
whereas it is in a state of compression, and supports itself on the
principle of the arch.
    In the second case, although the floor of the ocean is in a state
of tension, if the voussoirs be supposed to coincide with the radii
of the earth, yet we know so little of the real direction of the
main joints, that it is unsafe to speculate about them, although
their fan-shaped arrangement under the mountain axes would
appear to indicate a provision to sustain the weight, or rather is
itself a consequence of the superincumbent weight.
    I  prefer, however, to deny the validity of Archdeacon Pratt's
proof on the following grounds. As we know nothing of the
interior of the earth,   I  am as well entitled as any other person
to make hypotheses, and I accordingly make the following : —
    1 . The mountain chains float, like icebergs, on the surface of
the fluid nucleus, having deep roots penetrating far down into
the denser fluid below.
    2. The liquid displaced by the roots of the mountains, finds
lodgement in cavities scooped out under the floors of the deep
oceans, thus restoring the hydrostatical equilibrium of the crust,
which is thinnest under the oceans, and thickest under the
mountains.

      3. The effect of the tide caused by the sun and moon is ren
dered insensible at the surface by the great viscosity of the
liquid at the bounding surface, which can only be called a fluid
by courtesy. This viscosity distributes and destroys the pressure.
      Let the foregoing hypotheses be assumed, which are quite as
likely as any hitherto adduced, and it follows easily that the
earth's crust, if it have one at all, need not exceed ten miles in
thickness.

      In conclusion, would observe that in this controversy I have
 a natural advantage of position, which I am not prepared to re
 linquish.      I  deny our knowledge of the interior of the globe ;
 on this subject I maintain that our ignorance is absolute and
 necessary. If Archdeacon Pratt possesses peculiar sources of in
 formation on this subject, let him give us the benefit of his
 knowledge ; but he may rest assured that something more is
 necessary than reiterated assertion, and that to accuse an oppo
 nent of a fallacy which has no existence but in his own miscon
  ception of a mathematical principle, neither convinces others, nor
  advances his own cause.

  LXI.      On a new Theoretical Determination   of the Velocity of Sound.
             By  the Rev. Samuel Earnshaw,        M.A., Sheffield.
        To  the Editors of  the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
          Gentlemen,
   II   AM perfectly     aware the problem of the propagation of sound
          is considered to have been solved; but notwithstanding this
      venture to offer the following new solution to the notice of the
  philosophic world ; because it not only leads to a numerical result
   quite different from any before obtained from theory, and agree
   ing better with experiment, but likewise furnishes some new
   results of an unexpected character, and affords besides a glimpse
   into a department of nature which has hitherto remained her
    metically sealed. Laplace's ingenious suggestion of a change of
   temperature due to a sound-wave, brought the result of theory so
    very near to that of experiment, that it has been thought un
    reasonable to require a closer agreement.        But it is confessed
    that the experiment by which "the effect of a change of tem
    perature is obtained is one that is remarkably difficult to manage,
    — one also in which errors of observation are greatly magnified
    in the result : this i3 shown to be so, from the great differences
    between the results of different experimentalists ; and       I think I
    may say that the requisite value      of the coefficient    (commonly

450            The Rev. S. Earnshaw on         a new Theoretical
denoted by k) is much greater than Dalton's experiments warrant,
and than what would have been conjectured apriori to be its value.
In looking also at the determinations of its value, and also of the
value of the velocity of sound,          I
                                    am a little suspicious that modern
experimentalists have suffered themselves to be biassed by a de
sire to make experiment and theory agree.           At any rate, if we
compare experiments made since 1816, when Laplace announced
his theorem for the correction of Newton's result, with those
previously made, it is impossible not to notice a very sudden and
startling change ; and in the same spirit the value of k has been
gradually growing in the hands of experimentalists till it is now
large enough really to justify the opinion which has been ex
pressed, that to Laplace is due the honour of having completed
the solution, which was begun in England, of the problem of the
propagation of sound.        And, to speak candidly, it must be con
fessed that Laplace's sagacious suggestion undoubtedly has the
air of a vera causa, although it requires a larger development
of heat by the sound-wave than seems probable.            But its great
defect,  ifI   may  be  allowed to  consider it defective, is that the
result it gives does not come up to experiment.         The theoretical
velocity,   after being  amended   by  Laplace's  suggestion, still falls
short of the experimental velocity by 24 feet, if we take this last
to be 1090 feet ; and by 76 feet, if we take the velocity of sound
to be 1142 feet as determined by Derham, Flamsteed, Halley,
and the Florentine Academicians.         It should be remembered also
that theory might apriori be expected to give a result exceeding,
rather than falling short of, experiment ; for theory assumes the
elasticity and fluidity of the atmosphere to be perfect, and we
have reason to think both are really in a slight degree im
perfect ; and this is not likely to accelerate, but rather to retard
(if
 it    at all affect) the propagation of sound-waves.      Upon the
whole, after considering the matter in as impartial         spirit asa
possible, candour obliges me to confess that Laplace's suggestion
does not furnish     a
                       sufficient cause.   do not deny that
                                              I                  may      it
be a   cause but
            ;        it    not the whole.
                          is                There        cause, still
                                                           is   a
unrevealed, for the defect of the theoretical velocity.        Euler
considered that some part of the error of theory might be due
to the incorrectness       of analysis       in assuming   (-r   )   =1 previ
ously to integrating the differential equation  and certainly, as
                                                      ;
this was an arbitrary step,   was reasonable to suppose
                                    it                     might      it
in some way have the effect of making the theoretical result
smaller than    would be were the equation integrated without
                it
making use of approximative steps. When therefore            suc
ceeded in integrating       without approximative steps,
                               it                             was        I I

wave remained          the same as before.                     This caused me to examine
 the question of the propagation of waves in an elastic medium
 ab initio ; and the result is that            have,      I              I
                                                       believe, detected a
 flaw in the problem as previously treated, which being remedied,
 there results from theory a value of the velocity of sound which
 agrees accurately with the experimental value found by Pictet,
 and with the following remark of Young : — " From a com
 parison of the accurate experiments of Derham, made in the
 daytime, with those of the French Academicians, made chiefly at
 night, it appears that the true velocity of sound is about 1130
feet in a second;" and this agrees exactly with the value which
I   obtain by the theory, which I will now proceed to lay before
 your readers.
     1. There is a fundamental difference in the mechanical actions
 of two elastic media, one of which is supposed to be continuous,
 and the other to consist of particles separated by finite intervals.
 Let A Z be an elastic medium ; divide it
 by imaginary planes into extremely thin
 slices D, E, F, . . . , bo thin that each con
 tains only one layer of particles ; in other
 words, the thickness of the slices will be a..
 equal to the distance between the particles
 of the medium. Now according to the
 common solution of the problem of sound,
 the medium is supposed to be continuous ;
                                                                              by
     G) is,
 that      any slice (as      F)  pressed upon only
                                   is                        the two slices
 (E,      with which     it  in immediate contact.
                              is                         And, correspond
 ing to this, any slice (F)        supposed to exert no direct pressure
                                     is
 on any slices beyond the two (E,             with which
                                                      G)         in contact.     it    is
 Hence all the motion which any one slice (F) has,                  received            it
 from one of its immediate neighbours (E), and transmits                                               it
 wholly to the other (G). This             the system of medial action
                                                     is
 supposed in the investigation of the differential equation of sound
 as commonly given.
     But this supposes molecular action to extend from any one par
 ticle to those only which are nearest to — supposition for which
                                                              it,   a
 there  is  no foundation whatever in nature.                 certain, how   It   is
 ever,  that molecular action    extends  to very    small  finite

 and therefore enables molecules which are separated                     any                     by
 distance not exceeding that, to act on each other.              Hence any

452                 The Rev. S. Eamshaw on                 a new   Theoretical
 molecular action.     This is the system of medial action supposed
 in the investigation which I have to produce.
     2. It is to be noticed, also, that when the medium is supposed
to be continuous, the whole force exerted on F on one side is
 supposed to be exerted by the slice E, and on the other by the
 slice G; but on the other supposition, these forces are distri
buted among the slices E, D, C . . . on one side, and G, H, . . .                     I
on the other, according to some rapidly decreasing law, which
we shall have to determine.         Consequently the force which on
the first supposition is exerted by one slice (E) upon F, is on the
latter hypothesis exerted by E, D, C . . . unitedly ; so that the
force in the former case exerted by E alone is equal to the sum
of the forces exerted by E, D, C . . . in the second case.
     3. Let z be the distance of any slice D from F, and let H be
at the same distance on the other side of F. Then we may repre
sent by mj\z) the force exerted by either of the slices D, H on a
particle in F.     Hitherto we have supposed the medium in equi
librium, let it   now  be in a state of motion ; and for simplicity
let us suppose all the particles in any slice to be in the same state
of disturbance.      Denote by           the disturbances of the-slices
I), F,   H  at the time  t.  Then   the whole force exerted by D and
H on a particle of the slice F
     =mf{z + x—xl)—mf(z+xl—x) = —mf'(z)                              .   {xl—2x+x1},
neglecting powers of x— z, and                      a.'   — x above the
                                                        first.  Now
this step supposes that the relative displacements of any two par
ticles which are within the sphere of each other's action,        so                  is
small in comparison of their distance from each other, that the
square and higher powers of       may be neglected.
                                       it               The absolute
displacements may be of any magnitudes, subject to this con
dition.   Our results will therefore not be limited to small abso
lute motions, but to small relative motions of particles within the
sphere of each other's action.      Let now      be the thickness of

ears, X is immensely larger than h; and consequently for all
 audible sounds,             =1,     ? = 1,   &c. ; and hence the velo-

organs of hearing, though not absolutely the same, is sensibly the

From this formula we learn that every slice produces a term in
the expression for the velocity, so that there are as many terms
in the expression for the velocity as there are slices within the
radius of the sphere of action of any one particle.
   6. From arts. 2 and 3 it is evident that the whole force exerted
upon a particle of the slice F by all the slices on one side of F
is mf(h) + mf{2h) + mf{3h) +         and this is therefore the force
which we must suppose concentrated in the slice E, and an equal
force in the slice G, on the hypothesis of continuity.     Hence if

This put into numbers, taking                       to be equal to 916 feet,
gives the velocity of sound equal to 1130 feet.
   Thus we see that the error committed in calculating the velo
city of sound, was not the leaving out the consideration of
the development of heat, but the supposing the medium of air
to be continuous.          I am surprised to find the result so much
affected by*a circumstance which appears trifling, — and the more
so, as the radius of the sphere of sensible molecular action is
known to be, though finite, very small.                     The assumption of
continuity     is  therefore  by  no  means    so   allowable     as we should be
inclined     a priori to suppose ; and its effect on the motion of an
elastic medium is very much greater than was to be expected.

LXII.      On   a new   kind  of Electric    Current.      By G. Quincke*.
                   the above title, the fifth Number of Poggendorff's
UNDER     Annalen      for 1859 contains an article of considerable
length,    the   leading points in which are contained in the follow
ing abstract.
  When pure water flows through a porous body, an electrical cur
rent is elicited, —a fact established by the following experiments.
   A plate of burnt clay is luted with sealing-wax between two
glass tubes of 25 millims. diameter (fig. 1), whose ends are
worked down smooth.              A                       Fig. \_

melted into the side of the

those wires, the wires themselves being connected with the ter
minals of a sensitive multiplier furnished with astatic needles.
The tubes A and B are made smaller at the ends, for the conve
nience of connecting them with other tubes.                    The apparatus is
now filled with distilled water, care being taken that no air

456        M. G. Quincke on     a new kind of Electric Current.
remains in the clay plate. If, then, either by suction at B or by
some pressure at A, the fluid is driven from A to B through the
clay plate, there is indicated, at the instant the now of the fluid
begins, a deflection of the needles, due to an electric current
passing from A towards B. The platina plate B, then, on which
the current strikes last, behaves like the platina plate of a Grove's
element.     As soon as the passing of the water ceases, the needle
returns to its place, a polarization- current, however, in a contrary
 sense to the primary current and to the flow of the fluid, being
 called forth.
    On changing the direction of the flow of the water, as by
 means of suction at A, the multiplier indicates an electrical cur
 rent passing in the fluid from B towards A.
    As with this form of the apparatus the flow of the fluid strikes
 the plates dissimilarly, thus causing a want of precise similarity
 in their conditions, the modification of the apparatus shown in
 fig. 2, by which the flow of the fluid is not directed against the
 platina plates at all, was arranged for the subsequent experiments.
     With this view the tubes A, B of fig. 1 were closed at the end,
 and two narrower tubes, C, D of fig. 2, were adapted to the side
 between the open end of
 the tubes and the platina
 plates. With this arrange
 ment     the fluid against
 the plates remained un-
 changed, while the water                  s       ^        3~
 flowed through C, the diaphragm, and D.
     The pressure employed varied, according to the diaphragm
  used, from a third of an atmosphere to three atmospheres.
     Instead of the clay plate, other porous bodies were placed
  between the tubes A and B of fig. 2 ; and the multiplier always
  indicated a current coinciding with the flow of the fluid, and
  which lasted as long as that flow did. On its ceasing, there was
  a more or less strong polarization-current in a contrary direction
  to the primary one.
     The substances thus examined were, —
                Silk,                       Sulphur,
                Linen,                      Burnt clay,

                Lime-wood,                  Platina,
                Oak,
   which were applied in the following way.

            M. G. Quincke   on a new kind         of Electric   Current.       457
    Some thirty layers of thin silk stuff were placed over each
other and attached over the tube A of the apparatus ; the tube
B was then adapted against the former, and the part separating
them covered thickly with sealing-wax.        Owing to the wide
pores of the silk, considerably more water flowed through under
equal pressure than when the clay plate was employed.         The
linen was    used in the same manner.
    The other substances were applied in the form of powder, in a
glass tube of the diameter of the tubes A and B of fig. 2.    The
ends of these tubes, the length of which varied, according to the
substance employed, from 20 to 45 millims., were ground flat,
and over them were placed discs of the silk stuff spoken of, to
prevent the flow of the fluid carrying away particles of the sub
stance under examination.      In the case of Bunsen's coal the
tube was closed with plates thereof.
     Platina was made use of in the spongy form, iron as filings.
 The glass had been reduced to powder on an anvil. Ivory and
the various kinds of wood were employed in the form of sawdust.
 It was endeavoured in vain to press water through a porous
 plate of wood, for the plate had to be luted in dry; and on
 becoming moist, even if cut perpendicular to the direction of the
 fibres, it warped so much that it broke the sealing-wax or the
tube.
    The direction of the electric current was not changed by add
ing acids or solutions of salts to the distilled water, but it was
considerably weakened thereby.
   For instance, on using a new clay plate 3-9 millims. thick,
and pressing distilled water through            the needle of the multi
                                                  it,
plier was  deflected  up  to the  stop    on
                                          :   the  addition of four drops
of pure hydrochloric acid to         apint and three-quarters of the
water, the deflection of the needle did not, under the same pres
sure as before, exceed 15 or 20 degrees.              further addition of
                                                          A
twelve drops of acid weakened the        electric, current so much, that
a far greater pressure had to be applied to deflect the needle at
all.    If
         the acid amounted to 16 per cent, of the fluid employed,
no deflection whatever was observed, even under               pressure of
                                                                   a
three atmospheres.       On adding alcohol to the distilled water,
the deflection of the needle was increased.
   The question arises, what      is    that causes these electric cur
                                       it
rents   ?    If
            the tubes   A  and   B of fig.    are luted together without
                                                  1
any clay plate between them, and            stream of water
                                              a                    passed is
through them,      no  deflection    is observable     in the  multiplier.
Hence        seen that the presence of
            it   is                        diaphragm necessary
                                                      a              is
for the manifestation of an electric current.
   The law that obtains in all these experiments may be stated
concisely in these terms —   :

      The electromotive force which is developed         when a certain pres
 sure forces pure water through a clay plate,            is independent of the
 size and thickness of the plate, and also of            the amount of water
 that has flowed through, but is proportional             to the pressure  em
ployed.
     The multipliers used for these experiments were such as are
 employed by M. E. du Bois-Reymond in his researches in organic
 electricity.    In one of the instruments the wire was wound no
 less than 33,000 times round the frame, in the others 10,080
 and 600 respectively.
     In a subsequent Number of PoggendorfFs Annalen (Part 1 1
 for 1859), M. Quincke announces that he has since discovered
 that, by using flowers of sulphur as a porous diaphragm, the
 electromotive force, all other circumstances remaining equal, is
 incomparably greater ; and that this substance is therefore better
 suited than burnt clay for forming a diaphragm-apparatus, so
 that now there will be no further difficulty in demonstrating
 these electrical currents under moderate pressures.               The sulphur
 which was mentioned in the original paper as being used for a
 porous plate, was roll-sulphur ground to powder in an agate
 mortar, as were also the talc and the graphite. At the close of
 his supplementary notice, M. Quincke remarks that he has been
 able to establish the two following facts with respect to these
 electrical currents ; first, that they produce chemical decomposi
tion ; and secondly, that they afford evidence of free electricity.

    The apparatus used in the following experiments, was described in
my Paper ; but in the present instance, only two of the cells were
employed, viz. that exposed to ordinary white light, and that from
which all light is excluded.       In order more effectually to prevent
the possible admission of light, the following precautions were adopted
with the dark cell : — 1. The perforated zinc floor was covered with
thick brown paper. 2. The under surface of the lid was lined with
black cloth, to secure accurate adjustment when shut.                  3. The
opaque black glass was covered with an additional coat of black oil-
paint.    4. The lid was never opened in any light except that of a
candle or of gas.

Dr. Dobell on the Influence of Light on               the Growth of Animals. 459
   March 20th, 1859. — A number of ova of the Silkworm (Bombyx
mori), all of the same age, were placed in each of the two cells. No
change was observed until May \%th (sixty days after the commence
ment of the experiments), when one larva emerged from the ovum
in each cell ; and during twelve days, larva; continued to emerge in
the light and in the dark at the same rate.
   June 9th. — Sixteen larvae, as nearly as possible of the same size,
were selected in each cell, and the rest removed. The experiments
then proceeded with these thirty-two individuals,                         and no death
occurred from first to last.
   The following Table shows the day on which each larva began to

   From this it is seen that the mean period occupied by the meta
morphosis in the darkened cell was eighteen days fifteen hours, and
in the light cell seventeen days sixteen hours.
   The longest and shortest periods in the darkened cell twenty-two
days and seventeen days, in the light cell nineteen days and seven
teen days.
   June 9th. — On selection of sixteen of the largest larvse from the
inhabitants of each cell, it was noted that, when sixteen were selected
from the darkened cell and several of similar size removed, only
four could be found as large in the white cell, the remaining twelve
selected were therefore of a rather smaller size.                    This difference in
the two cells became less obvious afterwards, but, throughout the
experiments, there was a slight difference of size in favour of the
darkened cell.
   With these exceptions, no difference could be detected between the
results obtained in the cell from which light was completely excluded
 and in that exposed to its full influence.

     In several previous communications I have submitted to the Royal
 Society the results which            I have obtained in examining the deport
 ment of triethylphosphine with dibromide of ethylene, as the proto
 type of diatomic bromides.                I have shown that the final product of
 this reaction is a diatomic salt corresponding to two molecules of
 chloride of ammonium.
     The further prosecution of the study of triethylphosphine in this
 direction has led me to investigate the derivatives generated by the

In order to avoid the inflammation of the phosphorus-base, small

of the reaction vary with the relative proportions of the two sub

   By adding gradually crystals of iodoform to a moderate bulk of
triethylphosphine until a new addition produces no longer an eleva
tion of temperature, a viscous mass of a clear yellow colour is obtained,
which, when treated with alcohol, changes to a white powder of cry
stalline aspect ; these crystals are easily soluble in water, difficultly
soluble in alcohol, and insoluble in ether. Two or three crystalliza

        This formula represents the iodide of methyl-triethylphosphonium,
     which was formerly obtained by M. Cahours and myself, by acting
     with iodide of methyle upon triethylphosphine.
        The alkaline liquid, obtained by the action of oxide of silver upon
     the tri-iodide, when saturated with hydrochloric acid, yields no longer
     the platinum salt, difficultly soluble in water but soluble in hydro
     chloric acid. In a dilute solution no precipitate whatever takes
     place, and only after considerable evaporation well-defined deep
     orange-yellow octahedrons are deposited, which contain

          From   these results it is obvious that the triphosphonium-salt,
     when submitted to the action of oxide of silver, passes over into a
     monophosphonium-compound.          The latter is not the sole product of
     the reaction ; I have already alluded to the viscous deliquescent
     substance which accompanies the iodide of methyl-triethylphospho
     nium.     This is an iodide which, in the solution produced by the
     action of oxide of silver upon the original tri-iodide, exists in the form
     of oxide. The latter substance is easily recognized by evaporating
     the solution of oxide of methyl-triethylphosphonium,        and adding a
     concentrated solution of potassa, when the oily globules characteristic
     of the dioxide of triethylphosphonium        separate, which disappear
     immediately on addition of water.

   I  have satisfied myself that chloroform and bromoform act like
iodoform upon triethylphosphine.
   The phosphorus-base acts, even at the common temperature, upon
tribromide of allyle.       The mixture of the two bodies solidifies into a

me to extend my experiments to tetratomic             bodies.    The chloride of

hydrogen in marsh-gas, appeared to promise accessible results.                 On
submitting this body, remarkable for its great indifference under
ordinary circumstances, to the influence of triethylphosphine,             I have
observed with astonishment a most powerful reaction.                 Every drop
of triethylphosphine which is poured into the chloride of carbon,
hisses like water falling upon red-hot iron.           On cooling, the mixture
solidifies into a mass of white crystals, which will be the subject of a

    The following communication was read : —
    " Comparison of some recently determined Refractive Indices with
Theory."       By the Rev. Baden Powell, M.A., F.R.S. &c.
   In a series of papers inserted in the Philosophical Transactions
(1835, 1836, 1837), and afterwards, in a more correct and complete
form, in my Treatise * On the Undulatory Theory applied to the Di
spersion of Light' (1841), I endeavoured to investigate the great
problem of the explanation of the unequal refrangibility of light on
the principles of the undulatory theory, as proposed by M. Cauchy
about 1830, by numerical comparison with the indices observed,
more especially in cases of the most highly dispersive media then
examined.
   The general result then arrived at was, that while the theory
applied perfectly through an extensive range of media of low and
moderate dispersive power, it did not apply well to those of higher ;
and to the highest in the scale (which of course formed the true
test of the theory) it did not apply within any allowable limits of
accuracy.      Since that time little has been done towards prosecuting
the subject.
   In the experimental part of the inquiry, about 1849, I had ob
served the indices for a few new media* ; but these were not high in
the scale ; yet though perhaps thus of little importance,             I have now
thought it as well to go through the calculation for them : the
results are of the same general character as just described.
   Soon after, finding that my friend, the Rev. T. P. Dale, F.R.A.S.,
was desirous to carry on some researches               of this kind,     I placed
at his disposal the apparatus with which I had determined all my
indicesf.
   In 1850 that gentleman communicated             to the Royal Astronomical
Society   a short  general   account    of his observations   % relative to some
substances not very high in the scale.

464                            Royal Society : —
    In  1858,   Mr. Dale, in conjunction with Dr.     J.  H.Gladstone, F.R.S.,
presented     to the  Royal Society*    a valuable    series  of determinations,
evincing highly interesting      results  relative  to the   change of refractive
power    in various   substances  under   different   temperatures.
    None of these media being high in the scale, they have little
bearing on the main object of my inquiries. In two cases (viz. water
and alcohol) the indices agree so closely with mine, that it was not
worth while to recalculate them. In two other cases have carried  I
out the numerical comparison, which affords a good agreement with
the theory.
    Very recently the same gentlemen have, however, published some
observations on several other media, especially phosphorus, a sub
stance at the very summit of the scale, for which               I had long been
extremely desirous to obtain some determinations of indicesf .
    Among these results only two sets are in a form in which they can
 be made available for comparison with theory. These are the indices
 for the standard rays in bisulphide of carbon, and for solution of phos
 phorus in that medium, which I have now calculated theoretically.
    The results (given in the sequel) in both cases indicate discre
pancies between theory and observation too great to be due to any
reasonable allowance for error ; and we are confirmed in the con
clusion before arrived at, that, for highly dispersive substances, the
 theory, in its present state, is defective.
    But these comparisons are all made by means of the same formula
 employed in my former researches, viz. that derived from Cauchy's
 theory by Sir W. R. Hamilton, which he communicated to me, and
 which    I explained in a paper in the Philosophical Magazine J.
     Considering the unsatisfactory condition in which the question
 was left when tried by the test of the higher media in my former
 inquiries, it is a matter of some surprise that in the long interval
 since the publication of those results no mathematician has been in
 duced to revise the theory.        Some criticisms indeed were advanced
 by Mr. Earnshaw§, and others by Prof. Mosotti and the Abbe
 Moigno||, bearing on the general principle.              Sir W. R. Hamilton's
 formula in particular was founded on certain assumptions con
 fessedly but approximate.          It remains then a promising field for
 inquiry to analysts, whether a better formula might not be deduced,
 or other improvements made in the general theory, by which a
 method applying so well to lower cases might be made equally
 successful for the higher.

    In  the first of these media the differences are greater than can be
fairly allowed to errors of observation.
    In the second case it is yet more clearly apparent that the theory
is defective. The ray C was not observed ; but the theoretical index
is evidently in error to a large amount, as it is even lower than that
of B. The indices for D and C are perhaps within the limits of
error ; but that of E is too much in defect to be allowed.

     1. "Notes about Spitzbergen in 1859."           By James Lamont,
 Esq., F.G.S.
     Mr. Lamont cruised about the southern coasts of Spitzbergen in
 his yacht during the summer and autumn of 1859. He first visited
 Edge's Land, which is composed of horizontal strata of limestone,
 shale, and sandstone, with some coal.           One of the glaciers on
 this coast has a frontage of 30 miles.         Deeva Bay was explored
 throughout.      Black Point yielded some Carboniferous fossils. The
 Thousand Isles are composed of greenstone, sometimes columnar.
 Stour Fiord and Walter Thymen's Straits were next visited. The
 shores consist of the same kind of horizontal strata, with trap-rocks.
 Bell Sound and Ice Sound on the west coast, were also examined ;
 the former has high hills of grey fossiliferous limestone all round it ;
 the fossils, as determined by Mr. Salter, prove to be all Carboni
 ferous.     At various points on the coast and islands of southern
 Spitzbergen Mr. Lamont found bones of whales at elevations of 10
 to 100 feet above the sea, and at distances of from a few yards to
 half a mile inland. The bones are sometimes imbedded in banks
 or moss.      Drift-wood (pine) also abounds ; some of it lies 30 feet
 above high-water-mark.
     In the supplement to this paper, Mr. Horner supplied a descrip
 tion of the rock-specimens brought from northern Spitzbergen by
 Parry and Foster in 1827. From the evidence thus afforded it
 appears that the islands and mainland about the entrance of Waigatz
  Straits consist of granitic and gneissic rocks with quartz-rock and
 crystalline limestones, — possibly the altered equivalents of the
  Carboniferous sandstones and limestones of southern Spitzbergen.
 A list of the recent shells sent by Mr. Lamont from Spitzbergen
 was supplied by Mr. Woodward.            Prof. Huxley gave the result of
 his examination of the bones — chiefly whale, white whale, and
 walrus.     Mr. Prestwich described the gravels from Bell Sound—
  which consist chiefly of clay-slate, hornblende-slate, and mica-slate.
  Lastly Mr. Salter determined the following fossils — from the grey
 limestone of Bell Sound, Athyris or Spirifer, a large species,
 Productus costatus, P. Humboldtii, P. mammatus and another species
  of Productus, Camarophoria, Spirifer Keilhavii, Streptorhynckus
  crenistria, Zaphrentis ovibos, Stenopora, Syringopora, Fenestella,
 specimens of a new genus allied to the last, and some Sponges ; —

Nucula,     a small Aviculo-pccten, and Spiri/er.      A large Aviculo-
pecten     probably from the same locality also occurs ; and one
weathered block of white limestone, perhaps from Bell Sound, yields
Spiri/er alatus, a small Productus like the P. horridus figured by
De Koninck as brought from Spitzbergen by M. Robert, and a large
foliaceous Stenopora.         These last, with a specimen of Spiri/er
cristatus, on another loose block, are the only forms having a
Permian aspect in the collection made by Mr. Lamont.
    2. " On the so-called Wealden Beds at Linksfield, and the
Reptiliferous Sandstones of Elgin." By C. Moore, Esq., F.G.S.
    When visiting the section at Linksfield, near Elgin, in the
autumn of 1859, the author recognized a similarity of appearance
between the shales and thin limestone-bands at Linksfield and those
of the Bone-bed series (at the base of the Lias) at Pylle Hill, near
Bristol, at Aust Passage and at Penarth, on the Severn, and at the
Uphill cutting on the Great Western Railway. Giving in detail
 the sections at Pylle Hill and at Linksfield, the author pointed out
 some close lithological resemblances, and stated that he recognized
 the " white lias," the " Cotham marble," the " bone-bed," and the
 gypseous clay-bands of the south in the quarry at Linksfield.
 Cyprides, Estheriec, remains of Hybodus, Lepidotus, Acrodus, and
 Plesiosaurus, Mytilus, Modiola, Vnio, and Cyclas, from the Links-
 field beds, were among the palaeontological evidences which the
 author brought forward as supporting his correlation of the beds in
 question.
     He next offered some observations on the red layer of clay, sand,
 and stones intercalated between the Linksfield shales and the corn-
 stone, and, not accepting Capt. Brickenden's opinion of its having
 been thrust in by the action of ice against the escarpment during
 the formation of the boulder-clay, he suggested that an early glacial
 period, contemporaneous with the Lower Lias, destroyed some of
 the lower shales and limestone of Linksfield, leaving their remnants
 imbedded in a red drift to be covered by the succeeding undis
  turbed deposits of the bone-bed series.
     Mr. C. Moore next remarked that the Cornstone at Linksfield,
  on which all the above-mentioned beds rest, might possibly be of
 Triassic date, as he had observed on the flanks of the Mendips and
  elsewhere a stone of a similar aspect, belonging to the Trias, and
  occasionally yielding remains of Reptiles and Fishes ; to this rock the
  author refers the druidical stones of Stanton Drew.       Some observa
 tions on the discovery of reptilian and mammalian teeth in a Triassic
  deposit near Frome, by the author, on the possible relations of
  some of these to the Reptilia found in the Lossiemouth sandstone,
  and on the probable Secondary age of the latter, concluded the paper.

     NEW SECONDARY TILE OF GREAT POWEK.               BY M.   G. PLANTE.
   TACOBI proposed recently the use of secondary electric currents for
  *J telegraphic purposes, and Plante had suggested the substitution
  of electrodes of lead for those of platinum in these batteries. A more

                Intelligence  and Miscellaneous   Articles.           469
extended study has convinced him of their use.            He states that
a battery with electrodes of lead has 2| times the electromotive
force of one with electrodes of platinized platinum, and six times as
great as that of one with ordinary platinum.     This great power arises
from the powerful affinity which peroxide of lead has for hydrogen,
a fact first noticed by De la Rive. The secondary battery which he
recommends has the following construction.            It consists of nine
elements, presenting a total surface of ten square metres. Each
element is formed of two large lead plates, rolled into a spiral
and separated by coarse cloth, and immersed in water acidulated
with one-tenth sulphuric acid. The kind of current used to excite
this battery depends on the manner in which the secondary couples
are arranged.      If they are arranged so as to give three elements of
triple  surface,  five small Bunsen's cells, the zincs of which are im
mersed to a depth of seven centimetres, are sufficient to give, after a
few minutes' action, a spark of extraordinary intensity when the
current is closed. The apparatus plays, in fact, just the part of a
condenser ; for by its means the work performed by the battery, after
the lapse of a certain time, may be collected in an instant. An idea
of the intensity of the charge will be obtained by remembering that
to produce a similar effect it would be necessary to arrange 300
Bunsen's elements of the ordinary size (13 centimetres in height),
so as to form four or five elements of 3 | square metres of surface,
or three elements of still greater surface.    If the secondary battery
be arranged for intensity, the principal battery should be formed
of a number of elements sufficient to overcome the inverse electro
motive force developed.       For nine secondary elements about fifteen
Bunsen's cells should be taken, which might, however, be very small.
    From the malleability of the metal of which it is formed, this battery
is readily constructed ; by taking the plates of lead sufficiently thin,
a large surface may be placed in a small space.        The nine element*
used by Plant6 are placed in a box 36 centimetres square, filled with
liquid once for all, and placed in closed jars ; they may also be kept
charged in a physical cabinet, and ready to be used whenever it is
desired to procure, by means of a weak battery, powerful discharges
of dynamic electricity. — ComptesRendus, March 26, 1860.
 NOTE ON THE USE OF SULPHATE OF LEAD IN VOLTAIC COUPLES.
    M. Edm. Becquerel describes a modification of the sulphate of
lead battery invented by his father, M. Becquerel.
    Sulphate of lead has the property, when it is made into a paste
 with a saturated solution of chloride of sodium, of becoming hard
and compact ; other chlorides exert a similar action. Cylinders may
be moulded of this paste, if a rod of copper, lead, tin-plate,          or
even of gas-coke be placed in the centre. These cylinders, when dry,
are permeable to a liquid conductor in which they are placed, and in
contact with zinc form a constant current.           Plates may also be
 formed of this substance ; and when placed at the bottom of a vessel
 resting on a conducting support of copper, lead, or tin-plate, a piece
 of zinc being suspended above them, and the vessel filled with aci-

dulated water or solution of chloride of sodium, a constant couple
with a single liquid is formed, without a diaphragm.            But usually
the cylindrical form, combined with the use of a cloth or porcelain
diaphragm, is preferable.
    All samples of sulphate of lead are not alike, probably from the
presence of foreign admixtures ; some become very hard, others do
not acquire a sufficient resistance.     Without knowing on what this
depends,   a  mixture   of 1 00  grammes  of dried and pounded sulphate
of lead, 20 to 30 grammes of chloride of sodium, and 50 cubic centi
metres of saturated solution of chloride of sodium, gives good re
sults : the addition of 20 to 25 grammes of oxide of lead (minium
or massicot) increases the hardness of the mass.           Another method
of using the     different  sulphates  of lead  is perhaps   preferable.    It
consists in coating    the freshly  moulded  sulphate   of lead  with a  thin
layer of plaster.     This mass being placed in a liquid in the interior
of a hollow zinc cylinder, constitutes a couple ; in this way the sul
phate does not get out of shape, nor is there any necessity for a
diaphragm ; the plaster serves this purpose, and prevents the con
tact of the zinc and the reduced lead.
    In these couples either water acidulated with sulphuric acid, or
solution of chloride of sodium may be used ; in the latter case the
electromotive force is somewhat greater than in the former, but the
solubility of sulphate of lead in it causes a deposition of reduced lead
on the zinc, which must be removed from time to time.                  With
acidulated water this is not the case.
    The electromotive force of these new couples, as compared with
that of a zinc-platinum couple, water containing one-tenth of acid,
and nitric acid, is as follows : —
Couple with nitric acid                                                  100

                                    sulphuric acid                         27
 In the first moments of the action the electromotive force de
 pends on the nature of the conductor in contact with the sulphate
 of lead ; but as soon as there is metallic lead reduced, it attains a
constant value.       When these couples are in operation, the sulphate
 of lead is reduced to the metallic state — the sulphuric acid from it
 forming sulphate of zinc : the lead may be obtained by fusion.
 From the chemical equivalents we readily get the relative weights
 which the two electrodes must possess in order to have a constant
 current; 100 grammes of zinc require470grammes of sulphate of lead.
    These solid masses, permeable to liquids and employed as negative
 electrodes, by preventing polarization play the same part as the per
 oxides of lead or manganese, nitric acid, and reducible metallic salts ;
 but their resistance to conductibility, which varies with the progress
 of the reduction, prevents the application of these couples with a
 single liquid to the same uses as nitric acid couples.          They may,
 however, be used with advantage where piles of great resistance
and long duration are required. — Comptes Rendus, April 2, 1860.
