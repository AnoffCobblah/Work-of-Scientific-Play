I. On the Perturbations of Planets moving in Eccentric and
     Inclined Orbits. By Sir J. LUBBock, Bart., F.R.S.*
THE accuracy of the tables which give for an indefinite
      time the places of the older planets, is at present sufficient
for the purposes of astronomy, and is commensurate with the
accuracy of observation; or if this statement appears to be
exaggerated, it will at least be admitted that the sensible
errors which remain are owing rather to inadvertence in the
numerical computation than to the imperfection of the method
itself. Such a result is owing to the uninterrupted labours of
the greatest mathematicians from the time of Newton, and is
justly regarded as one of the greatest triumphs of human in
telligence.   But it must be recollected that these methods,
by which the perturbations of the older planets have been
obtained, are applicable only to the case of orbits nearly cir
cular, and little inclined to each other; so that the general
solution of the problem of the three bodies, as it is called,
remains to the present day imperfect. The methods in use
for the older planets are founded, as is well known, upon the
development of the disturbing function in terms of the mean
anomalies.     M. Binet has indeed carried this development to
 quantities of the seventh order inclusive; but such a develop
 ment is quite insufficient in the case of comets ºr planets
 moving in highly eccentric and inclined orbits, which problem
 presents far greater difficulty; while the nature of the expres
 sion is such, that it is evidently impracticable to carry further
 such a mode of development, even if the expressions were su<U+017F>.

2       Sir J. Lubbock on the Perturbations of Planets
fesses to give a general solution of the problem otherwise than
by mechanical quadratures, is due to M. Hansen. This im
portant work is translated in the Conn, des Temps for 1847.
That great mathematician has considered the case when r- ",
that is, when the disturbed body is inferior; and has illus
trated the question by the numerical calculation of the per
turbations of the comet of Encke by Saturn. M. Hansen
develops the disturbing function according to multiple angles
of the eccentric anomaly of the disturbed planet literally; and
first, according to multiple angles of the true anomaly of the
disturbing planet; M. Hansen next converts the cosines and
sines of the multiple angles of the true anomaly of the disturb
ing planet into sines and cosines of multiple angles of the mean
anomaly of that planet; so that finally the disturbing function
is exhibited in terms of the eccentric anomaly of the disturbed
planet and the mean anomaly of the disturbing planet; but
those series which serve to give the sines and cosines of the
multiples of the true anomaly, in terms of sines and cosines
of the mean anomaly, are not very convergent; and the pro
cess becomes extremely laborious, even in the case which M.
 Hansen has considered, in which, in consequence of the great
distance of Saturn, the approximation does not require to be
carried nearly so far as in the case of the perturbations of the
same comet by Jupiter, and in many others which may require
consideration. Moreover, in this as in every other mode
which can be devised of developing the disturbing function
literally, all quantities must be retained of a given order;
although when they are of a different sign, in many instances
they destroy each other; but such reductions cannot before
seen. The numerical substitutions are also extremely labo
rious, in consequence of the multitude of terms which have to
be considered.
   As the disturbing function, and others which require to be
integrated, are finally exhibited by M. Hansen in terms of
two variables, such that direct integration is impossible, M.
Hansen has recourse to the integration par parties, in which
each term by integration gives rise to a series of other terms,
the nature of which is complicated.
   The method which I propose differs from that suggested
by M. Hansen in every particular. Instead of attempting a
literal development, I insert the numerical values of the ellip
tic constants in the earliest possible stage: by this means the
radical, which expresses the mutual distance of the planets, is
explicitly a function of sines and cosines of various angles
with numerical coefficients. When r < r", I develop in terms
of the eccentric anomaly of m, after having obtained expres

            moving in Eccentric and Inclined Orbits.               3
sions for the co-ordinates of m' in terms of the eccentric ano
maly of m. Such expressions are very easy to obtain, and are
very convergent. It will be recollected that before I endea
voured to develop the disturbing function in the lunar theory
in terms of the mean motions of the sun and moon, the inva
riable practice had been (see Mécanique Céleste, vol. iii. p. 189)
to express the co-ordinates of the sum in terms of the true
longitude of the moon; but the equation which connects the
eccentric anomalies of two bodies is far simpler than that which
connects the true anomalies, or w and v, and therefore the
conversion which I employ is made with greater facility. The
quantity under the radical sign in R may thus be considered
as a function, of which the general term can be represented by
                                         r
                           sin (,

use of tables, which give the numerical coefficients in the
development of {1—A cos 2} -4, {1 – A cos 2} -*, &c. Such
tables have been calculated for me by Mr. Farley. By pro
ceeding in this way, no term is ever introduced which affects
the final result beyond a given place of decimals. For the
development of the radical admits of being exhibited in the
form
                     A+B+C+D+&c.;
such that
              B=aA02, C=3B02, D=yCºA,
so that each term is deducible from the one which precedes
it, by the multiplication of that term by 202, 302, &c., 2, 3,
y, &c. being proper fractions. If therefore the terms in the
two quantities which form those products, such, for instance,
aS                          &A and QR
which form B, are sorted and arranged in the order of their
numerical magnitude, as soon as any one partial product sinks
below any limit that may be assigned, all the succeeding terms
are necessarily of inferior magnitude ; and the approximation
stops, as it were, of itself, without any exercise of thought on
the part of the computer.
   When r > r, that is, when the planet disturbed is superior
to the disturbing planet, I am not able to suggest any other
course than to develop in terms of the true anomaly of the dis
turbed planet, and the mean     *ly2

4.       Sir J. Lubbock on the Perturbations of Planets
and to integrate par parties. I have obtained the law of the
coefficients in the series which results in this process, and they
are highly convergent. I am confident that, by the processes
which I have attempted thus so briefly to describe, the per
turbations of planets moving in orbits, however eccentric and
inclined, may be calculated with nearly as great facility as
they are given by existing methods, in orbits nearly circular
and in the same plane, and may be exhibited in tables, giving
their values for an indefinite period, if required. If these me
thods, which I have described in detail lºre, possess the
advantages which I ascribe to them, I hope the time is not
distant when the perturbations of Pallas and of some of the
comets may be reduced to a tabular form; but as the labour
will be very considerable, it will be necessary to limit the in
quiry in the commencement to the cases of the greatest emer
gency.
    Although my methods are specially adapted to the deter
 mination of the perturbations of bodies moving in eccentric
 orbits which cannot be developed in terms of the mean mo
 tions, yet they embrace also the case of a planet moving in an
 orbit nearly circular; and it is easy to show in what manner
 the labour is increased by the greater eccentricity. If the
 reciprocal of the radical which expresses the mutual distance
 of the planets be called

 the chief difficulty arises in developing {1 + P}Ta. If the
 numerical values of the elliptic constants are introduced,
               1 + P=1 – A, cos 21—A, cos 22+&c.,
 A1, A2, &c. are numerical coefficients, which I here suppose
 ranged in the order of their numerical magnitude. I make
 {1–4,cos 21) {1-A,cos 22} . . . . (1–A, cosa;) = 1 + P+Q,
 including a limited number of terms in 1+P.+ Q.                  -
        {1–A, cos a) Tº, {1 – A, cos 2.) Tº . . . . &c.,
 can be obtained at once by means of a table.          But as the
 coefficients given by such a table do not readily furnish, by
 interpolation, the values required unless it be considerably
 extended, I take for A1, A2, &c. the nearest value given by
 the table, and I leave the residue to form part of Q. In this
 way it will generally be found sufficient to include not more
 than six terms in 1 + P+ Gl, so as to leave Q consisting of

            moving in Eccentric and Inclined Orbits.            5
 terms of which the coefficients are each below 1 in numerical
 value, and the quantity (1 + P}Tº can be developed accord

 unity, which depend only on the inclination of the orbits and
 the position of their line of intersection, and such that when
 they are in the same plane

    The process is precisely the same in substance, whether the
 orbit of m is highly eccentric and inclined, or circular, and in
 the same plane with that of m'; the only difference being that,
 while in the former case it may be necessary to detach as many
 as six terms to form the quantity 1 + P+ Gl, in order that Q
 may not contain any term of which the numerical coefficient
 exceeds ‘l in magnitude; in the latter case, supposing e' the
 eccentricity of m' to be inconsiderable, 1 + P+ G will only
 contain one factor, and therefore {1 + P+ Q}T*, &c. can be
 calculated with greater facility. Thus, for example, in the
 perturbations of
    Pallas by Saturn, it is convenient that 1 + P+Q. should
 contain three terms.
    Pallas by Jupiter, it is convenient that 1 + P+Q. should
 contain four terms.

 should contain five terms.

And then in each of these examples Q will contain no term of

                II. On the Discovery of Gun-Cotton.
                    By Professor SchoeNBEIN*.
      HE substance to which I have given in German the name
       of schiesswolle, and in English that of gun-cotton, having
excited a lively curiosity, it may be interesting to the scientific
world to become acquainted with some details of the way in
 which I was first led to its discovery.
   The results of my researches on ozone led me in the course
of the last two years to turn my attention particularly to the
oxides of nitrogen, and principally to nitric acid. The nu
merous experiments I have made on this subject have led me,
as I have stated in detail in Poggendorff’s Annalen, to adopt
a peculiar hypothesis on the so-called hydrates of nitric acid,
sulphuric acid, &c., as well as on the normal nitrates, sulphates,
&c.
   For a long time I had entertained doubts as to the exist
ence of compound bodies of this nature, which cannot be
isolated, and which are stated to be capable of existing only
in combination with certain other substances; for a long time
also <U+017F>had come to the notion that the introduction of these
imaginary combinations had only been an apparent progress
in theoretical chemistry, and that it had even impeded its
development.                                    -
   It is well known that what has most contributed to the
admission of the existence of these compounds has been the
opinion generally received among chemists respecting the
nature of nitric acid. Starting from the existence of the com
pound of nitrogen NOs, as an undoubted and demonstrated
fact, notwithstanding the impossibility of isolating it, they always
cite nitric acid to prove the existence of compounds which
cannot exist in an isolated state. In my opinion, there is no
degree of oxidation which is represented by NO, and what
these chemists designate by the formula NO3-H HO must be
considered as being really NO,-- HO2; I am even inclined
to regard the normal nitrates NOg+ RO, as compounds which
must be expressed by NO,--RO,. Amongst other motives
which induce me to admit this opinion, I will mention the fact
that we can obtain hydrated nitric acid or a normal nitrate by
the direct mixture of NO, with HO, or RO2. Other consi
derations, which I have had occasion to detail elsewhere, in
duce me also to consider hydrated sulphuric acid to have the
form SO, +HO, and not that of SOs-H HO, and a normal
sulphate that of SO,--RO,. It is sufficient here to observe
that SO, placed in presence of HO, gives rise to what is
        * From the Archives des Sciences Physiques et Naturelles.

8       Prof. Schoenbein on the Discovery of Gun-Cotton.
called hydrated sulphuric acid, and that SO, placed in pre
sence of BaO2 or PbO2 gives rise to what is called sulphate
of the oxide of barium or of lead. Rose’s compound, to which
the formula 2SOs--NO, has been assigned, should have, in
my opinion, 2SO,--NO,. . Admitting this, I considered it
probable that the mixture of 2(SO,4-HO) (=2(SO4+ HO))
with NOA-F HO, (= NO,-- HO) yields 2SO,--NO, and
that at the same time 3HO, is disengaged, or enters into
a loose combination with what is called the bisulphate of
deutoxide of nitrogen. In other words, I conjectured that a
mixture formed with the hydrates of nitric acid and sulphuric
acid would possess a very great power of oxidation, and would
form a kind of aqua regia, in which the combination HO,
would act the part of the chlorine. On this hypothesis, and
abstracting HO, from the acid mixture by means of a proper
oxidable body, there ought to remain Rose's compound.
    Guided by these suppositions, which, I admit, may be as
little founded as they are contrary to the ideas received among
chemists, I commenced in December 1845 a series of experi
ments with a view to put my hypothesis to the proof: it will
be seen in the sequel whether the results at which I arrived
tend to confirm it.
   I, mixed some flowers of sulphur and a certain quantity
of the acid mixture of which I have spoken: immediately,
even at the temperature of 32°F., a lively disengagement of
sulphurous acid gas took place without the production of
deutoxide of nitrogen. After the reaction, which was accom
panied by a development of heat, there remained a colourless
liquid, which, mixed with water, disengaged a considerable
quantity of deutoxide of nitrogen, and acted generally as a
solution of Rose's compound in hydrated sulphuric acid would
have done.
   I should add here, that a mixture of four ounces of hydrated
sulphuric acid with a single drop of nitric acid, on the addition
of flowers of sulphur, disengages a sensible quantity of sulphu
rous acid. To assure himselfof the presence of the latter, the
operator has only to hold over the liquid a strip of paper which
has been covered with iodide of potassium paste, and tinged
slightly blue by exposure to chlorine. The liberated sulphu
rous acid will soon dissipate this blue colour.
   Selenium and phosphorus are oxidized in the same manner
at low temperatures in the acid mixture in question; and this
latter is modified to such an extent, that, on the addition of
water, an abundant disengagement of deutoxide of nitrogen gas
takes place.
   Iodine even, in the state of powder and shaken up with the

       Prof. Schoenbein on the Discovery of Gun-Cotton.            9
acid mixture, rapidly absorbs oxygen, when exposed to a low
temperature; and there is formed, besides iodic acid, the
compounds to which Millon has lately drawn attention. After
the reaction a liquid remains, which, diluted with water, gives
an abundant disengagement of deutoxide of nitrogen and
liberates iodine.
   My experiments on ozone having shown that this body,
which I consider to be a distinct peroxide of hydrogen, forms,
as well as chlorine, at the ordinary temperature, a peculiar
compound with olefiant gas, without apparently oxidizing in
the least either the hydrogen or the carbon of this gas, I had
the idea that it would not be impossible that certain organic
matters, exposed to a low temperature, would likewise form
compounds, either with the peroxide of hydrogen alone, which,
on my hypothesis, occurs in a state of combination or of mix
ture in the acid mixture, or with NOI. It was this conjecture,
doubtless very singular in the eyes of chemists, which princi
pally led me to commence experiments with common sugar.
   I made a mixture of one part (volume) of nitric acid, of 1:5
spec. grav., and two parts of sulphuric acid of 1.85, at the
temperature of 36°F. ; I then added some finely powdered
sugar, so as to form a very fluid paste. I stirred the whole, and,
at the end of a few minutes, the saccharine substance formed
itself into a viscous mass entirely separated from the acid
liquid, without any disengagement of gas. This pasty mass
was washed with boiling water, until this last no longer exer
cised any acid reaction; after which I deprived it, as much as
possible, at a low temperature, of the water it still contained.
The substance now possessed the following properties: — Ex
posed to a low temperature, it is compact and brittle; at a
moderate temperature, it may be moulded like jalap resin,
which gives it a beautiful silky lustre. . . It is semi-fluid at the
temperature of boiling water; at a higher temperature, it
gives off red vapours; heated still more, it suddenly defla
grates with violence, without leaving any perceptible residue.
It is almost insipid and colourless, transparent like the resins,
almost insoluble in water, but easily soluble in the essential
oils, in aether and concentrated nitric acid, and in most cases
it acts in general like the resins in a chemical and physical
point of view: thus friction renders it very electro-negative.
I will add, that the acid mixture, by means of which this resi
nous body was obtained, has an extremely marked bitter taste.
   I wished to make experiments also with other organic sub
stances; and I soon discovered, one after another, all those
about which there has been so much said of late, especially in
the Academy of Paris. All this passed in December 1845,

 10      Prof. Schoenbein on the Discovery of Gun-Cotton.
 and the first few months in 1846. In March, I sent speci
 mens of my new compounds to some of my friends, in parti
 cular to Messrs. Faraday, Herschel and Grove. It is neces
 sary to note expressly that the gun-cotton formed part of these
 products; but I must add, that hardly was it discovered when
 I employed it in experiments of shooting, the success of which
 encouraged me to continue them. Accepting the obliging
 invitation which I received, I went in the middle of April to
 Wurtemburg, and made experiments with gun-cotton both in
 the arsenal of Ludwigsburg, in the presence of artillery offi
 cers, and in Stuttgard, before the king himself. In the course
 of May, June and July, with the kind cooperation of the
 Commandant de Mechel, of M. Burkhardt, captain of artil
 lery, and other officers, I subsequently made in this city (Båle)
 numerous experiments with arms of small calibre, such as
 pistols, carbines, &c., and afterwards with mortars and can
non, experiments at which Baron de Krüdener, the Russian
 ambassador, was several times present. I may be allowed to
 mention, that I was the person who fired the first cannon
 loaded with gun-cotton and shot, on the 28th of July, if I
 remember aright, after we had previously ascertained, by ex
 periments with mortars, that the substance in question was
 capable of being used with pieces of large calibre.
    About the same time, and indeed previously, I employed
gun-cotton to blast some rocks at Istein in the Grand Duchy
of Baden, and to blow up some old walls at Bale; and in
both cases I had opportunities of convincing myself in the
most satisfactory manner, of the superiority of this new explo
sive substance over common gunpowder*.
    Experiments of this kind, which took place frequently and
in the presence of a great number of persons, could not long
remain unknown; and the public journals soon gave, without
participation on my part, descriptions, more or #. accurate,
of the results which I had obtained. This circumstance, joined
to the short notice which I inserted in the May number of Pog
gendorff’s Annalen, could not fail to attract the attention of
German chemists: in the middle of August I received from
M. Boettger, Professor at Frankfort, the news that he had
succeeded in preparing gun-cotton and other substances. Our
two names thus became associated in the discovery of the sub
stance in question. To M. Boettger the gun-cotton must have
been particularly interesting, as he had previously discovered
an organic acid which deflagrates readily.
   In the month of August I went to England, where, assisted
   * In the month of June I made also the first capsules, and employed
them with success for muskets, in the presence of the above-named officers.

       Prof. Schoenbein on the Discovery of Gun-Cotton.      11
by the able engineer, Mr. Richard Taylor of Falmouth, I
made numerous experiments in the mines of Cornwall, which
were entirely successful, in the opinion of all competent wit
messes. Experiments on the action of gun-cotton were also
made in several parts of England, under my direction, both
with small fire-arms and with pieces of artillery, and the re
sults obtained were very satisfactory.
   Until that time there had been little or nothing said of
gun-cotton in France; and it will appear that the short notices
which Mr. Grove gave at Southampton at the meeting of the
British Association, and the experiments with which he ac
companied them, served first to attract the attention of French
chemists to this substance. At Paris, the thing was at first
considered hardly credible, and jokes even were passed upon
it; but when there could no longer remain any doubt as to
the reality of the discovery, and when several chemists in
Germany and other countries had published the processes
which they employed to prepare the gun-cotton, then a lively
interest was manifested in a subject which had just before ex
cited derision, and it was soon pretended that the new explo
sive substance was an old French discovery. It was declared
to be nothing more than the xyloidine first discovered by M.
Braconnot, and afterwards investigated anew by M. Pelouze,
and the only merit left me was to have conceived the happy
idea of putting this substance into a gun-barrel. The know
ledge of the composition of xyloidine ought to have sufficed
to convince those who put forward that opinion, that it is not
suited for fire-arms, on account of its containing too much
carbon and too little oxygen for the chief part to be converted
into gaseous matters during the combustion. It was moreover
very easy to discover the essential differences which exist be
tween the xyloidine of Braconnot and gun-cotton. Never
theless the error was kept up for some months.
   Matters stood thus, when, on the 4th of last November, a
Scotch chemist, Mr. Walter Crum of Glasgow, published a
memoir, in which he showed that gun-cotton is not the same
product as xyloidine, but that it presents an essentially differ
ent composition; and towards the end of the same month, the
French Academy received a communication of the same na
ture. The gun-cotton was then no longer xyloidine, it was
called pyroxyloidine, and the first was admitted to be unsuit
able for fire-arms.
   If, therefore, it is proved that from the commencement of
 1846-I prepared gun-cotton, and applied it to the discharge
of fire-arms, and that M. Boettger did the same in the month
of August,--if it be admitted that xyloidine cannot serve the

 12       The Rev. B. Bronwin on the Inverse Calculus
same purposes as this cotton, and if it be notoriously known
that what is now called pyroxyloidine was not brought before
the French Academy and the scientific world until towards
the middle of last November, the idea of attributing to France
the discovery of gun-cotton cannot be seriously entertained,
or of assigning to me merely a practical application of that
which another would have discovered.
   I appeal to the justice of Frenchmen, to decide the point to
whom belongs the honour of not only being the first to apply
the new substance in question, but also of having first pre
pared it—to MM. Braconnot and Pelouze, or myself. I
must, moreover, add expressly, that it was not xyloidine even
which led to my discovery, however intimate may be its rela
tion with gun-cotton; it was theoretical ideas, possibly very
erroneous ones, but which are peculiarly my own, as well as
some facts which I was also the first to discover. Suum cuique
is a principle of morality on which society at large rests;
why should it not be strictly respected in the republic of sci
ence? M. Pelouze is a distinguished chemist, and already
possesses a sufficiently high reputation not to require to ele
vate his pretensions on the merits of others; and I am fully
persuaded that this estimable chemist, of well-known truth
of character, will, appreciating with impartiality the circum
stances which have occurred, freely render me the justice to
which I consider myself entitled.

   It is plain that we may give to k, not only integer values,
but fractional ones also, and any values whatever, and nega

on r, or on a', merely changes them into r + k, and a "" re

 between them. But if we are obliged to integrate by series,
 they will in general be subject to the restrictions mentioned in

 vanish by the operations      (#).

The theorems (3.) and (4.) are likewise satisfied by these ex

IV. On certain Phaenomena of Voltaic Ignition and the De
   composition of Water into its constituent Gases by Heat.
   By W. R. Grove, Esq., M.A., F.R.S.*
IN the Philosophical Magazine for August 1841, I recom
     mended for eudiometrical purposes, the use of a platinum
wire ignited by a voltaic battery. In fig. 1 is re- Fig. 1.
presented a form of apparatus for this purpose; it
consists of a tube of Bohemian glass, with a loop of
platinum wire ºth of an inch diameter sealed into
its upper end; the size of the glass tube may be
adapted to the quantity of gas sought to be analysed,
and may when necessary be reduced to extremely
small dimensions, one-eighth of an inch being ample;
into this the gas may readily be made to ascend, by
the insertion of a wire of copper, platinum, or glass,
as may be suitable to the gas: two cells of the nitric
acid battery are sufficient fully to ignite the wire,
and the same battery supplies, by electrolysis, pure
oxygen and hydrogen for the analysis. Since the                    -* –
period when I first proposed this, I have seldom used any
other apparatus for such gaseous analyses as are performed
by combining the gas to be examined with oxygen or hydrogen.
 This eudiometer possesses the advantage of enabling the ope
 rator either to detonate or slowly to combine the gases, by
using different powers of battery, by interposing resisting
 wires, or by manipulation alone,—a practised hand being able
 by changing the intervals of contact to combine or detonate
the gas at will. My general practice has been to produce a
 gentle heat in the wire until the gases contract, and then gra
 dually to increase the heat until a full ignition takes place, by
 which means all the objects of the eudiometer of Volta are
 fulfilled, without detonation, without dependence on the fickle
 electric spark, and without thick tubes, any danger of explo
 sion, or of the gases being projected from the eudiometer.
    I have commenced with a description of this eudiometer,
 as it has been indirectly the means of my undertaking the
 experiments detailed in this lecture; and as its very great
 convenience has never been generally understood, I think that
 in strongly recommending it, I shall be of service to chemists.
    In a paper honoured by insertion in the Philosophical
 Transactions for 1845, p. 358, I have shown another method
 of eudiometry also performed by voltaic ignition; in that ex
 periment the vapour of camphor was decomposed into car
 bonic oxide and carburetted hydrogen; it was an application
    * From the Philosophical Transactions for 1847, part i.; having been
 received by the Royal Society September 3, and read November 19, 1846.

       Mr. Grove on the Decomposition of Water by Heat.               21
 of voltaic ignition to effects analogous to those produced by
 Priestley and others, by passing compound gases through
 ignited tubes of porcelain.
    But the voltaic process has this immense advantage, that
 the heat can be rendered incomparably more intense; that
the quantity of vapour or gas to be operated on may be inde
finitely small; that there are no joints, stop-cocks or ligatures;
and that there is no chance of endosmose, which takes place
through all porcelain vessels.         I therefore determined to
examine by these means several gases, both with a view of
verifying, under different circumstances, known results, and
seeking for new effects by this new and advantageous appli
cation. I used an eudiometer (fig. 1) of 8 inches long and
0.4 inch internal diameter, exposing the gases to intense heat,
and subsequently analysed the residues in one of the same
length, but 0-2 inch diameter.                                           -
   I will first consider the physical effects of different gases on
the ignition of the wire itself.
   In a paper on the Application of Voltaic Ignition to lighting
Mines”, I have mentioned the striking effects of hydrogen in
reducing the intensity of ignition of a platinum wire, so much so
that a wire voltaically ignited to incandescence in atmospheric
air, is apparently extinguished by inverting over it a jar of
hydrogen; with other gases the effects are not so striking, and
with them these differences are best shown by including a volta
meter in the circuit. Davy found that the conducting power of
a wire diminished in proportion to the degree to which it was
heated: assuming the accuracy of this position, the amount of
gas in the voltameter would be inverse to the intensity of ig
nition in the wire. The following is the result I obtained with
different gases, employing the same battery (the nitric-acid
combination at its most constant period), the same wire, and
the same vessel :—

         Gases surrounding the wire.      the voltameter, per minute.

22 Mr. Grove on the Decomposition of Water by Heat.
    To ascertain the relation between the amount of radiant
heat generated by the same battery and wire in gases which
presented striking differences as to the luminous effects of the
platinum wire, an apparatus was prepared in which the bulb
of a thermometer was retained at a certain distance from the
coil of wire ignited by a battery of four cells, and exposed,
first, to an atmosphere of hydrogen, and then to one of atmo
spheric air, at the same temperature and pressure; the ther
 mometer rose 73° in five minutes in the hydrogen, and 15°
 in the air in the same time. Both the heating and luminous
 effects appear therefore to be greater in atmospheric air than
 in hydrogen. I cannot satisfactorily account for the differ
ences shown in the above table; there appears a general ten
dency to greater ignition in the electro-negative than in the
combustible gases, but the facts are far too few to found a
generalization. I was at first inclined to regard the difference
of effect in hydrogen as analogous to the peculiarity mentioned
by Leslie+ respecting its convection of sound, but the pa
rallel does not hold; sound is transmitted imperfectly through
rarefied air, and also through hydrogen; on the contrary, the
heat of the ignited wire is most intense in the former, and
least so in the latter; the heat is also very much reduced in
intensity in the compounds of hydrogen, ammonia and olefiant
gas, or even by a small admixture of hydrogen with another
gas, such as nitrogen; hydrogen, therefore, appears to have
a peculiar and specific action in this respect.
    I now pass to the consideration of the effects of the ignited
wire on different gases. The ignition was in every case raised
to the fullest extent, and the gases after exposure to it were
carefully cooled down to their original temperature.
    When the experiments were                            Fig. 2.
made over water, the whole
eudiometer was immersed in a
vessel of distilled water, occa
sionally having an inch depth of
oil on the surface (see fig. 2.f);
when over mercury, and a long
continued exposure was required,
a bent tube was employed, as at
fig. 3, the closed end being im
mersed in water or oil, to prevent
the fusion of the glass which
would otherwise have ensued.

    The tubes are much more easily preserved from cracking,
and the ignition better kept up with oil on the exterior than
with water, but as in many of these experiments I might have
been considerably mis-                      Fig. 3.

glass, or a bad seal
ing of the wire, al
 lowing a portion of
oil to enter the tube,
 I used water in the
greater     number of
 them until I was as
sured of the phaenomena.
    The apparatus, fig. 3, is superior in one respect Fig 4.
 to fig. 2, even for experiments over water, as the
 wire being situate below the volume of gas, the circu
 lation is more rapid. This object may also be effected
 by employing the form of eudiometer, fig. 4, in which
 the loop of wire is near the centre of the tube, so as
 to be just above the surface of water in the tube;
 there are, however, some difficulties of manipulation
 with this form, which render it practically of less
 value than fig. 1.
    Binoride of nitrogen over distilled water contracted
 differently in proportion to the heat of the wire; in
 the best experiment it contracted to one-third of its
 original volume; the residual gas was nitrogen.
  Nitric acid was found in solution in the water.
     Over mercury the effects were nearly the same; the mer
 cury was attacked, and the orange fumes of nitrous acid were
  visible.
     Protozide of nitrogen was decomposed into nitrogen and
 oxygen; the volume increased by 0:35 of the original volume;
  I could not get the full equivalent proportion, or 0.5 of oxygen.
     Carbonic acid underwent no perceptible alteration.
     Ammonia increased to double its original volume; it was
  now no longer absorbable by water, and gave three volumes
  of hydrogen, plus 1 nitrogen.
     Olefiant gas contracted slightly, deposited carbon, the residue
  being hydrogen and olefiant gas, more of the former in pro
  portion to the heat, but I could not succeed in entirely de
  composing it.                                         -
      Nitrogen suffered no change.            -
      Oxygen gave a very slight contraction, amounting to #6th
  of its volume; the oxygen employed was very pure, obtained
   from chlorate of potash and manganese, and also from water

24    Mr. Grove on the Decomposition of Water by Heat.
by electrolysis: no change in properties was perceptible in
the oxygen after its exposure to the ignited wire. This con
traction I incline to attribute to a slight portion of hydrogen
present, which view will, I think, be considered as strengthened
by the effect of the ignited wire on hydrogen, to be presently
detailed. I at one time thought that the contraction might be
due to a slight oxidation of the wire, but it never went beyond
a very limited point; nor was the wire altered in size or weight,
though it was kept ignited for many hours.
    Chlorine over water gave dense white fumes; a grayish
yellow insoluble powder accumulated on the sides of the tube
near the platinum wire, which appeared of the same nature
as the vapours; the deposit was insoluble in cold nitric, sul
phuric, or muriatic acid, but dissolved by the last when boiled.
The fumes did not, as far as I could judge, affect litmus paper;
a barely perceptible tinge of red was indeed communicated to
it, but this, I had every reason to believe, was attributable to
a slight portion of muriatic acid not absorbed by the water.
I have not yet worked out this result, as it is probable, con
sidering the number of experiments that have been made on
heated chlorine, that it is a known product, though I cannot
find, in several books to which I have referred, any substance
answering to it in description, and the field opened by voltaic
ignition is so new that each result demands a separate and
prolonged examination; if I find that this is an unknown
compound I shall probably resume its investigation*.
    Cyanogen gave, though in very minute quantities, a some
what similar deposit, but at its then very high temperature it
began to act rapidly on the mercury, and I was obliged to
give up the experiment after an hour's ignition. Both these
gases require peculiar and novel apparatus for examination
by voltaic ignition. It will presently be seen that my whole
attention and disposable time were necessarily occupied with
certain phaenomena to which this class of experiments ulti
mately led me.
    Hydrogen gave a very notable contraction, amounting in
some cases to one-tenth of its volume.        This was an unex
pected result, and I examined it with care. It took place
both over water and over mercury; rather more with the
former than with the latter. It obtained equally with hydrogen
procured by electrolysis from carefully j water and pure
sulphuric acid; with that procured from common zinc and
pure sulphuric acid diluted with distilled water; and with
that obtained from distilled zinc and pure diluted sulphuric
acid.   The contraction was less when the water from which
                    * See Supplemental paper.

      Mr. Grove on the Decomposition of Water by Heat,        25
the hydrogen was obtained was carefully purged of air by
boiling and the air-pump, but yet there was a notable con
traction even when the water had been freed from air to the
utmost practicable extent. In the numerous experiments
which I made on this subject, the contraction varied from the
Tºoth to the ºth of the whole volume.
   After many fruitless experiments I traced it to a small
quantity of oxygen which I found hydrogen to contain under
all circumstances in which I examined it. Phosphorus placed
in hydrogen, obtained with the utmost care, gives fumes of
phosphorous acid, shines in the dark and produces a slight
contraction, but there is after this a further contraction by the
use of the ignited wire.
   I may cite the following as an easy experiment and simple
illustration of the rapidity with which hydrogen appropriates
oxygen. Let hydrogen be collected over water well-purged
of air; let a piece of phosphorus remain in it until all com
bustion has ceased, the hydrogen will then be full of phos
phoric vapour; fill another tube with water, and pass the
hydrogen rapidly into it, the second tube will instantly be
filled with a dense white fume of phosphorous acid; the hy
drogen having instantly carried with it oxygen from the stra
tum of water it has passed.
   A very careful experiment was made as follows:—distilled
water was boiled for several hours, to this was added one
fortieth part by measure of pure sulphuric acid, and it was
cooled under the receiver of an air-pump; it was now placed
in two test-glasses, connected by a narrow inverted tube, full
of the same liquid: platinum electrodes were placed in each
glass, and the hydrogen caused to ascend immediately into the
eudiometer tubes; the whole was completed within two or
three minutes after the water had been removed from the air
pump. Here the ordinary sources of impurity in hydrogen
were avoided; no zinc was used, the sulphuric acid was pure,
and the quantity was so small, that, had it not been pure, the
error could have been but very trifling. The hydrogen so
obtained, contracted in volume ºth ; hydrogen prepared in
the same way, and exposed to phosphorus, gave dense white
fumes; the phosphorus was luminous in the dark for more
than an hour, and the contraction (temperature and pressure
being carefully examined) was ºth; the amount of contrac
tion by the wire would of course equal three times the volume
of oxygen mixed with the hydrogen, consequently the oxygen
would be ºath of the whole volume; the platinum wire induces
therefore a greater absorption of oxygen than the phosphorus,
unless the volume of hydrogen is increased by the phosphoric

vapour; the sequel of this paper will render it probable that
even the ignited wire does not and cannot induce combination
of all the oxygen existing in the hydrogen.
   I have looked into the papers of MM. Berzelius and Du
long, and of M. Dumas on the equivalent weight of hydrogen.
The latter contains a most careful experimental investigation,
and is by far the best determination we have ; although it is
not there mentioned that hydrogen contains oxygen, yet a
correction is made for the air contained in the sulphuric acid
employed. M. Dumas does not state how the quantity of that
air is calculated. There can be no question that nothing ap
proaching in elaborate care to these experiments has been yet
performed on the subject; but with the fullest consciousness of
M. Dumas' skill, I have, in all my experiments, perceived
such an inveterate tendency of hydrogen to possess itself of
oxygen, that I cannot help entertaining some doubts whether
we have yet the real weight of hydrogen within the assigned
limits of error.
   It is difficult to see how hydrogen can be absolutely deprived
of oxygen which has once existed in it; neither an oxidable
metal as zinc, or an ignited inoxidable metal as platinum, get
ting rid of all the oxygen, and phosphorus, if it does so, re
places it by its own vapour. The near approach, however, of
the equivalent of hydrogen, as determined by M. Dumas, to
the ratio of whole numbers, renders it probable that it is a
very close approximation to the truth.                            -
   I have not been able to detect nitrogen in the hydrogen,
but the probability is that a slight quantity also exists in it.
Whether the oxygen proceeds from portions of air still re
maining in solution in the liquid from which the air is ex
hausted, or whether it is a part of the water actually decom
posed, but of which the oxygen is not absorbed by the zinc,
is a question to resolve which further experiments are neces
Sal"W.
   Harwºn       and carbonic acid mixed in equal volumes were
readily acted on by the ignited wire; they contracted to 0-48
of the original volume; the residue was carbonic oxide; one
equivalent of oxygen had therefore united with the hydrogen;
and the slight additional contraction was probably due to the
further combination of hydrogen with oxygen, as above stated.
    Carbonic oride exhibited a remarkable effect, and one which,
 coupled with the last experiment, gave rise to considerations
 which mainly led to the results to be detailed in the body of
this paper. Carbonic oxide, very pure and carefully freed from
carbonic acid, was exposed to the ignited wire over distilled
 water; the gas increased in volume in one experiment to one

      Mr. Grove on the Decomposition of JWater by Heat. 27
third of its original volume, in the greater number of instances
to one-fifth: this increase depended upon the intensity of ig
nition, which it was very difficult to maintain at its maximum
on account of the frequent fusions of the platinum wires.
   Here again I had a long research and many erroneous
guesses, which I need not detail. The effect did not take
place with perfectly dry gas over mercury, and I thence was
led to attribute it to some combination with aqueous vapour;
the increase turned out to be occasioned by the formation of
carbonic acid. By agitation with caustic potash or lime water
the gas was reduced to exactly its original bulk, but it was
now found to be mixed with a volume of hydrogen equal to
the volume of carbonic acid by which it had been increased;
it was thus perfectly clear that half a volume or one equivalent
of oxygen derived from the vapour of the water, had combined
with one volume or equivalent of carbonic oxide, and formed
one volume or equivalent of carbonic acid, leaving in place of
the carbonic oxide with which it had combined, the one vo
lume or equivalent of hydrogen with which it had been origi
 nally associated.
    Comparing the last experiment, viz. that of mixed carbonic
 acid and hydrogen with this, I was naturally struck with the
curious reversal of affinities under circumstances so nearly
 similar; in the one case, hydrogen taking oxygen from car
 bonic acid to form water and leaving carbonic oxide; in the
 other, carbonic oxide taking oxygen from water to form car
 bonic acid and leaving hydrogen.                                -
    I thought much upon this experiment; it appeared to me
 ultimately that the ignited platinum had no specific effect in
 producing either composition or decomposition of water, but
 that it simply rendered the chemical equilibrium unstable, and
 that the gases then restored themselves to a stable equilibrium
 according to the circumstances in which they were placed with
 regard to surrounding affinities; that if the state of mixed
 oxygen and hydrogen gas were, at a certain temperature,
 more stable than that of water, ignited platinum would de
 compose water as it does ammonia.
    This is a very crude expression of my ideas, but we have
 no language for such anticipatory notions, and I must adapt
 existing terms as well as I am able.
    It now appeared to me that it was possible to effect the
 decomposition of water by ignited platinum; that, supposing
 the atmosphere of steam in the immediate vicinity of ignited
 platinum were decomposed, or the affinities of its constituents
 loosened, if there were any means of suddenly removing this
 atmosphere I might get the mixed gases; or secondly, if, as

   28   Mr. Grove on the Decomposition of Water by Heat.
  appeared by the last two experiments, quantity had any influ
  ence, that it might be possible so to divide the mixed gases
  by a quantity of a neutral ingredient as to obtain them by
  subsequent separation (or as it were filtration) from the neu
  tral substance.   Both these ideas were realized.
     To effect the first object, after, as usual in such circum
  stances, much groping in the dark, I cemented a loop of pla
  tinum wire in the end of a tube retort similar to fig. 3, and
  covered it with asbestos, ramming this down so as to form a
  plug at the closed extremity of the tube, the platinum wire
  being in the centre. My object was, by igniting the platinum
  wire, to drain the water out of the asbestos, and the ignited
  wire being then in an atmosphere of steam, I hoped the water
 would by capillary attraction keep constantly oozing down to
 the platinum wire as the steam or decomposed water ascended.
 The experiment did not succeed; the water established a
 current through the asbestos by washing away fine particles,
 and the phaenomena of ordinary ebullition took place, unless
 the intensity of the battery was very much exalted, when a
 very slight decomposition was perceptible, which I attributed
 to electrolysis. This experiment, however, suggested another
 which did succeed. In one or two cases the asbestos plug
 became compressed above the platinum and so choked up the
 tube that the wire suddenly fused. It now occurred to me
 that by narrowing the glass tube above the platinum wire I
 had the result at my command, as the narrow neck might be
 made of any diameter and length, so as just to allow the water
 to drip or run down as the steam forced its way up; a tube
 was so formed, and is shown with its accompaniments at fig. 5.
                              Fig. 5.
    The result of this experiment was very striking: when two
cells of the nitric-acid battery were applied the air was first
expanded and expelled, the water then soon boiled, and at a
certain period the wire became ignited in the steam. At this
instant a tremulous motion was perceptible, and separate
bubbles of permanent gas of the size of pin-heads ascended,

      Mr. Grove on the Decomposition of Water by Heat.                29
and formed a volume in the bend of the tube.              It was not a
continuous discharge of gas as in electrolysis, but appeared to
be a series of rapid jerks; the water, returning through the
narrow neck, formed a natural valve which cut off by an in
termitting action portions of the atmosphere surrounding the
wire; the experiment presented a novel and indescribably
curious effect. The gas was oxyhydrogen. It will occur at
the first to many of those who hear this paper read, that this
effect might be derived from electrolysis. No one seeing it
would think so for a moment; and although I shall by my
subsequent experiments, I trust, abundantly negative this sup
position, yet as this was my first successful experiment on this
subject, and is per se an interesting and striking method of
showing the phaenomenon of decomposition by heat, I will
mention a few points to prove that the phaenomenon could
not be occasioned by electrolysis.
    To account for it by electrolysis, it must be supposed that
the wire offered such a resistance to the current that this di
 vided itself, and the excess of voltaic power passed by the
 small portion of water which trickled down, instead of by the
 WIre.
    In the first place, the experiment was performed with di
 stilled water, and only two cells of the battery employed, which
 will not perceptibly decompose distilled water.
    2ndly. No decomposition took place until the instant of
 ignition of the wire, though there was a greater surface of
 boiling water exposed to the wire before than after the period
 of ignition.
    3rdly. A similar experiment was made, but with the wire
 divided in the centre so as to form two electrodes, and the
 water boiled by a spirit-lamp; here the current had no wire
 to conduct any part of it away, but the whole was obliged to
 pass across the liquid, and yet no decomposition took place,
 or if there were any it was microscopic.
    4thly. When, instead of oil, distilled water was used in the
 outer vessel”, even the copper wires, one of which would form
 an oxidable anode, gave no decomposition across the boiling
 water outside, while the ignited wire inside was freely yielding
 mixed gases.
     5thly. To prevent the water from being the shortest line
 for the current, I repeated the experiment with a perfectly
  straight wire (fig. 6). The result was precisely the same,
 but the experiment is more difficult; as a certain length of
    * January 8.-I have since found that the exterior tube of oil or water
 may be dispensed with in this experiment, as the water which trickles
  down prevents the fusion of the glass.

size of the bulb is much more difficult to adapt to the produc

site quantity; the straight wire
being more suddenly extinguish
ed and more easily fused: with
careful manipulation however it                                 Ç
succeeds equally well with the
former experiment.                    N
   I might add other experiments
and arguments, but I believe when
the remainder of this paper has been read, that the above will
be thought scarcely necessary.
   I now directed all my efforts to produce the effects by heat
alone without the battery. I will mention a few of my unsuc
cessful attempts, as it will save trouble to future experimenters.
I sealed a platinum wire into the extremity of a curved tube,
filled the latter with water, and applied a strong heat, by the
blowpipe to the projecting end of the wire, hoping that the
conducting power of the platinum, although inferior to that of
most other metals, was sufficiently superior to that of glass to
enable me to ignite the portion of the wire within the tube,
and thus surround it with an atmosphere of steam ; the water
however all boiled off from the glass; nor could I succeed in
igniting the platinum by heat from without. A similar failure
occurred when, on account of its superior conducting power,
a gold wire was substituted for that of platinum.
   I sealed spongy platinum and bundles of platinum wire into
the ends of Bohemian glass tubes, closing the glass over them,
and then filling the tubes with water and heating the whole
extremity; but the water boiled off from the glass, and the
platinum could not be made to attain a full incandescence.
   After many similar trials I returned to the battery, and
sought to apply it in a manner in which electrolysis could not
possibly take place. I had hoped, as I have above stated, to
obtain a residual decomposition of water by masking or dilu
ting the gases by a neutral substance. I therefore tried the
following experiment:... a tube                  Fig. 7.
 similar to fig. 1 was filled with
 water which had been carefully
freed from air by long boiling
and the air-pump; it was then
inverted in a vessel of the same
 water, and a spirit-lamp applied
to its closed extremity, until the
 upper half was filled with va

      Mr. Grove on the Decomposition of Water by Heat.        31
pour (fig. 7). The wire was brought to a full ignition by
the battery, and kept ignited for a few seconds; connexion
was then broken and the lamp removed, so that the water
gradually ascended. A bubble of the size of a large mustard
seed was left in the extremity of the tube, and I was much
gratified at finding that when this was caught by a lighted
match at the surface of the water-trough it detonated. The
experiment was then repeated, continuing the ignition for a
longer time, but the gas could not be increased beyond a
very limited quantity; indeed it was not to have been expected,
as supposing it to be mixed gas, recombination of the excess
would have taken place, and the fact of any uncombined gas
existing when exposed to incandescent platinum, will doubt
less surprise those who hear it for the first time.
   The experiment was repeated as at first and the bubble
transferred to another tube; the wire was then again ignited
in vapour, another bubble was instantly formed and trans
ferred, and so on, until after about ten hours’ work sufficient
gas was collected for analysis; this gas was now placed in an
eudiometer, it detonated and contracted to 0°35 of its original
volume; the residue being nitrogen. The experiment was
repeated several times with the same general results, the re
sidue sometimes containing a trace of oxygen.
   Here electrolysis was out of the question; the wire was
ignited in (if I may use the expression) dry steam, the upper
part of the tube being far above the boiling-point, and of
course perfectly transparent; if not an effect of heat, it must
have been a new function of the electric current, at least one
hitherto unknown.
   As the voltaic arc and electric spark afford heat of the
greatest intensity, I tried a succession of electric sparks from
platinum wires through steam in the apparatus fig. 8, the
water, as in all my experiments,
having been previously purged of                Fig. 8.
air (to save circumlocution I will
in future call it prepared water).
The sparks were taken from the
hydro-electric machine of the
London Institution; they had in
the steam a beautiful crimson ap
pearance; on cooling the tube a
bubble was perceptible, which
detonated by the match.
   As in the previous experiments, a whole day's work did not
increase the bubble, but when it was transferred another
instantly formed; the gas was similarly collected; it detonated

32 Mr. Grove on the Decomposition of Water by Heat.
and contracted to 0-4 of its original volume; the residue was
nitrogen with a trace of oxygen.
   This experiment will again surprise by its novelty; the
very means used in every laboratory to combine the mixed
gases and form water, here decompose water*. . From a vast
number of experiments which I have made on the voltaic and
electric disruptive discharges (which are I believe similar phae
nomena, differing only in quantity and intensity), I believe the
decompositions produced by them are the effects of heat alone,
and this experiment was therefore to my mind a repetition of the
last under different circumstances; others however may think
differently. This experiment also I several times repeated.
   By counting the globules given off, and comparing a cer
tain number of them with the average volume of steam in the
last two experiments, an attempt was made to ascertain what
proportion of water could be decomposed by an ignited pla
tinum wire in aqueous vapour, or, which amounts to a corol
lary from this proposition, what degree of dilution would
enable mixed gas to exist without combustion in an atmo
sphere of steam exposed to an ignited platinum wire. The
proportion in an experiment in which the globules were so
counted, was 1 to 2400; the probability is however that dif
ferent temperatures of the platinum wire would give different
volumes of gas so decomposed, the volume being greater as
the wire is more intensely ignited.
   Although there was no known effect of electricity which
could produce the phaenomenon exhibited by the last two
experiments, and it was in any event new, still, firmly con
vinced that it was an effect of heat, I again determined to
attempt its production by heat alone, and without the use of
the battery. I procured a tube of silver 9 inches long and
0.4 inch diameter; at the extremity of this was a platinum cap
to which a smaller tube, also                       Fig. 9.
of platinum, was soldered.

the tube was then, when full of hot water, inverted into water,
and the flame of a common blowpipe made to play against the
platinum tube (fig. 9) until a white heat was obtained. Upon
inverting it under water, a bubble of the size of a mustard
seed rose to the surface, which gave a very feeble detonation
with the match.      Similar bubbles were collected as before,
and the gas in an eudiometer contracted to 0-7. On re
petition the experiment did not succeed so well, and upon
several repetitions it sometimes succeeded and sometimes
failed, and I should not mention it but that it was the first
experiment which gave me, although not very satisfactorily,
the effect of decomposition by heat alone. The reason of
its uncertainty I believe to have been the want of a suffi
ciently intense heat, as I dared not venture on account of
the gold solder to push the ignition very far; in fact, I sub
sequently fused the extremity and spoiled the apparatus by
applying the oxyhydrogen flame to it; had the platinum tube
been welded instead of gold-soldered, it would doubtless have
succeeded better. I should state that the object of the silver
tube was to prevent the chance of recomposition by the cata
lytic effect of a large platinum surface; to have, in short, a
small portion of platinum exposed to the steam, and that at a
high temperature: occonomy was also no indifferent consi
deration. This experiment, although, coupled with the pre
vious ones, tolerably conclusive, did not satisfy me, and I
attacked the difficulty in another manner. The experiment
(fig. 5) induced me to believe that if I could get platinum
ignited under water so as to be in an atmosphere of steam,
decomposition would take place; and M. Boutigny’s experi
ments on the spheroidal state of water led me to hope I might
keep platinum for some time under conditions suitable for my
purpose.
   After a few failures I succeeded perfectly by the following
experiment. The extremity of a stout platinum wire was
fused into a globule of the size of a peppercorn, by a nitric
acid battery of thirty cells; prepared water was kept simmer
ing by a spirit-lamp, with a tube filled with water inverted in
it; charcoal being the negative terminal, the voltaic arc was
taken between that and the platinum globule until the latter
was at the point of fusion; the circuit was now broken, and
the highly incandescent platinum plunged into the prepared
water: separate pearly bubbles of gas rose into the tube, pre
senting a somewhat similar effect to experiment (fig. 5). The
process was repeated, the globule being frequently plunged
into the water in a state of actual fusion; and when a sufficient
 quantity of gas was collected it was examined, it detonated,

34     Mr. Grove on the Decomposition of Water by Heat.
leaving 0-4 residue ; this was as usual nitrogen with a trace
of oxygen. A second experiment gave a still better result,
the gas contracting to 0.25 of its original volume.
    On making the platinum negative and the charcoal positive,
a very different result followed : the carbon was, as is known
to electricians, projected upon the platinum; and the gas in
this case was mixed with carburetted hydrogen and carbonic
 oxide. I know no experiment which shows so strikingly the
 different effects at the disruptive terminals as this; when the
platinum is negative it gives much carbonic gas, when it is po
sitive, not a trace (the gas was delicately and carefully tested
for it); nay, more, by changing the platinum from negative to
positive the carbon is instantly removed, and in a single ex
periment the platinum becomes perfectly clean.
    Here then I produced very satisfactorily decomposition by
heat; it is true, the battery was used, but used only as a means
of fusing the platinum, as this was, as soon as fused, entirely
separated from the circuit and could have no possible voltaic
action. Wishing however altogether to avoid the use of the
battery, I repeated this experiment, employing as my means
of fusing the platinum the oxyhydrogen blowpipe; the expe
riment was equally successful, perhaps more so, as the mani
pulation was more easy.
    I could readily by this means collect half a cubic inch or
more of the gas; when detonated, the residue of nitrogen
averaged 0-35 of the original volume.
    In carefully watching this experiment, I observed that at
first a rapid succession of bubbles ascended into the tube from
the incandescent platinum, it then became quiescent; the
spheroidal state was assumed by the water and no gas
ascended; on losing the spheroidal state a sudden hiss was
heard, and a single bubble ascended into the tube. I deter
mined to examine separately the gas from the platinum before
and after the quiescent state; to effect this I placed two in
verted tubes in the capsule with the orifices near each other;
the platinum at the point of fusion was immersed under one
tube, say tube A, and as soon as the ascent of bubbles ceased,
it was removed across to tube B, and the last bubble then
entered that tube; the gases from each tube were separately
analysed, and tube A gave nearly all detonating gas, the re
sidue being only 0:2; tube B gave none; the gas collected in
it was nitrogen, with a trace of oxygen.
   In order to examine the effect of an oxidable metal under
similar circumstances, I fused by the oxyhydrogen blowpipe
the end of a stout iron wire, plunged it into prepared water
and collected the globules of gas; no oxygen was given off,

V. Invention of Flutions. By CHARLEs Richard WELD, Esq.
  To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
IN the course of my researches in the archives of the Royal
     Society, with reference to a history of the Society which I
am compiling, I have been much struck with a very remark
able discrepancy on a most important point, connected with
the celebrated dispute of the invention of fluxions, between the
original Minutes of the Society and the statements of writers
on this subject.
   Sir David Brewster and Professor De Morgan, following
others, state that at a meeting of the Society held on the 20th
of May 1714, a resolution was inserted in the Minutes, that
“it was never intended that the report of the committee was
to pass for a decision of the Society”.” This alludes to the
report presented by the committee appointed by the Society
to determine the question of the invention of fluxions. Now
the exact words of the minute are these:—
   “It was not judged proper (since this letter was not directed
to them t) for the Society to concern themselves therewith,
nor were they desired so to do; but that if any person had
any material objection against the Commercium or the report
of the committee, it might be reconsidered at any timef.”
   There is nothing here to show that the Society resolved (and
this is the word Mr. De Morgan uses) upon repudiating the
report of their committee; so far from this, the opposite con
clusion is at once obvious, which is in keeping with the ori
ginal resolution of the Society adopting the report of their
Committee, nemine contradicente. The point is of great mo
ment; for had the Society come to the resolution as repre
sented, a strong case would be made out against Newton. I
have examined the Minutes of the meeting in question with
the greatest care, and confidently assert that there is no other
allusion to the dispute between Leibnitz and Newton. In
conclusion, I wish to state that it is at the request of some of

VI. Researches on the Composition and Characters of certain
   Soils and Waters belonging to the Flaw districts of Belgium,
   and on the Chemical Constitution of the Ashes of the Flaw
   Plant.     By Sir Robert KANE, M.D., M.R.I.A.4
ABQUT.         two years since, I had the honour to submit to
       the Royal Irish Academy the results of some inquiries
into the chemical composition of the flax and hemp plants,
and into the chemical phaenomena of the treatment which they
undergo in the preparation of the ligneous fibre for the pur
poses of the arts. The main object of that memoir was to
point out that, whilst the plant, as a whole, was rich in alka
lies, earths, sulphuric and phosphoric acids, &c., the fibre, as
ultimately purchased in the market, was practically destitute
of all these materials, which therefore remained amongst the
substances removed from the plants during their preparation,
and hitherto rejected as of no use. Those results being pub
lished in the Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, and
copied thence into various agricultural books and journals,
have in some degree led to the oeconomising of those valuable
residues; and it is to be hoped that, according as the atten
tion of farmers becomes more definitely fixed upon the real
and philosophical principles of the growth and composition of
various crops, the utilization of the different parts of plants
will be still more carefully attended to.
   The researches to which I have referred, involved the de
termination of the elementary composition of the plants, only
so far as it was necessary to prove the presence and propor
tional quantity of certain materials in the plant as it grows,
and their'absence in the fibre as prepared; but it was not my
design therein at all to discuss the very important questions,
so fundamental to vegetable chemistry and physiology, of the
degree within which the composition of the ashes of a plant
may vary; or whether there is any general expression within
which the constitution of the mineral elements of a plant is
necessarily contained; or finally, whether there can be traced

             of certain Soils and Waters in Belgium.            37
any positive relation between the composition of the plant and
the composition of the soil upon which it grows. To answer
these questions even approximatively, will require investiga
tions frequently repeated, and the concurrent labours of many
different investigators; and although my present inquiries may
serve to furnish certain grounds for arriving at an opinion upon
these points, I would not in any way be understood as putting
them forward with that view.
    My main object, in the inquiry which forms the subject of
the present paper, was to ascertain, if possible, whether there
existed any difference between the composition of the ashes of
the ordinary flax of Ireland and the flax grown in those loca
lities in Belgium, where that plant is known to yield a fibre of
so much commercial value.         Further, to ascertain the compo
sition of the soils of those districts, in order to compare them
with the soils of the localities in Ireland where flax is, or may
be, successfully cultivated. Finally, as it is known that in the
preparation of the fibre the most important stage consists in
the steeping or retting of the plant, I considered it of the
greatest interest to trace, if possible, whether the superior qua
lities of some rivers or ponds in Belgium could be connected
with any peculiarity of chemical constitution. For the mate
rials and specimens necessary for these investigations, I am
indebted to the kindness and liberality of Mr. Marshall of
Leeds; who was anxious also to connect therewith the dis
cussion of some most important points of special technical
application, for which, however, the pressure of other avoca
tions did not allow me time. I therefore publish the results
contained in the present paper, solely under their scientific
relations to agricultural chemistry and physiology, and shall
not enter upon any considerations belonging to manufacturing
practice.
   Before entering into the description of the numerical re
sults of the analyses, I think it better to premise a succinct
notice of the modes of analyses adopted for the different classes
of substances, as I shall thereby be enabled to avoid a great
deal of repetition.
   1. Qf the Modes of Analyses used for the Ashes, Soils and
                           Waters.
    The preparation of the flax-ashes was effected by chopping
up the plant stems into moderately small bits, and then car
bonizing them gently in a Hessian crucible. The material so
obtained was further incinerated by very gentle ignition in a
platinum capsule over a gas flame; but it was not in any way
sought to burn off all charcoal, or to obtain the ash perfectly

38 Sir Robert Kane on the Composition and Characters
white, as such would require a temperature capable of mate
rially altering the constitution of the ash, a fact of which I
have been long aware, and which has latterly fixed the atten
tion of several chemists. The ash so prepared was carefully
dried in a stove, and then treated in the following manner:—
   Dilute muriatic acid having been poured over the quantity
of ash selected for analysis, the whole was heated in a water
bath until it dried completely down; water was then added,
and when the soluble materials had been completely taken up,
the whole was thrown upon a weighed filter and the liquor
separated; there remained upon the filter such particles of
sand or soil as had been adherent to the plants, the unburned
charcoal of the ash, and the silica which had existed in the ash,
either free or in combination with alkaline or earthy bases.
   The weight of this insoluble residue having been properly
determined, it was boiled in a strong solution of caustic potash,
by which all the proper silica of the ash was taken up, and
the residue then remaining being weighed, gave the sand and
charcoal, the silica being thus determined by difference.
   The muriatic solution was then divided into three parts for
the determination—
   1. Of the alkaline constituents.
   2. Of the phosphoric acid, manganese, alumina, magnesia,
and lime.
   3. Of the sulphuric acid and oxide of iron.
   The first portion of solution was rendered slightly alkaline
by carbonate of ammonia, and then mixed with solution of
caustic barytes in excess, and allowed to stand for some hours.
By this means the sulphuric and phosphoric acid were perfectly
removed, as well as the earthy constituents, except a small
quantity of lime, which remained dissolved in a caustic state,
and which was then perfectly removed by the addition in ex
cess of a mixture of caustic and carbonated ammonia.         The
liquor, after filtration, was evaporated to dryness, and the
residue gently ignited, when the ammoniacal salts were per
fectly expelled: there remained the alkalies of the ash as
chlorides.    This residue was weighed, then dissolved in water,
and a solution of bichloride of platinum added. The liquor
and precipitate were then evaporated nearly to dryness, the
potash platinum salt washed by a mixture of alcohol and aether,
and the amount of platinum determined in the usual way.
The soda was ascertained by subtracting the weight of the
chloride of potassium from the weight of the mixed chlorides,
as given in the first instance.
   To the second portion of the liquor was added so much
ammonia as nearly neutralized it without producing any per

             of certain Soils and Waters in Belgium.              39
manent precipitate. A quantity of perchloride of iron was then
added, and acetate of potash, until a deep wine-red colour was
produced; the liquor was then boiled until all odour of acetic
acid ceased, and a copious brown precipitate formed, which
was separated by the filter. This precipitate was then re
dissolved in muriatic acid, boiled until all odour of acetic acid
ceased, and the liquor then precipitated by ammonia. The
precipitate, collected on a filter, was dried, ignited, and weighed,
then redissolved by muriatic acid. A quantity of tartaric acid
was added to the liquor, and ammonia then added in such
excess as to redissolve the precipitate which first forms. To
the solution thus got, hydrosulphuret of ammonia was added
in excess, the sulphuret of iron collected on a filter, and, when
washed, redissolved in aqua regia. The peroxide of iron,
precipitated from the liquor by ammonia, collected, dried,
ignited and weighed, and its weight subtracted from the weight
of the basic phosphate previously given, determines in an ab
solute manner the quantity of phosphoric acid.
   To the liquor from which the phosphoric acid had been
separated by the means described above, hydrosulphuret of
ammonia was added, by which a precipitate was formed, which
was collected, and, while moist, boiled with caustic potash
liquor; the undissolved matter was dissolved in muriatic acid
nearly neutralized, and treated with benzoate of ammonia; by
this a trace of iron, generally remaining from the preceding
process, was removed, and the manganese was then precipi
tated by carbonate of ammonia, collected, ignited and weighed.
The potash liquor was then acidulated by muriatic acid, and
the alumina which it had dissolved was precipitated, and its
quantity determined in the usual way.
   The solution, from which the iron, alumina, and manga
nese had thus been separated by hydrosulphuret of ammonia,
was next boiled until all odour of sulphuretted hydrogen
ceased, and then treated with oxalate of ammonia, the oxalate
of lime collected was gently ignited with carbonate of ammonia,
and the quantity of lime determined. The liquor was then
very much concentrated by evaporation, and treated with
phosphate of soda and ammonia, set aside until the ammoniaco
magnesian phosphate had perfectly deposited, and the quan
tity of magnesia determined from that of the latter salt.
    The third portion of the ash liquor was treated with nitric
 acid, so as perfectly to peroxidize the iron; it was then de
 composed by chloride of barium, by which all the sulphuric
 acid was separated as sulphate of barytes, collected and weighed.
 To the filtered liquor there was added a great excess of phos
 phate of soda and ammonia, and then an excess of acetic acid.

40 Sir Robert Kane on the Composition and Characters
By boiling, the whole of the iron separated as perphosphate,
and was collected, ignited, and the quantity of oxide of iron
calculated from its weight.
   For the determination of the chlorine, a totally distinct
portion of ash was taken, digested with water, acidulated with
nitric acid, and then precipitated with nitrate of silver in the
usual way.                  -
   It will be observed that, in all its main features, this plan
of examination of the ash coincides with that employed by
Will and Fresenius, and proposed by them in their memoir
on the Composition of certain Ashes. It is, however, that
which I had followed in all my former ash analyses, except
in regard to the determination of the phosphoric acid, for
which I had previously made use of the method proposed by
Schulze, but now replaced with so much advantage by that
invented by Will.
   It is necessary, however, to remark, that the composition
of the perphosphate of iron, given by Will, and upon which
he founds his mode of determining the quantity of oxide of
iron, has been contested very recently by Wittstein, who has
not succeeded in preparing that salt with the composition
assigned to it by Will. According to the latter chemist, it
consists, in its anhydrous form, of 2Fe2O3 + 3POs, that is,
              2Fe2O3 . . . 160                 42'89
              3PO. . . . . 213                 57.11
                                  373         100'00
whilst the salt uniformly obtained by the other chemists was
Fe, Os--POs, or
              Fe2O3 .   .   .  .   80         52'98

                                 151         100'00
 But the circumstances of preparation of the different salts do
not appear to have been quite identical; and I do not, there
fore, reject Will's numbers, which have been, moreover,
verified by some trials made in my own laboratory. I have
consequently employed his formula in calculating the amount
of iron in the different materials; but it is easy to calculate,
for each analysis, the change (in most cases trifling) which the
employment of Wittstein's formula for the perphosphate should
introduce.
   In the examination of the soils, the process consisted, first,
in mechanically separating the sandy and gravelly materials
from the finely-divided portion, by careful elutriation with the
smallest possible quantity of pure water. This having been

            of certain Soils and Waters in Belgium.          41
done, and the quantity of sand determined by direct weighing,
the finely-divided earthy material was carefully dried at the
highest temperature it would bear without its organic consti
tuents being injured, and then weighed. It was then carefully
but gently ignited in a current of air, until the organic mate
rials were burned out, and was then again weighed. The loss
of weight gave the quantity of organic substance, together,
however, with some traces of water, from which the soil could
not be previously perfectly freed.
   The soil was then subjected, for the determination of its
chemical constituents, to precisely the same general plan of
treatment which I have described in the case of the ash. The
matter, insoluble in muriatic acid, was however found to be
(the sand and organic matters having been previously sepa
rated) ferruginous clay, which it was not necessary further to
examine, as all the materials of importance, in studying the
chemical nature of the soil, had been taken up by the different
solvents used.
   In the case of the waters, the quantity employed for ana
lysis was, with one exception, about two gallons; in that case,
owing to a vessel having leaked (No. 3), but one gallon was
employed. The waters were, in the first instance, very care
fully filtered; and where any sensible quantity of sediment
was found upon the filter, its nature and quantity observed.
   The water was then evaporated, at first upon the sand-bath,
but finally upon a water-bath, to perfect dryness, and the re
sidue having been collected and dried at 212°, was weighed.
It was then incinerated ; the residue, moistened with carbonate
of ammonia, again gently ignited and weighed. By the dif
ference of weight, the quantity of organic matter present was
ascertained in the state in which it exists when dried at 212°
Fahrenheit.
   The solid material thus obtained was treated with water,
until all soluble salts were taken up, and the alkalies, lime,
magnesia, with sulphuric and muriatic acids, therein deter
mined.     The undissolved residue was next treated with muri
atic acid, and the amount and nature of the earthy substances
taken up, as well as oxides of iron, &c., and phosphoric acid,
if any, ascertained. The material insoluble in muriatic acid,
when present, was of course determined.
   The detailed modes of analyses pursued in these cases were
precisely the same as in those of the ashes and soils.
   In carrying out the greater part of the practical details of
these analytical methods, I derived valuable aid from Mr.
William Sullivan, then my private assistant, but now first
chemical assistant in the Museum of Irish Industry, founded
by Her Majesty's Government in Dublin.

   By these analytical results, it is abundantly evident how
completely due to artificial means is the fertility of those dif
ferent Belgian soils; the large quantity of azotized organic
matter, the proportionally large quantities of phosphoric acid
and magnesia, and of the alkalies, being evidently the result
of the copious treatment with animal manures, to which, as all
persons conversant with Flemish agriculture are aware, the
soil in Belgium is subjected. This will become still more
evident, when hereafter I have to notice the course of cultiva
tion which those soils are made to undergo. The duty, so
important in the preparation of our Irish soils for flax, of di
viding the soil to the finest possible state, and rendering it
perfectly friable and porous, is seen by the above results to be
naturally effected in the Belgian soils, of which a well-manured,
incoherent sand, might be more correctly the title; none of
them containing, except that marked A, and that from Hol
land, E, as much clay as would even justify the title of a light
loam.    There is, therefore, no doubt but that the soils most
adapted for the successful growth of flax are of this very light
and porous character; and that, in the selection of districts in
this country into which the flax culture may be extended, this
quality of lightness and permeability of soil is of the first im
portance,
   The quantity of lime contained in the Belgian soils will be
observed to be extremely small; but in that from Holland
and from the Lincolnshire warped land it is much larger, in
deed so as to constitute the most dominant earthy material.
This has evidently had its cause in the source from whence
these soils were derived, the silt deposited in shallow, quiescent
waters by the sea, and which contains, mixed with sand, a
proportion of comminuted shells or chalk. There is no posi
tive evidence that this amount of lime is connected with any
decided inferiority in the flax; but it is still worthy of atten
tion, that the soil of the districts which have been longest and
best known for the production of good flax have but a mere
trace of lime in their constitution.
   The comparatively large quantity of magnesia which the
Belgian soils contain, and which is so remarkably contrasted
with its inferior proportion in the warp soil, is, in my opinion,
produced by the artificial manuring by animal liquids; and
to this source also I attribute the great richness of these soils
in phosphoric acid.

              VII. On the Colouring Matters of Madder.
                           By Dr. Schunck”.
       HE organic colouring matters present such a wide field for in
         quiry, that it would require the labour of years to enable one
  person fully to elucidate their properties, or even to bring this depart
  ment of organic chemistry into a state of development proportionate
  to the present condition of the science. The substances included under
  the name of colouring matters by no means agree in their chemical
  characteristics; they merely coincide in being possessed of certain
  vivid colours, or in giving rise to coloured compounds. Strictly con
  sidered, some of them ought to be classed among the resins and others
  among the extractive matters; and on the other hand, if we attempt
  a definition of the class according to their chemical characteristics,
 we shall find it impossible to exclude a large number of bodies, which,
 like tannin and catechin, are capable of giving rise under peculiar
 circumstances to brown substances, which in nowise differ in their
 general properties from the bright red colouring matters of archil,
 logwood, &c. Some colouring matters are presented to us ready
 formed in the different parts of plants and animals; others are pro
 duced artificially from colourless substances, which undergo very
 complex changes during the process; others arise spontaneously
 during the first stages of oxidation or putrefaction following the ex
 tinction of organic life. In the investigation of substances thus
 widely differing in properties and formation, it would be vain to
 expect at present anything approaching to general results in regard
 to the class as a whole. I must therefore content myself on this
 occasion with giving a short account of the results of some ex
 periments which I have made on one branch of the subject, at the
 same time apologising for their present vague and undefined nature.
    I have directed my attention in the first instance to madder, partly
 because the colouring matters contained in it are almost unknown,
 or rather worse than unknown, viz. known in such a manner as
 merely to mislead those who wish to inform themselves by the ac
counts given of them, and partly because madder is an article of such
an immense importance in the art of dyeing that every discovery in
relation to it acquires immediately a practical bearing.
    It will be unnecessary for me to allude to the former numerous
investigations of madder, except so far as to mention that Robiquet
discovered in it a crystallized volatile colouring matter, which he
called Alizarin, and that Runge described five colouring matters
which he obtained from it, viz. madder purple, madder red, madder
orange, madder yellow and madder brown. I may here state as one
result of my investigation, that I agree with Runge in thinking that
there is more than one colouring matter in madder, though I am of
opinion that the substances which he enumerates and describes are
not pure. Before however entering on this part of the subject, I
shall first give the results at which I have arrived in regard to ali
              * From Report of British Association for 1846.

       Dr. Schunck on the Colouring Matters of Madder.               47
zarin.    Alizarin is doubtless the most interesting and the most
definite in its nature of all the substances contained in madder.      It
also presents itself the most easily to the observer even on the most
superficial examination.     If we heat madder spread out in a thin
layer on a metal plate without carrying the heat far enough to char
the woody parts of the root, we shall in the course of a few hours
find its surface covered with small red or orange-coloured crystals,
which consist of alizarin. In the same way any extract of madder,
whether with water, alcohol or alkalies, evaporated to dryness and
gently heated, gives a crystalline sublimate of alizarin, which is va
riously coloured from a light yellow to a dark red or brown. Now
one of the first points to be ascertained in regard to this body was
whether it exists as such in the root, or whether it is formed by the
process of sublimation. Robiquet, the discoverer, states that it pre
exists in the plant. He considered alizarin as the colouring principle
of madder, and merely subjected it to sublimation for the purpose
of purifying it. But his investigation presents us with no convincing
proof of this opinion, for the extract of madder with water, alcohol,
&c., from which he prepares his alizarin by sublimation, shows no
trace of anything crystalline; and many chemists have asserted in
consequence that it is a product of decomposition, being formed by
the action of heat in the same way as pyrogallic, pyrotartaric acid,
and many other bodies.       I have however no hesitation in affirming
that it exists in the plant as such, having in more than one way ob
tained it in a crystallized state without the intervention of heat.
If we make an extract of madder with cold water, we obtain a brown
fluid which produces no reaction on test-paper. After being ex
posed however to the action of the atmosphere for some hours, it
acquires a distinctly acid reaction; and if it be now examined care
fully, there will be found floating about in it a number of long hair
like shining crystals: these crystals are alizarin. If the fluid be still
further exposed to the influence of the atmosphere, a yellow amor
phous substance begins to separate, which I shall mention afterwards.
This is succeeded by a gelatinous substance, and after some days a
complete state of putrefaction ensues. It seems as if the alizarin in
madder, or at all events that part which dissolves in the water, exists
in combination with lime. On exposure to the atmosphere, there
is formed, from some constituent of the root dissolved in the fluid
 through the instrumentality of the oxygen, some acid, which seizes
 hold of the lime in the solution and separates the bodies which are
 combined with the lime. Now the alizarin, being a body of very
 slightly acid properties, is separated first, and the other substances
 follow in succession. The fresher the madder is, the purer will be
the alizarin, which separates on exposure to the atmosphere; in some
 instances it forms on the surface of the fluid a thick light yellow
 scum; but in most cases it is mixed with brown or red substances,
 from which it is separated with difficulty. It is therefore most
 advisable to separate the crystals which are deposited after twelve
 hours' standing, by filtration. These crystals are then washed from
 the filter and boiled with very dilute nitric acid until they have be

 come of a bright yellow colour. They are then dissolved in boiling
 alcohol, from which they separate on cooling in yellow transparent
 plates and needles having a strong lustre. Alizarin prepared in
 this way has the following properties:—It has a pure yellow colour
 without any admixture of red. It may be volatilized without leaving
 any residue. The vapour crystallizes on cooling in beautiful yellow
 plates and needles. It suffers hardly any change if exposed to the
 action of the most powerful reagents. It dissolves without change
 in cold concentrated sulphuric acid. Concentrated nitric acid hardly
 affects it even on boiling. It is not changed by chlorine. It is in
 soluble in water, but soluble in alcohol with a yellow colour. It
 dissolves in alkalies with a beautiful purple colour. Its compounds
 with the alkaline earths are red and slightly soluble in water. Its
 compounds with the earths and metallic oxides are insoluble in water
 and exhibit different shades of red. It imparts no colour to cloth
 mordanted with acetate of alumina or oxide of iron, on account of
 its insolubility in water. Very little alizarin is obtained in this way;
 perhaps one 1 gr, from 1 lb. of madder, though there is more of it
 contained in the root.
    I shall now shortly describe two other colouring matters which I
 have obtained from madder.       If an extract of madder be made with
 hot or cold water, and a strong acid, such as muriatic or sulphuric
 acid, be added to the fluid, a dark reddish-brown flocculent preci
 pitate is produced. This precipitate was separated by filtration and
washed until the acid was removed. On being treated with boiling
water, a part of it dissolves with a brown colour.      On adding a few
drops of acid to the filtered solution a dark brown precipitate is
produced, which seems to me to be a peculiar colouring matter
similar in its properties to orcein, hematin and other soluble colour
ing matters. It dissolves in alkalies with a red colour, and is capable
of imparting very lively colours to mordanted cloth. As far as I
am aware it has not been described in the former investigations of
this subject, though it seems to be the principal substance concerned
in the production of the colours for which madder is used in the
arts. I have however only examined it very slightly as yet. The
residue left behind by the boiling water was treated with dilute
boiling nitric acid, by which every trace of the preceding substance is
destroyed, and the residue itself acquires a bright yellow colour
and a more powdery consistence. This yellow powder contains
alizarin, as is shown by its giving crystals of that substance on
being gently heated; in fact it contains all the alizarin of the root,
but mixed with another substance of an amorphous nature but very
similar properties, from which it is difficult to separate it. By crys
tallising from alcohol no separation can be effected, as they are both
about equally soluble in that menstruum. They also behave in a
similar manner towards the alkalies, the earths and most of the me
tallic oxides. I have hitherto only succeeded in discovering one
method of separating them, which is as follows:—The mixture of the
two is dissolved in a little caustic potash. To the solution is added
perchloride of iron, which produces a dark reddish-brown precipi

           Analysis of the Urine of the Calf and Sheep.                    49
tate consisting of peroxide of iron in combination with the two sub
stances. Now on boiling this precipitate with an excess of perchlo
ride of iron, the alizarate of iron dissolves, forming a dark brown so
lution, while the iron compound of the other substance remains
behind. On adding muriatic acid to the filtered solution, the alizarin
separates in yellow flocks and may be purified by crystallization from
alcohol. The other substance, to which I have not yet given a
name, is obtained by decomposing its iron compound, which remains
behind on treating with perchloride of iron, with muriatic acid, and
washing till all the oxide of iron is removed.         It seems also to be a
colouring matter, as it dissolves with a red colour in alkalies and
gives red compounds with the earths and metallic oxides.                 It is
insoluble in water, but soluble in alcohol with a yellow colour. It
therefore resembles the resins in its general properties. It cannot
be obtained in a crystallized state. From a hot concentrated solu
tion in alcohol it separates on cooling as a yellow powder. It im
parts no colour to mordanted cloth.

50          Mr. Hind on the expected Reappearance of
  IX. On the expected Reappearance of the celebrated Comet of
                1264 and 1556. By Mr. HIND+.
YHYPHE time is now near at hand when the return of the comet
      of 1264 and 1556, signalised by Mr. Dunthorne and M.
Pingré, may be expected to take place. It is therefore de
sirable that observers should be in possession of everything
that may tend to facilitate their search for the comet; and I
Venture to communicate to the Society the results of some re
cent calculations of my own on the subject, preceded by a very
brief view of the principal circumstances connected with former
appearances of the comet, and a short notice of calculations
already published.
    “The great and celebrated comet” of 1264, as Pingré
terms it, is mentioned by nearly all the European historians
of the time, and was observed by the astronomers of the dy
nasties then reigning in the north and south of China. It is
described as presenting a most imposing appearance, with a
tail 100° in length, stretching from the east part of the “mid
heaven.” The comet was of “surprising magnitude,” far
exceeding any remembered by those who beheld it. Contem
porary writers generally considered it the precursor of the
death of Pope Urban IV., and many of them relate that it
disappeared on the same night that the pope died, or on Oc
tober 2; thus, in the words of Thierri de Vaucouleurs,
       “Quo (Urbano) moriente, velut mortem cognosceret ejus,
           Apparens minime stella comata fuit.”     -
   In 1556 the appearance of the comet was not on the same
scale of splendour as in 1264, but still was sufficiently imposing
to call forth from historians the epithets “ingens et lucidum
sidus.” It was observed by Paul Fabricius, a mathematician
and physician at the court of the emperor Charles V. of Au
stria. M. Pingré, the celebrated cometographer, sought in vain
for the original observations; the only information he could find
on the subject was contained in a small rough chart found in
Lycosthenes and other authors. I have beforet suggested the
probability that these observations were given by Fabricius in
his work upon the comet, published at Nürnberg in 1556, and
mentioned by Lalande in his Bibliographie; but, as far as I
am aware, this work has not been discovered in any library.
M. Pingré would have at his command the splendid collec
tions of St. Geneviève and the Royal Library at Paris; and his
ineffectual search for the observations in these libraries makes
it at least doubtful whether they are now in existence. The
chart just mentioned enables us to form a tolerably definite

              the celebrated Comet of 1264 and 1556.              51
 idea of the path followed by the comet, and we have ample
 information for a rough determination of the elements.
    When Halley published his Synopsis of Cometary Astro
 nomy, he gave a set of parabolic elements for the comet of
 1556, founded upon the observations made by Paul Fabricius;
 but he remarks that these elements are not so certain as those
 of other comets he had computed, the observations being made
 “neither with sufficient instruments nor due care,” and by no
 means to be reconciled with any regular calculation.
    The elements of the comet of 1264 were first computed by
 Mr. Dunthorne.       His discussion of the observations and cir
 cumstances relating to the comet's apparition are published in
 vol. xlvii. of the Philosophical Transactions. The elements
are chiefly founded on the authority of a manuscript preserved
 in the library of Pembroke Hall College, Cambridge, entitled
 Tractatus fratris AEgidii de Cometis.     But it must be observed
there are manifest contradictions in this account not easily set
right. The other authorities consulted were the Chronicon
Sampetrinum Erphurtense and the Chronicle of John Vitodu
ranus. The orbit deduced by Mr. Dunthorne much resem
bles that calculated by Halley for the comet of 1556.
    In the Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris
for 1760, appears a valuable memoir by M. Pingré on the
comet of 1264. After collecting together a great number of
accounts from different chronicles and histories of the day,
he proceeds to the discussion of the elements. The contra
diction in the Cambridge manuscript which relates to the
comet's motion in longitude is pointed out; and since this
manuscript was Mr. Dunthorne's chief authority, it might be
supposed that his orbit would differ entirely from M. Pingré's.
This, however, was not the case; for although there are dif
ferences of some moment in one or two of the elements, there
is still a striking similarity between the two orbits taken as a
whole, and M. Pingré's approaches much nearer than Mr.
Dunthorne's to the orbit of the comet of 1556.             A closer
agreement might have been produced if he had not wished to
preserve the path laid down by Thierri de Vaucouleurs with
as little alteration as possible. M. Pingré concludes from his
researches that there is little doubt of the identity of the comets
of 1264 and 1556, and, therefore, that the return to perihelion
may be expected to take place in the year 1848. In No. 493
of the Astronomische Nachrichten will be found the results of
my first calculations relating to this comet. I have there de
duced elements from the observations by Fabricius in 1556,
and computed an ephemeris for comparison with the comet's
observed path. The agreement, though not so close as could
be wished, was the best that could be obtained from the data
                                E 2

52         Mr. Hind on the expected Reappearance of
given by M. Pingré in his Cometography. I then reduced the
elements to the year 1264, and with the assistance of a passage
in Thierri's poem, I fixed the time of perihelion for July 9.9
(old style). The passage alluded to is as follows:–
           “Undecimumque gradum Phoebo superante Leonis,
              Ter demo Cancri restitit illa loco.”
   With M. Pingré, I have understood by “Ter deno Cancri,”
the 120th degree of longitude; but I am not quite sure that
this is the true interpretation.
   With perihelion and node reduced as before stated, and the
other elements as for 1556, an ephemeris of the comet’s geo
centric path in 1264 was computed. During the month of
July, calculation and observation agree pretty well; but after
the beginning of August the theoretical places entirely differ
from the positions of the comet, as deduced from the accounts.
Instead of traversing Orion towards the end of its appearance,
as some historians relate, it would take a higher declination,
passing through Auriga and Taurus.
   Since the publication of this paper in the Astronomische
Nachrichten, I have made some further investigations on the
subject, and with more success than in my first calculations.
A closer comparison of data showed pretty clearly that the
observation of March 5, on which I had chiefly relied, must
be erroneous as it is given by M. Pingré. In tome i. of his
Cometography, p. 503, we learn that on March 5 the comet
was almost in the right line joining the stars y and 0 Virginis,
and was equidistant from the stars. A trigonometrical cal
culation from these data gives the place of the comet in lon
gitude 188° 1', and latitude +2°19', and this position was
employed in my earlier investigations. But I have recently
satisfied myself, that the observation as given above cannot be
reconciled with those of March 3 and 4, and on subsequent
days, by any set of elements. The cause of this anomaly is,
I believe, an error in the name of the star. If instead of y
and 0. Virginis we read 3 and 0, then the place of the comet
would be in longitude 188° 41', and latitude +5° 13', which
agrees very well with the track which the comet ought to have
followed, according to the other observations.
   A recalculation of the elements from an interpolated posi
tion for March 5, and from those of March 9 and 14, gives
the following values:—

   If this ephemeris be compared with the descriptions of the
comet's apparent path in the heavens, we shall find the agree
ment as close as could be expected, considering the uncer
tainty and irregularity of the data.
    With the above elements reduced to 1264, the time of pe
rihelion was found to be July 13:42, i.e. assuming with Pingré,
 that the comet was in longitude 120° when the sun had reached
 the 11th degree of Leo, according to the narration of Thierri
 de Vaucouleurs. The geocentric places of the comet, Green
 wich mean midnight, old style, would then be as follows:–

    If we are to depend solely on the European accounts of
 this comet's path, the above is liable to two objections: first,
 too high a declination in August; and secondly, that the posi

54        Mr. Hind on the earpected Reappearance of
tions are in Eridanus during the latter part of the comet's
apparition; historians generally contenting themselves with
stating that the comet “finally traversed Orion.” M. Pingré's
elements, which are not open to these objections, do not agree
so well as mine with the more circumstantial details left us in
the Chinese annals. The two orbits differ chiefly in the lon
gitude of the node and perihelion distance, but the discord
ances are by no means great.
   The results of my calculations have satisfied me that the
comet of 1264 was, in all probability, the same as that of 1556,
and consequently, that its return to perihelion must be very
near at hand. The nodes of the comet's orbit lie very close
to the earth's path. The ascending node is passed fifty days
before perihelion, the radius vector being 1.193, and conse
quently the distance outside the earth's orbit about 0.197.
The passage through descending node occurs 314 days after
perihelion, and the distance of the point from the earth’s orbit
inside is 0 126.    However, the nearest approach of the comet
to the earth will not happen at the nodes, but soon after its
passage through them; thus in 1556 the least distance between
the two bodies was 0.074, nine days after the transit through
ascending node. The effect of this close proximity to our
globe on the period of revolution of the comet has been inves
tigated by Professor Mädler, of the Dorpat Observatory, as
detailed in No. 501 of the Astronomische Nachrichten; it
amounted to 14 days only, and the return of the comet to
perihelion was fixed for the end of February 1848.

   It appears from this ephemeris, that according to the most
probable supposition we can make respecting the time of pe
rihelion without actual calculation of the perturbations, the
position of the comet in the heavens during the approaching
reappearance will be extremely unfavourable for observation;
and it is therefore the more desirable that those who look
out for comets should be on the alert. Nearly the whole of
the vast trajectory of this comet lies below the plane of the
ecliptic, and far from the paths of the larger planets, but it ex
tends into space more than twice the distance of Neptune;
and surely we are not yet able to say what causes may operate,
at this immense distance from the sun, to affect the time of the
next return to perihelion.         If however the comet can be de
 tected and observed, we shall then have the means of ascer
 taining something more on these points

X. Analysis of the Water of the Thermal Spring of Bath
    (King’s Bath). By Messrs. GEORGE MERCK and Robert
    GALLow AY”.
THE water of this celebrated spring, the efficacy of which
       was known in the time of the Romans, has been analysed
repeatedly by various chemists at different periods. Richard
Phillips f, Scudamoret, WalkerS, and more recently Noad||,
have occupied themselves in the investigation of this water.
In their several analyses, the whole amount of the fixed ingre
dients of the water agrees very closely; but in regard to the
composition of these substances there are considerable dis
crepancies, as may be seen in a table which we have annexed
at the end of this paper.
    Besides great differences in the quantitative analysis, we
find discrepancies even in regard to the presence and absence
of certain constituents. Among the chemists that have been
mentioned, Walker is the only one who has recognised the
presence of potash. The same chemist corroborated Scuda
more’s statement as to the presence of magnesia, overlooked
by their predecessors; but he states also that he detected
alumina, which none of the others found. In all these ana
lyses iodine has been omitted. Mr. Cuff" however has in
dicated the presence of this element in the spring.                       -
    These discrepancies made another investigation of the mi
neral water of Bath very desirable; the following analysis was
performed at the suggestion of Dr. A. W. Hofmann.
    To obtain the water genuine, and especially for the pur
pose of ascertaining the amount of free carbonic acid it con
tained, we collected the water ourselves, an operation in which
we were kindly assisted by Messrs. Green and Simms, lessees
of the establishment.
    The water was taken from the principal well, which sup
plies the King's and Queen’s baths, which are the most
esteemed and valued in the city. Of the two other wells, one
supplies the Hot Bath and the other the Cross Bath, which
are in the neighbourhood of those first mentioned.

   * Memoir on the occurrence of Iodine and Bromine in certain Mineral
Waters of South Britain, by Charles Daubeny; Transactions of the Royal
Society of London, 1830, ii. p. 223.          -

    Analysis of the Water of the Thermal Spring of Bath. 57
    The King’s Bath is an oblong cistern, 65 feet long and 40
feet broad, in which the water stands at the height of 46
inches. It is supplied from the bottom by means of twelve
large and about twenty smaller apertures. By far the largest
amount of water rises however from an opening made in the
centre of the bath, 18 inches in diameter. Although the
water flows under the influence of a very small pressure, the
 quantity is such, that the two reservoirs, the King's and the
 Queen’s bath, are entirely filled in about mine hours. The
quantity of water entering each minute is 126 gallons, upon
the authority of Dr. Daubeny”.
                        I. Qualitative Analysis.
    The water as it issues from the well has a temperature of
46°C. (115° Fahr.), the temperature of the air being 20° C.
 (68°Fahr.); it is clear and without odour, and has no effect
upon vegetable colours; it has a saline and slight iron taste;
the iron is deposited as sesquioxide in rather large quantities
in the pipes leading from the well.
    The following experiments gave the qualitative composition
of the mineral water; on boiling for some time a white cry
stalline precipitate formed. The qualitative analysis was
therefore divided into two parts.
    a. The analysis of the precipitate formed on boiling.
    b. The analysis of the substances remaining dissolved.
         a. Analysis of the Precipitate formed on boiling.
    1. The precipitate was treated with hydrochloric acid; a
small portion of it dissolved with effervescence, indicating the
presence of carbonic acid. The portion insoluble in hydro
chloric acid dissolved on the addition of a large quantity of
water:—Indicating sulphate of lime.
    Another portion of the water was boiled some time, with
the precaution of replacing the evaporated water, in order
that all the sulphate of lime should remain in solution; in
this case only a very small precipitate was formed, which was
entirely soluble in hydrochloric acid.
    2. On heating this solution and adding ammonia, a very
slight flocculent precipitate of a yellowish-white colour was
‘produced after some time:–Indicating oride of iron.
    3. In the filtrate from the sesquioxide of iron (2.), on the
addition of oxalate of ammonia, a white precipitate was
formed:—Indicating salts of lime.
   * On the Quantity and Quality of the Gases disengaged from the Thermal
 Spring which supplies the King's Bath in the City of Bath, by Charles Dau
beny; Transactions of the Royal Society of London, 1834, I. i.

58          Messrs. Merck and Galloway’s Analysis of
   4. In the liquid filtered off from the oxalate of lime (3.),
phosphate of soda produced an exceedingly slight crystalline
precipitate:–Showing the presence of magnesia.
   Note.—This precipitate could only be distinctly seen in
testing a large quantity of the water.
       b. Analysis of the substances remaining dissolved.
   The liquid which was filtered from the precipitate (a.)
formed on boiling had no alkaline reaction; a portion of it
was evaporated nearly to dryness and treated with hydro
chloric acid; no carbonic acid was evolved, from which com
portment the absence of alkaline carbonates could with safety
be concluded.
   1. A portion of the liquid gave on addition of chloride of
barium a copious white precipitate, insoluble in hydrochloric
acid:—Indicating sulphuric acid.
   2. In another portion of the liquid nitrate of silver pro
duced a copious white precipitate, easily soluble in ammonia:
—Evidencing the presence of chlorine.
   3. The entire solubility of the silver precipitate seemed to
indicate the absence of iodides. To make ourselves perfectly
certain of the absence of these salts, 30 or 40 pounds of the
water were evaporated to 2 or 3 pounds, and the liquid filtered
off from the precipitate which had been formed; a part of this
fluid was evaporated with precaution to dryness, the residue
was mixed with some starch paste, and a few drops of nitric
acid being added, feeble but distinct violet spots were ob
served : this experiment was repeated several times with the
same success:–Indicating the presence of iodine.
   4. Another portion of the liquid (b.) was treated with hy
drochloric acid, evaporated to dryness, and gently ignited : on
treating the residue with a large quantity of water an insolu
ble portion remained:—Showing the presence of silicic acid.
   5. Another portion of the liquid (b.) gave, on addition of
chloride of ammonium and oxalate of ammonia, a white pre
cipitate:—Indicating lime.                               -
   6. On adding, to a portion of the filtrate, ammonia and
phosphate of soda, a slight crystalline precipitate was formed:
—Indicating magnesia.
   7. For the discovery of the alkalies, the remaining portion
of the filtrate from the lime precipitate was evaporated to
dryness, and the residue ignited until the ammoniacal salts
had been expelled. The ignited residue was then dissolved in
water, the sulphuric acid and magnesia precipitated by baryta
water, and after separation of the excess of baryta by means
of carbonate of ammonia, the filtrate evaporated to dryness

           the Water of the Thermal Spring of Bath.         59
and ignited. The residue imparted a yellow colour to the
blowpipe flame:–Evidencing the presence of soda.
   An alcoholic solution of the residue gave with a concen
trated solution of bichloride of platinum a yellow crystalline
precipitate:—Indicating potassa.
   The precipitate which had formed on evaporating for the
iodine determination, was treated with hydrochloric acid, the
filtrate saturated with ammonia and precipitated by sulphide
of ammonium; this precipitate was re-dissolved in nitro-hy
drochloric acid mixed with chloride of ammonium, and the
sesquioxide of iron separated by ammonia. The filtrate, eva
porated and fused with nitrate of potash and carbonate of
soda, gave a green mass:—Showing traces of manganese.
   Lithia, alumina, bromine and phosphoric acid were found
to be absent.                                                  -
   In regard to the presence of gases in the water, it was
scarcely necessary to test for the presence of free carbonic
acid.    On mixing a solution of lime with the mineral water a
precipitate was formed, which dissolved in an excess of the
mineral water. The quantity of free carbonic acid however
is not very large; the water has no reaction on blue vegeta
ble colours; hydrosulphuric acid is not contained in the water.
Acetate of lead gave only a white precipitate of sulphate of
lead free from all trace of brown colour, which might indicate
the presence of sulphur.
   A large quantity of gas is continually disengaged from the
chief spring as well as from the secondary ones. Dr. Dau
beny” paid particular attention to the composition of this gas.
He found that it consists principally of nitrogen, together
with small quantities of carbonic acid and oxygen.
   He employed a peculiar apparatus, constructed on purpose
for these experiments, by which he was enabled to collect the
whole of the gases from the principal well, as well as from
those adjoining it. The experiments of Daubeny are so nu
merous and accurate as to preclude any other researches on
the subject.
                    II. Quantitative Analysis.
             Determination of the Specific Gravity.
   A small bottle, which contained at the temperature of
16°-5 C. (60°Fahr.) 10 grms. of distilled water, contained at
the same temperature 10:025 grms. of the mineral water;
from this the specific gravity of the water is calculated
as 1'0025.

60          Messrs. Merck and Galloway’s Analysis of
                1. Estimation of Sulphuric Acid.
   The mineral water was heated with a little hydrochloric
acid and chloride of barium added.
   I. 534.199 grims, of water gave 1340 grm. of sulphate of
baryta = 0.4605 grm., or 0.08620 per cent. of sulphuric acid.
   II. 475'003 grims. of water gave 1°1791 grim. of sulphate
of baryta = 0.4050 grm., or 0.08526 per cent. of sulphuric
acid.
   Mean of the results, 0.08573 per cent.
                    2. Estimation of Chlorine.
   The water was treated with nitric acid and precipitated by
nitrate of silver; the precipitated chloride of silver was washed
by decantation, fused and weighed.
   I. 101 grms. of water gave 0:1137 grm, of chloride of silver
 = 0.2811 grim., or 0.02778 per cent. of chlorine.
   II. 100'006 grms. of water gave 0.1093 grims. of chloride
of silver = 0.02702 grims., or 0.02701 per cent. of chlorine.
   Mean of the results, 0.02739 per cent.
                  3. Estimation of Silicic Acid.
   To the water was added nitric acid in excess; it was then
evaporated to dryness and the residue for some time heated
on the sand-bath.      On treating this residue with water and
hydrochloric acid, the silicic acid remained behind; it was
collected, washed and weighed.
   I. 765.325 grims. of the water gave 0-0342 grim., or
0-00446 per cent. of silicic acid.
    II. 732.015 grms. of water gave 0.0289 grim., or 0.00407
per cent. of silicic acid.
   Mean of the results, 0-00426 per cent.
                      4. Estimation of Iron.
   The iron was estimated,—
   A. In the precipitate formed on boiling the mineral water.
   B. In the water which had not been boiled.
   Both estimations gave the same results.
   A. Estimation of the iron in the precipitate:—
   A certain quantity of the water was boiled for some time;
the precipitate which had formed was washed, dissolved in
hydrochloric acid and precipitated by an excess of ammonia.
   I. 777-215 grims. of water gave 0-0079 grm., or 0-00101
per cent. of sesquioxide of iron.

   II. 765.325 grims. of water gave 0-0078 grim., or 0-00101
per cent. of sesquioxide of iron.
   III. 732:015 grims. of water gave 0:0086 grm., or 0.00116
per cent. of sesquioxide of iron.
   Mean of the results, 0-00106 per cent., corresponding to
0.00153 per cent. of carbonate of oxide of iron.
                     5. Estimation of Lime.
   The estimation of the lime was divided into—
   A. Estimation of the lime contained in the water in the
state of carbonate.
   B. Estimation of the lime contained in the water in the
state of sulphate.
   C. Estimation of the total amount of lime for control.
   A. Estimation of the lime combined with carbonic acid:—
   The ammoniacal liquor filtered off from the precipitate of
 sesquioxide of iron was precipitated by oxalate of ammonia;
 the oxalate of lime was converted in the known way into
 carbonate.
   I. 712-747 grms. of water gave, on boiling, a precipitate
 containing 0-0904 grm. of carbonate of lime=0.05062 grim.,
 or 0-00712 per cent. of lime.
    II. 623.881 grims. of water gave, on boiling, a precipitate
 containing 0.0782 grm. of carbonate of lime=0.0437 grm.,
 or 0.00700 per cent. of lime.
    Mean of the results, 0:00706 per cent.
    B. Estimation of the lime combined with sulphuric acid:
    The mineral water was kept boiling for one or two hours,
 replacing the water which evaporated; the precipitate formed
 was filtered off, washed, and to the filtrate was added chlo
 ride of ammonium, ammonia, and oxalate of ammonia; the
 oxalate of lime was converted into carbonate.
    I. 710-747 grms. of water gave in this way 0-6072 grim. of
 carbonate of lime=0-3400 grim., or 0.04783 per cent. of lime.
    II. 623-881 grims. of water gave 0.5165 grim. of carbonate
 of lime=0.2892 grm., or 0.04635 per cent. of lime.
    Mean of the results, 0.04709 per cent.
    C. Estimation of the total amount of lime for control:—
    The ammoniacal liquid which was filtered off from the pre
 cipitate of sesquioxide of iron was precipitated after the addi
 tion of chloride of ammonium by oxalate of ammonia, and the
 oxalate of lime converted into carbonate.

 62         Messrs. Merck and Galloway’s Analysis of
    I. 765.325 grims. of water gave 0,7211 grm. of carbonate
 of lime=0.403816 grim., or 0.05276 per cent. of lime.
    II. 732.015 grms, of water gave 0.6981 grim. of carbonate
of lime=0.3909 grim., or 0.05340 per cent. of lime.

   The estimation of the magnesia was divided in the same
manner as the estimation of lime into—
   A. Estimation of the magnesia combined with carbonic
acid.
   B. Estimation of the magnesium combined with chlorine.
    C. Estimation of the total amount of magnesia for control.
   A. Estimation of magnesia contained in the water as car
bonate:—
   To the liquid filtered off from the oxalate of lime was
added phosphate of soda ; on stirring, after some time a pre
cipitate of phosphate of magnesia and ammonia was formed,
which was converted by ignition into pyrophosphate of mag
IleSla.
   I. 777-215 grims. of water gave, on boiling, a precipitate
which contained 0-0046 grm. of pyrophosphate of magnesia
 = 0:001685 grm., or 0.00021 per cent. of magnesia.
   II. 623°881 grims. of water gave, on boiling, a precipitate
which contained 0-0044 grm. of pyrophosphate of magnesia

   Mean of the results, 0.00023 per cent.
   B. Estimation of the magnesia contained in the water as
chloride of magnesium.
   The liquid filtered off from the oxalate of lime was con
centrated by evaporation, ammonia added filtered off from a
small portion of silicic acid which separated, and the mag
nesia precipitated by phosphate of soda.
   I. 414-279 grms. of water gave in this way 0-1007 grm.
of pyrophosphate of magnesia = 0.03689 grim., or 0.008906
per cent. of magnesia.

Mean of the total amount found by direct estimation 0-00922
                 7. Estimation of the Alkalies.
   For the estimation of the alkalies the mineral water was
evaporated to one-third of its volume and baryta water added
in excess, the precipitates of sulphates of baryta, lime, mag
nesia and sesquioxide of iron were filtered off, and the excess
of baryta precipitated by means of carbonate of ammonia.
To get rid of the silicic acid the filtrate was evaporated to
dryness with hydrochloric acid, gently ignited, dissolved in
water, again filtered and evaporated to dryness; the mixed
chlorides obtained in this manner were weighed.
   I. 632°481 grms. of the mineral water gave 0.2937 grim. of
chloride of sodium and chloride of potassium = 0.04643 per
cent. of the mixed chlorides.
   II. 546.032 grims. of water gave 0-2538 grm. of chlorides
of sodium and potassium = 0.04648 per cent. of the mixed
chlorides.
   Mean of the results, 0.04645 per cent.
                 8. Estimation of the Potassa.
   The chlorides of potassium and sodium were dissolved in
a small quantity of water and an excess of bichloride of
platinum added; the liquid.was then evaporated to dryness
in the water-bath, the residue digested with alcohol, the in
soluble chloride of platinum and potassium filtered off from
the soluble sodium salt and washed with alcohol; the preci
pitate was dried in the water-bath and weighed.
   I. 632,481 grims, of the mineral water, or 0.2987 grim. of
the mixed chlorides, gave O'124 grim. of chloride of platinum

64          Messrs. Merck and Galloway’s Analysis of
and potassium = 0.0378 grim. of chloride of potassium
=0.00597 per cent. of chloride of potassium, which equals
0-00377 per cent. of potassa. * * * *               *

chlorides, gave 0-0975 grm. of chloride of platinum and po
tassium = 0.02977 grim, of chloride of potassium = 0.00545

                10. Estimation of Carbonic Acid.
   To find the quantity of free carbonic acid contained in the
water at the moment it was taken from the well, a siphon of
exactly known capacity was immersed in the well, and the
water obtained in this way put in bottles, containing a mix
ture of ammonia and chloride of calcium.          In this way the
free carbonic acid as well as the carbonic acid in combination
was precipitated in the form of carbonates. Four bottles were
filled with mineral water by this method. The capacity of
the siphon was exactly 533 cubic centimetres, therefore
533 x 4 x 1.0025–2137 grms. of water were taken.
   The precipitate from the water contained in these four bot
tles was collected, washed, dried and weighed; it yielded
14748 grm. of carbonate mixed with some alumina from im
purity in the solution of chloride of calcium.
   To estimate the quantity of carbonic acid in this precipitate,
two portions of it were taken and estimated separately after
the method proposed by Drs. Fresenius and Will.                   -
   I. 0.66 grm, of the carbonate, &c. gave in this way 0-22
grm. of carbonic acid, therefore 14748 grm. of the carbonate,
or 2137:0 grms. of water, gave 0.4916 grim. of carbonic acid.
   II. O-718 grm. of the carbonate, &c. gave 0:23 grm. of car
bonic acid, therefore 14748 grim. of the carbonate, &c., or
2137:0 grims, of water, gave 0-4718 grim. of carbonic acid.

Estimation of the total amount of the fived ingredients in the

  The water was concentrated in a porcelain dish, and after
wards evaporated to dryness in a platinum basin. The resi
due was heated in an air-bath until the weight was constant.
Two estimates were made.
   I. 217.058 grims. of water gave 0.4540 grm., or 0.20916
per cent. of residue.
   II. 319.57 grns. of water gave 0.6726 grim., or 0.21040
per cent. of residue.
   Mean of the results, 0.20978 per cent.
   But in this experiment the iron was obtained in the state
of sesquioxide, whilst in the preceding calculation it is taken
as the carbonate of the oxide, in which form it exists in the
water.
   On calculating the absolute weights from the above, we
obtain the following numbers:—

   According to our experiments, 1 litre of the water contains
95.64 cubic centimetres of free carbonic acid at the tempera
ture of 46°C. (115°F.) and normal atmospheric pressure.
    One imperial gallon contains therefore 26:45 cubic inches
of free carbonic acid of 46°C., being more than double the
quantity which has been determined by former experiments.
   This however is not surprising, as the estimations previ
ously made had been effected by the expulsion of the carbonic
acid from the water. Besides the difficulty of avoiding a loss
of carbonic acid before the operation, it is scarcely possible,
as Mr. Phillips justly notices in his paper, to expel all carbonic
acid by simple ebullition. Besides, we see from the experi
ments of Daubeny, that the gas which escapes from the well
contains at different periods highly varying amounts of car
bonic acid. He found by several experiments that the King’s
Bath evolves on an average 267 cubic inches of gas per minute,
or 223 cubic feet in twenty-four hours. He further ascer
tained that this gas consists nearly entirely of nitrogen, mixed
with a small amount of oxygen and carbonic acid, and that
these gases were generally in the following proportion:-
                     Nitrogen . . =91-9
                     Oxygen . . . = 3-8
                     Carbonic acid    = 4:3
   In many instances, however, he observed as much as 7.4
to 8-2, and even once 11-5 parts of carbonic acid.
   From these observations there is no doubt that the quan
tity of carbonic acid dissolved in the water is very variable.
   In the following Table we give the analyses of former ex
perimenters, calculated in an imperial gallon (70,000 grs.).

On the Correlation of Physical Forces : being the substance of a Course
   of Lectures delivered in the London Institution, in the year 1843.
   By W. R. G.Rove, Esq., M.A., F.R.S., Barrister-at-Law. Printed
   at the request of the Proprietors of the London Institution. London:
   Samuel Highley, 32 Fleet Street.
rThis       publication treats of subjects which might have been advan
       tageously considered at much greater length; but it must be
acknowledged that in the brief space to which the author has con
fined the announcement of his views and speculations, he has done
them no small degree of justice; it may indeed be questioned
whether the opinions broached are not of such a nature as to defy
the test of experiment to realise or to refute them. This is certainly
the case as far as experiment has yet been carried; but although we
discover great reason for doubting whether the difficulties which
beset the subjects may ever be overcome, we discover no cause for
despair, seeing that new modes of research and new instruments for
carrying them out are of almost daily occurrence. As a proof of
this we may cite the author's excellent invention of his well-known
and justly-appreciated voltaic battery; and his still more recent
discovery, that water may be decomposed by heat so as to exhibit
both its elements in the gaseous form.
   Mr. Grove states that “the position which he seeks to establish
in this Essay is, that the various imponderable agencies, or the affec
tions of matter which constitute the main objects of experimental
     * Recalculated according to a more correct principle by Walker.

physics, viz. heat, light, electricity, magnetism, chemical affinity and
motion, are all correlative, or have a reciprocal dependence; that
neither, taken abstractedly, can be said to be the essential or proxi
mate cause of the others, but that either may, as a force, produce
or be convertible into the other; thus heat may mediately or imme
diately produce electricity, electricity may produce heat; and so of
the rest.”
    In further illustration of the author's views, we may quote what
he states to be the sense that he has attached to the word correlation,
which is, that “ of a reciprocal production or convertibility; in other
words, that any force capable of producing or being convertible into
another, may, in its turn, be produced by it, nay, more, can be
itself resisted by the force it produces, in proportion to the energy
of such production, as action is ever accompanied and resisted by
reaction; thus, the action of an electro-magnetic machine is reacted
upon by the magneto-electricity developed by its action.”
    In order to support his speculations by facts, the author appeals
in the first place to the agency of electricity. “To commence, then,
with electricity as an initiating force, we get motion directly pro
duced by it in various forms; for instance in the attraction and re
pulsion of bodies, evidenced by mobile electrometers, such as that of
 Cuthbertson, where large masses are acted on ; the rotation of the
fly wheel, another form of electrical repulsion, and the deflection of
 the galvanometer needle, are also modes of palpable, visible motion.
 Electricity directly produces heat, as shown in the ignited wire, the
 electric spark, and the voltaic arc, in the latter the most intense heat
 with which we are acquainted, so intense, indeed, that it cannot be
 measured, every sort of matter being dissipated by it. Electricity
 directly produces light in the same phaenomena. It directly produces
 magnetism in all ferruginous bodies placed at right angles to its line
 of direction, and, indeed, in the substances, of whatever nature,
 traversed by the electrical current, in a direction at right angles to
 that of the current; in this case giving us a new character of force,
 viz., a force acting, not in direct straight lines, but in a tangential or
 rather rectangular direction.
     “Lastly, electricity directly produces chemical affinity, and by its
 agency we are enabled to obtain effects of analysis or synthesis, with
 which ordinary chemistry does not furnish us. Of these effects we
 have examples in the brilliant discoveries by Davy of the alkaline
 metals, and in the peculiar crystalline compounds made known by
  Crosse and Becquerel.”
     Having stated thus much respecting electricity in support of his
 peculiar views, Mr. Grove adduces additional confirmation of them
  from considering the action of light, in a passage which we shall
  quote at length. He observes that “light is, perhaps, that mode of
  force the reciprocal relations of which with the others has been the
 least traced out. Until the discoveries of Daguerre and Talbot, very
 little could be definitely predicated of the action of light in produ
  cing other modes of frce; and, even, since these discoveries, it is
  doubted by many competent investigators, whether the phaenomena

of photography are not mainly dependent upon a separate agent
accompanying light, rather than upon light itself. It is, indeed, dif
ficult not to believe that a picture, taken in the focus of the camera
obscura, and which represents to the eye all the gradations of light
and shade shown by the original luminous image, is not an effect of
light; certain it is, however, that the different coloured rays exer
cise different actions upon various chemical compounds, and that
the effects on many, perhaps on most of them, are not proportionate
in intensity to the effects upon the visual organs; those effects,
however, appear to be more of degree than of specific difference,
and without pronouncing myself positively upon the question, hitherto
so little examined, I think it will be safer to regard the action on
photographic compounds as resulting from a function of light: so
viewing it, we get light as an initiating force, capable of producing,
mediately or immediately, the other modes of force. Thus, it imme
diately produces chemical action; and having this, we at once ac
quire a means of producing the others.”
   Mr. Grove then relates the following beautiful experiment, by
which he conceives that he showed the production of all the other
modes of force by light:—“A prepared Daguerreotype plate is in
closed in a box filled with water, having a glass front, with a shutter
over it; between this glass and the plate, is a gridiron of silver wire;
the plate is connected with one extremity of a galvanometer coil,
and the gridiron of wire with one extremity of a Breguet's helix;
the other extremities of the galvanometer and helix are connected
by a wire, and the needles brought to zero. As soon as a beam of
either daylight or the oxyhydrogen-light is, by raising the shutter,
permitted to impinge upon the plate, the needles are deflected : thus
light being the initiating force, we get chemical action on the plate,
electricity circulating through the wires, magnetism in the coil, heat
in the helix, and motion in the needles.”
   We have had some difficulty in selecting passages for quotation
from this publication, on account of the profusion of interesting
matter which it contains, though in so small a space ; we believe,
however, that the selections which we have given are such as will
well and sufficiently illustrate the interesting views of their author.

tion of St. Helena.” By Lieut.-Colonel Edward Sabine, R.A., For.
Sec. R.S.
   It has long been known that the diurnal variation of the magnetic
needle is in an opposite direction in the southern, to what it is in
the northern hemisphere; and it was therefore proposed as a pro
blem by Arago, Humboldt and others, to determine whether there
exists any intermediate line of stations on the earth where those
diurnal variations disappear. The results recorded in the present
paper are founded on observations made at St. Helena during the
five consecutive years, from 1841 to 1845 inclusive; and also on
similar observations made at Singapore, in the years 1841 and 1842;
and show that at these stations, which are intermediate between the
northern and southern magnetic hemispheres, the diurnal variations
still take place; but those peculiar to each hemisphere prevail at
 opposite seasons of the year, apparently in accordance with the
position of the sun with relation to the earth's equator.
    Feb. 25.-“On certain Properties of Prime Numbers.” By the
 Right Hon. Sir Frederick Pollock, M.A., F.R.S., Lord Chief Baron
of the Exchequer, &c.
    The author of this paper, after noticing Wilson's Theorem, (pub
lished by Waring about the year 1770, without any proof), which
theorem is that, if A be a prime number, 1. 2. 3. . . . (A-1)+ 1 is
divisible by A; refers to Lagrange's and Euler's demonstrations,
and mentions Gauss's extension of the theorem, to any number, not
prime; provided that instead of 1, 2, 3, &c. (A-1), those numbers
only be taken which are prime to A, and 1 be either added or sub
tracted. This theorem was published by Gauss without a proof in
 1801, with a rule as to the cases in which 1 is to be added or sub
tracted, the correctness of which is questioned by the author, who
proceeds to propound the following theorem, which he had previ
ously, for distinctness, divided into three.
    If any number, prime or not, be taken, and the numbers prime to
it, and less than one half of it be ascertained, and those be rejected
whose squares + 1 are equal to the prime number, or some multiple
of it (which may be more than one), then the product of the re
maining primes (if any), + 1 shall be divisible by the prime number.
    He gives as examples, 14, the primes to which, and less than one
half, are 1, 3, 5, and 1. 3. 5=15; therefore 1. 3. 5–1 = 14; also
15, the primes to which and less, are 1, 2, 4, 7; but 4 ×4=16
= 15+ 1 ; therefore 4 is to be rejected, and 1.2. 7+ 1 = 15. The
author adds another theorem, that if A be a prime number, all the
odd numbers less than it (rejecting as before); also, all the even
numbers (making the same rejection except A-1) will, multiplied
together, be equal to A+ 1.                                       -
    The author then proceeds to prove Gauss's extension of Wilson's

                                Royal Society.                            71
 theorem, and to give the cases in which 1 is to be added or sub
 tracted; and in the course of the proof, he mentions that the num
 bers prime to any number not only are found in pairs, one greater
 and one less than one-half of the number, but that they associate
 themselves in sets of four, with an odd pair in certain cases. Thus,
 the primes to 7 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,-
                            2x4 =8=7-H 1.

A, but pºp-n A+ 1, it is shown that the complemental primes
(A–4) and (A-p) will have a product=n'A-E1, and that, in
stead of 1, the number may be any other prime to A. Upon this
foundation the author proceeds to show that Wilson's theorem, and
also Gauss's, may be made much more general; that if A be a prime
number, as 7, the numbers less than it may be arranged in pairs,
not only with reference to 1, but to any number less than 7. Take
4 as an example:–
                          1       x       3-7–4
                             -
                               ,” “N
                          4       x      6=4x7–4
                          2        X      5-2 x 7–4
therefore 1.2.3.4. 5.6=7m—43;
therefore 1.2.3.4.5.6+4°=7n; that is, is divisible by 7.
   The same is then shown as to numbers not prime, provided those
numbers alone are taken which are prime to it, and the number of
pairs will be half the number of primes. The general theorem
therefore is this:—If A be any number, prime or not, and m be the
number of primes to it, which are 1, p, q, r, &c.; then 1.p.g.r, &c.,
+zº will be divisible by A, provided Z be prime to A, whether it
be greater or less.
   It follows from this that   234. 1      must be divisible by A, and there
fore that z"—1 must be divisible by A. If A be a prime number

and 2 a number prime to it (which every number not divisible by it
is), this is Fermat's theorem, and the author has given a new proof
of it.  But the theorem is true though A be not a prime number,
provided z be prime to A and m be the number of primes to A,
and less than it; and instead of 1, any other number prime to A
raised to the mth power may be substituted: and z"—y" will be di
visible by A, provided 2 and y be primes to A, and m be the number
of primes to A and less than it.
   The author has therefore in this paper offered a proof of Gauss's
theorem, and proved that it applies in certain cases to one half of the
primes, and in all cases, with certain modifications, has shown that
a similar property belongs to the product of the odd numbers, and
 also of the even numbers which precede any prime number; and
lastly, has shown the intimate connexion between Wilson's theorem
and Fermat's, and shown that each is but a part of a much more
general proposition, which, he observes, may itself turn out to be
part only of a still more universal one.
   In a postscript, the author has shown that the well-known law of
reciprocity of prime numbers is an immediate corollary from his
theorem; and that it may be extended thus: if A and B be any
two numbers (not prime numbers but) prime to each other, and the
primes to A, and less than it, are (m) in number, and the similar
primes to B are (n), then (A"—1) is divisible by B, and (B"—1) is
divisible by A.
    “On the reabsorption of the Mixed Gases in a Voltameter.” By
Professor M. H. Jacobi, in a letter to Michael Faraday, Esq., F.R.S.
 Communicated by Dr. Faraday.
    The author found that if the mixed gases developed from the
decomposition of water by a voltaic current, be allowed to remain
in the voltameter in which they were collected, in contact with the
fluid which produced them, they by degrees diminish in volume,
and ultimately disappear by being absorbed by the fluid. He has
not yet fully determined the precise conditions on which this phe
nomenon depends; but he is inclined to think that it is owing to a
portion of the mixed gases, diffused throughout the whole liquid,
coming into contact with the platinum plates, and being recombined
on the surface of those plates; and this process being renewed with
every fresh portion of the gases which takes the place of the former,
the whole of the gases are thus reconverted into water.
   March 4.—“Researches into the effects of certain Physical and
Chemical Agents on the Nervous System.” By Marshall Hall, M.D.,
F.R.S., &c.
   The professed object of the author, in the present paper, is “to
detail the results of an investigation of the phenomena and the laws
of production and action of certain secondary or induced conditions
of the nervous system, which are effected by a voltaic, and proba
bly by any other electric current, but persistent after the influence
of that current is withdrawn.”. This condition he designates by the
new term electrogenic, as describing at once the origin and the inde
pendence of that condition. On the present occasion he confines

                             Royal Society.                          73
 himself to the subject of the electrogenic condition of the muscular
 nerves, postponing to future inquiries that of the incident nerves
 and of the spinal marrow; and also the modes of action of other
 physical and chemical agents, such as mechanical injury, heat and
 cold, strychnine, and the hydrocyanic acid.
    The bones and muscles of the brachial lumbar and pelvic regions
 of a frog, being isolated from all the other parts of the body, except
 ing only by means of their respective brachial and lumbar nerves,
 which were perfectly denuded on all sides, and raised from the glass
 on which the limbs were laid, a voltaic current from a pair of the
“couronne de tasses” was passed downwards through the nerves, in
 a direction from their origin in the spinal marrow towards their ter
 minations in the muscles. Energetic muscular movements were at
 first excited; and the current was thus continued during the space
 of five, ten, or fifteen minutes, and at the end of this period was
 withdrawn.     No sooner was the current discontinued than the mus
 cles were affected with spasmodic contractions, and with a tetanoid
 rigidity, constituting the secondary, or what the author denominates
 the electrogenic condition; an effect, which as instantly subsides on
 the restoration of the voltaic current.
    The author proceeds to state the precautions which must be taken
 to ensure the success of experiments on this subject; and traces the
zeffects of desiccation of the nerves from spontaneous evaporation,
 and of the application of external moisture, on the phenomena; and
 also the modifications introdueed by varying the extent of voltaic
 contact. Various experiments are then described, which the author
 instituted with a view to ascertain the nature of the electrogenic
 condition of the nerves, and the circumstances under which it is in
 duced; and he is led to the conclusion that the phenomena involve
 some voltaic principle which has not hitherto been fully investigated.
     March 11,–" On the cause of the discrepancies observed by
 Mr. Baily with the Cavendish Apparatus for determining the Mean
  Density of the Earth.” By George Whitehurst Hearn, Esq., of the
  Royal Military College, Sandhurst. Communicated by Sir John
  F. W. Herschel, Bart., F.R.S.                     -
     After taking a summary review of the methods employed by Mr.
  Baily for determining, on the plan devised by Mr. Cavendish, the
  mean density of the earth, and of the anomalies, hitherto unac
  counted for, which had introduced perplexity in the results obtained,
  the author, suspecting that these anomalies had their source in the
  variable magnetic states of the masses which were the subject of
  experiment, traces the effects which such an influence might be
  supposed to have on those results. He finds that, the attraction
  arising from gravitation between a mass and one of the balls being
  exceedingly minute, an almost inconceivably feeble magnetic state
  may be the cause of great perturbations. He then proceeds to in
  vestigate the subject by the application of mathematical analysis;
  from which he is led to the conclusion that the masses and balls do
  actually exert on one another influences which are independent of
  the action of gravitation. He finds that such influences are of a

 very fluctuating nature; the action arising from them being either
 positive or negative, and its sign also changing in each revolution
 as the masses are turned round a vertical axis; and he observes that
 such action may either fall short of that arising from gravitation or
 exceed it many times. Such disturbing force he conceives can be no
 other than a magnetic influence; not however one of the ordinary
 kind, but that which Faraday has recently discovered as affecting
 all diamagnetic bodies.
    The author concludes by proposing methods by which the inquiry
 should in future be conducted, so as to obviate or eliminate this
 source of error. Such an inquiry, he remarks, would, by exhibit
 ing the magnetic and diamagnetic powers under new aspects, lead,
in all probability, to important consequences.
    March 18.-‘ Researches to determine the Number of Species
and the Mode of Development of the British Triton.” By J. Hig
ginbottom, Esq., F.R.C.S. Communicated by Thomas Bell, Esq.,
F.R.S.
    The observations of the author, of which he gives a detailed ac
count in the present memoir, have led him to the following con
clusions:—
    Two species only of the genus Triton are met with in England;
namely, the Triton verrucosus and the Lisso-triton punctatus. It is
three years before the animal is capable of propagating its species,
and four years before it attains its full growth.  In its tadpole state,
it remains in the water till its legs acquire sufficient strength to
qualify it for progressive motion on land. While a land animal, it
is in an active state during the summer, and passes the winter in a
state of hybernation; but does not then, as has been erroneously
supposed, remain at the bottom of pools. Very dry, or very wet
situations are incompatible with the preservation of life during the
period of hybernation. At the expiration of the third year, the
triton revisits the water, in the spring season, for the purposes of
reproduction, and again leaves it at the commencement of autumn.
Impregnation is accomplished through the medium of water, and
not by actual contact. The growth and development of the triton
are materially influenced by temperature, and but little by the action
of light, The triton possesses the power of reproducing its lost
limbs, provided the temperature be within the limits of 58° and 75°
Fahrenheit; but at lower temperatures, and during the winter, it
has no such power.
    April 15.-" On the Proper Motion of the Solar System.” By
Thomas Galloway, Esq., A.M., F.R.S.                                   -
    The object of this paper is to communicate the results of a calcu
lation for determining the direction of the proper motion of the
solar system from the apparent proper motions of stars in the
southern hemisphere, deduced mostly from a comparison of the
observations made by Lacaille at the Cape, about the middle of the
last century, with the recent observations of Mr. Johnson and the
late Professor Henderson at St. Helena and the Cape respectively.
After adverting to the papers of Sir William Herschel in the Philo

                            Royal Society.                            75
sophical Transactions for 1783 and 1805, and some other investi
gations of the same subject, the author remarks that up to a
recent period astronomers seem generally to have entertained the
opinion that our knowledge of the proper motions of the stars is
not sufficiently advanced to enable us to pronounce positively either
on the fact or the direction of the motion of our own system. This
opinion was grounded on the discrepancies which present them
selves when it is attempted to explain the observed displacements
of individual stars by referring them to the motion of the sun in an
opposite direction; it being always found that whatever direction
is assigned to the sun's motion, there are many stars whose proper
motions cannot thereby be accounted for. But if the sun be in
motion it is very improbable that any star is absolutely at rest;
hence the proper motions deduced from a comparison of catalogues
must be regarded as the effect partly of the true proper motions of
the stars, and partly of the apparent systematic or parallactic mo
tion caused by the displacement of the point of view; and as we
have no reason for supposing the true proper motion of a star to be
more probable in one direction than in another, it may be expected,
d priori, that the observed directions will form angles of all different
values with the direction of the sun's motion, or any other fixed
line. The observed discrepancies are therefore not incompatible
with a general drifting of the stars towards a particular region of
the heavens; but in order to deduce the direction of the systematic
motion, it becomes necessary to take account of a very considerable
number of proper motions, and to represent them by equations,
involving the unknown quantities required for determining the
direction of the sun's motion, and to solve the equations so as to
obtain the most probable values of those quantities. The first person
who investigated the subject under this point of view was Professor
Argelander of Bonn, in a paper published in the Petersburg Me
moirs for 1837. From the proper motions of 390 stars deduced
from a comparison of Bessel's catalogue of Bradley's observations
with his own catalogue of stars observed at Abo, Argelander found
the direction of the sun's motion, for 1792:5, to be towards the point
of the sphere whose right ascension is 259° 47'-6 and declination
+32°29'5. Lundahl, subsequently, from a comparison of the places
of 147 stars in the catalogues of Bessel and Pond, and not included
among those considered by Argelander, found the co-ordinates of
the point to be AR=252° 24'4, Dec.-- 14° 26'l ; and Otto Struve,
still more recently, from the comparison of about 400 of Bradley's
stars with the positions determined at the Dorpat Observatory, ob
tained the result AR=261° 23'-1, Dec.--37° 35'-7.       The mean of
those results taken with respect to their probable errors, was found
by O. Struve to be AR=259° 9'4, Dec.--34° 36'5.                     -
   All the stars included in the calculations of Argelander, Lundahl,
and O. Struve being situated to the north of the tropic of Capri
corn, it appeared to be a point of some interest to determine whe
ther the southern stars agree with the northern in their indication
of the direction of the solar motion, or afford any confirmation of

 76                            Royal Society.
the hypothesis of the sun's translation. Unfortunately, we have
no observations made in the southern hemisphere in the last century
equal in precision to those of Bradley, but the catalogue given by
Lacaille in his “Astronomiae Fundamenta, furnishes a means of
 comparison of considerable value in reference to the present in
 quiry. In Mr. Johnson's ‘Catalogue of 606 Stars in the Southern
 Hemisphere’ (London, 1835), there are sixty-one which, on com
paring their places in 1830 with those of Lacaille reduced to the
same epoch, appear to have shifted their positions not less than 8"
 in space in the interval of eighty years between the epochs of the
 catalogues, or to have an annual proper motion of not less than
 one-tenth of a second in space. Prof. Henderson's catalogue (Mem.
 R. Astron. Society, vols. x. and xv.) furnishes thirty-six stars, which,
 on a like comparison, appear to have an annual proper motion ex
ceeding the same limit. Of these, however, thirty-two are contained
in Mr. Johnson's catalogue, but Henderson gives the proper motions
of sixteen other stars (in the southern hemisphere), from the com
 parison of his own places with those of Bradley. On the whole,
 therefore, the two catalogues furnish eighty-one different stars whose
proper motions are given both in right ascension and declination.
 The method of investigation is the same as that of Argelander. From
 the differences of AR and Dec. given by comparison of the cata
 logues, the direction of the apparent motion of each star is com
 puted. It is then assumed that the sun is moving towards a point
 whose right ascension A=259° 46'-2 and declination D= +32°
 29'6; and the direction in which each star would appear to move,
 if it were itself at rest, is computed on this hypothesis. The differ
 ence of these two directions is treated as an error of observation,
 and its numerical value substituted for the differential of the angle
 which determines the direction of the parallactic motion; this diffe
 rential being expressed by a formula containing the differentials of
 A and D multiplied by known coefficients. An equation is thus
 obtained of the form
                              O=ad A+bdD+n,
in which a, b, and n are known quantities. Each star furnishes a
similar equation; and the equations, being first multiplied respec
tively by the sine of the star's distance from the point assumed as
the apex of the sun's motion, in order to give them all the same
weight, are solved by the method of least squares, and the result
ing values of d A and d D applied as corrections to the assumed
values of A and D.        The results are as follows:—the whole of the
eighty-one equations give (for 1790) as co-ordinates of the point
towards which the sun's motion is directed,
       AR=263° 38'0-E5° 14'5; Dec.- +37° 15'0+6° 17'-6.
But two of the stars compared with Lacaille move in a direction so
nearly opposite to that of their motion on the assumed hypothesis,
that (in one case especially) a slight error of observation would
change the sign of n in the equations of condition. It therefore
appears necessary to reject those two stars; and a further reason

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                77
for rejecting them is, that they are both situated within 8° of the
pole, in which position Lacaille's determination of the right ascen
sion is probably not to be depended upon. Setting aside, there
fore, the two stars in question, the remaining seventy-nine equa
tions give              -         -    ,, ,  , , , , ,,  -
       AR=256° 51.5+4°45'1; Dec.---34° 14' 34-5° 36' 2.
The author further observes, that one of the stars compared with
Bradley's catalogue is also remarkable as appearing to move in a
direction nearly opposite to the mean direction of the whole, and
that if this star be rejected also on account of the great probability
there is that the parallactic motion is in this case concealed by the
larger proper motion of the star itself in an opposite direction, the
co-ordinates of the solar apex become
       AR=259° 47'4-E4° 31'-9; Dec.- +34°19'5+5° 17'-7,
a result differing less than a degree either in right ascension or de
clination from the mean, as above stated, of the three previous de
terminations.                                                       -

ACTION OF CHLORINE ON ALCOHOL.—FORMATION OF ACETAL.
           STAS states that he has observed that the causes which give
         • rise to acetal are not always oxidating causes.        When
 chlorine is made to act upon alcohol, acetal is the principal product,
 as long as it does not act by substitution, and it is at once a dehy
 drogenating and an oxidizing body. This discovery, the author is
 of opinion, throws great light on the hitherto obscure action of
 chlorine upon alcohol.
    In order to obtain acetal by the action of chlorine upon alcohol,
 it is sufficient to pass a current of chlorine into alcohol of 80 per
 cent., cooled to 50° or 60° F. The action is to be discontinued
 when chlorinated bodies commence formation by substitution : this is
 readily ascertained, for the alcohol then becomes turbid on the addi.
 tion of water; the liquid, which has become very acid, is to be di
 stilled, and one-fourth of the quantity is to be preserved. This is to
 be neutralized by means of chalk, and by a fresh distillation one
 fourth of the product is again to be obtained; in this fused chloride
 of calcium is to be dissolved, which immediately separates a large
 quantity of a very volatile fluid, containing, like common rough
 acetal, aldehyd, acetic aether and alcohol; by the addition of more
 chloride of calcium, the utmost quantity of alcohol and acetic aether
 are separated; the purification of the acetal is to be completed.
    The analysis of the acetal thus obtained was similar to that pro
 cured in the usual way; and thus the chlorine acts, as already
 stated, both as a dehydrogenating and oxidizing body: C*H'80°-H

         BISILICATE OF IRON OR FERRUGINOUS PYROxENE.
     This new mineral is described in a memoir presented by M. Du

  and Professor in the School of Mines at St. Etienne. It corresponds
  in composition to a pyroxene with a base of iron.

  asbestos, or more nearly fibrous amphibole.                      Its specific gravity is
  3.713, which exceeds that of the densest epidotes, amphiboles or
 pyroxenes. By analysis M. Gruner obtained—

                   CHLOROSULPHURET OF SILICIUM.
    M. Isidore Pierre states that when hydrosulphuric acid and chlo
 ride of silicium in vapour are passed through a porcelain tube heated
 to redness, they react upon each other ; much hydrochloric acid is
produced, which is disengaged with excess of hydrosulphuric acid
gas and a little chloride of silicium, which escapes the reaction.
    If the products of this reaction be passed into a U-shaped tube
immersed in cold water, a fuming liquor condenses, which has a
sharp foetid odour, resembling that of hydrosulphuric acid and chloride
of sulphur.     The liquor thus obtained was slightly opake by sul
phur suspended in it: this was deposited by being left forty-eight
hours in a well-stoppered bottle.             There were also deposited on the
sides of the bottle, clear lemon-yellow crystals, which were sulphur
in the form of oblique rhombic prisms, without any modification.
    The condensed liquor has consequently the power of dissolving
sulphur, and of depositing it in crystals belonging to the same system
as those which are obtained in the dry way. The smallness of these
crystals prevented the author from determining their angles; but he
reckons upon being able soon to do so. No sensible traces of sul
phuret of silicium were found in the minute deposit produced in the
porcelain tube.
    The liquid condensed in this operation was distilled in an oil-bath
from a retort furnished with a thermometer: the more volatile por
tions, which usually distil from 140° to 176° F., were rejected.
They consist principally of chloride of silicium mixed with a small
quantity of chlorosulphuret. Afterwards there is obtained a limpid
colourless liquid which fumes in the air, and has an odour resembling
that of chloride of silicium and hydrosulphuric acid.

    Its specific gravity at 60°F, is about 1'45; that is, a little less
than that of chloride of silicium. When it is thrown into water, it
occasions an abundant disengagement of sulphuretted hydrogen gas
and a slight deposit of sulphur. It boils at above 212°F. ; but the
small quantity obtained did not allow of ascertaining its exact boil
ing-point.
    By analysis, it yielded such proportions of its constituents as to
indicate for its formula C1° S Si, which would give—

    XIV. On a new Voltaic Battery, cheap in its construction and
      use, and more powerful than any Battery yet made; and on
      a cheap substitute for the nitric acid of Grove's Platina
      Battery. By the Rev. N. J. CALLAN, Professor of Natural
      Philosophy in the Royal College, Maynooth *.
    SOME time ago, whilst I was reflecting on the principle of
         action of Grove’s and Bunsen’s batteries, it occurred to me
   that lead might be substituted for the platina of the former and
   the carbon of the latter. I put into the porous cell of a Grove's
   battery a piece of lead about Tºth of an inch thick, two inches
   broad and six inches long. I found that the voltaic current
   produced by the lead excited by a mixture of concentrated
  nitric and sulphuric acid was very powerful. I afterwards
  compared the power of this leaden battery with that of a pla
  tina one of the same size, by sending through the helix of a
  galvanometer, at the same time, but in opposite directions, the
  currents produced by the two batteries. Both batteries were
  charged with the same acids: the lead and platina were ex
  cited by concentrated nitric and sulphuric acid, and the zinc
  by dilute sulphuric acid. The current from the platina bat
  tery destroyed the deflection produced by the leaden one, and
  caused an opposite deflection, which indicated that the former
_ current was about twice as strong as the latter. The two
  batteries were left working for about three hours and a half.
  At the end of that time the current from the lead was about
  twice and a half as powerful as the current from the platina.
  The quantity of lead dissolved during these three hours and
  a half was very small.
     It struck me that by diminishing the action of the acids on
  the lead, I might increase the power of the battery. I there
  fore covered a leaden plate with gold leaf, and coated another
                      * Communicated by the Author.

of the same size with chloride of gold, in the same way in
which sheet silver is platinized for Smee's battery. These
plates and a platina one of the same size were put successively
into the porous cell of a Grove's battery, and the voltaic cur
rent sent through the helix of our large electro-magnet, in
which the iron bar is about thirteen feet long and two and a
half inches thick; the copper wire is about 500 feet long and
one-sixth of an inch diameter. The magnetic power given to
the electro-magnet by the leaden plate coated with chloride of
gold, appeared to be equal to that which was produced by the
platina plate. The magnetic effect of the current from the
leaden plate covered with gold leaf was not so great. A coat
ing of chloride of platina was afterwards found to answer as
well as one of chloride of gold.
    Some days after a leaden and platina battery of the same
size were left working for four hours and a half. At the end
of that time the lead plate acted fully as well as the platina.
When the nitric acid was so much exhausted that the lead
was barely capable of magnetizing the large electro-magnet so
as to make it sustain a certain weight, the leaden plate was
taken out of the porous cell, and a platina plate of the same
size put in its stead. The platina plate was not able to make
the electro-magnet sustain the weight which the lead had
caused it to sustain.
    The magnetizing power of the platinized or gilded lead and
platina batteries was compared several times in working an
electro-magnetic machine. On these occasions the power of
the leaden battery was evidently superior to that of the pla
tina one. Sometimes the platina plate was taken out of the
porous cell, and a platinized or gilded lead plate of the same
 size put in its place: the velocity of the machine was instantly
and considerably increased. The same effect was produced
 when the platina plate was taken out of the cell and a plati
nized platina one put in its stead. Hence it appears that a
leaden plate coated with chloride of platina or gold, or a pla
tinized platina plate, produces a more powerful voltaic cur
rent than a platina plate does. On the 24th of last May, a
 small platinized lead battery and a Grove's battery of the same
 size, were exhibited before the Royal Irish Academy. The
 power of the former was obviously superior to that of the
 latter. By using double leads and single zincs instead of
 double zincs and single leads, the power of the battery appears
 to be increased. When the lead plates have been used for a
 long time, they require to be newly gilded or platinized. After
 being used they should be rinsed in water, and dipped into a
 weak solution of chloride of gold or platina.         º

    Seeing that the concentrated acids, by dissolving the lead,
removed the gold or platina powder, and that the nitric acid
was very expensive, I endeavoured to find in its stead a cheap
substitute which would not act on the lead. The first that
occurred to me was common nitre. I dissolved about the
eighth of an ounce of it in sulphuric acid, which I diluted with
nearly an equal bulk of water. I poured the mixture into
the porous cell of a Grove's battery, and put into it a pla
tinized leaden plate. I then sent the voltaic current through
the helix of our large electro-magnet: the magnetic power
given to the magnet appeared to be greater than that which
was given to it by a Grove’s battery of the same size, in which
the platina was excited by concentrated nitric and sulphuric
acid. I afterwards compared the heating power of the two
batteries, and found the power of the platinized lead battery
to be evidently superior to that of the other. I charged a
platinized leaden battery with a mixture consisting of about
five parts of sulphuric acid, five of solution of nitre, and one
of nitric acid, and a Grove’s battery with equal parts of nitric
and sulphuric acid. The former fused a piece of steel wire
which the latter only raised to a white heat. When a platina
plate is excited by a mixture of sulphuric acid and a solution
of nitre, the voltaic current appears to be as powerful as that
which is produced by the plate when excited by concentrated
nitric and sulphuric acid. The cost of the nitre necessary
for charging a battery is about the twentieth part of that of
the nitric acid. The power of the former declines sooner than
that of the latter: but from the results of several experiments,
I have come to the conclusion that the expense of doing a
given amount of work by a platina battery excited by con
centrated nitric and sulphuric acid, would be three or four
times as great as if the work were done by a platinized lead
battery excited by a mixture of sulphuric acid and a solution
of saltpetre. I have tried nitrate of soda, or cubic nitre, and
nitrate of ammonia, as substitutes for nitric acid; but although
they give great power, they do not answer as well as the com
mon nitre. A solution of common nitre and cubic nitre along
with sulphuric acid, forms a mixture scarcely inferior to the
solution of common nitre and sulphuric acid. The most
powerful mixture for the platina or platinized lead battery
consists of about four parts of sulphuric acid, two of nitric
acid, and two of a saturated solution of nitre. When no nitric
acid is used, at least one half of the mixture should consist of
 sulphuric acid, and the remainder of nitre and water: the
 solution need not be saturated with nitre.     Four parts of sul
 phuric acid, two of a  solutiº of chromate of potash, and two
                                 2

of the solution of nitre, make a most powerful exciting mix
ture for platina, but give comparatively little power to plati
nized lead. I endeavoured to find among the sulphates a
substitute for sulphuric acid, but did not succeed. The vol
taic current from a platinized lead battery, excited by two
parts of sulphuric acid, three of sulphate of soda, and three
of nitrate of potash, is very powerful, but considerably inferior
to that which is produced by the concentrated acids.
    On finding that platinized or gilded lead and platinized
platina were superior to platina, I saw that the cause of the
 superiority was that, in the platinized or gilded lead, and in
 the platinized platina batteries, the acting metals were, not
 lead or platina and zinc, but gold or platina powder, and
 zinc.; and that the gold or platina powder was more negative
 compared with zine than platina is. Hence I inferred, first,
 that a leaden plate coated with any of those substances which
are more negative and cheaper than platina or gold, would
 act as powerfully as platinized or gilded lead; and secondly,
 that any other metal to which the platina or gold powder
 would adhere might answer as well as lead. I therefore
 coated, by the galvanic process, leaden plates with antimony,
 arsenic, chromium, molybdenum and borax. The plates
 coated with arsenic and molybdenum were much inferior to
 platina: those that were coated with antimony and borax
 appeared fully equal to platinized lead, but they soon lost their
power. The first plate which I chromed acted as well, and
 retained its power nearly as long as platinized or gilded lead.
 I afterwards coated a great number of plates with chromium;
 but all of them were far inferior to the first. The power of a
 leaden plate is greatly increased by being coated with mer
 cury, or even with clay boiled in aqua regia, or with any other
 substance which I tried; but I have not found any substance
 to answer as well as the chloride of gold or platina.
    I have compared with platinized lead, the other cheap me
 tals coated with gold or platina, or chromium; and with the
 exception of cast iron, they were all inferior to it. Platinized
 or chromed cast iron answers as well as platinized lead; and
 without being chromed or platinized, cast iron appears to act
 as powerfully as platina. The power of a cast iron battery in     º
 magnetizing our large electro-magnet, and in driving an elec
 tro-magnetic machine, was compared with that of a Grove's
 battery of the same size. In the two batteries the exciting
 mixture was the same. The power of the former appeared to
 be fully equal to that of the latter.
    From the results of several experiments which I have made
 on the relative power of platinized silver and platinized lead,

        The Rev. N. J. Callan on a new Voltaic Battery.       85
I feel confident that the latter may, without any diminution
of power, be substituted for the former in Smee's battery.
Cast iron does not take the coating of platina powder (at least
until the hard surface is worn away) so well as lead or silver,
and on that account it does not act as powerfully as either.
But I have found zinc and cast iron excited by dilute sul
phuric acid as constant in their action as zinc and platinized
lead. A platinized lead, or cast iron plate six inches square,
may be had for the twelfth part of the cost of a platinized
sheet of silver of the same size.
   From the experiments which have been described, I infer,
first, that a battery superior in power to Professor Grove's
nitric acid battery may be made by substituting platinized
platina or lead for platina, and nitrosulphuric acid and nitrate
of potash for nitric and sulphuric acid; and secondly, that a
battery equal in power to the nitric acid battery may be con
structed by the substitution of cast iron for platina.
   The advantage of what I may call the nitre platina battery
over the nitric acid one is, that the expense of working the
former is, as has been already stated, considerably less than
that of working the latter.
   The advantage of the cast iron or platinized leaden batteries
over Professor Grove's is, that they are far less expensive in
their construction. A plate of cast iron or platinized lead
may be had for a shilling, whilst a platina plate of the same
size will cost nearly three pounds. Besides, a cast iron, or
platinized lead battery may be worked by a mixture of nitre
and sulphuric acid for one hour for about the tenth part of
the expense of working a Grove’s battery for the same time.
    The cheapness of cast iron and platinized lead will enable
every one to procure a powerful voltaic battery. A platinized
lead battery is about fifteen times as powerful as a common
 Wollaston battery of the same size. A cast iron battery is a
little less powerful than the platinized lead one; but I prefer
the former, because the cast iron does not require to be chromed
or platinized. I am now preparing two large cast iron bat
teries for the College : one will contain about thirty-three
square feet of zinc and sixty-six of cast iron, the other will
contain eighty square feet of zinc and a hundred and sixty of
cast iron. These batteries will be more powerful than any
battery ever constructed. The expense will be very mode
rate; for the zinc plates and Wedgwood troughs of our for
mer batteries will answer for the new ones.

XV. On the Perturbations of Planets moving in Eccentric
   and Inclined Orbits. By Sir J. LUBBoCK, Bart., F.R.S.
                       [Continued from page 6.]
  N the last Number of the Philosophical Magazine I de
    scribed tables by which the development of the disturbing
function R is greatly facilitated. I shall now describe other
tables which have been calculated for me by Mr. Farley,
and which also facilitate the numerical solution.         The ad
vantages which the employment of tables presents wherever
they can be applied are well known. Not only the march of
the figures affords security against error, but the computer
acquires facility in such calculations systematically undertaken,
while the operations are more easy than they would be if the
quantities required were not connected by a common origin,
or so troublesome as they would be if undertaken by different
individuals, or by the same individual at different times. The
use of tables is out of the question in a literal or algebraic
development; but, on the contrary, it is an important pro
perty of the numerical development that it can thus be mate
rially facilitated.
   All developments whatever may be resolved into three
classes, which I call literal, quasi-literal, and arithmetic. Li
teral or algebraical are those which result when the numerical
values of the constants are inserted last, and after the deve
lopment is complete. Quasi-literal are those which result
when either a part only of the constants are expressed by means
of general symbols, or when the development is made up of
several distinct processes, and when the numerical values are
inserted after a portion of these, but not all have been accom
plished. Finally, arithmetic or numerical developments are
those which result when the numerical values of the constants
are inserted in place of the general symbols before any step
of the development is attempted.
   A literal development is generally preferable, for this rea
son, that if it can be performed, the development which re
sults serves for every possible value which can be assigned to
the constants. Such, for instance, is the development of the
disturbing function due to M. Binet; and if such a development
in terms of the requisite variables could be accomplished and
carried out to a sufficient extent, and if, being accomplished,
numerical values of the constants could be easily introduced,
it would be preferable to any other. M. Hansen's develop
ment, in his Memoir on the Perturbations of Encke's Comet
by Saturn, is a quasi-literal development, because a portion
only of the processes is general. The conversion of the quan

tiples of f is an arithmetical process; while the calculation of
the quantities An, in p. 29 of M. Hansen's paper, is literal
or algebraical.
    I regard as very difficult any development of the disturbing
function, either literal or quasi-literal, when the eccentricity
of the disturbed body is considerable and the perturbations
are large, as in the case of Encke's comet disturbed by Jupiter;
and if such were possible, the replacement of the numerous
symbols by numbers at the conclusion, would be an operation
of almost insurmountable difficulty. On the other hand, in
performing an arithmetical development according to the rules
which I have invented, not only no quantity can be introduced
which has a numerical value beneath any given limit (say
beneath unity in a given decimal place), but it is equally im
possible, except by a numerical imistake, that any quantity
which is above that limit can be omitted. The developments
may also be effected by mechanical quadratures, as explained
by M. de Pontécoulant (Théor. Anal., vol. iii.), or by the method
given by M. Le Verrier in the first number of the Dévéloppe

 which, by means of various combinations, form the disturbing

 stants are introduced before the development is begun are
 alone required. Mr. Farley has calculated the coefficients of
 these quantities when they are developed in terms of the mean
 motions for the planets, and also other tables for eccentricity,
 ‘1, 2, . . . . .7, which show the convergence to be so slight,
 that such mode of development can only be employed when
 the eccentricity is small. These tables have all been con
 structed by means of mechanical quadratures. These tables
 are not wanted for the comets, because their co-ordinates
cannot be developed in terms of their mean anomalies in suf
ficiently converging series.
     When the method of mechanical quadratures is applied to
the determination of the perturbations of comets, a correction
is required; but when that method is used for the determina
tion of coefficients of this nature, the limits of the integral are
0 and 360°, and the correction vanishes; so that by means of
 several particular values, rigorous values of the coefficients
are easily obtained. Nor does the width of the interval matter,
provided it is not made too large. It is difficult to give pre
cise rules to regulate the width that should be employed; but
in the formation of these tables it was easy to employ various
modes of verification. As this inquiry is in its infancy, I
considered it sufficient to retain only those terms which are

              moving in Eccentric and Inclined Orbits.           89
due to the elliptic motion; but hereafter it may be desirable
to reconstruct the tables of the elementary quantities for each
of the planets, retaining some of the principal inequalities due
to the disturbing force.
    Pingré, in his work on comets many years since, gave a list
of comets, with their elements.          At that time, however, the
method of finding the orbit, or even the distance of a comet,
was understood by so few persons, that, from that and other
causes, the numbers contained in that table may not be accu
rate: many other comets have been discovered since, and such
a table brought up to the present time appears to be an impor
tant desideratum in astronomy.

XVII. On certain Phaenomena of Voltaic Ignition and the
   Decomposition of Water into its constituent Gases by Heat.
   By W. R. GRovE, Esq., M.A., F.R.S.
                      [Continued from p. 35.]
I WASnow anxious to produce a continuous development of
    mixed gas from water subjected to heat alone, in other
words, to succeed in an experiment which should bear the same
relation to experiment fig. 9 as fig. 5 did to fig. 7; for this pur
pose the apparatus shown at fig. 10 was constructed: a and
                             Fig. 10.
b are two silver tubes 4 inches long by 0.3 inch diameter;
they are joined by two platinum caps to a platinum tube c,
formed of a wire one-eighth of an inch diameter drilled
through its entire length, with a drill of the size of a large

 92. Mr. Grove on the Decomposition of Water by Heat.
 pin; a is closed at the extremity, and to the extremity of b is
 fitted, by means of a coiled strip of bladder, the bent glass
 tube d. The whole is filled with prepared water, and having
 expelled the air from a by heat, the extremity of the glass
 tube is placed in a capsule of simmering water. Heat is now
 applied by a spirit-lamp, first to b and then to a, until the
 whole boils; as soon as ebullition takes place, the flame of an
 oxyhydrogen blowpipe is made to play upon the middle part
 of the platinum tube c, and when this has reached a high
 point of ignition, which should be as nearly the fusing-point
 of platinum as is practicable, gas is given off, which, mixed
 with steam, very soon fills the whole apparatus and bubbles up
 from the open extremity, either into the open air or into a gas
 collector. Although by the time I had devised this apparatus
 I was from my previous experiments tolerably well assured of
 its success, yet I experienced a feeling of great gratification
 when on applying a match to one of the bubbles which were
ascending, it gave a sharp detonation; I collected and ana
 lysed some of it; it was 0.7 oxyhydrogen gas, the residue
nitrogen, with a trace of oxygen.
    Those who have endeavoured to deprive water of air, will
have no difficulty in accounting for the residual nitrogen, or
nitrogen mixed with a small portion of oxygen, which has
occurred in all my experiments. De Luc pointed out the
impossibility of practically depriving water of air, and Priest
ley, from observing the obstinacy with which water retained
air, was led to believe that water was convertible into nitrogen
(phlogisticated air). I have repeated several of Priestley's
experiments under much more stringent circumstances, and
have never been able to free water from air, or so to boil
water that for every ebullition of vapour a minute bubble of
permanent gas was not left, which appeared to have been an
indispensable nucleus to the vapour.
    The difficulty of boiling water increases, as M. Donny has
proved, in proportion to its freedom from air, and at last the
bursts of vapour become so enormous that the vessels em
ployed are generally broken. There appears to me a point
beyond which this resistance does not extend ; but even at
this point a minute bubble of air is le<U+017F>t for each burst of va
pour, though they are so few and distant that the aggregate
amount of gas is very trifling. I have produced from water
which had been previously carefully deprived of air by the
ordinary methods, three-fourths of its own volume of perma
nent gas, which proved to be nitrogen; but as the water in
this experiment was boiled under a long column of oil, it is
probable that if any oxygen were present, it might have been

       Mr. Grove on the Decomposition of Water by Heat. 93
absorbed by the oil; I have, however, always found the pro
portion of oxygen to decrease as the boiling was continued.
It may be worth noticing, as having had some influence on
my mind, that many months ago, when considering the expe
riments of Henry and Donny on the cohesion of water, I
mentioned to . Mr. Gassiot, and also to Mr. Bingham my
assistant (to whose assiduity I am much indebted), that I was
inclined to think if water could be absolutely deprived of air,
it would be decomposed by heat, a result which I have now
attained by a totally different series of inductions. It is a cir
cumstance worthy of remark, that I find the greater part of
the air to be expelled at a comparatively low temperature, and
when the water has come in contact with the platinum, while
the decomposition all takes place when the platinum is sur
rounded by an atmosphere of steam, if steam it may be called,
 for the state of this atmosphere at the first immersion of the
 platinum is at present very mysterious.
    I think I may now safely regard it as proved, that platinum
intensely ignited will decompose water, and several considera
tions press on the mind in reflecting on this novel phaeno
 menon,
    First of all, to those who are attached to the cui bono argu
 ment, and estimate physical science in proportion only to its
 practical applications, I would say that these experiments
 afford some promise of our being, at no distant period, able
 to produce mixed gases for purposes of illumination, &c. by
 simply boiling water and passing it through highly ignited
 platinum tubes, or by other methods which may be devised;
 we in fact by this means, as it were, boil water into gas, and
 there appears theoretically no more simple way of producing
 chemical decomposition.
    To pass however to more important considerations: the
 spheroidal state, which has lately attracted the attention of
 philosophers, appears to be closely connected with these re
 sults, and is rendered more deeply interesting. The last
 experiment but two which I have mentioned, shows that the
 spheroidal state is intermediate between ordinary, ebullition
 and the decomposing ebullition; it is probably therefore a
 state of polar tension, coordinate in some respects with that
 which takes place in the cell of a voltaic combination before
 decomposition, or when the power employed not being of suf
 ficient intensity to produce actual decomposition, the state
 commonly called polarization of the electrodes, obtains. The
 phaenomenon brings out also a new relation between heat,
 electricity, and chemical affinity; nitherto many electrical
 phaenomena could be produced by heat and chemical action,

 94   Mr. Grove on the Decomposition of Water by Heat.
the difference being that in the effects produced by the last
two forces there was no polar chain, but every minute portion
of the matter acted on gave rise to the phaenomena which in
the electrical effects are only observable at the polar extremi
ties; thus in decomposing water by iron and sulphuric acid,
or by passing steam over heated tubes of iron, parallel results
are obtained to the electrolysis of water with an iron anode;
but in the former cases every portion of the iron oxidated
gives off its equivalent of hydrogen, in the latter the equiva
lent is evolved from the cathode at a point distant from that
where the oxidation takes place. Hitherto electricity has been
the only force by which many compounds, and particularly
water, could be resolved into their constituents without either
of these being absorbed by another affinity. The decompo
sition by ignited platinum removes this exception, and pre
sents the parallel effect produced by heat alone.
   Although there is no substance except platinum and some
of the more rare metals, such as iridium, which promise much
success in a laboratory experiment made for the purpose of
producing the effect I have described, as the greater number
 of substances which will bear a sufficient heat, are fragile,
oxidable, or affected by water, yet general considerations from
the nearest analogies in chemistry would lead us to expect a
similar effect from all matter in a state of intense ignition;
even assuming the presence of solid matter to be necessary,
the catalytic effects of platinum are shared in different degrees
by other substances: it therefore appears probable that at a
certain degree of heat water does not exist as water or steam,
but is resolved into its constituent elements.      If, therefore,
there be planets whose physical condition is consistent with
an intense heat, the probability is, that their atmosphere and
the substances which compose them are in a totally different
chemical state from ours, and resolved into what we call ele
ments, but which by intense heat may be again resolved into
more subtle elements. The same may be the case in the
interior of our planet, subject however to the counter agency
of pressure.
   The experiments strongly tend to support the views of
Berthollet, that chemical and physical attraction are affinal,
or produced by the same mode of force. All calorific expan
sions appear to consist in a mechanical severance of the mole
cules of matter; and if heat produce effects of decomposition
merely by increase of intensity, there seems no reason why
we should assign to it in this case a different mode of action
from its normal one. On this view physical division carried
on indefinitely must ultimately produce decomposition, and

       Mr. Grove on the Decomposition of Water by Heat.                95
chemical affinity is only another mode of molecular attraction.
Thus a high degree of rarefaction, as at the bounds of the
atmosphere, or in the interplanetary spaces, may entirely
change the chemical condition of matter.
    In a paper published in the Philosophical Transactions for
1843, p. 111, I have shown that we may oppose a chemical
action by a physical one (electrolysis by a vacuum), that an
tagonizing chemical by physical tension, they mutually oppose
each other. I believe the converse of this experiment has
been made by M. Babinet, who by physical compression has
prevented the development of chemical action.
    I have also described in the Philosophical Magazine for
November 1845, certain phaenomena which appear to me to
be irreconcileable with received chemical views; and though
I then believed that the theory of Grotthus would be obliged
to give way, I now incline to think that some of our chemical
doctrines must ere long undergo a revision.
    It is rather surprising that the valuable applications of which
 the phaenomena of voltaic ignition are capable, and the fertile
 field which (as I believe) it presents for discoveries, both phy
 sical and chemical, should have been so completely neglected.
 It is true that until a recent period the imperfection of the
 voltaic battery rendered accurate and continued experiment
 on this subject difficult of performance, but still much might
 have been done. Davy made several experiments on the
 voltaic disruptive discharge, which in many points may be
 regarded simply as very intense ignition; but I am only aware
 of two experiments of his on voltaic ignition; one, in which
 he employed it in an exhausted receiver to examine to what
 extent the radiation of heat was carried on in vacuo; and
  another, already alluded to, in which, by immersing a portion
  of an ignited wire in water, he observed that it conducted in
  some inverse ratio to its heat.
     I have made a vast number of experiments on the voltaic
  arc or disruptive discharge, in various media”; when this is
  taken in a medium incapable of acting chemically on the elec
  trodes, the phaenomena are those of intense ignition of the
  terminals, which are dissipated in vapour and condensed upon
  the interior of the vessel in which the discharge is taken.             I
  have examined some of these deposits, and they appear to
  consist of the metal of the terminals in a finely-divided state;
  this is strikingly shown with zinc. If the arc be taken between
  zinc points in an exhausted receiver, a fine dark powder,
  nearly black, is deposited on the interior, which, when col
  lected, proves to be pure zinc, and on the application of a

   gentle heat, takes fire in the open air and burns into the white
   oxide: to casual observation the zinc would appear to be
   burned twice. The experiment appears to me to present an
   argument in favour of the dynamic theory of heat.
      With charcoal, on the other hand, there is little or no de
  posit, but the charcoal continually yields carbonic oxide and
  hydrogen, and this for hours after the presence of water would
  be deemed impossible. I have taken the arc between pieces
  of well-burned charcoal for eight or nine successive hours,
  and there was still gas generated; indeed it appeared to be
  given off as long as there was any charcoal remaining, and a
  conversion of the carbon into inflammable gas might have
  been supposed. Much still remains to be done with this
  powerful agent, the voltaic arc: where, however, the object
  is simply to expose gases to an intense heat, the ignition of a
  conjunctive wire of platinum is more simple in its application,
  more uniform in its action, and instead of requiring a power
 ful battery, the effect can be satisfactorily produced by five or
 six cells, in many cases by two.
     The heat is not so intense as that of the arc, but as it can
 be brought to within a few degrees of the fusing-point of pla
 tinum, it is far more intense than any heat usually employed
 in laboratories, certainly than any which can be applied to
 minute, I may say microscopic portions of gas or vapour.
     In conclusion, I must express my sincere thanks to the
 managers of the London Institution, for having permitted me,
 as an honorary member, to carry on these experiments in the
 laboratory of the Institution.

 XVIII. Supplementary Paper on certain Phaenomena of Voltaic
    Ignition, and the Decomposition of Water into its constituent
    Gases by Heat. By W. R. G.Rove, Esq.”
 IN     selecting the above title, I endeavoured to give as clear
      an enunciation of the phaenomena to be described in the
paper as was consistent with the brevity usual in a title.
    An exception has, however, been taken to it, that as the
effects of decomposition are produced by ignited platinum,
the phaenomena may result from that obscure mode of action
called catalysis. That I did not intend to exclude from con
sideration any possible action of the substance employed, will
be evident from the paper itself, in which I have called attention
to the general production of catalytic effects by solid bodies.
   * From the Philosophical Transactions for 1847, part i.; having been
received by the Royal Society November 26, and read November 26, 1846.

       Mr. Grove on the Decomposition of Water by Heat.       97
    Whatever value or novelty there may be in the facts I
 have communicated, is the same whether they be regarded
as resulting from catalytic or from thermic actions. If the
action be catalytic, it is one absolutely the reverse of that
 usually produced by platinum, and therefore just as much at
variance with received experience as decomposition of water
by heat would be; the effect of platinum, like that of heat, on
the elements of water having been hitherto known only as
combining them. With regard to any theoretic views I may
have advanced, I by no means attach the same importance to
them as I do to the facts themselves, though I consider it
necessary for the collation of facts, and desirable for the pro
gress of science, that an author pretending to communicate
new results should give with them the impressions which led
to their discovery, and the inferences which he regards as im
mediately deducible from them. No expression can be given
to facts which does not involve some theory, and admitting
the difficulty (perhaps insuperable) of correctly enunciating
new phaenomena, and the probability of future discoveries
entirely changing our views regarding them, I cannot at pre
sent see that the title of my paper could be altered without
being open to greater objections. I am of this opinion, not
so much because other bodies than platinum will produce the
effect, as I shall presently show, nor from the fact that the
electrical spark will decompose aqueous vapour, though these
are arguments in its favour; but from the following conside
rations. The catalytic action of platinum will induce or en
able combination to take place where there is already a strong
affinity or tendency to combine, as with mixed oxygen and
hydrogen gases; it will also induce decomposition where the
affinities are extremely weak, or in a state of unstable equili
brium, as in Thenard's peroxide of hydrogen; again, where
there are nicely-balanced compound affinities, it may change
the chemical arrangement of the constituents of a compound,
but I do not know of any case in which a powerful chemical
affinity can be overcome by catalytic action; to effect this we
require some natural force of greater intensity than that to be
overcome. We might as well say that the platinum electrodes
of a voltaic battery decompose water, as to say that platinum
decomposes it in the case in question; there, the force of
electricity acts only by means of matter, and matter of a pecu
liar description; its action also is only perceptible at the sur
face of this matter. I seek to use the expression in my title
with reference to heat in a similar sense to that in which we
use similar terms with reference to electricity, i. e. to regard
heat as the immediate dynamic force which overcomes the

 affinity; thus, as we say when employing the voltaic battery,
 that we decompose water by electricity, so here we should say
 that we decompose it by heat.
    If it be said that heat so weakens or antagonizes the affinity
 of the elements of water as to enable catalytic action to sepa
 rate them, this amounts to the same theory, as heat is then
 regarded as the antagonizing force, and in this case the action,
 both thermic and catalytic, is the reverse of the normal action.
 I have thought it desirable shortly to discuss this question as
 likely to lead to further investigation, though I have been
 somewhat embarrassed by the want of definite meaning in the
 term catalysis; I must plead guilty to have frequently used
 the term, but notwithstanding, or perhaps on account of, its
 convenience, it has I fear had an injurious effect on scientific
 perspicuity.
    The following experiments were made to ascertain whether
 platinum was the only substance by which the effect could be
 produced. A knob or button of the native alloy of iridium
 and osmium of the size of a small pea was formed by the vol
taic battery; to this was attached by fusion another smaller
knob of the same metal one-fourth the size of the former, and
to this smaller one was attached a stout platinum wire; the
object of the second knob was both to prevent the fusion of the
platinum wire and also to avoid the possibility of any surface
of platinum being exposed to the recipient tube or alloyed with
the metal to be heated. The preparation of this simple in
strument was very troublesome, but when made it answered
the purpose well; the larger button could be fully ignited to
an intense glow, while on account of the narrow neck which
united them, the smaller was barely red-hot, and the platinum
wire not perceptibly ignited. An experiment having been
made with this metallic button and prepared water, similar to
that previously made with platinum, gas was given off which
averaged 0.3 of mixed gas; the residue was nitrogen mixed
with varying small quantities of oxygen. The effect, upon the
whole, was decidedly inferior to that of the platinum. Indeed
as platinum is the most dense and unalterable of all known
substances, it would be likely, upon any received theory of
heat, to produce the greatest effects.
   I tried palladium in the same manner; the gas yielded was
hydrogen with small quantities of oxygen, and the water was
stained with the oxide of the metal.
   I now tried silica and other oxides, but the results were
not very satisfactory. A spheroid of silica was formed by
fusing pulverized silica on to a platinum wire, so as to cover
it for the length of 0.4 of an inch; when this was plunged into

      Mr. Grove on the Decomposition of Water by Heat.         99
the hot water and again fused in the oxyhydrogen blowpipe,
it constantly became frothed with small bubbles of vapour,
and after a few experiments generally separated in fissures;
in the experiment which was continued for the longest time
without disintegration, the gas given off contained 0-15 of
oxyhydrogen gas ; from the whole result I believe there is an
action of the water on the silica (probably forming a hydrate
decomposable by heat) which is a bar to satisfactory results.
With other oxides, at least such as would bear an intense
heat, the difficulties were still more insuperable. Priestley
has shown that water will corrode glass, and if I mistake
not, others have shown the same effect produced on silica.
   Although, as applied to the facts detailed, I attached no
further meaning to the title of my paper than that which I
have above stated, yet in one or two theoretical inferences I
have certainly gone further; for instance, when I suppose the
possibility or probability of mechanical rarefaction producing
the same effects as heat, here (although I do not, indeed I can
not conceive the existence of heat without matter) I certainly
abstract from the proposition any consideration of solid matter.
In order to ascertain how far this view might be founded on
truth, I had thought of making a few experiments on the
effect of mechanical rarefaction on the tendency of gases to
combine, but (in addition to the interference of necessary
occupations) I find that M. de Grotthus has already experi
mented on the point; his experiments, as far as they go, cor
roborate the views I have put forth.                  - -
   He finds* that mixed gases, such as chlorine and hydrogen,
or oxygen and hydrogen, when rarefied either by slow incre
ments of heat or by the air-pump, do not take fire (“ne s'en
flamment pas”) by the electric spark. From the context, he
evidently means that the gases will not detonate or unite in
volumes, as he states that a partial combination ensues. Grott
hus appears to have considered the combination of gases by
the electric spark as an effect of sudden compression or mole
cular approximation, certain particles being brought within
the range of their affinities by the sudden dilatation of others.
Although he did not pursue the subject far enough to ascertain
whether a degree of rarefaction could be reached which would
be an actual bar to combination, still his experiments strengthen
those views which assimilate mechanical and thermic molecular
repulsion, and regard chemical affinity as being antagonized
by physical repulsion.

that of metallic oxides at a higher, and so on to oxide of hy
drogen, there appears to be an extensive series of facts which
afford strong hope of a generalized antagonism between ther
mic repulsion and chemical affinity, and a consequent esta
blishment of the law of continuity in reference to physical and
chemical attraction.
   The deposit from chlorine, to which I have alluded in my
paper, I have since examined, and though it differs in colour
from that described in books, I find it is a protochloride of
platinum, formed at the expense of the platinum wire. The
larger portion of the chlorine in the tube combines with the
hydrogen of the aqueous vapour, and the muriatic acid is
absorbed by the water; when the experiment terminates the
gaseous volume is reduced to nearly one-half, and this residue
is oxygen.
   This effect induced me to try an ignited wire on other ana
logues of chlorine, and I tried bromine and chloride of iodine
in the apparatus (fig. 5). The tube was filled with the liquid,
and its extremity was in the first experiments immersed in
another narrow tube of the same liquid as that which filled it.
When the platinum wire was ignited, permanent gas was
given off both from the bromine and from the chloride of
iodine, which gas on examination proved, to my surprise, to
be .. In one experiment I collected half a cubic inch
of gas from an equal volume of chloride of iodine. As the
experiment in this form required too large a quantity of the
liquid to enable me to observe any change which might take
place in its character, I repeated it with a tube five feet long,
bent in two angular curves. A small quantity of the liquid
 was placed in the extremity of the tube containing the wire,
 which was so arranged as to be the lowest point; the angles
 were placed in cold water and the experiment proceeded with ;
 my object was to enable the dense vapour of the liquids to
 shelter them from the atmosphere, there being no satisfactory
 method of shutting them in and yet allowing room for the
 elimination of the liberated gas, or of absorbing the latter by
 combination without also absorbing the vapours.
    I had hoped by the above means to proceed with the ex
 periments until all the oxygen was liberated that could be
 driven off, and then to have examined the residua; but I found
 that after experimenting for a short time, both the platinum
 wire and the glass in proximity to it were attacked by the
 liquids; this difficulty, similar to those which have hitherto
 prevented the isolation of fluorine, I have not yet been able
 to conquer, though I hope to resume the experiments.
    As chloride of iodine is decomposed by water, it cannot

        Sir David Brewster on the Structure of Topaz.               101
contain any notable quantity of the latter, but, until the expe
riments are carried further, it must remain a question whether
the oxygen results from a small quantity of water contained
in the liquid, the hydrogen combining with the liquid itself, or
from a decomposition similar to that of the peroxides. The
experiments certainly add a new and striking analogy to those
already known to exist between the peroxides and the halo
gens, but they do not, as far as I have hitherto carried them,
necessarily prove analogy of composition.                      -
   In conclusion, I would call attention to a point which I
omitted to notice in my original paper, viz. the explanation
afforded by the results contained in it of the hitherto myste
rious phaenomena of the non-polar decomposition of water by
electrical discharges, as in the experiments of Pearson and
Wollaston. This class of decompositions may now be car
ried much further. With the exception of fused metals, I
know of no liquid, which, when exposed to intense heat such
as that given by the electric spark, the voltaic arc, or incan
descent platinum, does not give off permanent gas; phos
phorus, sulphur, acids, hydrocarbons, water, salts, bromine
and chloride of iodine, all yield gaseous matter.
   Viewing these effects simply as facts, and without entering
on any theoretical explanations or speculations, I cannot but
think that there is a remarkable generality pertaining to them
worthy of the most careful attention.
   The apparatus I have described, particularly that repre
sented by fig. 5, and the numerous applications of voltaic
ignition which will occur to those who duly consider the sub
ject, promise, I venture to believe, new methods and powers
of investigating the molecular constitution of matter, and will,
I trust, lead to many novel and important results.

 Wº:              examining, in polarized light, the form and
          structure of the numerous crystals which I had dis
 covered in the fluid cavities of topaz, my attention was par
 ticularly called to certain optical phaenomena exhibited in
 other parts of the specimen. These phaenomena, when first
   * Read before the Royal Society of Edinburgh on the 20th of January
 1845, and published in their Transactions, vol. xvi. part 1. p. 7.

102 Sir David Brewster on a Modification of the Doubly
presented to me, were very indefinite in their character, and
very imperfectly developed; but after a diligent examination
of nearly 900 specimens of topaz, I succeeded in obtaining the
most satisfactory exhibition of them under various forms, and
in various degrees of intensity.
   When an elastic force is propagated from a centre, in a soft
and compressible medium, an increase of density is commu
nicated to the surrounding mass, of a temporary nature if
the medium is a hard solid, like glass, but of a permanent
nature if the medium is soft, and becomes indurated during
the continuance of the compressing force. Both these effects
may be exhibited experimentally; the first by a pressure upon
glass, and the second by the action of an expanded bubble of
air upon gum in a state advancing to induration.
   The physical change thus produced in the transparent me
dium, whether it be temporary or permanent, may be exhibited
to the eye in two ways; either by the property of the com
pressed parts in depolarizing light, or in the unequal refraction
of common light produced by a varying density, and conse
quently a varying refractive power. In the first of these cases,
the depolarizing action is displayed in the production of four
quadrants of light, separated by the radii of a black rectan
gular cross, similar to the central portion, or the tints of the
first order, in the uniaxal system of polarized rings; and, in
the second case, the inequality of refractive density is shown
by the mirage of a luminous point, in the form of concentric
circles surrounding the centre of force, each circle marking
successive actions of the central force.       -
   When the four luminous quadrants of depolarized light,
shown at A, B, C, D in Plate I. fig. 1, first presented them
selves to me, I had some difficulty in perceiving the seat of
the force, by which I believed that they were produced. The
centres, or intersections of the black cross, were either too
deep beneath the surface of the topaz, or too much covered
by fluid cavities, to be seen; but by removing the part of the
crystal which contained these cavities, I succeeded in finding
that in every case there was a minute cavity in the centre of
the luminous quadrants, or at the intersections of the arms of
the black cross, from which the compressing force had ema
nated. One of these cavities is shown at E, fig. 2. It is of
a quadrangular form, like the section of a rhomboidal prism,
sometimes elongated, and sometimes of a slightly irregular
shape. When perfectly regular, these cavities are between
the 3000dth and the 4000dth of an inch in diameter. They
are always dark, as if the elastic substance which they con
tained had collapsed into an opake powder; and I have met

          Refracting and Physical Structure of Topaz.         103
with only one case in which there seemed to be a speck of
light in the centre. The degree of compression to which the
topaz has been subjected is measured by the polarized tint
developed in the luminous quadrants. It varies from the
faintest pale blue to the white of the first order. In one case
I found the luminous quadrant of one cavity coinciding with
a luminous quadrant of another cavity, and thus producing
the sum of their separate tints. This effect is shown in fig. 3.
    In the phaenomenon now described, the elastic force has
spent itself in the compression of the topaz. The cavity itself
has remained entire, without any fissure by which a gas or a
fluid could escape. I have discovered, however, other cavities,
and these generally of a larger size, in which the sides have
been rent by the elastic force; and fissures, from one to sia in
number, propagated to a small distance around them. These
fissures have modified the doubly refracting structure pro
duced by compression; but, what is very interesting, no solid
matter has been left on the faces of fracture, such as that which
is invariably deposited, when an ordinary cavity, containing
one or both of the two new fluids, is exploded by heat. The
form of some of the cavities which have suffered this disrup
tion is shown in fig. 4.
    The influence of the compressing forces in altering the
density, and consequently the refractive power of the topaz, is
so distinctly seen in common light as to indicate the phaeno
mena that are seen under polarized light. When the cavity
is most distinctly perceived, it is surrounded with luminous
and shaded circles, as shown in fig. 5; and traces of these are
distinctly seen, as shown in fig. 6, when the specimen is ex
amined in polarized light.
    The cavities now described have obviously no resemblance
whatever to those which I have described in previous papers
as containing two new fluids. When any of the latter are
either burst by heat, or exposed under high temperatures to
the compressing forces of the fluids which they contain, they
exhibit none of the phaenomena peculiar to the former. The
doubly refracting structure suffers no change; and when the
cohesive forces of the crystal are overpowered, the faces of
 most eminent cleavage separate, and are covered with trans
lucent crystalline particles, which the evaporated or discharged
fluids leave behind.
    The peculiar character of the pressure cavities, as we may
 call them, is still further evinced by the nature of the speci
 mens in which they occur.       I have never found them accom
panying the ordinary cavities with two fluids. The specimens
 which contain them have imbedded in them numerous crystals,

differing little in their refractive power from topaz, and ex
hibiting in polarized light the most beautiful colours, varying
with the thickness of the crystal, and diminishing in intensity
as their axes approach to the plane of primitive polarization.
    It is impossible to review the preceding facts without arri
ving at the conclusion, that the topaz must have been in a
soft and plastic state when it yielded to the compressing force
which emanated from the cavities; and that a mineral body
thus acted upon could not have been formed, according to
the received theory, by the aggregation of molecules having
the primitive form of the crystal.
    In a letter to Sir Joseph Banks, printed in the Philosophical
Transactions for 1805, I deduced, from my experiments on
depolarization, the existence of a new “species of crystalliza
tion, which is the effect of time alone, and which is produced
by the slow action of corpuscular forces;” and I have re
marked that “this kind of crystallization will probably be
 found to have had an extensive influence in those vast arrange
ments which must have attended the formation of our globe.”
 These views have been confirmed by various new facts, wholly
independent of each other;-by the existence of crystals im
bedded in topaz, and having their axes in all possible direc
 tions, but especially by the nature and form of the strata of
 fluid cavities in that mineral.      These strata cut at all inclina
 tions the primary and secondary planes of the crystal. They
 are bent in the most capricious manner, forming planes of
 double curvature; and, what is also true of individual cavities
 stretching in every possible direction, they could never have
been formed but when the topaz was in a soft and plastic
State.
    An objection to these views may be drawn from the fissures
 which proceed from the pressure cavities. The topaz must,
 doubtless, have been indurated when these fissures took place;
 but it is equally obvious that the depolarization produced by
 compression must have previously existed, and it is probable
that the fissures were produced after the crystal had been
removed from its matrix, and when, from cleavage or other
wise, its cohesive forces had been diminished.

   If we examine somewhat in detail the results of the ash
analyses above given, there will be found several points worthy
of attention, in reference to the probable laws of replacement
of acids and bases, as mineral constituents of plants; and also
with regard to the necessary presence of certain materials,
   It will be seen that in all cases a large proportion of the
bases of the ash had been combined with organic acids, and
were hence found in the ash as carbonates. This quantity is,

108 Sir Robert Kane on the Chemical Constitution of the
however, variable; and it will be seen that a variation takes
place in the quantity of sulphuric acid exactly of an opposite
character; so that in the plant, the proportions of organic
salts and of sulphates would appear to have been such, that an
increase in one replaced any deficiengy of the other. Thus
when the quantity of carbonic acid in the ash was 25-235, the
sulphuric acid was 6'174; but when the sulphuric acid was
12-091, the carbonic acid fell to 9'895.         I do not however
mean absolutely to assert that the sulphuric and the organic
acids of the plant are, in all cases, or exactly, mutually re
placing.
   The small quantity, as well as the narrow limits of fluctua
tion of the silica, is worthy of notice; particularly when com
pared with that which I shall have to notice as regards the
composition of Irish flax. It does not appear connected with
any of the bases in particular, nor to follow any special varia
tion among them.
   There is nothing more peculiarly characteristic in the com
position of the ashes of the flax plant, than the quantity of
phosphoric acid which is found therein. In order to bring
this into full evidence, I shall extract from the works of other
chemists the determination of the quantity of phosphoric acid
in the ash yielded by the stems of other plants.
              Tobacco stalk and leaves .      .    2-73

              Clover plants . . . . . . 6:30
    The stems of flax are, then, more than double as rich in
phosphoric acid as the stems of even the cereal grasses or
leguminous plants; and if we even look to the constitution of
the ash of many substances used as food by man, we shall find
that, in 100 parts, there are from the ash of
              Oats . . . . 14.9 phosphoric acid
              Potatoes .    .  . 11'3        e e -
              Turnips . . . 6-1              e ea
whilst the average of the analyses of Belgian and Dutch flax
ashes show that there are present no less than 10-77 per cent.
 It was this enormous quantity of the most valuable ingredient
of manure that first impressed me with the importance of its
Oeconomy, and induced me to endeavour to fix the attention of
agriculturists upon the fact; for if we calculate, from the pro
duce per acre, the quantity of phosphoric acid taken from a
statute acre of ground by an ordinary crop of any of the usual
kinds, we shall find that it amounts in the case of flax to very
nearly as much as with any of the ordinary grain or root crops;

                        Ashes of the Flar Plant.                  109
and that whilst the mineral elements of these are what the
value really consists in, the value of the flax is altogether in
dependent of those constituents, which are thus so much real
loss to the farmer.
   Hence, under the ordinary plan of cultivation, farmers were
certainly in the right to consider it one of the most exhausting
crops; and that its place in rotation should be equivalent to
that of a grain crop, which it ought by no means to follow, or
be followed by; whereas, under a system of management which
should allow of the proper oeconomy of its mineral constituents,
that are separated in the processes of watering and dress
ing, the phosphoric acid and other materials might be restored
to the manure heap or to the field, and the crop of flax be
thus deprived of those permanently exhausting qualities which
it now possesses.
   It will be interesting further to notice the constitution of
these ashes, under a point of view which has been put forward
by some chemists, as possessing the character of a general rule
or law; to wit, that although the individual bases present in
an ash may vary very much, and even some (as in one of the
ashes analysed, B soda) may be totally absent, yet the sum of
the oxygen present in the bases will be found to be constant.
If we apply that rule to the ashes above analysed, we shall
find—                            -
           Title of ash.             Quantity of oxygen in bases.

                                 Average . 13:28
    There is certainly a close agreement among these numbers;
 and if we excluded one analysis (B), which is also exceptional
 in containing no soda, it should decidedly appear that the
 quantity of oxygen present in the bases of 100 parts of ash
 was represented by a constant number (13.86). It will be
 found that the analyses of Irish flax lend support to this view;
 but I think that we shall require very many inore analyses
 before we can fix upon it as a positive law.
    In order to afford comparison with the results above given,
 I have extended my analyses of Irish flax; and as there appear
 one or two remarkable points of difference between them, I
 shall notice also my prior results.
    The flax I originally experimented on was grown at my
 own residence, a short distance from Dublin. It yielded,

   I selected for another analysis a specimen of flax given to
me by William Blacker, Esq., which had received a prize at
the Market-hill show by the tenants of the Earl of Gosford.
When dried at 212°, this flax yielded 0.672 per cent. of nitro

   There is first to be remarked the very curious circumstances
of both Irish specimens containing a large quantity of silica,
from 21 to 25 per cent, whilst the Belgian and Dutch flax
contained only from 3 to 5 per cent. In the Dublin flax there
is no particular replacement to which this could be attributed;
but in the Armagh flax, the small quantity of carbonic acid,
only 4 per cent., shows that the organic acids had been but
little generated in the plant, and probably a quantity of silica
was substituted for them. The question of whether this large
quantity of silica, which, however, is mostly removed from the
fibre along with the other materials during its dressing, could
produce in it any degree of hardness or brittleness, is very
well worthy of the attention of the philosophical agriculturist.

                    Ashes of the Flar Plant.                 111
It is remarkable also, that in both Irish flaxes the potash
and soda are present in equal quantities, though not in the
same quantity in each ash. This, however, may be only a
coincidence, though still a remarkable one.
   A more interesting peculiarity is the presence, in the Armagh
flax, of the very large quantity of peroxide of iron, 13.5 per
cent. In the Dublin flax I have not formerly counted iron
as an ingredient, although I did find in the analyses a small
quantity, because I had burned the plants on a sheet of iron
wire-gauze, and I feared that a minute quantity of iron might
be derived from that; and also that, in that analysis, my only
object was to show the presence of large quantities of valuable
ingredients, which the farmer ought to oeconomise. I there
fore did not separately determine that minute trace of iron,
which, however, could in no way affect the numerical results.
The occurrence of the large quantity of iron in the Armagh
flax is, therefore, the more curious; and it will be interesting
to examine, by other analyses of the flax sown in the sand
stone districts of the north of Ireland, whether the same pro
portion of oxide of iron will be found.
   Notwithstanding the great difference in the quantity of silica
in the Irish flaxes from the Belgian, the proportion of oxygen
per cent. in the bases comes out nearly the same. Thus the
bases contain of oxygen,-

              Flax from Armagh. . . . . 13.66
closely coinciding with the number already found for the
Belgian and Dutch flax.
   It is not unimportant to correct a statement recently made,
that prepared fibre of flax is not so destitute of mineral con
stituents as I have assumed in the preceding investigations.
In order to arrive fully at the truth, I have instituted some
additional experiments, with the following results: —
   A. Very imperfectly dressed flax from the county Clare
gave, by incineration, with proper precautions, 0.97 per cent.
of ashes, containing principally oxide of iron and lime.
   B. A specimen of perfectly dressed flax from Belfast gave,
on incineration, 0.62 per cent. of ashes.
   C. A specimen of fine dressed linen gave, on incineration,
0-24 per cent. of ashes, principally lime, with some oxide of
iron. Hence it is evident that my former results on this point
were precisely confirmed by these new trials.
4. Itesults of the Examination of the Waters selected for steep
                      ing Flaw in Belgium.
   No. 1. This water is from a large pond near the bank of

 112 Sir Robert Kane on the Chemical Constitution of the
 the Scheldt, which has been most likely formed by digging
 out peat for fuel, as the soil near it is peat, and as in neigh
 bouring ponds peat is now scraped up from the bottom, and
 prepared for fuel by drying in the sun. This water is renewed
 by the overflowing of the Scheldt, and is apparently not at all
 peaty.
    This water was pretty clear, but contained some suspended
 matter. When 100,000 grains were evaporated to dryness
there was obtained 51.70 grains of residue, consisting of, in

   No. 2. Water from one of the best Bloe retting pits, near
Hamme Log, in Belgium. This water is also supplied from
the Scheldt annually, before the retting season commences,
and left to stand in the pit for six or eight weeks. The top
becomes covered with green weeds which are cleared off im
mediately the flax is put in. This causes the water to be
muddy, as there is a considerable thickness of mud at the
bottom which is disturbed, the workmen standing in the pit
when cleaning the top of the water. The flax is then laid in;
and after laying two or three layers, they shovel up some of
the mud in the bottom to put on the flax to sink it; and when
the pit is full, the flax is covered by about an inch thickness
of mud. This sample was taken from a pit which had just
been disturbed and mudded by cleansing the top of weeds,
preparatory to putting the flax in.
   This water was found very muddy, but the suspended mat
ter was principally organic.

   With regard to the constitution of these several specimens
of water, it can only now be remarked, that in all there was
present a large quantity of mineral impurities; and that in
Nos. 2 and 4, the very samples which are of the most remark
able and celebrated steeping waters in Belgium, a large quan
tity of iron is present, so that they might be in a degree termed
chalybeate waters. How this regards their excellence for
preparing flax I do not pretend to say, and indeed it will
require much more extended investigation before a satisfactory
solution of it can be given.              -
   All these waters are further remarkable for containing a
larger quantity of potash than ordinary waters are found usu
ally to have. I shall not, however, enter minutely into the
discussion of their constitution, as I shall have to resume the
subject at another time; and I wish only to place on record
for the present the analytical results which the samples of
waters forwarded to me from Belgium by Mr. Marshall, had
afforded.
XXI. On the Theoretical Welocity of Sound. By J. P. JoJLE”.
     HE celebrated French mathematician De Laplace has,
      it is well known, pointed out that the heat evolved by
the compression of air is the cause of the velocity of sound,
according to the theory of Newton, being so much less than
that actually observed. He has also given a formula by which
the velocity may be determined when the ratio of the specific
heat of air at constant pressure to that at constant volume is
known. The determination of the elevation of temperature in
air by compression has however been hitherto attended with
difficulty, and hence the theorem of De Laplace has never yet
been fairly compared with experiment. I was therefore anxious
                    * Communicated by the Author.

          Mr. Nicholson on the Composition of Caffein.              115
to ascertain how far the mechanical equivalent of heat, as de
termined by my recent experiments on the friction of fluids,
might be able to contribute to clear up this question.
    The capacity of air at constant pressure, according to the
experiments of De la Roche and Berard, is 0.2669.               Conse
quently a quantity of heat capable of increasing the tempera
ture of a lb. of water by 1°, will give 1° also to 3-74.7 lbs. of air,
while the air will be expanded Tºr; an expansion in which a .
force equal to 2007 lbs. through a foot is expended in raising
the atmosphere of the earth. The equivalent of a degree of
heat per lb. of water, determined by the careful experiments
brought before the British Association at Oxford, is 775 lbs.
through a foot. Hence 2007 lbs. through a foot is equal to
O“259.
   We see, therefore, that for every degree of heat employed
by De la Roche and Berard in expanding and heating air,
O°259 was occupied in producing the mechanical effect, leaving
O°741 as that actually employed in raising the temperature of
the air. Hence the actual specific heat (commonly called
capacity at constant volume) is 0.2669 × 0.741 = 0-1977. Ta
king this as the specific heat of air and the equivalent 775, it
follows that if a volume of air of 171.6 cubic inches be com
pressed to 170.6 cubic inches, it will be heated 1°, a quantity
of heat which will occasion an increased pressure of Tºr.            So
that the celerity of sound will be increased by this means in the
subduplicate ratio of 491 to 661-6, or in the simple ratio of
2216 to 2572, which will bring it up from Newton's estimate
of 943 to 1095 feet per ", which is as near 1130, the actual
velocity at 32°, as could be expected from the nature of the
experiments on the specific heat of air, and fully confirms the
theory of Laplace.

  XXII. On the Composition of Caffein, and of some of its
 Compounds. By Edward CHAMBER's NICHOLSON, Esq.”
CAFEIN was first analysed by Professors Liebig and
      Pfafft in 1832. The result of this investigation was
confirmed by a subsequent analysis of Prof. Wöhler f.
    In 1838 Professor Liebig induced M. Jobst $ to analyse
thein, who proved this body to be identical with caffein.
His analyses gave the same results as his predecessors. The
same remark applies to the experiments of Mulder | on thein,
 lºommuniate          by the Chemical Society; having been read Feb. 15,

these numbers is
                               Cs H5N2 O2.

proves that this formula must be doubled, and that the atom
of caffein or thein is

   From these numerous experiments the composition of caf
fein might have been considered as perfectly established. In
a recent investigation of coffee, however, M. Payen; states
that he has obtained results which differ very sensibly from
those obtained by his predecessors, and which he has trans
lated into the formula

   We observe here a difference of 2 per cent. of carbon, which
M. Payen has obtained over the results of the above-men
tioned chemists.
   In order to elucidate this discrepancy, Dr. Hofmann in
duced me to make some experiments under his direction,
partly with a quantity of beautiful caffein which he gave me”.
and partly with a specimen which I have prepared myself.
                               Caffein.
   To ensure perfect purity of the substance it was crystal
lized three times from dilute alcohol, washed and dried. Thus
purified, it formed very beautiful long white prisms, perfectly
transparent when dried in the air, but which became opake
if exposed to a higher.temperature. The crystals dried in the
water-bath lost no weight when kept in an air-bath for four
hours at a temperature of 130° C.
   The specimen which I had prepared myself was obtained
from Costa Rico coffee, by boiling the bruised fruit in water,
precipitating the decoctions by basic acetate of lead and treat
ing the filtrate with hydrosulphuric acid; after the whole of
the lead had been removed, I evaporated the liquid to dry
ness in a water-bath, in order to get rid of acetic acid, and
dissolved the residue in a small quantity of boiling water:
upon cooling, the caffein crystallized out of a dark colour,
and very impure. To purify it, it was washed and recrystal
lized three times from water, and finally from alcohol. It was
then perfectly white, and had exactly the same appearance as
the specimen which I obtained from Dr. Hofmann.
                               Analysis.
    I. O-3827 grm. of substance, dried at 100° C. and burnt

   On precipitating a solution of caffein in hydrochloric acid
with bichloride of platinum, as Dr. Stenhouse has shown, a
precipitate of an orange-yellow colour is obtained. If the two
solutions are mixed hot, the fluid on cooling deposits the com
pound in beautiful granular crystalline tufts, which, when
thrown on a filter and washed with alcohol, are perfectly pure.
This double salt is only sparingly soluble in alcohol, aether,
and water. It does not alter when exposed to light, nor does
it lose in weight when kept at 100° C. for a considerable time.
   The analyses of salts, all prepared at different periods and
dried at 100° C., gave the following results:—
   I. 0.5382 grim. of substance, burnt with chromate of lead,

   The analysis of caffein, as well as that of the platinum
compounds, agree so perfectly with the numbers of Professor
Liebig’s formula, that there can be no doubt about its accu
raCW.
   Ruming      l equiv. of oxygen less in the equivalent of caf
fein, as is proposed by M. Payen, the platinum compound
should contain not less than 24:46 per cent. of carbon and
25-12 of platinum.      Now three determinations by Dr. Sten
house, and six which I have made, never gave more than 24'64
per cent, that is, 0.6 per cent, less of platinum.
   Not satisfied, however, with these proofs, I have tried to
find some other compounds by which the atomic weight of
caffein could be determined with equal accuracy.
   In what follows a description of several new double salts
of caffein will be given, the analyses of which correspond
equally well with the original formula of this substance.
                  Caffein and Nitrate of Silver.
   This compound is obtained when a solution of nitrate of
silver is added in excess to an aqueous or alcoholic solution
of caffein.   If the solutions are concentrated it falls down in
white hemispherical nodules, which adhere firmly to the side
of the vessel.
   When washed with water and crystallized from alcohol it is
absolutely pure. This compound is indistinctly crystalline,
of a perfectly white colour, and if dry undergoes no change
when exposed to light, but if moist acquires a purplish hue.
It is very soluble in hot water and alcohol, sparingly soluble
in cold, and may be boiled in either solvent without under
going decomposition. It loses no weight in the water-bath,
but at a higher temperature it is decomposed, caffein sublimes,
and metallic silver is left.

    The only analogues to this singular compound which I
know are those of urea and nitrate of silver, analysed by Wer
ther*: the formulae of which are—C, H, N, O,--AgO, NO3,
 and C, H, N, O,4-2(AgO, NO.).
    These compounds, however, in consequence of the peculiar
 nature of urea, are not very stable, being decomposed when
 boiled with water into nitrate of ammonia and cyanate of
 silver. There likewise exists a compound of nitrate of silver
 and glycocoll, lately described by Horsfordt, having the for
mula
                        C, H, NO3-AgO, NO; ;
 and, according to H. Rose, a compound of mitrate of silver
 with ammonia, 3 equivs. of this gas being absorbed by 1
 equiv. of the former salt.
                  Chloride of Mercury and Caffein.
    This beautiful compound is obtained when an aqueous or
 alcoholic solution of caffein is added to a solution of chloride
 of mercury; the latter being kept in excess, the fluid remains
 perfectly clear, but after the lapse of a few seconds solidifies
 into a mass of very small crystals, which when recrystallized
 from water or alcohol and washed on a filter, are quite pure.
    When pure and crystallized from water it is very similar in
 appearance to caffein, the crystals not being however quite so
 large. It is very soluble in alcohol and water, hydrochloric,
 nitric, and oxalic acids, and seems to form with the latter a
 crystalline compound. It is nearly insoluble in aether. In
reference to its constitution, it is distinguished from the dou

ble salt of platinum, for in this instance the caffein is in direct
combination with the chloride of mercury, and is exactly
analogous to the corresponding compounds of leucoline and
aniline investigated by Dr. Hofmann+.            The mercurial com
pounds of this kind are generally easily decomposed, but the
compound of chloride of mercury and caffein is so stable, that
it may be boiled in water for a considerable time without un
dergoing the slightest change in its properties. It may be
dried at 100° C. and loses no weight at that temperature.
    I endeavoured to combine the determination of the carbon,
hydrogen and mercury of this substance in one combustion,
and have perfectly succeeded. The operation was conducted
as follows:—The substance was mixed with chromate of lead
and introduced into a combustion-tube of at least 26 inches in
length. About 6 inches of copper turnings are placed above
the mixture, leaving a space of 8 inches from the copper to
the anterior end of the tube. A receptacle for the mercury
is formed out of the tube itself by contracting it about an
inch from the copper turnings, and again so as to leave an
elongated bulb of an inch in length. At the close of the ope
 ration the tube is cut with a file at the posterior contraction.
 In order to separate the water from the mercury, the chloride
 of calcium tube (which has not been detached) is connected
 with an aspirator and air admitted through chloride of cal
 cium, the bulb being kept at a temperature of 100°C.
    I obtained in my analysis the following numbers:–07833
grm. of substance gave 0.5832 grim. of carbonic acid, 0.1639
grm. of water, and 0-3365 grm. of mercury, corresponding to
the following per-centage, which I place in comparison with
the theoretical numbers:—

    This compound is formed when a solution of terchloride of
 gold is added in excess to caffein dissolved in dilute hydro
 chloric acid. If concentrated solutions are employed, the
 whole immediately solidifies into a mass of a most splendid
 lemon-yellow colour; this is to be washed with cold water

and crystallized from alcohol, and finally dried in the water
bath.
    The crystals from an alcoholic solution are in the form of
long needles, of an orange-yellow colour and a very bitter
metallic taste; they are soluble in alcohol and water. When
boiled in water for a short time, the salt is decomposed, a
yellow flocculent matter precipitating, which is insoluble in
alcohol, ether and water, but soluble in hydrochloric acid.
If an aqueous solution is kept on the sand-bath for some
hours at a temperature of about 68°C. it is also decomposed,
and metallic gold separates in shining scales.
    It is not altered when exposed to light, and when dry may
be heated to 100°C. without undergoing decomposition.

   On mixing a hot alcoholic solution of caffein with an alco
holic solution of cyanide of mercury, beautiful needles of a
double salt are deposited upon cooling, which correspond
most likely to the mercury salt I have just described.       A so
lution of caffein in hydrochloric acid gives a beautiful brown
precipitate with chloride of palladium; and the filtered solu
tion deposits another compound in the form of yellow scales,
very similar in appearance to iodide of lead.
   Caffein gives no precipitate with solutions of sulphate of
copper, chloride of tin, acetate of lead, and mitrate of suboxide
of mercury. When boiled with sesquichloride of iron, a red
dish-brown precipitate subsides upon cooling, which is per
fectly soluble in water, and is most likely a double compound
of caffein and sesquichloride of iron.
XXIII. Note in reference to the extension of Euler's Theorem.
  By J. R. YoUNG, Professor of Mathematics in Belfast College.
                       To Richard Taylor, Esq.
      DEAR SIR,
   N the Philosophical Magazine for June last a communica
    tion of mine was published respecting an extension of a
certain theorem of Euler concerning the products of the sums
of squares. At the time that notice was written, I was under
the impression that the theorem admitted of an extent of ge
neralization which a further investigation of the matter proves
to me has not place. I am now prepared to show that the
proposition does not hold beyond the case for eight squares,
the formulae for which I have already printed in the Proceed
ings of the Royal Irish Academy; in the Transactions of
which body it is probable that the entire investigation of the
theorem for eight squares, and the proof that it does not apply
beyond that number, will hereafter appear.
   It may perhaps be interesting to algebraists to find the real
limits to this theorem demonstrably established; and thus to
know—in any attempts that may hereafter be made to extend
Sir W. R. Hamilton's remarkable and very fertile theory of
quaternions—beyond what boundaries such attempts must
prove fruitless.
                          I remain, dear Sir,
                                      Very faithfully yours,
  Belfast, July 16, 1847.                        J. R. YoUNG.

XXIV. On the Precipitate produced in Spring and River Waters
   by Acetate of Lead. By A. Con NELL, Esq., Professor of
   Chemistry in the University of St. Andrews”.
THE white precipitate which         it is well known is usually
      produced in spring and river waters by acetate of lead,
has been commonly attributed to the presence of sulphates,
chlorides and carbonates. The comparatively trifling action
of silver salts, however, shows that it is very rarely, unless in
the case of what are called mineral waters, due to chlorides;
and the ready solubility of the precipitate in acetic acid in
whole or in great part, proves that it is not due to sulphates
or phosphates, except in so far as it may be insoluble in acetic
acid.   Carbonates therefore remain as the probable cause;
and this is established by the circumstance, that although
effervescence cannot be noticed on the immediate addition of
acetic acid, effervescence will be observed if the precipitate is
allowed to subside, and the greater part of the solution de
canted, and an acid then added. I have found on investiga
tion that carbonate of lime is the usual source of the reaction.
The remarkable fact however on this view is, that the reaction
is scarcely diminished by boiling and filtering the water; and
indeed in some instances does not take place unless these steps
are had recourse to, and acetic acid still dissolves the whole
or great part. If the waters referred to are boiled and filtered
and then largely concentrated by evaporation, they usually
deposit carbonate of lime, and do not indicate any such alka
line reaction as shows an alkaline carbonate.     The carbonate
of lime causing the reaction is therefore evidently held dis
solved in the water independently of the presence of free
carbonic acid; and I do not think that chemists, generally
speaking, are aware that common water may still retain enough
of carbonate of lime to give, with acetate of lead, a consider
able precipitate of carbonate of lead, although they may have
been boiled and filtered. If in any such case the precipitate
should be found to dissolve in acetic acid truly without effer
vescence, the probable cause would be the presence of a suffi
cient quantity of some organic matter, such as crenic or apo
crenic acid, which precipitates lead salts; for it is not the least
likely that fluorine, which has been found in some spring
waters, should ever be present in sufficient quantity to affect
lead salts, and fluoride of lead would very likely not be so
luble in acetic acid.
   The question then arises, whence proceeds this carbonate
                   * Communicated by the Author.

On the Precipitate produced in Water by Acetate of Lead. 125
of lime.    To know whether it arises from the water redis
solving carbonate of lime, which had been held dissolved by
carbonic acid and then precipitated by boiling, I transmitted
a current of carbonic acid through lime water till it completely
redissolved the precipitate which had at first formed. I then
boiled the solution for a short time, as in experimenting
with the spring waters, and filtered the liquid; but although
it was slightly precipitated by acetate of lead, the effect was
very much less than that on common water; showing that we
cannot account for the effect on common water by supposing
that all the carbonic acid had not been driven off by the ebul
lition. Again, when distilled water was le<U+017F>t in contact with
marble in impalpable powder for several days, both acetate of
lead and oxalate of ammonia showed less lime than in the
common waters, although rather more than in the lime-water
experiment. I incline therefore to think that the carbonate
of lime owes its origin to double decomposition between an
alkaline carbonate and a lime salt, such as a chloride.                If to
a few ounces of distilled water a drop or two of muriate of
lime and a drop or two of carbonate of soda be added, the
liquid remains quite transparent; and the reaction of common .
water with acetate of lead and acetic acid may be exactly imi
tated with this liquid. And in all the common waters yielding
the reaction, I could detect alkalies in union with acids.
    The common water of the town of St. Andrews, I found,
after being boiled and filtered, to yield by evaporation gr; g;
of carbonate of lime; and other well and river waters may
contain still more. Fresenius has stated that water is capable
of holding in solution Tºrr of carbonate of lime, after being
 saturated with that salt by long-continued boiling, and left
 in contact for four weeks with the deposit formed on cooling.
 Nature of course does not take such pains to charge spring
waters with lime; and I think the method I have suggested
affords a much more simple and probable means of effecting
this end.
    The St. Andrews’ water also contains a trace of carbonate
of magnesia after being boiled and filtered ; and it is probable
that this substance may sometimes be in part the cause of the
reaction referred to, but to a much less extent”.
   * I have given fuller details on this subject, in a paper inserted in the
 Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh for the present year.

XXV. On the Action of a mixture of Red Prussiate of Potash
   and Caustic Alkali upon Colouring Matters. By John
   MERCER, Esq.”
     BOUT ten years since I discovered and used extensively
      in calico-printing the oxidizing properties of a mixture
of red prussiate of potash and caustic alkali. For many
years I have been in the habit of communicating to my friends
several applications of this interesting reaction, among whom
I may mention Mr. Crum of Glasgow and Dr. Lyon Playfair.
Since then Boudault t has directed attention to the oxidizing
power of the same mixture, as far as relates to metallic oxides,
but has not shown any important practical application of the
knowledge thus acquired.
   There are but few processes known in the arts for bleach
ing indigo, the principal of these being that in which chromic
acid liberated from the bichromate of potash by means of an
acid is used. In certain cases this process is attended with
various disadvantages, and the cloth requires to be subjected to
a clearing process to remove the oxide of chromium. The
topical application of a mixture of red prussiate of potash and
an alkali at once effects the same purpose, and in a most com
plete manner, leaving a brilliant white on the spot where the
colour is discharged without rendering any injury to the
fabric. The manner of applying this discharge may be ar
ranged to suit the conditions of the calico-printer. As a class
experiment for a lecture-table it is convenient to impregnate
the indigo-blue calico with a solution of prussiate of potash,
and then dip it into a weak solution of alkali.
   This action is a beautiful illustration of those double affi
nities which we frequently find at play in combinations or
decompositions. Thus, though neither chlorine nor charcoal
can decompose alumina per se, the same gas passed over a
mixture of alumina and charcoal combines with the metallic
radical; the charcoal in this case having aided the combina
tion by withdrawing the oxygen. It is the same kind of
action in the case under consideration. Red prussiate of
potash, Fe, Cyg 3K, differs from the yellow prussiate, Fe,
Cyg 4K, by containing one atom less potassium. When pot
ash is presented to the former, this deficient atom of potas
sium is supplied, but the affinity is not strong enough to
liberate the oxygen. When however a second body having
an attraction for oxygen, such as litharge or indigo, is pre
sented to the potash and red prussiate, this second affinity

   f Journal de Pharmacie. [Phil. Mag., vol. xxvii. p. 307.]

 Dr. W. Gregory on the Preparation of Hippuric Acid. 127
acting in a different direction withdraws the oxygen and
allows the potassium to unite with the compound radical fer
rocyanogen; thus Fe, Cyg 3K + KO + PbO = Fe, Cyå 4K
 + PbO2, the decomposition being of the same kind when an
organic matter is substituted for the oxide capable of further
oxidation. Soda and ammonia may be substituted for potash
in the above decomposition, producing the oxidation or dis
charging the indigo. This is curious in the case of ammonia,
for it cannot be explained by any other than by the ammo
nium theory, and shows the complete analogy between the
oxide of ammonium and the oxide of the simple metallic ra
dicals, potassium and sodium. It is interesting also to ob
serve that the last member in the formula Fe, Cyg 4R, may
be substituted by any alkaline base. Thus, that it may either
be Fe, Cyg 3K K, or Fe, Cyg 3K Na, or Fe, Cyg 3K NH4. This
circumstance points to important theoretical considerations
in the atomic constitution of the prussiates, which would be
foreign to the present paper, the principal object of which is
to furnish a means of discharging indigo, and thus supply
a process much wanted in the art of calico-printing, and which
I have followed for many years with success.
        XXVI. On the Preparation of Hippuric Acid.
                 By WILLIAM GREGo RY, M.D.”
 S|Nº. the discovery of hippuric acid by Liebig, that body
     has at all times attracted much attention. Its composition
and the products of its decomposition, among which were ben
zoic acid and benzamide, rendered it interesting, and various
ingenious views were entertained of its constitution. Its
detection in human urine by Liebig gave it additional im
portance.
   The beautiful discovery of Dessaignes, that hippuric acid,
when heated with strong acids, is resolved into benzoic acid
and glycocoll, has greatly increased the interest already at
tached to hippuric acid, which now affords the best means of
obtaining glycocoll, and has enabled Horsford, in his elabo
 rate researches on that substance, to fix its formula in a very
 satisfactory manner.

   There cannot, I think, be any longer a doubt that C, N HaOs
is the true formula of glycocoll, and Horsford has, in esta
blishing this point, at the same time confirmed and explained
in the most satisfactory manner the observation of Dessaignes.
   The researches of Horsford, however, have also demon
strated that glycocoll is in itself one of the most interesting
compounds known to chemists, and it is evident that the fur
ther study of this most singular body will lead to very va
luable results.
   I have already stated that glycocoll is best obtained from
hippuric acid, but as soon as I began to prepare for this pur
pose a considerable quantity of hippuric acid, I found, as all
 who have done so must have found, that the operation as pre
scribed in books is not only tedious and troublesome, but un
certain.
   The usual process consists in evaporating the urine of the
horse or cow at a moderate temperature to about one-eighth
of its bulk, and adding hydrochloric acid, when on standing
a few hours, crystals of impure hippuric acid are deposited.
 But it is well-known that if the temperature should rise too
high, although still to a point short of boiling, the hippuric
acid will partially or totally disappear, and benzoic acid will
be found in its place. Now when we bear in mind that the
urine contains but little hippuric acid, it is evident that to
obtain this acid in quantity we must operate with a very large
bulk of urine, and those who have done so well know how
tedious the evaporation is, since if we attempt to hasten it
by raising the temperature, we run the risk of losing the
whole; and this indeed frequently happens.
   The impure, highly-coloured acid first obtained has been
purified by different chemists in a great variety of ways.
Some have used chloride of lime; but this method is not
easily managed, and often converts the whole into benzoic acid.
   The last and by far the best method of purification is that
of Schwarz, who boils the impure acid with an excess of milk
of lime, and strains the alkaline liquid from the undissolved
lime. It passes rapidly and clear through calico, and the lime
retains the colouring matter, so that the addition of acid to
the filtered liquid causes the deposition of crystals of hippuric
acid nearly white. Schwarz recommends the addition of
chloride of calcium to the filtered or unfiltered liquid, and the
precipitation of the lime as carbonate by carbonate of potash
or soda, when the precipitated carbonate of lime carries with
it the last traces of colouring matter.   I have not found this
necessary, as a repetition of the process with the milk of lime
never fails to yield colourless crystals.

   As it was clear that the hippuric acid was not in the slight
est degree decomposed by boiling with excess of lime, al
though so easily metamorphosed by acids, I thought that by
applying the same . to the urine directly, I might be
enabled to boil it down, and thus shorten the process, and at
the same time prevent the decomposition of the hippuric acid,
since it would appear that hippurate of lime is not affected
by boiling, nor by excess of lime.
   Accordingly, I took some urine of the horse, mixed it with
excess of milk of lime and boiled for a few minutes.        I then
strained the solution, which was very materially decolorized,
and boiled the clear liquid as rapidly as possible down to the
requisite bulk. On adding hydrochloric acid I obtained a
copious deposit of crystals, which when pressed had a slight
red colour. I then treated them by Schwarz's method and
obtained an abundant crop of almost colourless crystals,
which consisted entirely of the needles of hippuric acid, with
out a visible trace of benzoic acid, the crystallization of which
is easily recognized. A second treatment with milk of lime,
which was hardly needed, and probably would have been
quite unnecessary had a greater excess of lime been used in
the previous one, yielded snow-white crystals of the utmost
beauty and purity.
   The improvement which I have thus introduced in the
preparation of hippuric acid may seem trifling, and is indeed
only the application of Schwarz's method to the urine, in
stead of to the crude acid; but any one who tries to prepare
some ounces, not to say pounds, of hippuric acid, will soon
find that the difference is practically important. By my me
thod it is possible to extract in one day the hippuric acid
from as much urine as would require a week to operate upon
on the usual plan, so that the quantity of hippuric acid which
we can thus obtain is only limited, as it were, by the quan
tity of urine to be procured. The tedious evaporation at low
temperatures is got rid of, and we are sure of obtaining the
whole hippuric acid originally present; whereas, on the for
mer plan, however carefully the evaporation is conducted,
and it requires constant superintendence, it almost always
happens that some of the hippuric acid is decomposed; while
a very slight accidental rise of temperature may destroy the
whole of it, as I have often seen.
   On the whole, I am satisfied that all who wish to study
hippuric acid and glycocoll will find on trial that what was
formerly a disagreeable and troublesome operation is now a
very easy and short one; and that they may now easily ob
tain these remarkable compounds in any desired quantity.

Nov.   *ON        the Structure of the Syllogism, and on the application
  1846.         of the Theory of Probabilities to Questions of Argument
and Authority*. By Professor De Morgan.
   The object of this paper is twofold: first, to establish two distinct
theories of the syllogism, both differing materially from that of Ari
stotle, and each furnishing a general canon for the detection of all its
legitimate forms of inference; secondly, to investigate the mode in
which the distinctive character of the two great sources of convic
tion, argument and authority, affects the application of the notion of
probability to questions not admitting of absolute demonstration.
   The two theories of the syllogism arise out of simple notions con
nected with the forms of propositions and their quantities. The dif
ference between a positive and negative assertion is not essential,
but depends on the manner in which objects of thought are described
by language. If Y and y be names so connected that each contains
everything which is not in the other, and the two have nothing in
common (a relation which is described by calling them contrary
   * Upon this paper a controversy has arisen, which, ". to the present
time, may be summed up as follows:–April 30. Mr. De Morgan published
a statement in answer to an assertion of Sir W. Hamilton of Edinburgh, to
the effect that the second, or quantitative, system of syllogism, was a wilful
plagiarism from certain letters which Sir W. Hamilton had written to Mr.
De Morgan. May 22. Sir W. Hamilton replied at length in another
pamphlet, retracting the assertion of wilful plagiarism, but maintaining that
the system was taken, unconsciously, from those letters. This was followed
by a letter from Mr. De Morgan in the Athenaeum of May 29, and another
from Sir W. Hamilton in the same publication for June 5. The point at
issue now seems to be as follows:—Mr. De Morgan challenges Sir W. Ha
milton to show anything in his second system which was not substantially
contained in a digressive section of the description of his first system, ad
mitted to have been sent to Cambridge before any communication had
taken place. Sir W. Hamilton, in reply, contends that the digression above
mentioned contains nothing to the purpose. Mr. De Morgan defers further
i.
 OQ10.
       until he publishes a work which he states himself to be preparing on
  #. the Athenaeum of June 19, appeared a letter from Mr. James Broun,
asserting certain mistakes on the part both of Sir W. Hamilton and Mr.
De Morgan, and giving certain extensions to the quantitative forms of the
latter. Again, June 26, appeared in the same publication a letter from
Mr. De Morgan, dated June 19, stating that he also had arrived at Mr.
Broun's forms, giving reasons for their rejection in favour of certain simpler
forms, giving the heads of an extended system of quantitative syllogism,
and asserting that he had materially extended both his systems. So the
matter stands. The subject of the structure of the syllogism seems to be
likely to excite some attention; and, without pronouncing any opinion on
the personal claims or conflicts of the several parties, we recommend the
attention of our readers to this rather neglected branch of pure science.—

names), the propositions ‘Every X is Y’ and ‘no X is y’ are sim
ply identical. In the same manner, the particular and universal
proposition are only accidentally distinct. If in ‘some Xs are Ys’
the Xs there specified had had a name belonging to them only, say
Z, then the preceding proposition would have been identical in mean
ing with “every Z is Y.”
   From the above it is made to follow, that every legitimate syllo
gism can be reduced to one of universal affirmative premises, either
by introduction of contrary terms, or invention of subgeneric names.
    In considering the nature of the simple proposition, Mr. De Mor
gan uses a notation proposed by himself.       Thus—
                 Every X is Y is denoted by X)Y A
                 No X is Y          - -    . .  X.Y    E
                 Some Xs are Ys . .        -     XY    I
                 Some Xs are not Ys        ..   X:Y    O
and names which are contraries are denoted by large and small let
ters. Aristotle having excluded the contrary of a name from formal
logic, and having thereby reduced the forms of proposition to four,
these forms (universal affirmative, universal negative, particular affir
mative, particular negative) the writers on logic in the middle ages
represented by the letters A, E, I, O. Thus X)Y and Y)K are
equally represented by A. When contraries are expressly intro
 duced, all the forms of assertion or denial which can obtain between
 two terms and their contraries, are eight in number; and the most
convenient mode of representing them is as follows:–Let the letters
 A, E, I, O have the above meaning, but only when the order of sub
ject and predicate is XY.        Then let a, e, i, o stand for the same
 propositions, after w and y, the contraries, are written for X and Y.
The complete system then is-                               -
                    A=X)Y               a=w)!/=Y)x
                    O=X:Y               o-r:y=Y:X
                    E=X.Y               e=a.y
                    I=XY                i-ry
 and every form in which subject and predicate are in any manner
 chosen out of the four X, Y, w, y, so that one shall be either X or r,
 and the other either Y or y, is reducible to one or other of the pre
 ceding.
    The propositions e and i, which are thus newly introduced, are
 only expressible as follows, with reference to X and Y.
     (i.) There are things which are neither X nor Y.
     (e.) There is nothing but is either X or Y or both.
    The connexion of these eight forms is fully considered, and the
 various syllogisms to which they lead. Rejecting every form of syl
 logism in which as strong a conclusion can be deduced from a weaker
 premise; rejecting, for instance,
                             Y)X+Y)Z=XZ                     -
  because XZ equally follows from Y)x+YZ, in which YZ is weaker
  than Y)Z—all the forms of inference are reduced to three sets.
     1. A set of two, called single because the interchange of the terms
                                      K 2                        -

132               Cambridge Philosophical Society.
of the conclusion does not alter the syllogism.        Neither of these
forms are in the Aristotelian list.    One of them is
                            X)Y+Z)Y=wz;
or if every X be a Y, and also every Z, then there are things which are
neither X nor Z; namely, all which are not Ys.
   2. A set of six, in which the interchange produces really different
syllogisms of the same form, and in which both premises and con
clusion can be expressed in terms of three names, without the con
trary of either. This set includes the whole Aristotelian list, except
those in which a weaker premise will give as strong a conclusion, or
the one in which the same premises will give a stronger conclusion.
   3. A set of six resembling the last in everything but this, that no
one of them is expressible without the new forms e and i ; that is,
requiring three names and the contraries of one or more of them.
   Those of the third set are not reducible to Aristotelian syllogisms,
as long as the eight standard forms of assertion are adhered to.
   The second theory of the syllogism has its principles laid down in
the memoir before us; but those principles are only applied to the
evolution of the cases which are not admitted into the Aristotelian
system. The formal statement of the manner in which the ordinary
cases of syllogism are connected with those peculiar to this second
system is contained in an Addition.
   In providing that premises shall certainly furnish a conclusion,
the common system requires that one at least of the premises shall
speak universally of the middle term; that is, shall make its asser
tion or denial of every object of thought which is named by the middle
term.    Mr. De Morgan points out that this is not necessary: m
being the fraction of all the cases of the middle term mentioned in one
premise, and n in the other, all that is necessary is that m + n should
be greater than unity. In such case, the real middle term, being
the collection of all the cases by comparison of which with other
things inference arises, is the fraction m + n—l of all the possible
cases of the middle term. Thus, from the premises “most Ys are
Xs’ and “most Ys are Zs,’ it can be inferred that some Xs are Zs,
since m and n are both greater than one-half. The assignment of
definite quantity to the middle term in both premises, gives a canon
of inference, of which the Aristotelian rule is only a particular case.
   In the addition above alluded to, this same canon, namely ‘that
more Ys in number than there exist separate Ys shall be spoken of
in both premises together,’ is made to take the following form:—If
in an affirmation or negation, in ‘As are Bs" and ‘As are not Bs,’
definite numerical quantity be given to both subject and predicate, if
it be stated how many As are spoken of and how many Bs—the
number of effective cases of the middle term is seen to be the num
ber of subjects in an affirmative proposition, whether the middle term
be subject or predicate. Hence, defining the effective number of a
premise to be the number of subjects if the proposition be affirmative,
and the number of cases of the middle term if it be negative, all
that is necessary for inference (over and above the usual condition

                  Cambridge Philosophical Society.                  133
that both premises must not be negative) is that the sum of the
 effective numbers of the two premises shall exceed the number of
 existing cases of the middle term; and the excess (being the fraction
 denoted by m+n-1 in the Memoir) gives the number of cases in
 which inference can be made.
    To attempt to combine these two systems of form and of quantity
is rendered useless by language not possessing the forms of mixed
assertion and denial, which the syllogisms deduced from the combi
nation would require. As far as the combination can, in Mr. De
Morgan's opinion, be made, nothing is required but a distinct con
ception of, and nomenclature for, the usual modes of expressing a
logical form, and implying one or the other of the alternations which
the mere expression leaves unsettled. Mr. De Morgan proposes the
following language.
    Two names are identical when each contains all that the other
contains: but when all the first (and more) is contained in the second,
then the first is called a subidentical of the second, and the second
a superidentical of the first. Two names are contrary when every
thing (or everything intended to be spoken of) is in one or the other
and nothing in both. But when the two names have nothing in
common, and do not between them contain everything, they are
called subcontraries of one another. And again, if everything be in
one or the other, and some things in both, they are called supercon
traries of one another. Lastly, if the two names have each some
thing in common and something not in common, and moreover do
not between them contain everything, each is called a complete par
ticular of the other. A table is then given, which contains every
form of complex syllogism.
   If X and Z be the terms of the conclusion, and both be described
in terms of Y, the middle term : it can be seen from this table what
can be affirmed and what denied, of X with respect to Z.        For in
stance, if X be supercontrary of Y, and Z subcontrary, then X must
be a superidentical of Z: but if X and Z be both subidenticals of Y,
nothing can be affirmed; only it may be denied that X is either
contrary or supercontrary of Z.
   The remaining part of this paper relates to the application of the
theory of probabilities above-mentioned. Mr. De Morgan asserts
that no conclusion of a definite amount of probability can be formed
from argument alone; but that all the results of argument must be
modified by the testimony to the conclusion which exists in the mind,
whether derived from the authority of others, or from the previous
state of the mind itself.     The foundation of this assertion is the
circumstance that the insufficiency of the argument is no index of
the falsehood of the conclusion. Various cases are examined; but
it must here be sufficient to cite one or two results.
    If u be the probability which the mind attaches to a certain con
clusion, a the probability that a certain argument is valid, and b the
probability that a certain argument for the contradiction is valid :
then the probability of the truth of the conclusion is
                                 (1–b)p.
                        (1–b)u-H (1—a)(1-p)"

134               Cambridge Philosophical Society.
   If b-0, or if there be no argument against, and if the mind be
unbiassed, or if p=   #.  this becomes
                          1
                        2—a or a +
                                       (1—a)*
                                        2—a
   For this writers on logic generally substitute a, confounding the
absolute truth of the conclusion with the validity of the argument,
and neglecting the possible case of the argument being invalid, and
yet the conclusion true.
   Nov. 23.—On a New Notation for expressing various Conditions
and Equations in Geometry, Mechanics and Astronomy. By the
Rev. M. O’Brien.
   If A, P, P be any three points in space, whether in the same
straight line or not, and if the lines AP and AP' be represented in
magnitude and direction by the symbols u and u', then, according to
principles now well-known and universally admitted, the line PP' is
represented in magnitude and direction by the symbol u'—u. Now
if AP and AP' be equal in magnitude, and make an indefinitely small
angle with each other, PP' is an indefinitely small line at right angles
to AP, and u'—u becomes du.          Hence it follows, that, if u be the
symbol of a line of invariable magnitude, du is the symbol of an in
definitely small line at right angles to it; and therefore, if X be any
arbitrary coefficient, Adu is the general expression for a right line
perpendicular to u.
   The sign Ad therefore indicates perpendicularity, when put before
the symbol of a line of invariable length. The object of the author
is to develope this idea, and to show that it not only leads to a
simple method of expressing perpendicularity, but also furnishes a
notation of considerable use in expressing various conditions and
equations in geometry, mechanics, astronomy, and other sciences
involving the consideration of direction and magnitude.
   The author first reduces the sign \d to a more convenient form,
which not only secures the condition that u is invariable in length,
but also defines the magnitude and direction of the perpendicular
which Adu denotes. This he does in the following manner. He
aSSumes
                            u=a&-Hy3+2),
(where a 3 y represent three lines, each a unit in length, drawn at
right angles to each other, and a y z are any arbitrary numerical
coefficients,) and supposes that the differentiation denoted by d affects
a 3 y, but not a y z. This secures the condition that u is invariable
in length, and leads to the following expression for Adu, viz.
              Adu=(zy'—z'y)2+(wz'—w'z)3+(ya'—y'a)),
a' y' z' being arbitrary coefficients.
   Assuming u'-a'a.--y'3+2'y, it appears from this expression for
 Adu, that dua 0 when u-u', and therefore that d denotes a differen
tial taken on the supposition that u' is constant.
   On this account the author substitutes the symbol D, in place of
Ad; he then shows that the operation D, is distributive with respect
to u' (i. e. that Dw ºw-D,--Dw), and to indicate this he elevates

                  Cambridge Philosophical Society.                  135
the subscript index u', and writes Du'.u instead of Du<U+017F>u. Thus he
obtains the expression
            Du'.u=(zy'—z'y)2+(wz'—w'z)[3+(ya'—y'w)).
   From this it follows that Du'.u is a line perpendicular both to u!
and u, and that the numerical magnitude of Du'.u is rr'sin 0, where
r and r" are the numerical magnitudes of u and u', and 0 the angle
made by u and u'.
   Having investigated the principal properties of the operation Du'.,
the author, by a similar method, obtains another notation, Au'.u,
which represents the expression wr' +yy'+zz', or rr'cos 0. He then
gives some instances of the application of these two notations to
mechanics, which may be briefly stated as follows:—
   1st. If U, U", U", &c. be the symbols” of any forces acting upon
a rigid body, and u, u', u", &c. the symbolst of their respective points
of application, then the six equations of equilibrium are included in
the two equations
                        XU=0 and XDu.U-0.
   2nd. That these two equations are the necessary and sufficient
conditions of equilibrium, may be proved very simply from first prin
ciples by the use of the notation Du.
   3rd. The theory of couples is included in the equation XDu.U=0.
In fact the symbol Du.U expresses, in magnitude and direction, the
axis of the couple by which the force U is transferred from its point
of application U to the origin.
   4th. Supposing that the forces U, U", U", &c. do not balance each
other, and putting XU=V, XDu.U=W, we may show immediately,
by the use of the notation Au, that the condition of there being a
single resultant is
                                AV.W =0;
and when there is not a single resultant, the axis of the couple of
minimum moment is                 -
                               AW.W

            # =w,--wºº,        #  =ws-wº,       #  =wly-wºº.
    The symbol w represents in direction the axis of instantaneous
rotation, and in magnitude the angular velocity about that axis.

                  # {Awa-i-Bw30+Cwy}=>Du.Uöm,
which includes Euler's three equations of motion about a fixed point.
    8th. If the forces U, U", U", &c. arise from the attraction of a
 distant body, the symbol of whose position is u', this equation may
be further reduced to the form

  G. Stokes, M.A., Fellow of Pembroke College, Cambridge.
     In a former paper the author had given the mathematical calcula
 tion of an instance of fluid motion, which seemed to offer an accurate
 means of comparing theory and observation in a class of motions, in
 which, so far as the author is aware, they had not been hitherto com
 pared. The instance referred to is that in which a vessel or box of
  the form of a rectangular parallelepiped is filled with fluid, closed,
  and made to perform small oscillations. It appears from theory that
  the effect of the inertia of the fluid is the same as that of a solid
  having the same mass, centre of gravity and principal axes, as the
  solidified fluid, but different principal moments of inertia.  In this
  supplement the author gave a series for the calculation of the prin
  cipal moments, which is more rapidly convergent than one which he
  had previously given. It is remarkable that these series, though
  numerically equal, appear under very different forms, the nth term of

the latter containing exponentials of the forms s” and a F, while
the nth term of the former contains exponentials of the second form
only. In conclusion, the author referred to some experiments which
he had performed with a box, such as that described, filled with
water, employing the method of bifilar oscillations. The moment of
inertia of the fluid about an axis passing through its centre of gra
vity (i. e. the moment of inertia of the imaginary solid which may
be substituted for the fluid), was a little greater as determined by
experiment than as determined by theory, as might have been ex
pected, since the friction of the fluid was not considered in the cal
culation. The difference between theory and experiment varied in
different cases from the T'ath to the #st part of the whole quantity.
   Dec. 7.—On the Principle of Continuity in reference to certain
results of Analysis. By Professor Young of Belfast College.
   The object of this paper is to inquire into the influence of the law
of continuity, as it affects the extreme or ultimate values of variable
functions, more especially those involving infinite series and definite
integrals.                              -
   The author considers that this influence has hitherto been impro
perly overlooked; and that to this circumstance is to be attributed
the errors and perplexities with which the different theories of those
functions are found to be embarrassed. He shows that every parti
cular case of a general analytical form—even the ultimate or limiting
case—must come under the control of the law implied in that form;
this law being equally efficient throughout the entire range of indi
vidual values. Except in the limiting cases, the law in question is
palpably impressed on the several particular forms; but at the limits
it has been suffered to escape recognition, because indications of its
presence have not been actually preserved in the notation.
    It is in this way that the series 1–1 + 1–1 + &c. has been con
founded with the limits of the series 1 —a 4-a:2—a:3+ &c.; these
limits being arrived at by the continuous variation of a from some
inferior value up to a = 1, and from some superior value down to
ac= 1. It is shown however that the series 1–1 + &c. has no equi
valent among the individual cases of 1–a7+ æº- &c., with which
latter, indeed, it has no connexion whatever.
    By properly distinguishing between the real limits, and what is
 generally confounded with them, the author arrives at several con
 clusions respecting the limiting values of infinite series directly op
 posed to those of Cauchy, Poisson, and others. And to prevent a
 recurrence of errors arising from a neglect of the distinction here
 noticed, he proposes to call such an isolated series as 1–1 + 1–&c.
 independent or neutral; and the extreme cases of 1–a +a;"—&c.,
 dependent series: the difference between a dependent and a neutral
 series becomes sufficiently marked, as respects notation, by introdu
 cing into the former what the author calls the symbol of continuity,
 which indeed is no other than the factor, whose ascending powers
 Poisson introduces—and, as here shown, unwarrantably—into the
 successive terms of strictly neutral series; thus bringing such series

under the control of a law to which in reality they owe no obedi
ence.                                                            -
   An error somewhat analogous to this is shown to be committed
in the treatment of certain definite integrals, which are here submit
ted to examination and correction, and some disputed and hitherto
unsettled points in their theory fully considered. The author is thus
led to what he considers an interesting fact in analysis; viz. that the
differentials of certain forms require indeterminate corrections, in a
manner similar to that by which determinate corrections are intro
duced into integrals; and he attributes to the neglect of these the
many erroneous summations assigned to certain trigonometrical
series. This is illustrated by a reference to the processes of Poisson.
   The paper concludes with some observations on what has been
called discontinuity; a term which the author thinks is sometimes
injudiciously employed in analysis, and prefers to treat discontinuous
functions as implying distinct continuities; and by considering these
in accordance with the principles established in the former part of
the paper, he arrives at results for definite integrals of the form

   March 1, 1847.-On the Theory of Oscillatory Waves. By G.
G. Stokes, M.A., Fellow of Pembroke College.                       -
   The waves which form the subject of this paper are characterized
by the property of being propagated with a constant velocity, and
without degradation, or change of form of any kind. The principal
object of the paper is to investigate the form of these waves, and
their velocity of propagation, to a second approximation; the height
of the waves being supposed small, but finite. It is shown that the
elevated and depressed portions of the fluid are not similar, as is the
case to a first approximation; but the hollows are broad and shallow,
the elevations comparatively narrow and high. The velocity of pro
pagation is the same as to a first approximation, and is therefore
independent of the height of the waves. It is remarkable that the for
ward motion of the particles near the surface is not exactly compen
sated by their backward motion, as is the case to a first approxima
tion; so that the fluid near the surface, in addition to its motion of
oscillation, is flowing with a small velocity in the direction in which
the waves are propagated; and this velocity admits of expression in
terms of the length and height of the waves. The knowledge of
this circumstance may be of some use in leading to a more correct
estimate of the allowance to be made for leeway in the case of a ship
at sea. The author has proceeded to a third approximation in the
case in which the depth of the fluid is very great, and finds that the
velocity of propagation is increased by a small quantity, which bears
to the whole a ratio depending on the square of the ratio of the
height of the waves to their length.              -

                  Cambridge Philosophical Society.                  139
   In the concluding part of the paper is given the velocity of pro
pagation of a series of waves propagated along the common surface
of two fluids, of which the upper is bounded by a horizontal rigid
plane. There is also given the velocity of propagation of the above
series, as well as that of the series propagated along the upper sur
face of the upper fluid, in the case in which the upper surface is free.
In these investigations the squares of small quantities are omitted.
   March 15.—Contributions towards a System of Symbolical Geo
metry and Mechanics. By the Rev. M. O'Brien.
   The distinction which has been made by an eminent authority in
mathematics between arithmetical and symbolical algebra, may be
extended to most of the sciences which call in the aid of algebra.
Thus we may distinguish between symbolical geometry and arithme
tical geometry, symbolical mechanics and arithmetical mechanics. This
distinction does not imply that in one division numbers only are
used, and in the other symbols, for symbols are equally used in both ;
but it relates to the degree of generality of the symbolization.      In
the arithmetical science, the symbols have a purely numerical signi-.
fication; but in the symbolical they represent, not only abstract
quantity, but also all the circumstances which, as it is expressed,
affect quantity. The arithmetical science is in fact the first step of
generalization, the symbolical is the complete generalization.
   In this view of the case, the author has entitled his paper Contri
butions towards a System of Symbolical Geometry and Mechanics.
The proposed geometrical system consists, first, in representing
curves and surfaces, not by equations, as in the Cartesian method,
but by single symbols; and secondly, in using the differential notation
proposed in a former paper* to denote perpendicularity, and to ex
press various equations and conditions. The proposed mechanical
system is analogous in many respects. Examples of it have already
been given in the paper just quoted.
   The author uses the term direction unit to denote a line of a unity
of length drawn in any particular direction; and he employs the
symbols a 3 y to denote any three direction units at right angles to
each other.
   He defines the position of any point P in space by the symbol re
presenting the line OP (O being the origin) in magnitude and direc.
tion. If w y z be the numerical values of the coordinates of P, and
a 3 y the direction units of the coordinate axes, the expression
                             a.o. +y|3+2).
represents the line OP in magnitude and direction, and therefore
defines the position of P. This expression he calls the symbol of the
point P.
   If r be the numerical magnitude, and a the direction unit of OP,
we have                            -
                           rs=w& +y|3+ 2y:
ra is therefore another form for the symbol of the point P.

   The following is the method by which the author represents curves
and surfaces.
   If the symbol of a point involves an arbitrary quantity, or, as it is
called, a variable parameter, the position of the point becomes inde
terminate, but so far restricted that it will be always found on some
line or curve. Hence the symbol of a point becomes the symbol of
a line or curve when it involves a variable parameter.
   In like manner, when the symbol of a point involves two variable
parameters, it becomes the symbol of a surface.
   The parameters here spoken of are supposed to be numerical
quantities. An arbitrary direction unit is clearly equivalent to two
such parameters; and therefore, when the symbol of a point involves
an arbitrary direction unit, it becomes the symbol of a surface.
   The following are examples of this method:—
   1. If u be the symbol of any particular point of a right line whose
direction unit is s, then the symbol of that right line is
                                 u-H re,
r being arbitrary.
   2. If u be the symbol of the centre of a sphere, and r its radius,
the symbol of the surface of a sphere is
                                w-H ra,
a being an arbitrary direction unit.
   3. If u be the symbol of any particular point of a plane, a and s'
the direction units of any two lines in the plane, the symbol of the
plane is

r and r" being arbitrary.
   4. If a be the direction unit and r the numerical magnitude of the
perpendicular from the origin on a plane, the symbol of the plane is
                                re-HDv.a,
v being an arbitrary line symbol, i. e. denoting in magnitude and
direction any arbitrary line.
   5. If u and u' be the symbols of two points, the symbol of the
right line drawn through them is
                              u-H m(u'—u),
m being arbitrary.
   6. If u be the symbol of any curve in space, the symbol of the
tangent at the point u is

    It is curious that this equation is immediately integrable, the in
tegral being the two equations

    The latter equation is the symbolical equation of a conic section,
 the origin being focus, h c and s being the arbitrary constants intro
duced by integration.
    3. The application of this method to the case of a planet acted on
by a disturbing force is worthy of particular notice, as it expresses
 the variations of the elements of the orbit with great facility, in the
 following manner:—
    If U be the symbol of the disturbing force, we have
                           d(hy)                                        -

    These two equations determine with great facility all the elements
 of the orbit. For y is a direction unit perpendicular to the plane
 of the orbit (i. e. it is the symbol of the pole of the orbit), and there
 fore it defines completely the position of the plane of the orbit. Also
 e is a direction unit in the plane of the orbit at right angles to the
 axis major, and therefore it determines the position of the axis major;
 in fact the direction unit of the axis major is D'y.s. The letters h
 and e have their usual signification.
     To find h and y separately from (1.), suppose that we obtain by
 integration of (1.)

   April 9, 1847–On an important error in Bouvard's Tables of
Saturn. By Mr. Adams.
   Having lately entered upon a comparison of the theory of Saturn
with the Greenwich observations, I was immediately struck with the
magnitude of the tabular errors in heliocentric latitude, and the more
so, since the whole perturbation in latitude is so small, that it could
not be imagined that these errors arose from any imperfection in the
theory. In order to examine the nature of the errors, I treated them
by the method of curves, taking the times of observation as abscissae,
and the corresponding tabular errors as ordinates. After elimina
ting, by a graphical process, the effects of a change in the node and
inclination, a well-defined inequality became apparent, the period of
which was nearly twice that of Saturn. One of the principal terms
of the perturbation in latitude (viz. that depending on the mean lon
gitude of Jupiter minus twice that of Saturn) having nearly the same
period, I was next led to examine whether this term had been cor
rectly tabulated by Bouvard. The formula in the introduction ap
peared to be accurate; but on inspecting the Table XLII., which
professes to be constructed by means of this formula, I was surprised
to find that there was not the smallest correspondence between the
numbers given by the formula and those contained in the table, the
latter following the simple progression of sines, while the formula
contained two terms. The origin of this mistake is rather curious.
Bouvard's formula for the terms in question is
    9".67 sin (p-2p'—60°29} +28". 19 sin{2p–4p'+66°12};
but in tabulating the last term he appears to have taken the simple
argument p-2p' instead of 2?–4?', so that the two parts may be
united into a single term,
                    25'-85 sin (0–20'+43°88},
which I find very closely to represent Bouvard's Table XLII.
   After correcting the above error, and making a proper alteration
in the inclinations and place of the node, the remaining errors of
latitude are in general very small. I subjoin a correct table to be
used instead of Bouvard's. The constant added being 36"-0 instead
of 26"-0, it will be necessary to subtract 10"-0 from the final result.

   On the Development of the Disturbing Function R.                      By Sir John
Lubbock.
   The greatest practical difficulty which is encountered in the pla
netary theory consists in the development of the expression for the
reciprocal of the linear distance between the disturbed and disturbing
planets. The algebraical expression of this development may be
obtained either by means of the binomial theorem or by Taylor's
theorem applied to several variables; by the latter method M. Binet
has carried the development as far as terms of the 7th order. But
when high powers of the eccentricities and inclinations are retained,
the expressions become excessively complicated, so that further pro
gress in this direction appears utterly hopeless.
   The numerical coefficients of the series may also be obtained by
quadratures; but to determine all the coefficients in this way would
involve very great labour.                                                            -
    In considering the problem of the perturbations of bodies whose
eccentricities and inclinations are considerable, the author has been
led to another mode of development, which he conceives to possess
great advantages over those just mentioned, and the use of which
may be greatly facilitated in all cases by special tables, which may
be prepared beforehand.

                      Royal Astronomical Society.                    145
    The principle of this method consists in expressing the square of
the ratio of the distance between the two planets to the radius vector
of the more distant planet, under the form of P—Q, in which P is the
product of any convenient number of factors of the form 1 + A cos 2,
and all the terms in Q have small coefficients.        Then  (P–Q) Tº
may be developed by the binomial theorem in a series of ascending
powers of Q, which consequently converges rapidly, and the values of
the   quantities P-3, P-3, &c., which enter into the successive terms
of this series, may be found by multiplying together the developments
of the several factors (1 + A cos 2) T3, (1+A cos a)-3, &c.      If then
tables were prepared, giving for different values of A the coefficients
of the development of these quantities in cosines of multiples of 2,
all the operations requisite for the development of the disturbing
function might be performed with great facility.
   The author remarks, in conclusion, that instead of developing, as
is usually done, in powers of the ratio of the mean distances      (#)

   I take the liberty to send you two positions of the comet discovered
here Feb. 6, obtained yesterday in full daylight, and about five hours
before the perihelion passage. The visibility of a comet in the day
time, and within 2° distance from the sun, is a phaenomenon of so
rare occurrence, that it may in some measure interest you if I give
very briefly the particulars of our observations.
    I had determined, by theory, that the intensity of light on March
30 ought to be 100 times stronger than that of a star of fourth mag
nitude, and was induced to make preparations for a daylight obser
vation.     I first saw the comet about 11 A.M. When the sky was
 perfectly cloudless about the sun, it had a whitish appearance, which
 rendered it a matter of no little difficulty to see the comet ; but
 during the passage of some cumuli clouds over the sun, and between
 the breaks, I obtained some excellent views of the comet, and several
 observations, which will no doubt be of great assistance in the accu
 rate determination of the elements.    The nucleus was nearly, if not
 perfectly, round, beautifully defined and planetary, the diameter 8||
 or 10". Two faint branches of light formed a divided tail, extend
 ing about 40" from the head, like two longish erect ears or horns
 rising from each side of the disc. At times I felt certain that the
 nucleus twinkled.     The tail resembled a thin smoke.
    With respect to the observations for position, I can only add that
 they were as good as could possibly be made, under the circum
    * The comet was seen at noon near the sun by two other observers, at
 Truro and in the Isle of Anglesey.

 In the observations for the first position the centre of the field was
 estimated, and nine single results are tolerably accordant. The
 second place depends on one good observation with cross wires,
 clouds preventing any further comparisons.
    Had the sky been free from the whiteness which is so fatal to
 vision by daylight, I should have obtained much better places.

 the comet with extreme care, but I do not know at present whether
 he saw it yesterday in daylight.

ON A NEW TEST FOR PRUSSIC ACID, AND ON A SIMPLE METHOD
    OF PRE PARING THE SULPHOCYANIDE              OF AMMONIUM.        BY
    PIROF. LIEBIG,
 W HEN some sulphuret          of ammonium and caustic ammonia are
        added to a concentrated aqueous solution of prussic acid, and
the mixture heated with the addition of pure flowers of sulphur, the
prussic acid is converted in a few minutes into sulphocyanide of am
monium.      This metamorphosis depends on the circumstance, that
the higher sulphurets of ammonium are instantly deprived by the
cyanide of ammonium of the excess of sulphur they contain above
the monosulphuret; for instance, if a mixture of prussic acid and
ammonia be added to the pentasulphuret of ammonium, the solution
of which is of a deep yellow colour, and the whole gently heated,
the sulphuret of ammonium is soon decolorized; and when the clear
colourless liquid is evaporated, and the admixture of sulphuret of
ammonium expelled, a white saline mass is obtained, which dissolves
entirely in alcohol. The solution yields, on cooling or evaporation,
colourless crystals of pure sulphocyanide of ammonium. Only a
small quantity of sulphuret of ammonium is requisite to convert, in
the presence of an excess of sulphur, unlimited quantities of cyanide
of ammonium into sulphocyanide; because the sulphuret of ammo
nium, when reduced to the state of monosulphuret, constantly reac
quires its power of dissolving sulphur and transferring it to the
cyanide of ammonium. The following proportions will be found to
be advantageous:–2 oz. of solution of caustic ammonia of 0-95
spec. grav. are saturated with sulphuretted hydrogen gas; the
hydrosulphate of ammonia thus obtained is mixed with 6 oz.
of the same solution of ammonia, and to this mixture 2 oz. of
flowers of sulphur are added; and then the product resulting from
the distillation of 6 oz. prussiate of potash, 3 oz. of the hydrate of
sulphuric acid, and 18 oz. water. This mixture is digested in the

 water-bath until the sulphur is seen to be no longer altered and the
 liquid has assumed a yellow colour; it is then heated to boiling, and
 kept at this temperature until the sulphuret of ammonium has been
 expelled and the liquid has again become colourless. The deposited,
 or excess of, sulphur is now removed by filtration, and the liquid
 evaporated to crystallization. In this way from 3% to 3}, oz. of daz
 zling white dry sulphocyanide of ammonium are obtained, which may
 be employed as a reagent, and for the same purposes as the sulpho
 cyanide of potassium. Of the 2 oz. of sulphur added, } an oz. is
left undissolved.
    The behaviour of the higher sulphurets of ammonium towards
prussic acid furnishes an admirable test for this acid. A couple of
drops of a prussic acid, which has been diluted with so much water
that it no longer gives any certain reaction with salts of iron by the
 formation of prussian blue, when mixed with a drop of sulphuret of
ammonium and heated upon a watch-glass until the mixture is be
come colourless, yields a liquid containing sulphocyanide of ammo
 nium, which produces with persalts of iron a very deep blood-red
colour, and with persalts of copper, in the presence of sulphurous
acid, a perceptible white precipitate of the sulphocyanide of copper.

  ON THE FUSION OF IRIDIUM AND RHODIUM.                BY R, HARE,
   This communication respects mainly my success in fusing both
iridium and rhodium, neither of which, in a state of purity, had been
previously fused. It may be supposed that the globule of iridium,
obtained by Children's colossal battery, forms an exception; but
the low specific gravity and porosity of that globule may justify a
belief that it was not pure, and at any rate the means employed were
of a nature not to be at command for the repetition of the process,
so that iridium might as well be infusible, as to be fusible only by
such a battery.
   The first specimen of the last-mentioned metal on which I ope
rated was one given me by Mr. Booth, a former pupil of Wöhler,
whom he had assisted in obtaining it by the excellent process de
vised by that distinguished chemist. This specimen was fused in
the presence of Mr. Booth. Subsequently I procured specimens,
warranted pure, severally from the house of Pelletier at Paris, and
from Messrs. Johnson and Cock, London.         Another specimen was
given to me by a friend, who had received it as pure, from a source on
which reliance may be placed ; and lastly, I obtained myself, by
Wöhler's process, a specimen of about sixty grains, from the inso
luble residue of platinum ore. All the specimens thus procured
were found to be fusible under my hydro-oxygen blowpipe. The
specimen obtained from Messrs. Johnson and Cock, after repeated
fusions, by which it was much consolidated, weighed sixty-seven
grains. During fusion there appeared to be an escape of volatile
matter, supposed to be osmic acid, arising from the presence of a
minute portion of osmium, between which and iridium an affinity of

a peculiar degree of energy exists. At a certain point of the process
a reaction took place sufficiently explosive to throw a portion of the
metal, in globules, off from the support. One of these, about twice
as large as the head of a common brass pin, proved to be hollow.
By prolonged and repeated fusion the metal became more compact
and more fusible.
   Fused iridium has nearly the grain of soft cast steel, with the pale
whiteness of antimony, and appears to be susceptible of a fine polish.
Although as hard as untempered steel, it is somewhat sectile, since,
when split by means of a cold chisel, the edge penetrated about the
eighth of an inch before a division was effected. By light ham
mering a corner was flattened without fracture, although under
heavier blows the mass cracked. I infer that although nearly un
malleable and very hard, iridium may be wrought in the lathe.
   I have already mentioned that I fused into a globule a specimen
of iridium obtained by me from the insoluble residuum of platinum
ore by Wöhler's process. From this globule, while congealing, a
portion ran out from the inside, leaving a cavity and covering one
of its sides externally with an incrustation, among which crystalline
spangles, or facets, were discernible. The specific gravity of the
globule of iridium, from the specimen furnished by Messrs. John
son and Cock, was taken by Mr. T. R. Eckfelt of the United States
mint at Philadelphia, and by Dr. Boyé, both having balances of the
greatest accuracy, and being very skilful in the employment of
them. In the first instance there was a perfect coincidence in the
results obtained, 21.83 being the numbers found by both of these
gentlemen. Agreeably to another trial made by Dr. Boyé, using
river-water instead of distilled, the number was 21-78, water being
in either case about sixty-eight, with allowance for the difference of
the water, and the temperature being above the standard of 60°.
The specific gravity of the specimen may then be estimated at 21:80.
   The specific gravity of fused platinum, purified according to the
instructions of Berzelius, before subjection to the hammer, proved
in one specimen to be not more than 1970, although by hammering
it became equal to 21:23. It is with fused platinum that fused
iridium should be compared. Of course the specific gravity of the
last-mentioned metal, when both are obtained by fusion, may be
assumed to be one-tenth greater than that of the former. Moreover,
as this metal is the only impurity existing in the standard platinum
of London, of Paris, or of St. Petersburg, it follows that a high
specific gravity is not to be viewed as a proof of purity. Accord
ingly a specimen of platinum, purified from iridium by the Ber
zelian process, and which had proved eminently susceptible of being
beaten into leaf, was found only to be of the gravity of 21:16, while
that of a specimen of standard Russian platinum, very brilliantly
white but inferior in malleability, presented to me by his Excellency
Count Cancrine, as a specimen of the purest platinum of the Russian
mint, was 21°31.
   Of rhodium I have fused two specimens, one of five pennyweights,
purchased of Messrs. Johnson and Cock, the other received through

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                149
the same channel as the specimen of iridium above-mentioned”.
Rhodium is at least as fusible as iridium, both of the specimens
alluded to having been converted into fluid globules. That pro
cured from Messrs. Johnson and Cock gave a globule weighing
ninety grains. On a second fusion it formed a perfect globule as
fluid as mercury; and yet in congealing lost its brilliancy by be
coming studded with crystalline facets all over its surface, excepting
the portion in contact with the support. The facets had the ap
pearance of incipient spangles. The rapidity with which they were
formed seemed anomalous.            The mass being split by a cold
chisel and viewed by a microscope, it appeared porous immediately
beneath the facets. When the mass was first fused, I found by the
gravimeter the specific gravity to be 1 1-0, which coincides with the
observations of Wollaston. Yet by a careful trial made at the United
States mint by Mr. Eckfelt, after the second fusion and the forma
tion of the facet, the specific gravity proved to be only 10.8. This
is sufficiently explained by the porosity above mentioned. In fact
the porosity to which rhodium and iridium are liable may render it
difficult to find specimens of precisely the same specific gravity.
    In sectility, malleability and hardness, rhodium did not appear to
differ much from iridium, but it is not of so pale a white as iridium.
The one has the pale white of antimony, the other the ruddy hue of
bismuth.
    Osmiuret of iridium, as existing in the native spangles associated
with platina ore, or as otherwise obtained, is far more difficult of
fusion than pure iridium. The propensity to assume the crystalline
form, and to adhere to it, is even greater in this alloy than in the
last-mentioned metal. On first exposure to the most intense heat
of the hydro-oxygen blowpipe some slight appearances of fusion
may be seen, and the spangles or grains may be made to cohere.
Nevertheless it yields very slowly, and requires an expenditure of
gas too great to be incurred unless it were for the purpose of once
well determining the question of its ultimate fusibility. This ob
ject was obtained completely as respects a globule of 45 grains in
weight. The specific gravity of this globule appeared to be 20-4,
but this result was evidently less than that which would have been
obtained had there not been some minute cavities, which, after
splitting the globule, were detected by a magnifier.
    The specific gravity of some large spangles of osmiuret of iridium
from South American ore was, by Dr. Boyé, found to be 191835.
That of some grains heavier but not so flat, presented to me by
Count Cancrine, was found to be 20'938.
    That the alloy of iridium with osmium should be more difficult to
fuse than pure iridium, leads to the inference that osmium must be
the most infusible of the metals, although, like carbon, very sus
ceptible of combustion, and capable, like that infusible non-metallic
radical, of forming a volatile peroxide. Of course its liability to
oxidizement would render it impossible to fuse it by the hydro

glass tube with sal-ammoniac, agreeably to the instructions given by
Berzelius. In this way a result was obtained which the information
given by that distinguished chemist had not led me to anticipate.
The tube became coated with a ring of osmium, which it would be
impossible by inspection merely to distinguish from the arsenical
ring on the peculiar features of which reliance has been placed for
the detection of arsenic.
   It follows from my experiments and observations, that of all
metallic bodies, osmiuret of iridium is the most difficult to fuse;
that rhodium and iridium are both fusible by the hydro-oxygen blow
pipe, properly employed; that the former has the rosy whiteness of
bismuth, the latter the pale white of antimony; and that both of
them are slightly sectile, though extremely hard and nearly un
malleable; that iridium merely fused is heavier than platinum con
densed by the hammer. Thus it follows from my experiments, and
from the recent observations of Breithaupt, on some specimens of
native iridium, that the metal, whether in this state or pure as ob
tained by chemical skill and consolidated by fusion, must be allowed
that pre-eminence in density, which, until of late, was given to
platinum.
   It may be proper to add, that subsequently to the writing of the
preceding narrative, receiving some large quantities of iridium and
rhodium from Messrs. Johnson and Cock, my experiments were
successfully repeated on a larger scale, but without any result be
sides that of confirming the facts above stated.—Silliman's Journal
for Nov. 1846, p. 365.
NOTE ON THE MEANS OF TESTING THE COMPARATIVE VALUE
   OF ASTRINGENT SUBSTANCES FOR THE PURPOSES OF TAN
   NING.    By Robert war INGTON, Esq.
   Having been frequently called upon to examine the value of
astringent substances imported into this country for the purposes of
tanning, such as valonia, divi-divi, Sumac, cutch, &c., I am induced
to believe that the detail of the manipulation adopted may not be
without interest to some of the members of the Society. As the
manufacture of leather was the object of the purchaser of these
materials, gelatin was selected as the basis for the estimation of
their comparative value ; and after several trials with various kinds of
natural and manufactured gelatin, such as varieties of isinglass, glue,
patent gelatin, &c., the finest long staple isinglass was found to be
the most constant in its quality and least liable to undergo change.

    With this therefore the test solution was prepared, of such a
 strength, that each division, by measure in the ordinary alkalimeter
 tube, should be equivalent to the one-tenth or one-fourth of a grain
 of pure tannin, and thus the number of divisions used would indicate
 the proportion of available tannin or substance precipitable by ge
 latin contained in any specimen. A given weight of the sample
 under trial was then infused in water, or if necessary the astringent
matter extracted by boiling, and the clear liquid precipitated by
 the test solution until no further deposit occurred.
   It was necessary in the course of this operation to test at intervals
a portion of the solution under examination, to ascertain the pro
gress of the trial; and this, from the nature of the precipitate, was
attended at first with some little difficulty: paper filters were inad
missible from the quantity of the solution they would absorb, and
thus introduce a source of extensive error; subsidence rendered the
operation very tedious. The plan I have adopted is as follows:—a
piece of glass tubing, about twelve inches in length and about half
an inch internal diameter, is selected, and this has a small piece of
wet sponge loosely introduced into its lower extremity, and when
it is wished to abstract a part of the fluid under investigation for a
separate testing, this is immersed a few seconds in the partially pre
cipitated solution; the clear liquid then filters by ascent through the
sponge into the tube, and is to be decanted from its other extremity
into a test glass; if on adding a drop of the gelatin solution to
this a fresh precipitate is caused, the whole is returned to the ori
ginal bulk, and the process proceeded in, and so on until the opera
tion is perfected; this method of operating is facilitated by conduct
ing the examination in a deep glass. After a few trials the mani
pulation will be found extremely easy, and in this way considerable
accuracy may be arrived at.—From the Proceedings of the Chemical
Society.
 on THE Two variETIES of ARSENIous AcID.                By M. BUSSY.
   The author first gives a new process for determining the quantity
of arsenious acid.   This process is based on the employment of stand
ard reagents. The reagent which he uses is permanganate of pot
ash, which M. Marguerite has already successfully employed for the
quantitative determination of iron.
   When a solution of permanganate of potash is poured into a solu
tion of arsenious acid, it becomes arsenic acid, and the red colour of
the reagent disappears. The liquor begins to become coloured only
when the transformation of arsenious acid is complete. When, then,
a standard solution of permanganate of potash is prepared, the quan
tity of arsenious acid contained in any solution may be determined
by that of the permanganate required to convert it into arsenic acid.
   M. Bussy states that the two varieties of arsenious acid, the vi
treous and opake, absorb the same quantity of permanganate, and
consequently that the differences observed in their solubility is not
derived from any difference of oxidizement.
   With respect to the solubility of the two varieties of arsenious

152           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
acid, M. Bussy has arrived at the following conclusions:—1st. The
vitreous, so far from being less soluble in water than the opake acid,
as stated by chemists, is, on the contrary, much more soluble. This
difference is nearly in the proportion of 3 to 1, at about 53° to 55°
of F.; the same quantity of water which dissolves 36 to 38 parts of
the vitreous acid, will take up only 12 to 14 of the opake. 2nd.
The vitreous acid dissolves much more rapidly than the opake acid.
3rd. Neither of the varieties possesses a degree of solubility which
is to be regarded as strictly peculiar to it. 4th. The opake acid
is converted into vitreous acid by long boiling in water; that is to
say, it then acquires the same degree of solubility as the vitreous
arsenious acid, which is such that 11 parts are dissolved by 100 of
water. 5th. Under the influence of water and a low temperature,
the vitreous acid is converted into opake acid; that is to say, a solu
tion of vitreous acid becomes reduced after a certain time to the
point of saturation which belongs to the opake acid. 6th. The mix
ture of the two varieties of acid in the same solution explains the
anomalies observed in the solubility of arsenious acid, which in fact
offers nothing opposed to the principles admitted by chemists. 7th.
Division, which facilitates the solution of the opake acid, without
however increasing its solubility, considerably diminishes that of the
vitreous acid; and to such an extent, that this acid, reduced to fine
powder and levigated, is not sensibly more soluble in water than
the opake acid; this resulting unquestionably from a transformation
which it undergoes, either at the moment of pulverization, or of its
contact with water. 8th. Acid which has been rendered opake by
the action of ammonia, and acid crystallized in water, act similarly
with water, and appear to belong to the same variety. 9th. The opake
acid dissolves more slowly than the vitreous in dilute hydrochloric
acid.   This circumstance, which thus modifies the nature of the
products formed during solution, explains why the luminous phaeno
mena observed by M. Rose in the crystallization of the vitreous acid,
are not in general observable with so great intensity in the solution
of the opake variety. J0th. The difference which has been observed
in the action of the two arsenious acids on tincture of litmus is
merely apparent. If the opake acid does not redden the tincture, it
is on account of its slight solubility, and especially because it dis
solves slowly; whilst the vitreous acid, which dissolves quickly,
immediately reddens the tincture. But if comparative experiments
be made, and the tincture be exposed to the action of the powder,
it becomes gradually red, and no difference is perceptible at the ex
piration of three or four days.-Comptes Rendus, Mai 1847.
             ON THE PREPARATION OF GUN-COTTON.
   Mr. Coathupe recently forwarded to the Chemical Society two
specimens of gun-cotton, with a view to illustrate the greatly in
creased explosive effects that are to be derived from a subsequent
immersion of the gun-cotton, when properly prepared in the ordi
nary way, in a saturated solution of chlorate of potash.

   “Having experimented with solutions of nitrate of ammonia, ni
trate of potash, nitrate of soda, bichromate of potash, &c. &c., for
the purpose of increasing the explosive properties of this interesting
substance, I can affirm that none of the results will bear the slight
est comparison with those obtained from the solution of chlorate of
potash, either in rapidity of ignition or in intensity of flame. The
process adopted for preparing the inclosed specimens was as follows:
viz. into a mixture of equal measures of strong nitrous acid and of
oil of vitriol, spec. grav. 1845, the cotton was immersed and stirred
with a glass rod during about three minutes: it was then well
washed in many waters and dried; a portion of it was then soaked
for a few minutes in a saturated solution of chlorate of potash, well
squeezed and dried.”                                   ~
ON BALSAM OF ToI.U, AND SOME PRodUCTS DERIVED FROM IT.
   M. E. Kopp states that the experiments which he has made on
this substance confirm the greater number of the results previously
obtained. He remarks that the balsam is composed of a very small
quantity of tolene C10H16, C–75 H=6:25; of free cinnamic acid,
C18H16O4; of a resin very soluble in alcohol, C86 Hss Os; of a resin
slightly soluble in alcohol, C18H20 O3, or C96 Hºo Olo.
   Tolen.—This carburetted hydrogen was prepared by exactly fol
lowing the plan proposed by M. Deville. It is colourless, very fluid,
of a penetrating taste somewhat like pepper, and its smell resembles
that of elemi. Its density at 60°F. is 0.858; its boiling-point is
between 310° and 320°F. Exposed in an imperfectly closed tube,
it gradually becomes resinous and very slightly coloured. M. De
ville gives as its formula C*H*. M. Kopp states that his analysis,
which differs but little from that of M. Deville, indicates C10H16.
    Cinnamic Acid.—The free acid of balsam of Tolu, as observed by
 M. Fremy, is merely cinnamic acid. This fact was proved by ana
lysis, and by its conversion into nitrocinnamic acid, very slightly
 soluble in cold alcohol; whereas benzoic and nitrobenzoic acids are
 very soluble in it. The results obtained by M. Deville are probably
 derived from his having examined the acids procured by the distilla
 tion of the balsam, or extracted by concentrated alkaline solutions.
    M. Kopp has shown that, under these two circumstances, the resins
 of balsam of Tolu are so changed as to give rise to a large proportion
 of benzoic acid. The resins, cautiously distilled with caustic soda, yield
 pure benzoen, and a coaly residue which contains much benzoate of
 soda.    Cinnamic acid, mixed with cold concentrated caustic soda,
 and submitted to a current of chlorine, is converted into chlorocin
 namic acid C1s (H14 Cl3)O4. If however the temperature be raised
 and the action is very strong, the chlorinated oil described by Mr.
 Stenhouse is disengaged, and chlorobenzoic acid, C14 (H10Cl2) O4, is
 formed.
    These two acids strongly resemble each other; but the latter is
 more soluble in water and in alcohol, and its salts crystallize more
 readily. Cinnamic acid, treated with concentrated mitric acid, is at

  154           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
  first converted into nitrocinnamic acid, then into benzoic acid, and
  finally into nitrobenzoic acid.
     Cinnamic and benzoic aethers are both, though with great diffi
  culty, converted into nitrocinnamic acid and nitrobenzoic aether.
  There is almost always a great part of the aether decomposed, and
  the acids are set free.
     Nitrobenzoic aether is solid, colourless, and of an aromatic odour
  and taste. It crystallizes in fine rhombic laminae. Its melting-point
 is 116°, and its boiling-point 564°. It is easily obtained by exposing
  an alcoholic solution of nitrobenzoic acid to a current of hydrochloric
  acid gas. Its formula is C14 (H8N2O4) O3 + C4H10O-C18H18 Nº Os.
     Nitrocinnamic acid dissolved in an alcoholic solution of sulphuret
  of ammonia is reduced with the assistance of a gentle heat. Sulphur
 is deposited, and two distinct substances are formed, one of which is
 of a yellowish colour and belongs to the class of resins, and the other
 to that of alkaloids. The latter is solid, colourless, crystallizes in
 small indistinct masses, insoluble in water, soluble in alcohol and
 in aether, and forms difficultly crystallizable salts.
     Resin a, C86 H3S OS. This substance is brown, translucent, brittle
 when cold; its powder agglomerates at 59°F. and fuses perfectly at
 140°F.      Concentrated sulphuric acid imparts a purple colour to it.
 When dissolved in potash and exposed to the air, it is readily oxi
 dized, and is converted into resin 3.     By dry distillation it yields
 benzoen and benzoic acid.      It dissolves readily in alcohol and in
 aether.
    Resin 3, C18H2008, Colour dull brownish-yellow, without taste or
 smell, slightly fusible (above 212°F.), but little soluble in alcohol
or aether. It is less alterable than the preceding resin. Sulphuric
acid renders it of a violet colour; potash dissolves it with a brown
colour.
    The mixture of the two resins treated with nitric acid yields, as
gaseous products, carbonic acid, nitrous vapours and nitric oxide;
as volatile products, hydruret of benzule, hydrocyanic acid, and a
little benzoic acid; as residue, a flocculent yellowish substance,
which is benzoic acid intimately combined with a yellow colouring
matter of a resinous nature, which destroys its crystallizing power,
and accompanies it in all its combinations, even in that of aether.
By the action of heat, especially by distillation, the resinous matter
is destroyed, and perfectly pure benzoic acid is obtained.     The resin
yields nearly one-third of its weight of benzoic acid.
    As to the constitution of balsam of Tolu, it seems very simple.
Primarily it is formed of the soft resinous matter C96 H38 OB, or of
that which gives rise to it. This resin, under the influence of the
air, is converted into cinnamic acid and resin 3: C96 H38+O2=Cls
H'6 O4-H C18H20 O3 + H2O.          In fact it is observed that in time
balsam of Tolu becomes hard, and contains a larger quantity of cin
namic acid. The resin C18H30 O* may itself easily furnish benzoic
acid for C18H20 O5=Cl*H* O. --H2O+ C4H4.                The carburetted
hydrogen perhaps gives rise to tolene; but it is more probable that
it is converted by the action of oxidizing bodies into resinous colour

on THE EQUIVALENT of TITANIUM.                            By M. Isidor E PIERRE.
   The author remarks that chemists generally agree that it would
be difficult to add to the precision of the numbers which represent
the equivalents of hydrogen, carbon, chlorine, bromine, iodine, phos
phorus, arsenic and silicon, as determined by the researches of Du
mas, Marignac and Pelouze.
   M. Pierre thinks however that this is not the case with titanium;
and that if the labours of different periods respecting this substance
be examined, it will be evident that its equivalent requires renewed
examination.
   M. H. Rose originally obtained, by various methods, numbers
which varied between 380 and 450; but he afterwards found that
the sulphuret of titanium which he employed in his experiments,
was procured free from titanic acid with great difficulty.
   In his last experiments, M. Rose made use of chloride of titanium,
which he decomposed by water. He precipitated with ammonia the
titanic acid derived from this decomposition, and afterwards treated
the filtered liquor with nitrate of silver, in order to separate the
chlorine in the state of chloride of silver; this method gave him
303.686 as the equivalent of titanium.
   The chloride of titanium used by M. Pierre was not prepared from
rutil, but from calcined artificial oxide of titanium: it was free from
oxide of iron and from chloride of silicium, and its boiling-point was
perfectly stationary. The chloride employed had been kept in a small
tube from the time of its preparation hermetically sealed: it was
broken by agitation in a stopped bottle, one quarter filled with distilled
water. By frequent agitation, without unstopping the bottle, the
whitish cloud at first produced above the liquid disappears. Without
this precaution there would be a probable loss of hydrochloric acid
in opening the bottle too soon, or by introducing the solution of
silver, which would expel a small quantity of this vapour.
   The following results were obtained:—                                gr.

   Equivalent of titanium 309:38.
   The three first numbers agree perfectly, but the two latter are
notably less, especially the last, since it differs from the three first
by five whole numbers, or more than 1% per cent. It was difficult
to attribute this difference entirely to deficient precision in the me
thod used. It occurred to the author that it might be owing to the
partial decomposition of the chloride of titanium, by the moisture of
the air during manipulation, and this was soon found to be the case
by direct experiment.
   M. Pierre proposes to adopt, as the nearest approximation to truth,
314-69, the mean of the three first experiments, as the equivalent
number for titanium.
   This number is very different from 355 deduced from 6:536, the
density of the vapour of the chloride of titanium observed by M.
Dumas. Its density, calculated from 314'69, would be 6'614.—

ON A MODIFICATION OF THE APPARATUS OF WARRENTRAPP AND
   WILL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF NITROGEN.                              BY WARREN DE
   LA RUE.
   My attention having been called to a communication by Mr. Alex.
Kemp in the number of the ‘Chemical Gazette’ for the 1st of April
1847, in which he describes a modification of Messrs. Warrentrapp
and Will's tube for nitrogen determinations, of a very similar con
struction to one I employed as far back as November 1845 in the
laboratory of the Royal College of Chemistry, and which I have re
peatedly shown to my friends, I am induced to lay before the So
ciety a description of my form of apparatus, which differs somewhat
from that described by Mr. Kemp.
   By the drawing, it will be seen that the tube B E, instead of
opening immediately into the bottom of the flattened bulb C, is pro
longed and rises for some distance into the bulb curving over to
wards its side; in this respect Mr. Kemp's apparatus does not differ
materially from mine. I found it necessary however to have a third
bulb (D) blown (which is best of a spheroidal form), in order to ef
fectually prevent the acid from being drawn into the tube G when
ever a sudden absorption took place; this third bulb communicates
with C by a narrow neck.          If the apparatus be constructed without

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.             157
the third bulb D, a portion of fluid generally passes into the tube G.
from the rotary motion induced in the fluid in C.
   The dotted lines indicate the height of fluid in the bulbs, and this
quantity is quite sufficient for the condensation of all the ammonia
likely to be formed. I would remark, that if during the progress of
the combustion a cessation of the production of gas should occur,
the construction of the apparatus is such as to prevent the whole of
the acid ever being carried over into the bulb C, so that on the evo
lution again commencing no fear need be entertained for the com
plete condensation of the ammonia.
   It only remains for me to add, that though this new form of ap
paratus is not so readily rinsed out as the original one of Messrs.
Warrentrapp and Will, no great inconvenience is experienced from
that cause, as the acid can, at the close of the operation, be easily
caused to flow into the bulb C and out at the tube G., by properly
inclining the bulbs, &c., and when this is done water or alcohol may
be introduced by a pipette through the limb H.

  ON THE DETECTION OF COTTON IN LINEN.               By G. C. KINDT.
  This subject has frequently engaged the attention of commercial and
scientific men; many experiments have been made in order to detect
cotton thread in linen; many processes have been recommended, but
none have hitherto proved satisfactory. I was therefore much sur
prised when a stranger, a few weeks ago, showed me a sample of
linen from the one-half of which all the cotton filaments had been
eaten away. He had obtained it in Hamburg, and asked me whether
I could give him a process for effecting this purpose. Now since,
as far as I am aware, nothing has been published on this subject,
 and it is of very general interest, I consider it a duty to communi
 cate the results of my experiments. I had already observed, in ex
 perimenting with explosive cotton, flax, &c., that these two sub
stances behave somewhat differently towards concentrated acids;
 and although it has long been known that strong sulphuric acid con

  158           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
 verts all vegetable fibre into gum, and when the action is continued
  for a longer period, into sugar, I found that cotton was metamor
  phosed much more rapidly by the sulphuric acid than flax. It is
 therefore by means of concentrated sulphuric acid that cotton may
  be removed from linen when mixed with it; and this object may be
  obtained by the following process:–
     The sample to be examined must be freed as perfectly as possible
 from all dressing by repeated washing with hot rain- or river-water,
 boiling for some length of time, and subsequent rinsing in the same
 water; and I may expressly observe, that its entire removal is
 requisite for the experiment to succeed. When it has been well
 dried, the sample is dipped for about half its length into common
 oil of vitriol, and kept there for about half a minute to two minutes,
 according to the strength of the tissue. The immersed portion is
 seen to become transparent.       It is now placed in water, which dis
 solves out the gummy mass produced from the cotton; this solution
 may be expedited by a gentle rubbing with the fingers; but since
 it is not easy to remove the whole of the acid by repeated washing
 in fresh water, it is advisable to immerse the sample for a few in
 stants in spirits of hartshorn (purified potash or soda have just the
 same effect), and then to wash it again with water. After it has
 been freed from the greater portion of the moisture by gentle press
 ure between blotting-paper, it is dried. If it contained cotton, the
 cotton threads are found to be wanting in that portion which had
 been immersed in the acid; and by counting the threads of the two
 portions of the sample, its quantity may be very readily estimated.
    If the sample has been allowed to remain too long in sulphuric
 acid, the linen threads likewise become brittle, or even eaten away;
 if it were not left a sufficient time in it, only a portion of the cotton
 threads have been removed ; to make this sample useful, it must be
 washed, dried, and the immersion in the acid repeated. When the
tissue under examination consists of pure linen, the portion im
 mersed in the acid likewise becomes transparent, but more slowly
and in a uniform manner, whereas in the mixed textures the cotton
threads are already perfectly transparent, while the linen threads
still continue white and opake.        The sulphuric acid acts upon the
flax threads of pure linen, and the sample is even somewhat trans
parent after drying as far as the acid acted upon it, but all the
threads in the sample can be seen in their whole course.
    Cotton stuffs containing no linen dissolve quickly and entirely in
the acid; or if left but one instant in it, become so brittle and
gummy that no one will fail to recognise it as cotton when treated
in the above manner.—Liebig's Annalen, Feb. 1847.

 XXIX. On certain Products of Decomposition of the Fired
     Oils in contact with Sulphur. By THoMAS ANDERson, Esq.,
     M.D., F.R.S.E., Lecturer on Chemistry, Edinburgh *.
      UMEROUS researches have established as a general rule
       that the products of the decomposition of organic sub
 stances vary with the circumstances of the experiment, and the
 nature of the agents under the influence of which it is performed.
 If, for instance, we examine the action of heat alone, we find it
 causing a set of decompositions specially characterized by the
 evolution of carbonic acid, formed by the union of part of the
 carbon of the substance with the whole or part of its oxygen;
 and this action is rendered more definite, and the number of
the products circumscribed by all circumstances facilitating
the formation of carbonic acid, such as the presence of a base,
which will even cause its evolution when heat alone is inca
pable of producing decomposition. Acids, on the other hand,
have a precisely opposite effect; they, in some instances, alto
gether prevent the formation of carbonic acid, and cause the
oxygen to exert its action on the hydrogen of the compound,
and to eliminate one or more atoms of water which do not
generally exist ready formed in it.
    In these particular instances, decomposition takes place at
the expense of the constituent atoms of the compounds them
selves, the extraneous substances serving merely as disponents
to the oxidation; in the one case of part of their carbon, in
the other of their hydrogen. But there is another class of
agents, which, besides eliminating one or more substances, are
capable at the same time of entering into union with the resi
dual atoms, and forming a new derivative of the original com
pound. The best investigated of this class of agents are chlo

rine, bromine, nitric acid and ammonia; the three former of
which exert their action on the hydrogen, the latter on the
oxygen of the substance, and form compounds, the complete
investigation of which is important, not merely in a purely
chemical point of view, but also from the light which they
seem likely to throw on the general question of the atomistic
constitution of matter.        In fact, the great object of the re
searches of organic chemistry at the present moment is that
of developing the relations which the individual atoms bear
to the molecules of their compound, by a knowledge of which
we hope eventually to arrive at some definite conclusions with
regard to the mode in which the elementary atoms are grouped
together in a complex molecule. Almost all the scanty in
formation which we possess on this subject has been derived
from investigating the products of the action of different agents
upon organic substances; and it is sufficiently obvious, that
the more varied the circumstances, and numerous the points
of view under which these reactions can be examined, so much
the more likely are we to arrive at definite results.
   It was the consideration of these points which led me to
undertake an investigation into the nature of the action of
sulphur in the free state upon organic compounds, a subject
hitherto totally uninvestigated, unless we except the curious
researches of Zeise" on the simultaneous action of ammonia and
sulphur upon acetone, which yields a variety of remarkable
products, the properties of which he has described, without
however determining their constitution. The results at which
I have already arrived in these researches are contained in
the following pages. They are, however, to be considered
only as the commencement of the investigation; and I am
desirous of submitting them to the Society even in their present
very imperfect state, as it is impossible to fix a period within
which a series of researches, surrounded by so many difficul
ties, can be completed. No one who has not been specially
occupied with such experiments can have any conception of
the numerous sources of annoyance which they present, and
of the expenditure of time and labour which is necessary for
their performance. Indeed, I have more than once felt in
clined altogether to abandon a subject occupying so much
time in proportion to the results obtained, and the completion
of which is further protracted by the nauseous odour of the
compounds, which is so disgusting that it is impossible to
pursue the investigation for any length of time continuously.
 . At the commencement of these researches I endeavoured to
examine the action of sulphur upon some of the simpler
   * Forhandlingar vid de Skandinaviska Naturforskarnes tredje méte, p. 303.

            of the Fired Oils in contact with Sulphur.        163
organic compounds, in the hope of arriving at results of cor
responding simplicity. My expectations, however, were dis
appointed, and I was obliged to have recourse to the fixed
oils, on which sulphur has been long known to exert an action;
the product obtained by heating together olive oil and sulphur
until a uniform balsam-like substance was formed, having
been employed in medicine by the older physicians under the
name of the balsam of sulphur.
   The phaenomena which manifest themselves during the
mutual action of sulphur and a fixed oil are these:—At the
first application of heat, the sulphur melts and forms a stratum
at the bottom of the oil; but as the temperature rises it slowly
dissolves, with the formation of a thick viscid fluid of a dark
red colour. As the heat approaches that at which the oil
undergoes decomposition when heated alone, a violent action
takes place attended by the evolution of sulphuretted hydrogen
in such abundance, that the viscid mass swells up and occupies
a space many times its original bulk. If at this point the
mixture be allowed to cool, it concretes into a tough sticky
tenacious mass, adhering strongly to the fingers, and having
a disagreeable sulphureous odour; if however the heat be
sustained, the frothing and evolution of sulphuretted hydrogen
continue, and at the same time an oil of a peculiar disgusting
odour, resembling that of garlic, but more disagreeable, passes
into the receiver.           -
    In the investigation of the products of this action, the first
and most essential step was to determine the particular con
stituents of the oil from which they are derived. In order to
do this, it was necessary to examine separately the action of
sulphur upon each of its components. I commenced therefore
by making use of stearic acid, which can be readily obtained
in a pure state: experiment however showed that none of the
peculiar products were derived from it; for when mixed with
half its weight of sulphur and distilled, mere traces of sulphu
retted hydrogen were evolved, and the products were identical
 with those obtained from the unmixed acid.       The nauseous
 smelling oils being then obviously derived either from the
 oleic acid, or the glycerine of the oil, I prepared a quantity
 of pure oleic acid, by the decomposition of the aethereal solu
 tion of the oleate of lead.    This, when mixed with half its
 weight of sulphur, and distilled in a capacious retort, under
 went decomposition precisely as the crude fixed oil did; sul
 phuretted hydrogen was developed in great abundance, and
 the product of the distillation could not be distinguished from
 that which I had previously obtained. I was unable to obtain
 glycerine in sufficient quantity to make a separate investiga

164 Dr. T. Anderson on certain Products of Decomposition
tion of the products of its decomposition; but these must also
be peculiar, as I could not distinguish the presence of acroleine
during any period of the distillation of an oil with sulphur.
   The product of the distillation of oleic acid was in the form
of a reddish-brown oil, having an extremely nauseous odour,
in which that of sulphuretted hydrogen was apparent. When
rectified, this sulphuretted hydrogen was driven off, and the
first portions which distilled were perfectly transparent and
colourless. As the process continued, however, the products
became gradually darker in colour, and the last portions which
distilled became semisolid on standing, from the deposition of
a quantity of white crystalline plates. These were separated
by filtration through cloth, expressed strongly, and purified
by successive crystallizations from alcohol, until they were
entirely free from smell and colour. The product was then
in the form of white pearly scales, which possessed acid pro
perties, and were totally insoluble in water; they were not
therefore sebacic acid, no trace of which could be discovered
among the products, but, on the contrary, possessed all the
properties of margaric acid. These crystals were obtained
from quantities of oleic acid, prepared at different times, and
with the greatest possible care, and must have been formed
during the decomposition. In order however to set this point
at rest, some of the same oleic acid was distilled alone, when
abundance of sebacic acid was obtained, and the latter portions
of the rectified product did not deposit any crystals on cooling,
but remained perfectly fluid. As this solid acid is produced
only in comparatively small quantity, and I was unable to
obtain enough of oleic acid, I made use, in preparing it on the
large scale, of pure almond oil, which, according to Schübler
and Gasserow, is entirely free of margarine. The oil which
I employed was expressed specially for these experiments, at
a temperature slightly above 32°; and in order to satisfy
myself of the absence of margaric acid in the products of its
ordinary decomposition, a quantity was distilled alone, and
the product rectified. The latter portions being collected
apart did not deposit margaric acid; and this I have also
found to be the case with the ordinary almond oil of com
merce, in the expression of which a moderate degree of heat
is employed.
   In distilling the oil and sulphur on the large scale, it be
came impossible to perform the process by the simple admix
ture of the substances, the frothing being so great as inevitably
to expel the materials from the retort. After a trial of various
methods, I found it most convenient to employ the apparatus,
of which this is a sketch. The oil was introduced into a large

            of the Fired Oils in contact with Sulphur.         1.65
glass balloon, to the mouth of which two tubes were adapted,
one descending to near the middle, and furnished with a cork
at the upper end, the other which constituted the neck of the
distilling apparatus passed into a tubulated receiver, kept cold
by immersion in water or ice. To the tubulature, a doubly
bent tube was affixed, which descended into a vessel of alcohol,
for the purpose of retaining any of the more volatile portions
which might be carried over by the rapid current of sulphu
retted hydrogen. The heat must be applied by means of an
open charcoal fire; and the furnace should be so constructed
that the fire may be rapidly withdrawn in the event of the
action becoming too violent. It is very desirable too that the
balloon should go down into the furnace, so that it may be
entirely surrounded by hot air. The oil is introduced into
the balloon, of which it must not occupy more than a fifth, or
a fourth at most, along with a few small pieces of sulphur, and
 heat is gradually applied. So soon as effervescence com
 mences, the cork of the small tube is withdrawn, and a small
 piece of sulphur is introduced; and this is continued gradually,
 so as to keep up a uniform action.        A dark reddish-brown
oil passes into the receiver, and at the same time sulphuretted
hydrogen passes in torrents through the alcohol; it there
 deposits a certain quantity of oil, and on escaping, may be
kept burning during the whole operation, with a flame eight
 or nine inches high. The principal difficulty of this process
 consists in regulating the heat, so as to keep up a steady action.
 If the heat be allowed to fall, the contents of the balloon be
come so viscid as inevitably to boil over; and at the same time
too high a temperature causes the whole action to go on with

166 Dr. T. Anderson on certain Products of Decomposition
excessive violence. I have generally operated on quantities
of three pounds, each of which requires a complete day for
its distillation, during which time the operator must never
leave it, but constantly attend to the regulation of the heat,
and the gradual addition of sulphur in small quantities. When
a quantity equal to about half the oil employed has distilled
over, the remaining mass becomes excessively viscid; and just
at this point the balloon frequently cracks, the contents escape,
and the whole catches fire, and blazes off with a bright yel
low flame and smell of sulphurous acid.
   The product of this distillation, which exactly resembled
that of the pure oleic acid, was rectified, and the crystals which
deposited from the latter portions were expressed and purified
by successive crystallizations in alcohol. They then presented
all the characters of margaric acid, and gave the following
results of analysis : —

Which gives the following results per cent.:-

These results agree completely with the formula for margaric
acid, and were further confirmed by the analysis of its silver
salt and aether.

   7-926 grains of the silver salt gave 2.284 of silver =28-70
per cent.
   The calculated result for margarate of silver gives 28-65
per cent.
   The aether was prepared in the usual manner, by dissolving
the acid in absolute alcohol, and passing dry hydrochloric
acid gas through the solution. The product, which possessed
all the properties of margaric aether, gave the following re

     These analyses establish, in a satisfactory manner, that the
 acid produced was margaric acid. It is scarcely possible how
 ever, in the present state of the investigation, to give anything
 like a rational explanation of the mode in which it is here
 formed.     Its production from oleic acid has been already
 observed by Laurent as the first product of oxidation by nitric
 acid; but the action of sulphur is certainly of a very different
 character, and cannot be considered as bearing any analogy
 to that of an oxidizing agent. The quantity of margaric acid
 produced does not appear to be constant, but varies with the
 rapidity of the distillation, and is always most abundant when
 it is slowly performed.             *
     The oil which distils previous to and along with the mar
 garic acid, and constitutes by far the most abundant product
 of the action of sulphur upon oleic acid and oil of almonds, is
a very complex substance, and contains some of its constituents
in very small proportion. On this account I found it neces
 sary to prepare it in very large        º         and in doing so I
abandoned the use of almond oil and employed linseed oil
instead, which is a much cheaper substance, and yields the
same fluid products. When the product of the action of sul
phur is carefully rectified, the first portions which pass over
are perfectly transparent and colourless, highly limpid and
mobile, and boil at the temperature of 160°Fahr. Only a
small quantity however passes at this temperature, and the
immersed thermometer gradually rises without indicating any
fixed boiling-point for the fluid. My first attempts to purify
this oil and separate it into its various constituents, did not
afford any satisfactory conclusions. Numerous analyses of
the more volatile portions were made without obtaining com
parable results, although all indicated the presence of carbon
and hydrogen nearly in the proportion of equal atoms. The
following are the details of three of these analyses:—

  Which correspond to the following results per cent. :—

     All these oils, when treated with fuming nitric acid, yielded
  an abundant precipitate of the sulphate of barytes; but as the
  results of the combustion were not constant, no quantitative
  determination was made.                     -
     The action of precipitants however upon this oil afforded
  a more satisfactory method of obtaining some of its consti
  tuents. It gives with corrosive sublimate a bulky white pre
  cipitate, and with bichloride of platinum a yellow compound,
  the characters of which vary slightly, according as it is pre
  pared from the more or less volatile portion of the oil. Ni
  trate of silver and acetate of lead, mixed with the alcoholic
  solution of the oil, produce only a slight cloudiness, but on
  boiling the solutions, the sulphurets of silver and lead are de
  posited.
     The Mercury Compound.—In order to obtain this substance
  in the pure state, the oil was dissolved in alcohol, and an
  alcoholic solution of corrosive sublimate added. The preci
  pitate which fell was collected on a filter, and washed with
  aether until the oil was thoroughly extracted, for which pur
  pose a considerable quantity of aether is required. . It is then
  boiled with a large quantity of alcohol, which dissolves a part
  of it; and the solution being filtered hot, allows the compound
 to deposit, on cooling, in the pure state. It is then in the
 form of a white crystalline powder, having a very fine pearly
 lustre, and exhibiting under the microscope crystals of a very
 peculiar form. They are six-sided tables, two opposite angles
  of which are rounded off, so as to give them a very close re
  semblance to the section of a barrel. It possesses, even after
  long-continued washing with aether, a peculiar slight sickening
  smell, which becomes more powerful on heating, and its pow
 der irritates the nose.        It is insoluble in water, which moistens
 it with difficulty. It requires several hundred times its weight
 of boiling alcohol for solution, and is almost entirely deposited,
 on cooling, in microscopic crystals. In aether it is almost in
 soluble. When heated, it is decomposed with the evolution

             of the Fired Oils in contact with Sulphur.                 169
of a peculiar nauseous smelling oil. The sparing solubility
of this compound in alcohol renders its preparation in sufficient
quantity for analysis an extremely tedious process, and I have
sought in vain for a more abundant solvent. The only sub
stance which I have found capable of taking it up in larger
quantity is coal-tar naphtha; but its employmentis inadmissible,
as the best which can be procured is an extremely impure
substance, and the crystals of the compound deposited from
it always acquire a rose or violet tint from some of its impu
rities. Oil of turpentine likewise dissolves it, but not more
abundantly than alcohol.
   By many successive solutions in alcohol, I obtained enough
of this substance for an analysis, of which the following are
the results:—
                  12:302 grains, dried in vacuo, gave
                    6'592     ...  of carbonic acid, and
                    3-018     ...  of water.
   8:061 grains deflagrated with a mixture of nitre and car
bonate of soda, gave 7'297 grains of sulphate of baryta =
1:0067– 12:48 per cent. of sulphur.
   The mercury and chlorine were determined together by
mixing the substance with quicklime, and introducing the
mixture into a combustion-tube.               The end was then drawn
out into an elongated bulb, into which the mercury sublimed,
and which was afterwards cut off, dried in the water-bath,
and weighed, both with and without the mercury; the chlo
rine was determined in the usual way from the residue in the
tube.
   9,958 grains gave 5'976 mercury = 60-01 per cent, and
4:310 grains chloride of silver = 10.67 per cent. of chlorine.
   5,797 grains gave 2.409 of chloride of silver = 10.25 per
cent. of chlorime.
   These results correspond closely with the formula Cig H16
S., Hg, Cl2, as is shown by the following comparisons:–

   It is sufficiently obvious that the formula Cig H16 S, Hg, Cl,

 170 Dr. T. Anderson on certain Products of Decomposition
 cannot be supposed to represent the rational formula of
 this substance. On the contrary, the remarkable analogy
 between its properties and those of the mercury compound of
 sulphuret of allyle appear clearly to indicate a similarity in their
 chemical constitution,-a similarity which, as we shall after
 wards see, is borne out by the properties of the platinum com
 pound. I consider this substance to contain an organic sul
 phuret analogous to sulphuret of allyle, the constitution of
 which must be represented by the formula Cs Hs S2, to which
 I give the provisional name of sulphuret of odmyl (from Cºu),
 odour), and that the rational formula of the mercury com
 pound is—
           (Cs Hs S,-- Hg, Cl3)-1-(Cs Hs S2-- Hg2S).
    On contrasting this with the formula of the allyle compound,
 which is—
           (C, H, Cl- Hg, Cl,)+(C, H, S + Hg, S.),
two important points of difference are apparent, namely, that
in the new compound we have the sulphuret, and not the
chloride, of the base in union with corrosive sublimate, and
the presence of subsulphuret in place of sulphuret of mercury
in the second member of the compound. It is even possible
to approximate more closely the formulae of the allyle and
odmyle compounds, by assuming the sulphuret of odmyle to be
represented by C, H, S; in which case the mercury compound
becomes—
        {3(C, H, S)+Hg, S,} + (C, H, Cl-i-Hg, Cl).
   This formula is however incompatible with its reactions, as
it involves the presence of calomel in the compound. Treat
ment with caustic potash however shows that this is not the
case, as it immediately becomes yellow, from the separation
of oxide of mercury, while the black suboxide would have
been formed had calomel been present.
   When a current of sulphuretted hydrogen is passed through
the mercury compound suspended in water, it becomes rapidly
black, a peculiar smell is observed, along with that of sulphu
retted hydrogen; and by distillation an oil passes over, which
is obtained floating on the surface of the water. It is per
fectly transparent and colourless. Its smell is peculiar, and
resembles the nauseous odour developed by crushing some
umbelliferous plants. When dissolved in alcohol, it gives
with corrosive sublimate a white precipitate, soluble in hot
alcohol, from which it is deposited in crystals precisely similar
to those from which it had been originally separated, and with
bichloride of platinum a yellow precipitate, slightly soluble in

           of the Fired Oils in contact with Sulphur.           171
hot alcohol and aether. This oil is in all probability the
sulphuret of odmyle Cs Hs S, ; but the small quantity in which
I have been able to obtain it, has prevented my performing
any analysis of it.
   The Platinum Compound.—When a solution of bichloride
of platinum is added to the alcoholic solution of the crude oil,
a yellow precipitate makes its appearance, which does not fall
immediately, but goes on gradually increasing for some time,
precisely as is the case with the allyle compound. The pro
perties of this precipitate are not however perfectly constant,
but vary according to the portion of the oil employed to yield
it. That obtained from the more volatile portion has a fine
sulphur-yellow colour, but the less volatile oil gives an orange
precipitate. It is insoluble in water, sparingly soluble in
alcohol and aether. When heated it becomes black, an oil is
evolved smelling exactly like that obtained from the mercury
compound, and sulphuret of platinum is left behind, which
requires a high temperature to drive off all its sulphur, and
leaves metallic platinum as a silver-white mass. When treated
with hydrosulphuret of ammonia, it is converted into a brown
powder, exactly like that obtained under similar circumstances
from allyle.
   The analysis of the yellow compound has not hitherto given
results of a satisfactory character. I have found the amount
of platinum to oscillate between 43°06 and 49.66 per cent.
The former of these was obtained from the most volatile oil,
the latter from that which boiled between 300° and 400°F.,
and intermediate results were obtained at intermediate tem
peratures. The results obtained from the oil which boiled at
a high temperature were remarkably constant; thus I have
found, in different experiments, 49'00, 49-51, and 49.66 per
cent. of platinum, which appear to indicate the presence of
some compound of rather sparing volatility. The precipitate
obtained from the most volatile oil appears to be that corre
sponding to the mercury compound which has just been de
scribed. Of it I have been able only to perform a very incom
plete analysis, which is insufficient to establish its constitution,
especially as it is impossible to ascertain whether it is a homo
geneous substance. As the results, however, approximate to
a formula analogous to that of the mercury compound, I give
the details, such as they are.
           9:155 grains of the platinum compound gave
           7'474     ...    carbonic acid, and
           3°294,    ...    Water.
   5-701 grains gave 2:455 grains of platinum =43°06 per cent.

   The analogy which those substances bear to allyle is exceed
ingly interesting, as showing the possibility of forming, by
artificial processes, substances similar in constitution to so
remarkable a compound, which is not a product of decompo
sition, but exists ready-formed in a variety of different vege
tables, where it must obviously be produced under circum
stances very different from the artificial substance; for allyle
cannot exist at all at a high temperature, and is entirely de
composed at, or even below, its point of ebullition. Unfor
tunately, however, the examination of this substance is much
complicated by the necessity of examining its compounds in
place of itself. Had it been possible to separate it directly
from the crude oil, the determination of its constitution and
that of its compounds would have presented comparatively
little difficulty, and been arrived at with much less labour than
that expended upon the imperfect details I have been able to
accumulate. Another point worthy of observation, is the total
alteration of the products of decomposition of oleic acid pro
duced by the presence of sulphur; no sebacic acid, and, in
fact, none of its ordinary products being evolved, although all
the substances produced contain carbon and hydrogen in the
proportion of equal atoms, just as they exist among the ordi
nary products, a circumstance which, taking into considera
tion the abundant evolution of sulphuretted hydrogen, we
certainly should not have anticipated.
    The oil which remains after the separation of the mercury
compound, likewise contains sulphur as one of its constituents;
but I have not yet had time to commence the investigation of
this part of the subject. The discussion of it, as well as va
rious other points connected with the compounds already de
scribed, I hope to make the subject of a future communica
t1011.

 XXX. On the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat, as determined
    by the Heat evolved by the Friction of Fluids. By J. P.
    Joule, Secretary to the Literary and Philosophical Society
    of Manchester*.
 IN the Philosophical Magazine for September 1845 I gave
     a concise account of some experiments brought before the
 Cambridge Meeting of the British Association, by which I
"had proved that heat was generated by the friction of water
 produced by the motion of a horizontal paddle-wheel. These
 experiments, though abundantly sufficient to establish the
 equivalency of heat to mechanical power, were not adapted to
 determine the equivalent with very great numerical accuracy,
 owing to the apparatus having been situated in the open air,
 and having been in consequence liable to great cooling or
 heating effects from the atmosphere. I have now repeated
 the experiments under more favourable circumstances, and
 with a more exact apparatus, and have moreover employed
 sperm oil as well as water with equal success.
    The brass paddle-wheel employed had, as described in my
 former paper, a brass framework attached, which presented
 sufficient resistance to the liquid to prevent the latter being
 whirled round. In this way the resistance presented by the
 liquid to the paddle was rendered very considerable, although
 no splashing was occasioned. The can employed was of cop
 per, surrounded by a very thin casing of tin. It was covered
 with a tin lid, having a capacious hole in its centre for the axle
 of the paddle, and another for the insertion of a delicate ther
 mometer. Motion was communicated to the paddle by means
 of a drum fitting to the axle, upon which a quantity of twine
 had been wound, so as by the intervention of delicate pulleys
 to raise two weights, each of 29 lbs., to the height of about 54
 feet. When the weights in moving the paddle had descended
 through that space, the drum was removed, the weights wound
 up again, and the operation repeated. After this had been
 done twenty times, the increase of the temperature of liquid
 was ascertained. In the second column of the following
 table the whole distance through which the weights descended
 during the several experiments is given in inches. I may
 observe also that both the experiments on the friction of water,
 and the interpolations made in order to ascertain the effect of
 the surrounding atmosphere, were conducted under similar
 circumstances, each occupying forty minutes.

    We see then that the weights of 29 lbs., in descending
through the altitude of 1265-13 inches, generated 0°-668 in the
apparatus. But in order to reduce these quantities, it became
necessary in the first place to ascertain the friction of the pul
leys and that of the twine in unwinding from the drum. This
was effected by causing the twine to go once round a roller of
the same diameter as the drum, working upon very fine pivots,
the two extremities of the twine being thrown over the pul
leys. Then it was found that, by adding a weight of 3150
grains to either of the two weights, the friction was just over
come. The actual force employed in the experiments would
therefore be 406000 grs. —3150 grs. = 402850 grs, through
1265'13 inches, or 6067.3 lbs. through a foot.
    The weight of water being 77617 grs, that of the brass
paddle-wheel 24800 grs, the copper of the can 11237 grs.,

  Mr. J. P. Joule on the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat. 175
and the tin casing and cover 19896 grs., the whole capacity
of the vessel and its contents was estimated at 77617 -- 2319
 + 1056-1-363=81355 grs. of water. Therefore the quantity
of heat evolved in the experiments, referred to a pound of
water, was 7°.7636.
    The equivalent of a degree of heat in a pound of water was
therefore found to be 781.5 lbs. raised to the height of one
foot.
    I now made a series of experiments in which sperm oil was
substituted for the water in the can. This liquid, being that
employed by engineers as the best for diminishing the friction
of their machinery, appeared to me well-calculated to afford
another and even more decisive proof of the principles con
tended for.

    In this instance, the force employed, corrected as before for
 the friction of the pulleys, was equal to raise 6080.4 lbs. to the
 height of one foot.
    In estimating the capacity for heat of the apparatus, it was
 necessary in this instance to obtain the specific heat of the
 sperm oil employed. For this purpose I employed the method
 of mixtures. 43750 grs. of water were heated in a copper
 vessel weighing 10403 grs. to 82°697. I added to this 28597
 grs, of oil at 55°593, and after stirring the two liquids
 together, found the temperature of the mixture to be 76°583.
  Having applied to these data the requisite corrections for the
 cooling of the liquids during the experiment, and for the capa
 city of the copper vessel, the specific heat of the sperm oil came
 out 0:45561.       Another experiment of the same kind, but in
 which the water was poured into the heated oil, gave the spe
 cific heat 0:46116. The mean specific heat was therefore
 O°45838.                                                          -
    The weight of oil employed was 70273 grains, and the
 paddle, can, &c. were the same as employed in the first series
 of experiments; consequently the entire capacity in this in
 stance will be equivalent to that of 35951 grs. of water. The
 heat evolved was therefore 7°7747 when reduced to the ca
 pacity of a pound of water.
    Hence the equivalent deduced from the friction of sperm
 oil was 782:1, a result almost identical with that obtained from
 the friction of water. The mean of the two results is 781.8%,
 which is the equivalent I shall adopt until further and still
 more accurate experiments shall have been made.

        I will make use of it to tell you something about my
little doings. You are no doubt struck with the peculiarity

taken the friction of both pulleys as the correction of each weight instead
of both weights. The whole of the experiments are exactly the same as
those presented to the Oxford meeting. The slight alteration in the equi
valent will make only a very trifling alteration in the theoretical velocity
of sound given in the last Number of this Magazine.

assure you that as long as the art of writing has been practised
no letter has ever been written with such an ink. Dealing now
again in my ozone business, I found out the other day that all
manganese salts, be they dissolved or solid, are decomposed
by ozone, hydrate of peroxide of manganese being produced
and the acid set at liberty. Now to come round again to my
ink, I must tell you that these lines are written with a solution
of sulphate of manganese. The writing being dry, the paper
is suspended within a large bottle, the air of which is strongly
ozonized by means of phosphorus. After a few minutes the
writing becomes visible, and the longer you leave it exposed
to the action of ozone the darker it will become. Sulphurous
acid gas uniting readily with the peroxide of manganese to
form a colourless sulphate, the writing will instantly disappear
when placed within air containing some of that acid; and it
is a matter of course that the writing will come out again
when again exposed to ozonized air. Now all this is certainly
mere playing; but the matter is interesting in a scientific
point of view, inasmuch as dry strips of white filtering paper
drenched with a weak solution of sulphate of manganese fur
nish us with rather a delicate and specific test for ozone, by
means of which we may easily prove the identity of chemical,
voltaic and electrical ozone, and establish with facility and
certainty the continual presence of ozone in the open air. . I
have turned brown my test-paper within the electrical brush,
the ozonized oxygen obtained from electrolysed water and
the atmospheric air ozonized by phosphorus. The quantity
of ozone produced by the electrical brush being so very small,
it requires of course some time to turn the test-paper brown.
    As it is rather inconvenient to write with an invisible ink,
I will stop here; not however before having asked your kind
indulgence for the many blunders and faults which my ozone
bottle will no doubt bring to light before long.

   Phil. Mag. S. 3. Vol. 31. No. 207. Sept. 1847.             N

 178 Dr. Wilson on the Decomposition of Water by Platinum
 turally excited much attention. It furnished the unexpected
 confirmation of the truth of an opinion expressed by James
 Watt so far back as 1783, that if steam could be made red
 hot [white hot] so that all its latent heat should be converted
 into sensible heat, either the steam would be converted into
 permanent air, or some other change would take place in its
 constitution *.
    In the greater number of Mr. Grove’s experiments, water
 was raised in temperature through the medium of platinum;
 and it became a question accordingly, as Sir John Herschel
 and my friend Dr. Lyon Playfair suggested, how far the de
 composition of water observed was owing to the mere heat of
 the metal, how far to the peculiar surface-influence, or so
 called catalytic force, which has been so long recognized as
 possessed by platinum and the other noble metals. Dr. Play
 fair also referred to the fact, “that many bodies at high tem
 peratures exhibited a great affinity for oxygen, which they did
 not possess at lower temperatures; as, for instance, silver,
 gold, and even platinum itself, which metals absorb oxygen
 when intensely heated, and give it out again on cooling. If
 the experiments had been tried in tubes of quartz or silica,
 they would not have been open to the objection which the
 use of so peculiar a metal as platinum appeared to involvet.”
    There was indeed one form of Mr. Grove’s experiment not
 liable to the exception urged against those where platinum was
 used. He found it quite possible to decompose steam by
 sending Leyden-jar discharges through it, and refers the de
 composition solely to the heat evolved by the electric spark.
 The same view has been suggested as not improbable by
 Faraday, in relation to the decomposition of water in the
liquid form by electric discharges f. With great diffidence,
however, I would remark, that the spark decomposition of
water cannot be regarded as an eagerimentum crucis,            Al
though the electric spark cannot decompose steam electroly
tically, we may not at once infer that it cannot decompose it
in another way. I have no wish to assert that it can, but it
is possible that it may, and a crucial experiment should be
unexceptionable. Again: the spark discharge of a Leyden
jar exerts a great disruptive force, and acts topically with
much violence.        There is reason moreover to believe that
mechanical agitation or disturbance of a chemical compound
can in many cases cause the separation of its elements. It
may seem an extravagant idea to suppose that oxygen may
be torn or detached from hydrogen by the action of a dis

ruptive force on the molecules of water, as if chemical affinity
were but a kind of mechanical cohesion, which may be over
come by division. On the other hand, however, it must not
be forgotten, that we are now acquainted with a large num
ber of fulminating compounds, which can be decomposed by
friction, by a touch, or a stroke. These compounds are all
fragile, and water is a very stable combination; but fragility
and stability are but terms of degree, in relation to stability
of union ; and if it shall appear that a feeble mechanical force
can overcome a small intensity of affinity, it will be acknow
ledged as quite possible that a powerful mechanical agency
may overcome a great one. We have no means perhaps of
making an unexceptionable experiment as to the decomposing
power of mechanical force; for we cannot bring it into play
without calling into action other agencies. If we touch, or
rub, or strike a fulminate, for example, we cause the evolution
of heat, and add its decomposing power to that of the mecha
nical impulse. It would be a mere petitio principii, however,
to assume that the heat produced alone effects the decompo
sition observed.   It seems to me, therefore, that the decom
position of steam by the electric spark furnishes a more
complex problem for solution than the action of white-hot
platinum on the same compound does; and that the experi
ments made with the metal are more likely to throw light on
those tried with the spark, than to be explained by them.
   Whilst thinking over these difficulties, and the objections
to Mr. Grove’s conclusions suggested by Herschel and Play
fair, I had occasion to perform the familiar class-experiment
of burning iron wire in oxygen. I observed with an interest
I had not felt previously, although I had carelessly noticed
the phaenomenon before, that bubbles of apparently perma
ment gas rose from the globules of white-hot oxide of iron as
they fell into the water. It seemed to me possible that this
gas might be a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen separated by
the influence of the metallic oxide, acting as platinum did in
Mr. Grove’s experiments. It was certain, moreover, that if
this should prove to be the case, it would supply a powerful
argument in favour of that gentleman’s conclusion, which
seems, in spite of all the objections noticed, in the highest
degree probable, namely, that heat, apart altogether from the
medium through which it is applied, can resolve water into
its elements,
   As the following experiments were made solely in the hope
of substantiating Mr. Grove’s view, which unfortunately, how
ever, they leave exactly as they found it, I trust that gentle
man will not consider their publication an interference with
his researches. I was led to try them incidentally, and
                               N 2

180 Dr. Wilson on the Decomposition of Water by Platinum
abandoned them as soon as I found I could render Mr. Grove
no assistance by means of them.
   It would be difficult to conceive a more rapid and effectual
way of raising a body to a white heat than that afforded
by the combustion of iron in oxygen. I took for granted
also(as it afterwards appeared, too hastily) that the metal could
not but be saturated with oxygen and converted into a de
finite oxide, which would be chemically indifferent to each of
the elements of water, and if it decomposed it at all, would
reject both its constituents. The convenient way, moreover,
in which the globules of oxide detach themselves and fall
into the water, and the rapidity with which the whole process
goes on, make it a very easy matter to collect in considerable
quantity whatever gases are evolved. A stoppered bottomless
jar of the ordinary construction for the iron-wire experiment,
and of 291 cubic inches’ capacity, was made use of in the fol
lowing trials. Eighteen experiments were made with it, and
from 100 to 110 grains of fused globules were obtained from
each combustion.      A test-tube, with a funnel fixed into it
by a perforated cork, and filled with water, was arranged so as
to receive the gas. In some experiments it was placed within
the oxygen jar, so that the coil of wire when introduced hung
close to it, a piece of tin plate being arranged so as to guide
the globules within the edge of the inverted funnel. In the
greater number of trials however the tube and funnel were
placed outside of the vessel containing the oxygen, and an
inclined plane of tin plate was so placed as to carry the
globules past the edge of the jar, and within the mouth of
the funnel. No difference of result was observed in experi
ments made in both ways, but the latter arrangement was
preferred as more convenient, and as enabling more oxygen
to be employed at each trial.
    In all the experiments, permanent gas was evolved when
the fused globules fell into the water. This statement is to
be considered as applying to each combustion considered as
 a whole; for individual globules were frequently observed to
give off no gas at all, or to evolve so very little, that it might
be air separating from the water, in which it had previously
existed in solution. The quantity of gas obtained at each
 combustion varied greatly. Sometimes as much as a cubic
inch was procured, more frequently only half that quantity,
and occasionally less. The globules from thick coils of wire
gave off a larger volume of gas than those from thin ones.
   Portions of the gas were transferred to a Grove’s eudio
 meter over water, and exposed to a white-hot platinum wire.
 They did not kindle or detonate, nor were they sensibly
 diminished in volume. Other portions were subjected to

         and the Black Owide of Iron at a white heat.       181
electric sparks and discharges in a syphon eudiometer over
water, with the same negative results; but when air or oxy
gen was mingled with the gas, it exploded sharply with
heated platinum or the electric spark. When a match was ap
plied to the open end of a tube containing the unmingled gas,
it burned rapidly with a pale blue flame, but did not explode.
The gas given off during the action of the fused globules on
water was not then a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen.
   Its freedom from all but a trace of oxygen was ascertained
in other ways. To one portion of the gas standing over water
nitric oxide was added, but no ruddy fume or yellow colora
tion showed itself. When phosphorus was introduced into
the gas, in one instance it did not smoke, but in the greater
number of cases it fumed for a brief period, and occasioned
an amount of contraction barely perceptible. The gas ap
peared to be nearly pure hydrogen. To ascertain if it cer
tainly were so, a portion of it was carefully dried, by chloride
of calcium, and transferred to a eudiometer over warm mer
cury. Dry oxygen was then added, and the mixture exploded.
When the whole had cooled, the walls of the eudiometer ap
peared dimmed by a very thin layer of moisture, but the
quantity of gas operated on was too small to admit of visible
drops being produced. Another portion of the gas was mixed
with half its volume of oxygen and fired by the electric spark.
The contraction which followed explosion varied in different ex
periments, but was frequently such as to leave not more than
one-twentieth part of the mixed gases unconsumed. Phos
phorus smoked in this residue for a short time, showing that
excess of oxygen had been made use of, and left a minute
volume of gas which was not diminished by caustic potash,
and must have been nitrogen.
    It seemed possible that the trace of carbon present even
 in malleable iron might affect the quality of the gas resulting
 from the action of the globules of oxide on water, and that
 carburetted hydrogen, carbonic oxide or carbonic acid might
 be produced. It seemed desirable to know whether the latter
 were present or not, as the oxygen might have gone to form
 them. It was impossible to be certain that carbonic acid
 was absent, for the gas from the globules being necessarily
 collected over water, the temperature of which was low, car
 bonic acid would be retained in solution by that liquid. All
 that I can say on this point is, that lime-water was not ren
 dered muddy or in the slightest degree opalescent by the
 gas. It was several times detonated with oxygen over lime
 water, but the latter remained quite transparent, so that nei
 ther carbonic oxide nor carburetted hydrogen can have been
 present. In short, the gas evolved from water by the white

 182 Dr. Wilson on the Decomposition of Water by Platinum
 hot globules of oxide of iron, was hydrogen mingled with a
 small quantity of air, previously no doubt in solution in water.
    As only the hydrogen, then, of the water decomposed was
 obtained, it became necessary to account for the absence of
 the oxygen. I was tempted for a moment to think it pos
 sible that the black oxide of iron might have changed into the
 red oxide of the same metal, by combining with the oxygen
 not obtained in the elastic form ; ea. gr. thus 2 Fes Oa--O =
 3Fe, O3.
    But the proto-peroxide of iron is known to be a very stable
 compound, little if at all prone to become the peroxide; and
 it seemed more likely that unoxidized iron might be present
 in the fused globules, which occasioned the evolution of hy
 drogen when it came in contact with water. To ascertain this
 point, portions of the globules were dissolved in dilute muriatic
 and sulphuric acids, and were found in most cases to evolve hy
 drogen. Some specimens of the globules gave off not a trace
 of gas when they dissolved, and must have consisted of the
 definite oxide; a point of interest in connection with the
fact already mentioned, that globules were frequently ob
 served to drop into water without any bubbles of gas rising
from them.
    The volume of hydrogen however given off in some of the
trials, when the product of combustion was placed in acid,
was very considerable. A graduated gas jar was filled with
dilute sulphuric acid, and inverted over a small capsule con
taining 100 grains of the crushed globules, which was placed
in a basin also containing dilute acid. By this arrangement
the gas was collected and measured at the same time, without
risk of mixing with air, or necessity for watching the process,
which is a slow one. 100 grains treated in this way gave off
16 cubic inches of hydrogen, corresponding to 9 grains of
iron. The experiment was accidentally stopped at this point
whilst the gas was still rising in undiminished quantity.
    Metallic iron, then, was certainly present in many of the
globules, and of this I had direct ocular demonstration. On
crushing some of them in a mortar, they were found to sepa
rate into a shell of pulverizable oxide, and a core of iron
which formed a nearly spherical pellet. In one case 50 grains
of the globules were crushed, the pellets separated, and the
residue placed in diluted sulphuric acid. It did not evolve a
trace of hydrogen in the course of twenty-four hours. The
pellets were then added to the same acid, and gave off 12
cubic inches of gas – 13.6 per cent. of iron in the globules*,

 that water or any other liquid penetrates to the iron core, and
 is subject to its influence. When this becomes known, it
 need not surprise us that most of the globules should rapidly
 decompose water. After observing this fact, I tried the
 effect of thin and thick coils of wire, and found that the latter
 invariably gave off the greater volume of gas. When the coil
 is so thin that the metal all oxidizes, no gas is evolved at all.
A thick coil indeed furnishes a striking mode of illustrating
 to a class the principle of Lavoisier's mode of decomposing
 water, and forms a beautiful addition to the iron-wire expe
riment.
    From these observations then, it would seem that white
hot oxide of iron cannot decompose water in the way white
hot platinum does. But before any conclusion can be drawn
from this fact inimical to Mr. Grove’s views, or favourable to
 the opinion that a specific property of the platinum has more
to do with the decomposition of water than its mere tempera
ture has, we should require to know how far the two white
hot bodies are to be considered as at the same temperature.
In Mr. Grove’s experiments, platinum is raised to as high a
heat as it can bear without fusing.      It must then be elevated
to a temperature much above that necessary to make iron
white hot, or to fuse its oxide, for our forges can melt iron
and its oxides, but do not fuse platinum. It may also be re
marked, that bright as the light emitted by burning iron is,
it falls short in intensity of that given off by platinum on the
verge of fusion. It seems accordingly probable, that during
the combustion of iron in oxygen the temperature never rises
high enough to confer upon the resulting oxide the power of
decomposing water. The question admits of direct decision,
by ascertaining whether oxide of iron, heated by the oxy
hydrogen blowpipe to as high a temperature as fusing pla
tinum, acquires the power of decomposing water without ap
propriating to itself either of its elements. But it would have
been an interference with Mr. Grove’s own researches to have
made experiments of this kind, and I have accordingly left the
question undecided,
    Meanwhile the experiments I have recorded are of some
little interest, as at least showing that not only a white heat,
but a high white heat, is essential to the successful perform
ance of Mr. Grove’s experiments. Unfortunately, we have
not at present any method of measuring high temperatures
which admits of ready application or secures great accuracy.
“White heat” is in fact a vague expression for a range of
temperature, of the extremes in either direction or extent of
which we have no very precise knowledge. The power of
the eye to measure the relative intensities of the light evolved

by white-hot bodies is very limited, and varies greatly in
different individuals. But the experiments I have recorded
seem to supply the means of so far at least defining the white
heat requisite for the separation of the elements of water,
inasmuch as they show that it must at least exceed the tem
perature necessary for the fusion of malleable iron or its black
oxide. If, moreover, the decomposing powers of the electric
spark be solely referable to its temperature, we seem entitled
to conclude, from the experiments I have detailed, that the
heat of the smallest spark that can decompose water is at
least equivalent to that of fusing platinum. They appear also
to warrant another conclusion. It was suggested by Dr.
 Leeson and by Mr. Hunt, that the bursting of steam-boilers
 might occasionally be owing to the metal they consist of be
 coming white-hot and decomposing water like platinum, with
 the rejection of both its elements”. This ingenious sugges
 tion seemed to myself, before making experiments with iron,
 likely to prove just; but as fusing white-hot iron appears
 unable to decompose water, otherwise than by combining
 with its oxygen, it is impossible that the walls of a boiler can
 ever be raised to a temperature sufficiently high to enable
 them to separate the elements of water in the way platinum
 does.
     I may now be permitted to make some comments on the
 rationale of the results obtained by Mr. Grove. That gentle
 man, if I understand him aright, considers the decomposition
 of water by white-hot platinum not only, as assuredly it is, a
 remarkable and unexpected result, but as evidencing on the
 part of heat a power to produce opposite or dissimilar chemi
 cal effects in the same circumstances. He is reported in the
 Athenaeum (Sept. 19th, 1846, p. 966) to have “ announced
 his discovery that all the processes by which water may be
 formed are capable of decomposing water” (p. 966). If by
 this statement be simply meant, that heat combines oxygen
  and hydrogen into water, and decomposes water into these
  gases, it will be admitted to be a just conclusion; but it may
 be questioned, I think, whether Mr. Grove’s experiments
 add anything to our knowledge of the power of heat to effect
 chemical changes, except in so far as they supply an addi
 tional very remarkable example of its twofold analytical and     {
  synthetical agency, which has been so long recognised. Hy
  drogen, which as a gas is probably the vapour of a very vola
  tile metal, may be compared with mercury, also a volatile
  substance. If mercury and oxygen be heated together to the
  temperature of 662°F., they combine and form the red oxide of
  the metal. If this resulting oxide be raised to a low red heat,

           and the Black Owide of Iron at a white heat.                   185
it is decomposed into mercury and oxygen. In like manner,
if hydrogen and oxygen be raised together to the tempera
ture of 660° Fº, they unite and form water. If the resulting
water be raised to a white heat, it is resolved into hydrogen
and oxygen. Both metals (?) present the same phaenomena.
At one temperature (nearly the same in both cases) combina
tion with oxygen occurs; at a higher temperature, decompo
sition of the oxide happens. Many other examples might be
given in illustration of the same fact.           Such cases, however,
 do not seem to warrant a conclusion as to heat exhibiting
anything like a polarity of force, by which I understand the
 manifestation in opposite directions of opposite powers of
 equal intensity. At all events, if the opposite effects of dif
 ferent intensities of the same agent be considered equivalent
to a polarity of action, it is difficult to see what force may not
 be called a polar one. The decomposing and combining
 power of heat of different intensities, seems exactly compara
 ble to the opposite effects of different intensities of mechanical
 impulse.
    If two pieces of smooth glass are laid together and struck
 gently or compressed slightly, they unite or cohere. If the
 united pieces are thereafter exposed to a sharp blow or to
 great compression, the union is dissolved, or they are shat
 tered to fragments.       Here the same force effects mechanical
 synthesis and mechanical analysis. But in these contrasted
 actions, as seems to be the case also in Mr. Grove’s experi
 ments, the results are occasioned by a difference in degree of
 intensity of the same power, not as in the opposite effects of
 a polarizing force like electricity, by a difference in the kind
 of power which appears, whatever be its intensity. There is
 one form, indeed, of Mr. Grove’s experiment which at first
 sight does not appear to admit of the explanation proposed
 in reference to the other trials—I allude to the decomposition
 of steam by the electric spark, which is well known to have
 the power of combining hydrogen and oxygen into water.
 A similar experiment was made in perhaps a still more in
 structive form in the latter part of last century by Beccariat,
 Pearson and Van Troostwyk, and more recently by Wollas
 toni, in his well-known decompositions of water with guarded
 poles. In certain of these trials it was found that Leyden
 jar discharges sent through water, decomposed it till the ac
  cumulation of permanent gas left the wires bare; after which
  the first spark that passed recombined the gases into water,
  which again covered the wire, when decomposition could

  186 Dr. Wilson on the Decomposition of Water by Platinum
  anew be obtained. Here, to appearance, the same agent act
  ing with the same intensity, alternately decomposed and re
  composed water. For argument’s sake, let it be acknow
  ledged that the heat alone of the spark was the cause of che
  mical change. Nevertheless it may be questioned, whether
 it acted with equal intensity in both cases. The electric spark
 must be conceived, according to the results already given, to
 be at first at a high white heat, and whilst retaining this tem
 perature we may believe it to possess a power of disuniting
 the elements of water, and of preventing their union. But as
 soon as the spark falls to the temperature of 660° F., it loses
 its power of decomposing water, and, on the other hand, ac
 quires a power of uniting hydrogen and oxygen. Although
 therefore the spark is always furnished of the same intensity,
 its action may change, and even be reversed, as its intensity
 diminishes. Moreover, even when the spark is white-hot, it
 is only the amount of matter directly in its track that will be
 raised to a white heat.   Contiguous portions will have their
 temperature much lower, so that in the case of hydrogen and
 oxygen, at some little distance from the route of the spark,
 the temperature will be 660° F., and there combination will
 begin, and ultimately extend through the whole mass of gas.
    In like manner, when a platinum wire is made white-hot in a
 mixture of hydrogen and oxygen, it causes their combination.
 Here we may suppose that union occurs as soon as the tem
perature of the metal rises to 660°F., and before it acquires
 a white heat.    Or if we were to arrange matters so that the
wire should be made white-hot in a vacuum and hydrogen
and oxygen afterwards admitted to it, still union of the gases
 should happen; for although the wire might prevent com
bination immediately around itself, at no great distance where
the temperature was below 700°F. it would compel union.
In all such experiments the combining effect of heat will be
much more manifest than its decomposing power; not that
perhaps the former is in reality greater than the latter, but
because flame is propagated through a mixture of hydrogen
and oxygen by a series of combustions. The hot wire or the
electric spark kindles only the portions of gas immediately
adjacent to it, but the combustion of those sets fire to the
molecules contiguous to them, and these in their turn to their
neighbours, till all are made to burn. Thus the flame travels
after the original cause of combustion has ceased to operate
directly, and the momentary action of a small spark, or the
transient heat of a red-hot capillary wire may suffice to fire
                                                                 .
an infinitely large mass of hydrogen and oxygen. There is
no provision for a similar propagation of decomposition
through water or steam when either is made white-hot; the

         and the Black Owide of Iron at a white heat.       187
absolute amount accordingly of disunion of the elements of
water occasioned is very small.
   If allowance, however, be made for the apparent difference
in extent of effect which heat shows in uniting and in dis
uniting the elements of water, the phaenomena otherwise
seem referable solely to the intensity of the temperature to
which hydrogen and oxygen are exposed. The opposite pro
cesses might go on simultaneously, union or disunion being
determined simply by the different temperatures to which
different portions of the gases were raised. At least it seems
not improbable that if a mixture of steam and of hydrogen
and oxygen were exposed to electric discharge, decomposition
of the steam and combination of the hydrogen and oxygen
might be effected by the same spark, provided the volume of
steam were not large. In the track of the spark decompo
sition would occur, so long as a white heat prevailed. When
the temperature fell, combination would happen where the
spark had passed, if it had not already commenced in the
neighbourhood of its direct route. Similar remarks apply
mutatis mutandis to the action of a hot platinum wire on a mix
ture of steam with oxygen and hydrogen.
   It may be objected to this view, that Mr. Grove decom
poses steam in his eudiometer, and obtains a permanent bub
ble of gas, consisting of hydrogen and oxygen. The bubble
however obtained in this way is very small, and could not
probably be greatly increased. Mr. Grove has not mentioned
how large a volume of hydrogen and oxygen he could obtain
in the same eudiometer, by alternately boiling the water till
the steam produced caused the liquid to fall below the wire,
and allowing the steam to condense till the water rose above
the metal. But I venture to say that no large volume of per
manent gas could be procured by this process if the same
eudiometer were employed many times successively. The
combining action of the wire might not take effect on the
hydrogen and oxygen when their quantity was small, and
they were diluted through a large volume of steam, for in
virtue of the law of diffusion, the molecules of hydrogen and
oxygen would be separated from each other by molecules of
water-vapour; but when the latter diminished in bulk, it
seems impossible to doubt that kindling of the gases would
OCCur.
   Mr. Grove’s experiments then do not appear to prove that
heat of the same intensity is able in the same circumstances
to form water and to decompose it. When therefore it is
stated that water can be produced by the processes that dis
unite its elements, the word ‘process’ can only be understood
to signify that the general arrangement in both cases is the

188 Dr. Wilson on the Decomposition of Water by Platinum.
same, not that the intensity of the agent called into play, or
its mode of action is identical.     If this could be affirmed, we
should be able to announce as a general proposition, that
manifestations of the same force absolutely identical as to
quality, quantity and intensity, could produce totally oppo
site results, which would be tantamount to affirming that un
like effects may flow from the same cause, without any altera
tion in the qualities or conditions of the latter.
   The last observation I would make refers to the curious
fact noticed by Mr. Grove, namely, that when a platinum wire
is heated white-hot in steam, “in a few seconds a small bub
ble of gas is formed; but if the action be continued for a
week, it does not increase in quantity*.”
   Are we to suppose that the wire is at the same time decom
posing water around itself, and producing water at a little
distance, undoing in one place what it effects in another, so
that no permanent accumulation of gas is allowed to take
place? This is possible, but I think not likely. The ob
servation made by Mr. Grove seems sufficiently explicable,
on the supposition that as soon as the wire is completely en
veloped in steam, the thermo-circulatory currents which the
high temperature occasions in the vapour prevent it from
remaining long enough in contact with the wire to become
heated white-hot. The steam probably circulates endlessly
around the wire without a trace of decomposition occurring
in it. It seems not unlikely indeed that in Mr. Grove’s ex
periments with his eudiometer it was not steam that yielded
the hydrogen and oxygen obtained, but the last film of water
below the wire, which could not escape from the metal, but
tended rather, in consequence of its expansion, to rise towards
it, and was thus compelled to acquire a white heat, and to
break up into its elements. If this view be correct, an ar
rangement where a white-hot wire or sheet of platinum foil
was kept grazing the surface of water, might be found to
effect a continuous decomposition of the liquid in question.
    It is no objection to this view that an electric spark decom
poses steam readily, for the duration of the spark is so short,
that there is no time for the production of thermo-currents,
nor any possibility of the steam escaping from the powerful
topical action of the discharge. The spark may be compared
to fulminating silver, whose action is instantaneous and vio
lent, but quite local,—the heated platinum to gunpowder, the
effect of which is cumulative and more general.

of such form, and if A and B are each odd, and C the double
or quadruple of an odd number, or if A and B are each even
and C odd, then, I say, the given equation may be made to
depend upon another of the form
                    Alu” +B'vº-C'w8–Dayz;

                      w.v. w = some factor of z.
   The following are some of the consequences which I deduce
from the above theorem. In stating them it will be convenient
to use the term Pure Factorial to designate any number into
the composition of which no single or square prime positive
factor of the form 6 n+1 enters.
   The equations          a”--y”--22°= Day:

is insoluble in integer numbers, provided that the Determinant,
for which in this case we may substitute A–27 Bº, is a pure
factorial whenever A is of the form 9n + 1, and equal to
2p**l or 4p”, p being any prime number whatever.
    I wish however to limit my assertion as to the insolubility
of the equations above given. The theorem from which this
conclusion is deduced does not preclude the possibility of two
of the three quantities w, y, z being taken positive or negative
units, either in the given equation itself or in one or the other
of those into which it may admit of being transformed. Should
such values of two of the variables afford a particular solution,
then instead of affirming that the equations are insoluble, I
should affirm that the general solution can be obtained by
equations in finite differencest.

                             w”--vº-Hwº–0,
 and is therefore insoluble.
    It is moreover apparent that the Determinant of equation
 (2) transformed is in general –27R*, and is therefore always
 a Pure Factorial, and consequently the equation
                       f*a*4-g”y” + h^*= Kryz

    Pressing avocations prevent me from entering into further
developments or simplifications at this present time.
    It remains for me to state my reasons for putting forward
these discoveries in so imper<U+017F>ect a shape. They occurred to
me in the course of a rapid tour on the continent, and the
results were communicated by me to my illustrious friend M.
Sturm in Paris, who kindly undertook to make them known
on my part to the Institute.
    Unfortunately, in the heat of invention I got confused about
27:25 is a Pure Factorial: consequently if the solution be possible, since
in this case the transformed must be identical with the given equation, this
latter must be capable of being satisfied by making r and y positive or ne
gative units. Upon trial we find that r=1 y=l z=2 will satisfy the equa
tion. I believe, but have not fully gone through the work of verification,
that these are the only possible values (prime to one another) which will
satisfy the equation. Should they not be so, my method will infallibly
enable me to discover and to give the law for the formation of all the others.

XXXIV. Experiment made at the Kew Observatory on a new
   Kite-Apparatus for Meteorological Observations, or other
   purposes+.
Mº. W. R. BIRT (on the 14th of this month) took some
        kites, &c. to the Kew Observatory, for the purpose of
endeavouring to ascertain how far it might be practicable to
measure the force of wind at various elevations by their means,
and (in the mere manipulation of his experiments) was assisted
by Mr. Ronalds. After several trials, &c. they agreed that
the sudden variations, horizontal and vertical, in the position
of the kite, the great difficulty of making a kite which should
present and preserve a tolerable approximation to a plane,
that of measuring, with sufficient accuracy, at any required
moment, its inclination, and lastly, the influence of the tail,
would always tend to render the observation somewhat unsa
tisfactory. Mr. Ronalds then proposed to try the following
method of retaining a kite in a quasi invariable given position.
Three cords were attached to an excellent hexagonal kite of
Mr. Birt's construction: one in the usual manner, and one
on each side (or wing). The kite was then raised as usual;
the two lateral cords were hauled downward by persons stand
ing at the apices of a large equilateral triangle (described upon
the ground) until the ascending tendency became considerable
(even when the force of the wind was at its minimum), and the
three cords were made fast to stakes or held in the hand.
He had entertained no expectation of the favourable result of
this simple and obvious contrivance. The place of the kite
did not seem to vary so much as one foot in any direction, and
it really appears to him probable that a very large kite or
kites might be employed in this kind of manner often and very

 XXXV. On Transformations produced by Catalytic Bodies.
                      By LYON PLAY FAIR, Esq.*
 BERZELIUS rendered a most useful work to science, when
       he collected into one class those varied phaenomena of
 chemical action resulting from causes certainly very different
from the ordinary manifestations of those affinities, which
 produce combinations or promote decompositions. This phi
 losopher believes the power t, which causes decomposition
 without the acting body participating in its result, to be a
 distinct electro-chemical agency different from other recog
 nised powers, and he named it the “Catalytic force.” Ac
cording to this view, catalytic bodies do not act by chemical
affinity, but they excite inherent affinities in other substances,
in consequence of which new combinations or decomposi
tions ensue.                                               -
    Mitscherlich f, adopting this view, considered a number of
catalytic decompositions in detail, and showed the important
influence exerted by the state of surface of bodies in favouring
this peculiar action, which he denominates decomposition by
contact. The examples, adduced in this interesting memoir,
of the favourable action of an extended surface upon combi
nation, fully prove that the physical condition of bodies ex
ercises an important influence upon the action of this force;
but they do not remove the necessity for studying the force
itself, as it may either be a vis occulta, entirely distinct from
powers already recognised, as Berzelius supposes, or may be
modified forms of those in continual operation.                        -
    Liebigs views the catalytic power as a dynamical action
lºommuniated by the Chemical Society; having been read April 5,

on the atoms of a complex molecule, conceiving that the ac
tivity of the atoms of a body in a state of motion may be
communicated to those of another body in a state of rest.
The atoms of a compound, according to this view, if in a state
of exact statical equilibrium, arrange themselves according to
new affinities, when the vis inerti<U+017F>e is overcome by motion.
In proof of this view, Liebig carefully examines a large num
ber of decompositions, and accounts for some of the most
difficult transformations in organic chemistry.
   But there are many instances, to which I shall have to
draw attention in the present memoir, where catalytic de
compositions ensue when there is no intestine motion in the
atoms of the exciting body; and hence we cannot do more
than consider motion as favourable to the development of
dormant affinities, in a manner similar to the surface action
described by Mitscherlich. The power of peroxide of hy
drogen and of pyruvic acid to reduce oxide of silver is cer
tainly a singular phaenomenon, and appears favourable to
Liebig’s views; but the cause of the original decomposition
of the peroxide of hydrogen cannot be ascribed to motion, as
the atoms of the oxide of silver are not in that state, and
those of the peroxide of hydrogen either not at all or only
slightly so. Neither will it suffice to suppose that the escape
of gas during such decompositions is due to the presentation
of angular points from which the gas may escape *, because
solutions of alkalies equally effect the decomposition, accord
ing to Thenardt. The cause, therefore, which enables cer
tain substances to hasten the decomposition of such bodies
as peroxide of hydrogen or persulphuret of hydrogen, al
though favoured by the state of surface and by motion, is in
dependent of mere physical condition.
   In further proof of the importance of motion in causing com
bination or decomposition, Liebig cites the favourable effects
of agitation on the precipitation of potash by tartaric acid. It
may be questioned, however, whether this is not either a me
chanical breaking up of a combination or the simple effect of
cohesion.    Thus when water is saturated with a gas, a brisk
agitation with a rod causes the separation of bubbles of gas
previously dissolved. The mechanical force may here be sup
posed to have broken up the compound molecule of water and
gas by detaching the former, and thus enabling the gas to
escape by its elasticity. In the precipitation of potash by
tartaric acid, cohesion may effect the same result that elasti
city does in the case of gas, the agitation knocking off the

atoms of water which are feebly attached. In fact we know
that the addition of alcohol equally aids the precipitation,
the action here being a chemical separation of the water,
as in the other it is mechanical.            The diminished solubility
of the salt, after it has been influenced by cohesion and sepa
rated from water, has its counterpart in many similar in
stances; for example, in the small solubility of anhydrous
sulphate of iron. The effect of agitation on a solution of
sulphate of soda, saturated while hot and allowed to cool, I
ascribe to the same cause.          The supposed effect of cohesion
or elasticity in these cases is nothing more than that con
stantly observed in ordinary phaenomena, when the gravity
of a substance is different from that of the medium in which
it exists. The vesicles of water in the atmosphere may be so
small that they float in it and produce fogs; but when ag
gregated together by the motion of the air, they form drops,
which precipitate to the ground with a rapidity proportionate
to their size: the converse of this is also true,                 Thus, the
particles or aggregated atoms of carbonic acid in water may
be so very small, that, with the slight affinity of the latter
added, they may be enabled, when in a state of rest, to re
main without resuming their elastic form; but agitation
causes a larger system of aggregated atoms, and the gas now
escapes in small bubbles.
    The first instance of cohesion applies in the precipitation
of tartar. At the moment of formation the particles may be
so widely apart, that, aided by their slight affinity for water,
they remain without aggregating to any considerable extent.
Brisk agitation, and the presentation of an extended surface,
effect their aggregation and cause a speedy precipitation. It
may be that these are really instances of combination favoured
by motion; but presuming that they are, the general argu
ment is not affected, that other decompositions perfectly ana
logous are produced where the exciting body is in a state of
rest.
    The third theory of these decompositions is, that catalytic
bodies act by exerting a feeble chemical affinity on one of the
constituents of the body decomposed. This view was intro
duced by Mercer *, and supported by several very ingenious
experiments communicated to the British Association at its
meeting in Manchester. One of these was, that protoxide of
manganese had the singular power of hastening the oxidation
of starch in nitric acid f. The metallic protoxide, from its
   * Reports of British Association, vol. xi. 2d Part, p. 32.
   # The experiment is easily made by dissolving 1 ounce oxalic acid in

disposition to pass into the state of peroxide, aids the oxalic
acid to decompose the nitric acid, the united affinities of
both being able to accomplish what neither by itself could do.
The protoxide remains unaffected at the end of the experi
ment, because, under the circumstances (the presence of acid),
it cannot gratify its desire to become peroxide, and, therefore,
it passes over its oxygen to the carbon, which escapes as
carbonic acid. Mercer cited, as further examples, the action
of protoxide of copper in eliminating oxygen from a solution
of hypochlorite of lime, and of peroxide or binoxide of nitro
gen in commencing the oxidation of a mixture of protochlo
ride of tin and nitric acid. Mercer implied by these instances,
that catalysis is an affinity of the catalytic agent for an ele
ment in the body acted upon, that affinity being feeble and
incapable of gratification under the circumstances.
    It would be advantageous to science if we could arrange
under a known power the cases of decomposition which ap
peared so mysterious as to induce the great Berzelius to
ascribe them to the action of a new force. It may not be
possible in the present state of our knowledge to comprehend
the whole of the instances observed, but, if most are included
in one category, we have a right to suppose that the others
may be embraced as our knowledge progresses. I shall there
fore endeavour to show that many catalytic decompositions are
merely cases of chemical affinity exerted under peculiar con
ditions.
    In no instance of chemical union does there seem to be
such a complete gratification of affinity as to suppress the at
tractions of the elements.        The inherent affinities still remain
more or less powerful, for, if it were not so, the compound
 would be permanent under all circumstances and not liable
to further change by the action of external agents.                When
manganese unites with 1 atom of oxygen, the affinity of the
metal for oxygen is not wholly merged, but is still strong
enough to attach to itself 1, 2 or 3 atoms more oxygen.
When the oxide is one of the lowest of the series, this affinity
exhibits itself in a basic power by attaching itself to any com
plex highly oxygenized molecule, such as the oxygen acids,
or of radicals playing the part of oxygen. When, on the
other hand, the manganese or other radical becomes highly
oxygenized, we find it possessing acid properties, that is, the
1:30 sp. gr. No action ensues on this mixture, but it immediately com
mences on the addition of a protosalt of manganese, which for simplicity
may be the oxalate or nitrate. The action is also strikingly shown by heat
ing a mixture of oxalic acid until the action commences, then diluting it
till all action ceases. A little protosalt of manganese now added to the
solution causes an immediate renewal of the oxidation.

additional atoms of oxygen, being less firmly attached, are
capable of gratifying the disposition of a less oxygenized atom
(the base) to attach itself to a higher oxide, or, to use the
convenient phraseology of Graham, the base becomes zincous
to the acid, which is now chlorous.
    On heating the nitrates, nitric acid is not given off, but
NO,--O. The decomposition readily results from the dis
position of the base to appropriate more oxygen and pass
into the higher oxides. If the base be oxide of nickel, the
oxygen becomes attached to the oxide and remains; if, how
ever, an oxide which has but a feeble affinity for oxygen
at an elevated temperature, the elasticity of that element
is able to overcome the affinity, which succeeded in break
ing up the nitric acid. The final action is so obviously de
pendent upon the oxygenous part of the acid, as to make
Schönbein believe that salts contain peroxides ready-formed;
thus that NOs, HO= NO,--HO, or PbO, NO. = NO,--
PbO2. This however is an unnecessary supposition, the pre
vious view accounting sufficiently for the decomposition of a
nitrate, so as to produce NO, and O. Admitting this view
to be correct in the expression that the preponderating quan
tity of a chlorous element in an acid renders the latter chlo
rous to a base, the mechanical attachment being to the chlo
rous element, we can understand why the number of atoms
of oxygen in a base should regulate the number of atoms of
acid attached to it. Thus RO presents only one chlorous
element of attachment to the acid, and therefore the latter
adheres to it in one proportion; whereas R, Oa, which pos
sesses three atoms of a chlorous element equally distributed
round a zincous nucleus, presents three points of attach
ment, and therefore produces a salt R, Os, 3A. This view
in result gives all the simplicity of the acid radical theory,
both views entertaining the idea that the oxygenous atoms of
the base and acid are attached to each other.             We have cer
tain instances, as for example KO, CIOs; PbO, NO3, where
the elastic atoms of oxygen combine as closely together as
non-elastic atoms, such as lead or silver.
   Although to aid conception we may suppose the atoms of
oxygen of the base and of the acid to be in mechanical con
nexion, the true arrangement is probably not so, seeing that
in a base there is always a part more zincous than the oxy
genous atom, although the base as unity is zincous to the
acid. We see many instances in chemistry of union of atoms
in pairs, or what may be called dual affinity. This Grahamºk

has proved to be the case with regard to atoms of water, and
we know of numberless instances in the case of oxides. Thus
RO uniting with oxygen forms RO2. In this case RO + O
corresponds to RO + A, the acid here representing the chlo
rous element from its oxygenous character. It is not neces
sary to suppose that A and O are associated in one continu
ous line, the probability being that the molecule may really
be represented by ARO. Thus also in R, O, where the O,
are probably grouped equally round R2, there is room for
three more of a chlorous element to gratify the dual affinity,
and the general formula R., Os, 3A is the result, the 3A here
representing three of a simple chlorous element. The result,
as regards affinity, will still however be the same, the whole
depending upon the attraction of the central nucleus R. It
is therefore only for simplicity of expression in studying the
phaenomena of catalysis, that I view the atoms of oxygen of
an acid as associated in mechanical continuation with the
atoms of oxygen of the base, the effect being represented by
this expression: the whole views of molecular or atomic con
stitution of bodies are in my opinion only convenient fictions
to enable us to study the forces themselves, and the concep
tion of a mechanical arrangement I only adopt as expressive
of the manifestations of powers residing in matter.
   To show that the tendency of bases to NOs, even without
being combined, is to attach themselves to the oxygenous
part of the acid, a curious phaenomenon observed by Mercer
may be cited.
   A portion of alumina may be taken and placed at the bot
tom of a vessel containing warm NOg; no action ensues, ex
cept partial solution; a slip of calico coloured in indigo-blue
may now be introduced into the mixture, and remains unaf
fected in the clear acid, but is immediately discharged when
pressed with a glass rod into the alumina. Here the alumina
acts by placing the oxygen of the nitric acid in a state of ten
sion without however succeeding in decomposing it, but the
moment an assistant affinity comes into play, that state is
shown by the decomposition of the nitric acid and oxidation
of the indigo. The alumina in the presence of the acid could
not oxidize (in fact, we know of no higher oxide), and there
fore the indigo appropriates the oxygen. I find that various
other oxides, such as calcined Cr2O3 and SnO2, have the same
power, the latter showing this disposition more strongly than
any of the other oxides. The best mode of trying these ex
periments is to heat a certain quantity of nitric acid, and then
dilute it till indigo cloth ceases to be bleached. The oxide of
tin is now added and allowed to fall to the bottom.       On in

198               Dr. Playfair on Transformations
troducing a slip of indigo-blue calico, the portion in the clear
acid will be found to remain unaffected, while that in contact
with the insoluble oxide will be bleached in a few seconds.
That this decoloration of the indigo is due to the assistant
affinity of another body acting in the same direction, i. e. also
having a disposition to unite with oxygen, may perhaps best
be shown by the following experiment:-Warm nitric acid is
diluted to such extent that it just ceases to discharge indigo
blue calico; it is then divided into two portions, with slips of
coloured calico in each, and through one of these binoxide
of nitrogen is passed. In the latter the indigo becomes
quickly bleached, while it remains unaffected in the former,
the action obviously being due to the accessory affinity of the
mitric oxide for more oxygen. In the same way indigo-blue
is discharged during the decomposition of a nitrate by heat,
other kinds of organic matter being oxidized under like cir
cumstances; in these instances the decomposition of the ni
tric acid is much facilitated,—1. by the affinity of the base for
oxygen; 2. the affinity of the organic matter for oxygen,
which unites with it at the elevated temperature. There are
many similar instances of this kind, where the behaviour of
NO, or NO, as an assistant is too clearly contrasted with the
action of other bodies to permit mistake. Thus urine when
kept is unfit for the preparation of urea, that substance ha
ving been converted into carbonate of ammonia during the
action of the air upon the mucus or colouring matter con
tained in the fluid.        Colourless nitric acid unites with urea
and may be heated with it without decomposition; but nitric
acid containing any of the lower oxides of nitrogen, such as
NO3 or NO1, immediately decomposes urea into carbonic acid
and ammonia”.         We cannot conceive that a lower oxide can
more readily oxidize urea than a higher oxide, and hence we
can only view the NO, as aiding the urea to oxidize itself, as
the mucus does in urine. In the same way, the action of
pure nitric acid on colourless uric acid is to form alloxan, if
the operation has been conducted so as to prevent the forma
tion of nitrous acid (NOA) during the oxidation. But if NO,
has been evolved, or if the colouring matter of the urine be
still contained in the uric acid, the products are only carbo
mate and oxalate of ammonia. The colouring matter of the
urine and NO, are thus seen to possess a similar action,
which is exactly the same as that of protonitrate of manga
nese on a mixture of starch and nitric acid, no oxalic acid
being formed in the presence of this salt, the only product of

 oxidation being carbonic acid. The NO, or NO, acts in these
 cases clearly by aiding the compound ready to oxygenate, but
 which, under the conditions, has not sufficient power to de
 compose the nitric acid without additional aid. The same ex
 planation probably applies to the singular discovery of Pro
 fessor Graham”, that the addition of NO, to non-accendible
 phosphuretted hydrogen renders it inflammable. In this case
 the two combined affinities produce the union of oxygen
 with one of the bodies. The presence of the small quantity
 of another compound of phosphuretted hydrogen in the spon
 taneously accendible gas, as described by Leverrieri and by
 Thenard<U+017F>, may probably act in the same manner.
    The action of this compound (PH2) corresponding to ami
 dogen (NH2) may be conceived so to disturb the attraction of
 the phosphorus to the hydrogen in the gas PHs as to produce
 the inflammability. Both the elements of this gas are highly
 combustible, uniting with oxygen at a low temperature.
 Their mutual attractions are sufficiently strong to prevent the
 oxygen breaking up this union; but when the second body
is present, the desire of PH2 for another atom of hydrogen
 may be supposed so far to draw the third atom of hydrogen
from the PHs, that oxygen has now the power to unite with
the two inflammable elements. In disturbing the existing
 equilibrium, it is presumed to act just as a spark would do by
elevating the already strong affinities of the two elements for
 oxygen. When a solution of hypochlorite of lime is poured
into a solution of muriate of ammonia in excess, a very pun
gent volatile compound results, which has no bleaching pro
perties, and therefore does not contain hypochlorous acid.
 The decomposition is expressed by the equation NHaCl +
CaO, CIO = NH2Cl + 2 HO + CaCl. The volatile com
pound NH2Cl has an affinity for hydrogen in order to pass
into NH, Cl. This body was well-fitted to test the view of the
cause of the inflammability of phosphuretted hydrogen (even
supposing PH2 is not spontaneously inflammable, as it is
stated to be by Thenard). On placing gas (which had en
tirely lost its inflammability by standing several days over
water), in contact with the above mixture, in about an hour it
acquired the property of smoking strongly in the air, although
it did not inflame spontaneously. This showed that the
affinity of PHs for oxygen was much elevated, although the
attraction was not sufficient for inflammation.

   There cannot be any doubt that the atoms of a body may
be placed in a greater or less degree of tension by varying
conditions. The experiments of Mr. Joule+ and myself on
Allotropism have fully proved that the space occupied by the
same body alters under different circumstances. It is there
fore not an unreasonable assumption that the affinity of one
body for a particular element may be sufficiently great to
produce a tense state of the atoms without effecting decom
position+: hence the added affinity of a second body acting
in the same direction may cause that change which each alone
could not effect. Anything that disturbs the state of statical
equilibrium in such a body will often effect its decomposition.
    This accessory affinity is recognised when both bodies
enter into union. Charcoal and chlorine decompose alumina
at a red heat, though neither can do so separately. In the
same way Boudault<U+017F> has shown that a mixture of potash
or soda and red prussiate of potash oxidizes various me
tallic oxides, while Mercer has for many years made use
of this mixture to discharge indigo-blue on calico S. Red
prussiate of potash (Fe2 Cyg 3K) has a great disposition to
attach to itself another atom of potassium to become yellow
prussiate of potash (Fe, Cys4K). It cannot gratify this de
sire without aid; but when assisted by a substance having
an affinity for the oxygen of the potash, and capable of
appropriating it, decomposition follows. There are often
cases in which the body exercising the accessory affinity may
be unable to effect the union, either by the influence of un
favourable chemical conditions or of cohesion or elasticity.
Thus, in the case with which we first started, the affinity of
protoxide of manganese for oxygen aids in the decomposition
of nitrate of protoxide of manganese, and sesquioxide of man
gamese remains. If the temperature during the decomposition

posed to result from the elastic powers of one of its elements and the cohe
sive force of the other.   The first effect of heat on oxide of chromium
must be to expand the atoms of oxygen, and removing them further from
the two atoms of chromium, permit the cohesive attraction of the latter to
be gratified. Hence the compound acquires properties dependent upon
cohesion, such as indifference to union and diminished solubility.

be elevated, the oxygen resumes its elastic state and refuses to
form this higher oxide, as in fact we know is the case in Mer
cer’s experiment with oxalic acid and nitric acid, where the
presence of hot NO, is an unfavourable chemical condition
to the existence of Mn2O3, and therefore it is not formed,
but in its stead the oxygen is passed over to the organic mat
ter, which is able to unite with it under the circumstances.
A similar instance of the effect of such conditions is seen
when the peroxides of copper, manganese or lead, are thrown
into a solution of bleaching powder. The affinity of these
oxides for an additional quantity of oxygen enables them to
decompose the hypochlorite of lime, converting it into chlo
ride of calcium. When the protoxides are used, this liberated
oxygen unites and converts them to peroxides. The latter
themselves have sufficiently strong affinity for oxygen to cause
the decomposition to proceed; but not uniting with it, pure
oxygen is given off in the gaseous state. Here elasticity has
come into play, and being more powerful than the feeble che
mical affinity, causes the oxygen to escape as a gas.                 When
the solution is cool the gas goes off in a succession of small
bubbles; but when hot, the escape is tumultuous, the heat
aiding the oxygen to enter into the elastic state”. A solution
of chloride of lime evolves oxygen slowly at the boiling-point;
but the decomposition is much accelerated by the accessory
agents referred to.
    The action of certain oxides upon peroxide of hydrogen is
exactly similar to that on a solution of hypochlorite of lime.
Thus peroxide of manganese, the protoxides of cobalt and
lead, minium, peroxide of iron, and the protoxides of nickel,
 copper and bismuth, all exert this action on peroxide of hy
 drogen with a force indicated by their order<U+017F>. In none of
 these cases does the oxide unite with a further proportion of
 oxygen. The violence of the action is however in proportion
 to their power of uniting with more oxygen. The first five
 oxides in the list have higher oxides of definite composition
 and of a certain degree of stability, with the exception of ferric
 acid; while the protoxides of copper and bismuth, although
 possessing the power of uniting with more oxygen, do not
 present superior oxides of a marked character. We should have

 tents are apt to be thrown out of the vessel: a mixture of chloride of lime
 and lime, or the ordinary unfiltered bleaching-powder of commerce, are
 also well-fitted to show the action.

 expected the oxides of nickel and cobalt to have exerted the
 same power, but from Thenard’s description of the former
 being in the state of a black powder, it may have been the
 oxide of increased specific gravity, to which attention has
already been drawn +. In all these cases the affinity is sup
posed to be sufficiently strong to break up the atoms of a
body yielding to the slightest disturbance of its state of stati
 cal equilibrium. Two affinities are at play in these decompo
 sitions, viz. the attraction of the metallic oxide for oxygen
and that of the water for the same body; both these affini
ties resist the union, and therefore, elasticity coming into
operation, robs both oxides of the gas. The affinity causing
the decomposition is so slightly preponderating in its in
fluence, that a second cause coming into operation is quite
sufficient to alter the conditions under which it was originally
exerted, and to draw one of the elements of the body acted
upon beyond the sphere of its affinity.
    The balance of affinities in all such cases is so near that we
not unfrequently find apparently contradictory effects result
ing from their gratification. Thus the addition of oxide of
silver to peroxide of hydrogen expels oxygen from the latter,
but at the same time it is robbed of its own oxygen and re
duced to the metallic state.         In this case we have two feeble
compounds instead of one, with affinities very nearly balanced,
and with atoms so tense as to yield readily to the first dis
turbing cause. We can scarcely adopt as sufficient the ex
planation of Thenard and Mitscherlicht, that the reduction
is due to the elevation of temperature accompanying the de
composition, because even when that is lowered by the ad
dition of much water to the peroxide of hydrogen, the silver
still becomes metallic.                                                 *
    It is a point yet undetermined, whether a lower oxide is to
be considered as unity to a higher oxide, or whether all the
atoms of oxygen are held by equal attractions.                  We know
that tartaric acid is able to separate potash from nitric acid
in forming a bitartrate, and yet acetic acid is sufficient to re
move the second atom of potash from the neutral tartrate.
But in a bibasic acid, like tartaric acid, it may be either atom
of potash that is abstracted, and the superior affinity for the
remaining one may be owing to attractions resulting after
the expulsion of the first. Thus MnO2 may have its atoms
of oxygen distributed round the central nucleus Mn, and held
by equal attractions, and the stability of the red oxide pro
duced by its calcination does not show that it pre-existed

stronger when one of the elements which divided it was

unites and forms a salt; but when acting on carbonate of
silver, a certain quantity of oxygen also leaves the oxide
during the escape of carbonic acid, and metallic silver re
mainst. As Liebig f suggests, motion may aid this result;
but were this the only explanation, we should expect that
   * During the passage of this paper through the press, Mr. Brodie, in a
lecture at the Royal Institution, showed that peroxide of potassium reduces
chloride of silver, the two atoms of oxygen passing off in the gaseous state,
while chloride of potassium and metallic silver remain behind, a singular
decomposition, when the behaviour of potash is remembered. But the
action is strictly the same as that here described; the atoms of oxygen,
being liberated at the same time, are presented to the silver, which, dividing
its attractive force between them, is not able to overcome the influence of
elasticity of the oxygen and its own cohesion, and therefore remains in a
metallic state.

  silver would constantly be reduced during the action of other
  feeble acids on carbonate of silver. If, however, we suppose
  that the pyruvic acid, Cº. He Og, from its affinity for more
  oxygen, exerts an attraction for that element at the moment
  of the liberation of the carbonic acid, the decomposition
  would be similar to those we have already considered, espe
  cially if the previous view of the molecular constitution of
  salts be admitted. In that case the oxygen of the oxide being
  attached to that of the carbonic acid, will be made highly
  tense during the escape of the latter, and may therefore be
  detached by a very feeble force, its elasticity finally over
  coming the weak affinity. An extension of the explanation
  however strikes me as more probable, but it would be prema
  ture to insist upon it without being supported by experiments
  which I have not yet been able to conclude.
     The action of metals and of charcoal on peroxide of hydro
  gen may be explained by the same feeble affinity. Alkalies
  also, from their attraction for oxygen, as indicated both by
  their capability of uniting with more oxygen and by their
  basic power or disposition to attach themselves to a com
  pound behaving as an oxygenous or chlorous element, favour
  the decomposition of HO, while acids, on the other hand,
  render it more stable, perhaps, as Thenard himself suspected *,
  from there being an inferior oxide (H, Os?). In this instance
  the elasticity of the oxygen tends to conceal the play of affi
  nities by preventing combination.
     When the acting body is present in large quantity, or ex
  hibits an increased surface, the action goes on with propor
  tionate rapidity. Thus, when nitric acid is in contact with
  starch, the action is moderate until a certain quantity of per
  oxide of nitrogen has been evolved by decomposition, after
  which it proceeds with a violence difficult to control. The per
  oxide of nitrogen surrounding every particle of starch aids it
  in the decomposition of the nitric acid. That this is the real
  cause of the phaenomenon may be proved by the following
  simple experiment. Nitric acid is heated with starch to a tem
  perature at which the action has a tendency to commence but
  has not yet begun. A stream of NO, or NO, is then passed
  through the liquid, when action immediately begins with an
  activity proportionate to the quantity of gas added. The ele
  vation of temperature due to the progressive action influences
  the decomposition, by causing the atoms of nitric acid to be
  come more tense. Exactly the same accessory affinity is
  used by the manufacturer of oxymuriate of tin, when he
  adds a fragment of tin to the mixture of chloride of tin and

                   produced by Catalytic Bodies.                    205
nitric acid. The tin eliminating some nitric oxide quickens
the action, which commences with difficulty with pure nitric
acid; nitric oxide gas passed through the solution answers
the same purpose.
   This accessory affinity also enables oxide of copper or per
oxide of manganese to evolve copious streams of oxygen from
chlorate of potash in a state of fusion. The heat of fusion
decomposes the compound slowly, but on adding a body ha
ving an affinity for the element acted upon by the heat (oxy
gen), the decomposition proceeds with greatly increased ra
pidity. We cannot ascribe this action to the presentation of
points from which the gas may escape, as in the lowering of
the temperature of ebullition by particles of sand, because
silica has no influence in accelerating this decomposition*.
   In the examples previously given we have the decomposi
tions aided by the tendency of one of the bodies to assume
the elastic form. But when the body acted upon has two
elements, one of which is influenced by elasticity, the other
by cohesion, we find it peculiarly liable to be acted upon by
external agents. Persulphuret of hydrogen is a compound of
this class, and has been closely studied in its decompositions
by Thenardt. The same bodies which decompose peroxide
of hydrogen act catalytically upon this sulphuret. The de
composition cannot be due to points for the escape of gas, as
suggested by Liebigf, to explain the decomposition of per
oxide of hydrogen, because solutions of the alkalies act with
equal power. The sulphurets, especially those of the alkaline
metals, decompose it very readily. As in the case of per
oxide of hydrogen, the acids afford stability to its sulphur
analogue. In the view of acids given, they are supposed to
have become chlorous or electro-negative, representing and
behaving as oxygen, and therefore exerting no affinity, we
 should anticipate that they would not show any disposition
to break up an oxygenous compound or its analogue of sul
phur. Another instance of accessory affinity is seen in the
 nitrosulphates § ; the formula (RO, SO3 + NO2) given by Pe
louze to these compounds does not allow us to understand
 their decompositions, which however becomes intelligible if
 we view nitrosulphuric acid as nitric acid, in which the fifth
 atom of oxygen has been replaced by one of sulphur (RO,
 NO, S). In this acid we have two elements—the nitrogen
 and the sulphur—sharing the oxygen, their mutual affinities
 being nearly balanced when the acid is united with an al

kali, although in a free state, the sulphur exhibits a superior
affinity, as shown by the decomposition which then results,
NOS = NO + SOs. Now any substance which acts as an
accessory to the sulphur by aiding the withdrawal of oxygen
from the nitrogen decomposes it. This instability is especially
exhibited in NH4O, NO.S.; the 3 atoms of hydrogen of the
ammonia in their attraction for oxygen introducing another
affinity, which accelerates decomposition. And, in fact, we
do find that the same agents which so readily decompose the
oxygenous compounds, chloride of lime and peroxide of hy
drogen, do equally cause the disruption of nitrosulphate of
ammonia into protoxide of nitrogen and sulphate of ammonia.
Alkalies are an exception to this rule, as they render the ni
trosulphates more stable, while they make the peroxide of hy
drogen prone to decomposition; but the cases are different,
the latter substance having none of the properties of an acid.
    The basic character of alkalies, defined as their power of
uniting with more oxygen, or with an acid playing the part
of an oxygenous element, is illustrated by several curious
decompositions. Thus, though grape-sugar reduces sulphate
of copper with ease, cane-sugar alone does not readily do so,
but when mixed with potash and boiled with the salt, sub
oxide of copper is produced, as in the mode of preparation
of that oxide suggested by Boettger*, or the reduction of
chloride of silver as proposed by Levolt. Here the disposi
tion of the organic matter to unite with oxygen is able to
gratify itself when aided by the accessory affinity of the pot
ash for oxygen. That the potash in this state acts by aiding
the oxidation, is seen by heating Cu2O with a solution of
caustic potash, exposed to the air, when it oxidizes much
more rapidly than when boiled with water alonef. When
suboxide of copper is dissolved in ammonia it oxidizes with
surprising rapidity. In this instance the hydrogen of the
ammonia adds to its disposition as an alkali to absorb oxy
gen. The quick oxidation is not merely due to the fact of

third, common water, taking care that the same volume of each fluid is
added. The whole are now placed on a sand-bath, so as to be exposed to
equal temperatures, and stirred occasionally. The suboxide of copper in
the basin containing chloride of manganese oxidizes very rapidly; that in
contact with the potash more slowly; and that with simple water is scarcely
effected when both the others have lost their red colour. These actions are
strictly in accordance with theory.

the suboxide being in a state of solution, because the soluble
salts of the suboxide do not oxidize with such extraordinary
ease, nor is it to be expected that they should, if we admit that
the acid itself plays the part of oxygen. The accessory affi
nity of alkalies for oxygen is exhibited in many other cases of
chemical action. Thus, colouring matters, such as deoxidized
logwood, Brazil-wood, peach-wood, japan, fustic and catechu
are oxidized more rapidly in contact with alkalies than in
water alone; and various dyeing principles, such as orcine and
erythrine, absorb oxygen with great avidity in the presence of
ammonia. Sugar may be boiled with potash without de
composition, but when air is admitted, formic, melassic, and
glucic acids are produced. Hydruret of benzyle when ex
posed to air gradually absorbs oxygen and passes into benzoic
acid, but in contact with potash this absorption is very much
accelerated. The rapid decomposition of the gallates and of
hematine in the presence of free alkali and air is a phaenome
non of the same kind. In fact, numberless instances of this
catalytic action of the alkalies are known to chemists.
   We find the influence of an accessory oxidation in many
cases of chemical union. Thus Campbell has shown * that
the transformation of cyanide of potassium into cyanate of
potash is much accelerated by the presence of the iron in yellow
prussiate of potash, the iron being converted into oxide during
the transformation. Here the iron plays the part of the
protoxide of manganese in the cases of oxidation already re
ferred to, or it perhaps bears a more direct relation to the
action of lead in communicating a tendency to the base metals
to seize oxygen during the process of cupellation. The in
fluence exerted by peroxide of manganese in first converting
cyanide of potassium into cyanate of potash and afterwards
into the carbonate of that base, is another instance of accessory
affinity; for only a portion of the oxygen is derived from the
 oxide employed. The solution of an alloy of silver and pla
 tinum in nitric acid may be supposed to be a similar affinity,
 It is not necessary to believe that this is a case proving the
 communication of intestine motion to the atoms of platinum,
 by which it acquires the power of decomposing nitric acidt ;
 for an equally simple explanation is given by assuming that
 the united affinities of platinum and silver are able to decom
 pose nitric acid, both these affinities acting in one direction
 at the same time, and enabling the platinum to dissolve. We
 have only to suppose that the atoms of nitric acid are placed
 by the silver in a state of such tension that the platinum can

 now seize oxygen, which it could not do from the nitric acid
 when in a less tense state. The quartation of gold is ob
 viously a phaenomenon of the same kind. In these instances
 the interposing silver much reduces the cohesive or aggregative
 force of the platinum or gold, which opposes so strongly the
 action of nitric acid upon them. But when we have every
 atom of platinum or of gold separated by one of silver, great
 facility is given to the nitric acid to act upon these metals,
 especially when the silver at the same time aids them by its
 assistant affinity.
    We have seen, in the consideration of the previous in
 stances of catalysis, that the play of affinities was occasionally
 so nearly balanced, that a second disturbing cause determined
 the direction of the action.        In the case of non-accendi
ble phosphuretted hydrogen, the addition of another oxi
 dizable body, NOA, decided the union of oxygen with the gas.
 In accendible phosphuretted hydrogen the compound PH2
played the same part. When the accessory agent is present
in small quantity, the preponderating affinity of the body
 acted upon shows itself in the result.               But, as the ac
tion is due to two affinities nearly equal in amount, it is easy
to conceive that the increased quantity of the accessory agent
may exactly balance affinities, and that the catalytic phaeno
menon will be prevented. Thus one-twentieth of the volume
of binoxide of nitrogen, according to Graham *, added to ac
cendible phosphuretted hydrogen, does not deprive it of in
flammability, the bubbles of gas escaping into the air with a
kind of explosion, although one-tenth volume of the same
gas altogether prevents the accendibility. This nitric oxide,
when pure, does not, like protoxide of nitrogen, render phos
phuretted hydrogen spontaneously inflammable, the reason
obviously being that its own affinity for oxygen is more
powerful than that of the phosphuretted hydrogen. When
added however in such small proportion to the accendible
gas that the foreign constituent in it preponderates, then it
becomes an accessory to the oxidation, though an increase of
the quantity renders it more powerful, and prevents accendi
bility by itself seizing oxygen. Thus also larger volumes of
gas, having an affinity for oxygen, but incapable like NO, of
gratifying that desire under ordinary circumstances, may
exactly balance the feeble affinity of the foreign accessory
body and prevent oxidation. Five volumes of hydrogen,
2 volumes of carbonic acid, 1 volume of olefiant gas, and
1 volume sulphuretted hydrogen, deprive 1 volume of phos

phuretted hydrogen of its spontaneous inflammability*. The
very conception of a catalytic agent, on the view adopted,
implies the exertion of an affinity, which is passed over or
added to that of the body acted upon.             If, therefore, a third
body claim this added affinity, the increase of power being
divided, may be insufficient to exert the force which it did
when wholly applied to aid the affinity of one body. It may
be this balancing of affinities which prevents the action of
platinum on a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen. The plati
num by its surface affinity condenses oxygen, and presenting
it to hydrogen in a condensed form produces union. But in
the presence of small quantities of certain oxidizable gases,
such as sulphuretted hydrogen, carbonic oxide, and olefiant
gases f, it ceases to exert this action, the assumption in this
case being that the affinity of the added gases for oxygen
balances that of hydrogen for the same gas.                         -
   This balancing of affinities may account for several phaeno
mena otherwise inexplicable. On the decay of vegetable
mould we find the hydrogen constantly diminishing in quan
tity until a certain period of decomposition, when the affinity
of the carbon of the humus for its hydrogen balances the
affinity of the surrounding oxygen. It seems to be the same
balancing of affinities which renders corrosive sublimate so
antiseptic in its properties; but, in this case, the balance re
sults from the affinity of the second atom of chlorine in the
bichloride of mercury for the hydrogen of the organic sub
stance, thus preventing its union with oxygen. It is probable
that the same affinity of chlorine for hydrogen causes turpen
tine and the volatile oils to act catalytically in exploding chlo
ride of nitrogen. The chlorine attracted by the hydrogen of
these substances is drawn without the sphere of its attraction
for nitrogen, and a disruption of the elements consequently
ensues, compounds such as this resting on the very verge of
separation between physical and chemical attraction. The
antiseptic action of corrosive sublimate is very different from
that exerted by sulphurous acid and sulphate of iron, these
bodies acting by their superior affinity for oxygen, and neu
tralizing the power of the ferments or accessory oxidizers
present in the organic body.
   There is no difficulty in applying these notions of catalysis
to organic compounds, which from the complexity of their

the oxidation of phosphorus in the air is probably another instance of this
balancing of affinities.

molecules are peculiarly liable to change. If it once be ad
mitted that an assisting affinity may exist in the sense defined
in the present paper, then we see the same cause operating
upon organic as well as inorganic molecules. When nitric
acid acts on oxalic acid or starch, an inorganic body (a pro
tosalt of manganese) lowers the temperature necessary for
the oxidation, and exerts its influence until all the starch
is converted into carbonic acid, being equally efficacious
on the addition of more nitric acid and starch.                    Here the
body acting as an assistant remains unchanged, and there
fore continues its action ad infinitum, rendering it impossible
to prepare oxalic acid from nitric acid and starch or sugar,
carbonic acid being the only product”. Had the assistant
oxidizer passed from solution during the progress of the oxida
tion, it could not of course continue its favourable effect, and
a new portion of it must have been added. Here the inor
ganic salt enables the sugar to oxidize itself from the sur
rounding medium just as yeast does, the only difference being
that the yeast itself suffers change, and therefore can only
continue its action for a limited period. It is exactly in the
same condition as a mixture of nitric acid and binoxide of
nitrogen made to act on protochloride of tin. A small portion
of the latter added to such a mixture is oxidized, but when
the solution is heated until all the NO, is expelled, oxidation
does not ensue on the addition of a new portion at the same
low temperature as before. Now Saussure and Colin have
shown that yeast only induces fermentation when it is in a
position to absorb oxygen. It acts therefore strictly as bin
oxide of nitrogen, or a protosalt of manganese, in the previous
instances, by adding its affinity for oxygen to that of the
sugar, the added affinities of both completing the union. The
only difference between these two decompositions is, that in
one case the oxidizing agent is nitric acid, in the other it is
water.     The composition of sugar shows it to contain the
elements of alcohol and carbonic acid minus an atom of water.
In such a compound we have the affinity of carbon for hy
drogen and of carbon for oxygen. The yeast by its nitrogen
also exerts an affinity for hydrogen, and by its carbon for
oxygen. The united affinities of the sugar and of the yeast
acting upon water decompose it, its elements on their libera
tion being shared by the carbon of the sugar, for which it
may be supposed to have the strongest affinities, Cls Hu On
  • In this it resembles the action of oxalic acid in converting an unlimited
quantity of oxamide into oxalate of ammonia, with this difference, that the
oxalic acid, which causes the change, may not be the same, but a regene
rated portion, while the salt of manganese always remains unchanged.

+HO=4CO2+2 (C. He O.). To show the exact similarity
of the two processes of oxidation when the assisting body is
either organic or inorganic, I may cite the curious manufac
turing process for oxidizing oils in the method of dyeing
Turkey-red used in this country, and included in Mercer's
patent for that colour. It consists in oxidizing oils by blow
ing hot air through them, the oils being in contact with a
solution of a salt of copper or of bran; the contact of either
of these solutions is found very materially to accelerate the
oxidation. The catalytic action of oxide of copper in evolving
oxygen from hypochlorite of lime was adduced as showing its
affinity for more oxygen, and this feeble affinity is well known
and used empirically by all calico-printers, who are in the con
stant habit of mixing a salt of copper with their colours for
the purpose of ageing them more speedily; in other words, of
causing them to unite with oxygen. This also is the assisting
cause in Mercer’s process for oxidizing oils; bran in solution
answers the same purpose from its affinity for oxygen. The
addition of common salt or muriate of ammonia favours the
oxidation in all the cases referred to, the oxidation proceeding
much more quickly in their presence. No sub-chloride is
ever formed, the action being purely catalytic, and probably
depending on the conversion of the salt of copper into a
chloride, the chlorine of which may be supposed to exert
a slight affinity for the hydrogen of the compound, thus
withdrawing it somewhat from the sphere of its own special
attractions in the body; the copper now aiding the chlorine,
delivers the hydrogen more easily into the power of the oxy
gen of the atmosphere. It is therefore immaterial whether
the body exercising the assistant affinity be organic or inor
ganic, if the conditions be favourable to the exercise of this
influence. The action of a body in acetous fermentation on
the transformation of brandy into vinegar must be recognised
as a phaenomenon of a like kind. We know that brandy may
trickle without change over a large surface of wood shavings,
through which air circulates at the heat of the human body,
ºut that it is quickly converted into vinegar if brandy in the
act of oxidation be mixed with it.      Here the added ferment
exerts its assisting affinity in precisely the same way as the
3alt of copper, when it aids the oxidation of oils or colours,
or as protonitrate of manganese or peroxide of nitrogen
during the oxidation of starch. The conversion of hydrogen
and oxygen into water by the action of fermenting silk, cot
ton, or woody fibre, as observed by Saussure, is obviously a
phaenomenon of the same kind, and can only be exerted
slowly and in the    immedia",   vicinity of the assisting oxidi

union of these two gases.                       -
   In these cases we must admit that the action is indepen
dent of a state of intestine motion of the atoms of one com
pound molecule imparted to those of another, or, if we do not
allow this, we must create two new powers and separate de
compositions caused by inorganic bodies from those produced
by organic compounds, although all the phaenomena of the
decomposition show them to belong to one category.
   In a body in a state of such incessant change as the blood
of living animals, it would naturally be expected that an added
agency, such as that described, would render it prone to
abnormal actions and oxidations, and in fact we do recognise
by all the recent progress in the study of public hygeine
that the addition of any oxidizing miasm or putrid matter
to the blood does produce those changes which are known
by their results in the different forms of disease. These and
other catalytic agents no doubt exercise most important in
fluence on the processes of animal life and on the action of
medicaments on the system, but it would be foreign to the
object of this paper to examine them in detail.
   The limits of a paper such as this compel me to avoid
including many other instances of catalytic decompositions
which come under this explanation, or of drawing special
attention to those which cannot be included in the present
state of our knowledge. Thus diastase, acting on starch,
converts it into sugar, but we have so little knowledge of
the composition or properties of the first body, that it would
be unwarrantable to embrace a case such as this.            But
in analogous changes produced by bodies which are under
stood, the same power is recognised. Sulphuric acid in
converting starch into grape-sugar offers an example of
combination which may fairly be examined by the same
method employed in investigating other decompositions.
 Graham has shown” that heat is evolved even on the addi
tion of the 48th atomic proportion of water to sulphuric acid,
or, in other words, that the affinity of that acid for water is
not gratified as long as our instruments of research can follow
the change. This is merely another proof of the doctrine
with which I started, that there is no evidence of such a
complete gratification of affinity as ever to merge entirely the
attractions of the elements of any body. In the case referred
to, the development of heat on each successive addition
proves that the water is condensed on entering into union
with the acid. When the heat of the sulphuric acid is arti

ficially increased, this compound is broken up, for distil
lation drives off the water and concentrates the acid.        Now
when starch is in the presence of this weak combination
of sulphuric acid and water, at a temperature at which the
latter is just able to exert its affinity and again have it de
stroyed by heat, it is not at all extravagant to suppose that
the starch may seize the water in its nascent state at the mo
ment of expulsion, or even that it may be able to unite with
the last atoms of the series of acid and water when presented
in that condensed state, although it cannot do so when the
water is free and not nascent. Any such union would explain
the transformation of starch into grape-sugar, the change
merely being in the acquisition of water, Cia Hio Olo-H4HO
=Cls Hia Ola. The action here is not the same, but the very
reverse of that which ensues in the preparation of aether. In
the one case the sulphuric acid abstracts water, in the other
it is the means of adding it, and the difference of the action
depends on the relative strength of the acids employed.
Without at all giving an opinion in favour of the necessity
for the formation of sulphovinic acid, as supposed by Liebigº,
or as to its not being an essential condition, as argued by
Mitscherlicht, the final result is simply of the order now
under consideration. In this decomposition the sulphuric or
phosphoric acid is so strong that it combines with the water
instead of yielding it, and the elevation of temperature essen
tial to the change may either be due to the formation and
after decomposition of sulphovinic acid, or it may be simply
owing to the necessity of rendering the molecule of alcohol
tense by heat, the elasticity of the aether and water both
tending to break up the hydrate, the decomposition of which
is determined by the presence of the strong acid now also
aiding and abstracting the water. The final result is certainly
purely catalytic in whatever light it is considered, although
there may be more than one step in the process.
   In conclusion, facts have been brought forward to show
that there is at least as much probability in the view that the
catalytic force is merely a modified form of chemical affinity
exerted under peculiar conditions, as there is in ascribing it
to an unknown power, or to the communication of an intes
tine motion to the atoms of a complex molecule.           Numerous
cases have been cited in which the action results when the
assisting or catalytic body is not in a state of change, and
attempts have been made to prove by new experiments that
the catalytic body exercises its peculiar power by acting in
            * Geiger's Pharmacie, vol. ii. p. 711 et seq.

the same direction as the body decomposing or entering into
union, but under conditions in which its own affinity cannot
always be gratified. The catalytic body is therefore a sub
stance which acts by adding its own affinity to that of an

decomposition under certain circumstances, without being
powerful enough to overcome new conditions, such as elasti
city and cohesion, which occasionally intervene and alter the
expected result.
   At the same time the theory is far from being fully proved;
but if I have succeeded in rendering probable that the ca
talytic force is only chemical affinity recognised under an
aspect which chemists have not been accustomed to view it,
and exerted under conditions which can only be developed
by close attention to details, it will not have been useless to
direct increased study to this interesting class of phaenomena.
XXXVI. On Guatermions; or on a New System of Imaginaries
   in Algebra. By Professor Sir WILLIAM RowAN HAMILTON,

                  [Continued from vol. xxx. p. 461.]
33.  FOR      the sake of those mathematical readers who are
          familiar with the method of co-ordinates, and not with
the method of quaternions, the writer will here offer an inves
tigation, by the former method, of that general property of
the ellipsoid to which he was conducted by the latter ºo::
and of which an account was given in a recent Number of
this Magazine (for June 1847).
   Let & y 2 denote, as usual, the three rectangular co-ordi
nates of a point, and let us introduce two real functions of
these three co-ordinates, and of six arbitrary but real con
stants, l m n l'm'n', which functions shall be denoted by u and
v, and shall be determined by the two following relations:
                 w(ll' +mm'+nn')=l'a' +m'y--n's;
    v'(ll 4-mm'+nn')*=(ly—ma)*4-(mz—ny)*+(nz—lz)”;
then the equation
                         u°+vº- 1 . . . . . . . . (1.)
will denote (as received principles suffice to show) that the
curved surface which is the locus of the point a y z is an ellip
soid, having its centre at the origin of co-ordinates; and con
versely this equation u’--vº-1 may represent any such ellip

  soid, by a suitable choice of the six real constants l m n l'm n'.
  At the same time the equation
                                  w?= 1
  will represent a system of two       P. planes, which       touch
  the ellipsoid at the extremities of the diameter denoted by the
 equation
                               v=0;                         -
 and this diameter will be the axis of revolution of a certain
 circumscribed cylinder, namely of the cylinder denoted by
 the equation
                               w°= 1;
 the equation of the plane of the ellipse of contact, along which
 this circular cylinder envelopes the ellipsoid, being, in the
 same notation,
                               tº - 0:           -
 all which may be inferred from ordinary principles, and agrees
 with what was remarked in the 29th article of this paper,
    34. This being premised, let us next introduce three new
constants, p, q, r, depending on the six former constants by
 the three relations
                 2p=l-Fl', 24= m + m, 2r-n + n’.
 We shall then have
         l'a' + my + n’z=2(pa + q9+rg)–(la + my + m2);
and the equation (1.) of the ellipsoid will become
                        (ll'+mm'+nn')”
                     =(l?--m” + n°)(a”--y” + 2*)
                      –4(la + my--nz)(pa +qy-Fr2)

          =(w”--y” + 2*){(l—a')*-i- (m-y)*--(n-2')*},
if we introduce three new variables, a ', y', 2', depending on
the three old variables w, y, z, or rather on their ratios, and
on the three new constants p, q, r, by the conditions,
                   * – º – 2' 2(pa-Fºy-Frº)
                    * Ty Tz T w”-Ey?--z”
    These three last equations give, by elimination of the two
ratios of ar, y, z, the relation
                   *4-y”4-gº-2(pa'+q/+rz');
the new variables a', y', 2' are therefore co-ordinates of a new
point, which has for its locus a certain spheric surface, passing
through the centre of the ellipsoid; and the same new point

  216         Sir W. Rowan Hamilton on Quaternions.
  is evidently contained on the radius vector drawn from that
  centre of the ellipsoid to the point a y 2, or on that radius
  vector prolonged. We see, also, that the length of this radius
  vector of the ellipsoid, or the distance of the point a y z from
  the origin of the co-ordinates, is inversely proportional to the
  distance of the new point a' y' z' of the spheric surface from
  the point l m n, which latter is a certain fixed point upon the
  surface of the ellipsoid. This result gives already an easy
  and elementary mode of generating the latter surface, which
  may however be reduced to a still greater degree of simplicity
  by continuing the analysis as follows.
      35. Let the straight line which connects the two points
  a' y' 2 and l m n be prolonged, if necessary, so as to cut the
  same spheric surface again in another point w" y" 2"; we shall
  then have the equation
                    a'ºs-y”4-2”–2(pa"+qy'--rz"),
  from which the new co-ordinates a!", y", 2" may be eliminated
  by substituting the expressions
       a"=l-F t|a'—l), y'- m +t(y'—m), 2" = n+t(2'—n);
  and the root that is equal to unity is then to be rejected, in
   the resulting quadratic for t. Taking therefore for t the pro
  duct of the roots of that quadratic, we find
                     f _ !?--m?--n”–2(lp-H mq+ nr).
                       T (r-1)2+(y–m)*-i- (2–n)”
   therefore also, by the last article,
                     t=              a?--y”--s”          -
                       T l?--m”--nº–2(lp + mg--nr)?
   consequently

º                      T(z+l)?-F(y–m)2+(2–n)”

      Denoting by A, B, C, the three fixed points of which the
   co-ordinates are respectively (0, 0, 0), (l, m, n), (p, q, r); and
   by D, D, E, the three variable points of which the co-ordinates
   are (a', y', 2'), (a", y'', 2"), (a, y, z); A BE D' may be regarded
   as a plane quadrilateral, of which the diagonals AE and BD'
   intersect each other in a point D on a fixed spheric sur
    face, which has its centre at C, and passes through A and D';
    so that one side D'A of the quadrilateral, adjacent to the fixed
    side AB, is a chord of this fixed sphere. And the equation (2.)
    expresses that the other side BE of the same plane quadrilateral,
    adjacent to the same fived side AB, is a chord of a fired ellipsoid,

            Sir W. Rowan Hamilton on Quaternions,                        217
if the two diagonals AE, BD' of the quadrilateral be equally long;
so that a general and characteristic property of the ellipsoid,
sufficient for the construction of that surface, and for the in
vestigation of all its properties, is included in the remarkably
simple and eminently geometrical formula
                               AE= BD'; . . . . . . . (3.)
the locus of the point E being an ellipsoid, which passes
through B, and has its centre at A, when this condition is
satisfied.
    This formula (3.), which has already been printed in this
Magazine as the equation (10.) of article 30 of this paper, may
therefore be deduced, as above, from generally admitted prin
ciples, by the Cartesian method of co-ordinates; although it
had not been known to geometers, so far as the present writer
has hitherto been able to ascertain, until he was led to it, in
the summer of 1846*, by an entirely different method; namely
by applying his calculus of quaternions to the discussion of
one of those new formst for the equations of central surfaces
of the second order, which he had communicated to the Royal
 Irish Academy in December 1845.
    36. As an example (already alluded to in the 32nd article
of this paper) of the geometrical employment of the formula
 (3.), or of the equality which it expresses as existing between
the lengths of the two diagonals of a certain plane quadrilateral
connected with that new construction of the ellipsoid to which
the writer was thus led by quaternions, let us now propose to
investigate geometrically, by the help of that equality of dia
gonals, the difference of the squares of the reciprocals of the
greatest and least semi-diameters of any plane and diametral
 section of an ellipsoid (with three unequal axes). Conceive
 then that the ellipsoid, and the auxiliary sphere employed in
 the above-mentioned construction, are both cut by a plane AB'c',
 on which B' and c are the orthogonal projections of the fixed
 points B and c; the auxiliary point D may thus be conceived
 to move on the circumference of a circle, which passes through
 A, and has its centre at c'; and since AE, being equal in length
   * See the Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy.
   t In reprinting one of those new forms, namely the following quater
nion form of the equation of the ellipsoid:
                           (26-Fe2)*—(36—63)*=1,
a slight mistake of the press occurred at p. 459, vol. xxx. of this Magazine,
which however, with the assistance there given by the context, can scarcely
have embarrassed the reader. In the preceding page, for a hyperboloid of
one sheet, touching the same cylinder in the same sheet, should have been
printed, . . . . in the same ellipse.

  218       Sir W. Rowan Hamilton on Quaternions.
 to BD' (because these are the two equal diagonals of the qua
 drilateral in the construction), must vary inversely as BD (by
 an elementary property of the sphere), we are to seek the
 difference of the squares of the extreme values of BD, or of
 BD, because the square of the perpendicular BB' is constant
 for the section. But the longest and shortest straight lines,
 B'Di, B'Da, which can thus be drawn to the auxiliary circle
 round C, from the fixed point B' in its plane, are those drawn
 to the extremities of that diameter D, CD, of this circle which
 passes through or tends towards B'; so that the four points
 D, C, D, B' are on one straight line, and the difference of the
 squares of B'Di, B'D., is equal to four times the rectangle
 under B'C' and CD, or under B'C' and CA. We see therefore
 that the shortest and longest semi-diameters AEI, AE, of the
 diametral section of the ellipsoid, are perpendicular to each
 other, because (by the construction above-mentioned)they coin
 cide in their directions respectively with the two supplementary
 chords AD, AD2 of the section of the auxiliary sphere, and
 an angle in a semicircle is a right angle; and at the same time
 we see also that the difference of the squares of the reciprocals
 of these two rectangular semiaxes of a diametral section of the
 ellipsoid varies, in passing from one such section to another,
 proportionally to the rectangle under the projections, B'C' and
 CA, of the two fixed lines BC, CA, on the plane of the vari
 able section. The difference of the squares of these recipro
cals of the semi-axes of a section therefore varies (as indeed it
is well-known to do) proportionally to the product of the sines
of the inclinations of the plane of the section to two fixed dia
metral planes, which cut the ellipsoid in circles; and we see
that the normals to these two latter or cyclic planes have
precisely the directions of the sides BC, CA of the generating
triangle ABC, which has for its corners the three fixed points
employed in the foregoing construction: so that the auxiliary
and diacentric sphere, employed in the same construction,
touches one of those two cyclic planes at the centre A of the
ellipsoid. If we take, as we are allowed to do, the point B
external to this sphere, then the distance BC of this external
point B from the centre C of the sphere is (by the construc
tion) the semisum of the greatest and least semiaxes of the
ellipsoid, while the radius CA of the sphere is the semidiffer
ence of the same two semiaxes: and (by the same construc
tion) these greatest and least semiaxes of the ellipsoid, or
their prolongations, intersect the surface of the same diacen
tric sphere in points which are respectively situated on the
finite straight line BC itself, and on the prolongation of that
line. The remaining side AB of the same fixed or generating

                  Notices respecting New Books.                  219
triangle ABC is a semidiameter of the ellipsoid, drawn in the
direction of the axis of one of the two circumscribed cylinders
of revolution; a property which was mentioned in the 32nd
article, and which may be seen to hold good, not only from
the recent analysis conducted by the Cartesian method, but
also and more simply from the geometrical consideration that
the constant rectangle under the two straight lines BD and
AE, in the construction, exceeds the double area of the triangle
ABE, and therefore exceeds the rectangle under the fixed
line AB and the perpendicular let fall thereon from the varia
ble point E of the ellipsoid, except at the limit where the
angle ADB is right; which last condition determines a cir
cular locus for D, and an elliptic locus for E, namely that
ellipse of contact along which a cylinder of revolution round
AB envelopes the ellipsoid, and i. here presents itself as a
section of the cylinder by a plane. The radius of this cylinder
is equal to the line BG, if G be the point of intersection, di
stinct from A, of the side AB of the generating triangle with
the surface of the diacentric sphere; which line BG is also
easily shown, on similar geometrical principles, as a conse
quence of the same construction, to be equal to the common
radius of the two circular sections, or to the mean semiaxis
of the ellipsoid, which is perpendicular to the greatest and the
least. Hence also the side AB of the generating triangle is,
in length, a fourth proportional to the three semiaxes, that
is to the mean, the least, and the greatest, or to the mean, the
greatest, and the least, of the three principal and rectangular
semidiameters of the ellipsoid.

Notice of a Memoir on Meteors of various sorts. By T.I. M. ForsTER,
                   F.R.A.S., &c,    Bruges, 1846.
Eººp                 in observing and in treating of these phaeno
     mena, Dr. Forster refers his readers to his former communica
tions of them, and to the numerous articles in the Royal Society’s
Transactions, as well as in the Gentleman's and Philosophical Ma
gazines.
   He carefully examines the theory of phosphorescent jets of gas
rising unperceived while traversing the low and damp strata of the
atmosphere, but becoming ignited as soon as they reach a sufficiently
dry stratum. The ignition is then supposed to run down the column
of gas, and reveal the several bends it had been subjected to by
various currents of wind. The occasional explosions may be ex
plained by supposing the running fire to reach a spot overabounding
in hydrogen, instances not unfrequent after heavy rains.

  220                Notices respecting New Books.
     It was not till the 10th of August 1811 that the idea of their
  periodicity occurred to Dr. Forster, when he and his father counted
  some hundreds, and by their journal perceived their recurrence on
  that same day. Indeed, in copying a curious old manuscript calen
  dar, he found the 10th and 18th of August called stellibunda and
 meterodes; but he acknowledges their frequency at all times and
 in all places.
     Inclined to assign them a gaseous origin, our author has yet, in
 deference to the learned men who differed from him, endeavoured to
 relate fairly the various arguments in favour of their several theories.
    Aristotle regarded meteors as arising from exhalations denoting
 an approaching change of weather. Theophrastus thought they pro
 gnosticated wind from the quarter towards which they rushed. And
 Aratus agreed with him, especially if they left long lingering tails,
 in which he was imitated by Virgil.      Lucan in his Pharsalia rather
 confounds meteors with the fixed stars.    Homer compares the descent
 of Minerva to the rush of a meteor.
    Passing over the middle ages, when meteors were feared as indica
 tions of Divine anger, we find that in the seventeenth century electri
 city began to be suspected, and was supported by the highest names
 of that aera. Then the magnificent meteor of the 18th of August 1783
brought out the elaborate paper by Dr. Blagden in the Philosophical
 Transactions for the following year. As to their velocity, it varies
 so much that this element cannot suffice to decide from what height
 they fall. The meteor above alluded to moved at only six miles per
 second when at about ninety miles above our heads. Cavallo esti
mated its diameter at 3200 feet, and its elevation at 560 miles.     Cer
 tainly the explosion not being heard for ten minutes after it was
seen is a sufficient proof of its distance.  The general electric state
 of the atmosphere that year over half the globe is well known, by
 the remarks made in consequence of the violent earthquakes that
 occurred.
    In support of the theory that meteors are occasioned by the igni
 tion of columns of inflammable gas, Dr. Forster mentions the ignis
fatuus, and the flitting lights that are seen in May on cabbages.
 Many naturalists regard meteors as one of the various phaenomena
 attributable to electricity, and some expected to find that they chiefly
 pointed to the magnetic pole.
    Many roofs of thatch have been ignited by the fall of meteors
 upon them, and this must be the explanation of towns recorded to
 have been burnt by fire from heaven. The explosion of the meteor
 of the 25th of September 1846, was heard a few seconds after it was
 seen : but if, instead of the ambiguous term a few, spectators would
 count slowly, they would afford a much nearer approach to the true
 time elapsed, especially if they would afterwards count at the same
 rate when they can compare with a seconds watch, or with a clock.
 (A.S.) The tail of that meteor was larger than usual, and lasted longer,
some persons stating fifty seconds, others some minutes. More
precise details are requisite. It was at first whitish, then purplish,
and lastly red, when it became curved, and faded in a serpentine

                   Notices respecting New Books.                    221
form. This last phaenomenon was observed in another instance
about twenty years since. Even the luminous arc of the 28th of
September 1828 might, our author thinks, be a still more dilatory
tail of a meteor that had shot across our hemisphere just before
sunset, and for that reason was not perceived.           In July 1799
Dr. Forster's father saw a meteor cross the sky from south to
north, then return southward, and finally bend to the north-west.
Another peculiarity is that of rising in the sky instead of descending,
which has been reported as occurring sometimes near the equator,
where they are very numerous. And Dr. Forster himself saw a
whitish globe stationary for two seconds, and then turn a fine red.
   A shower of small meteors is recorded to have occurred on the 25th
of April 1095; and Dr. Forster saw an approximation to this on a
bright winter night in 1832, inasmuch as the whole firmament was
in a glow from an immense number of very fine luminous tails nearly
parallel from E.N.E. to W.S.W. They might deserve the name
rather of streaks, no heads being visible. The duration of each might
not exceed a second, but the phaenomenon altogether lasted a quarter
of an hour and then ceased suddenly. And in November 1830 he
saw a similar multiplicity of little streaks, but crossed by others at
right angles. Another peculiarity was described by a clergyman
near Epping, that of seeing a meteor, after descending to the earth,
 undergo a sort of reverberation by rising in an oblique direction,
 and then break into sparks.
    Among the numerous authors who have treated of this subject,
 perhaps M. Quetelet's catalogue is the most complete, with the ex
 ception of his omitting the interesting meteor of 1783. M. Arago
 and M. Biot have also treated the subject ably.
    A copious journal of meteors has been kept in Dr. Forster's family
from 1767, but no periodicity was suspected till the 10th of August
 1811; though then, on looking back through the journal, it was per
 ceived that there had been a great preponderance in the Novembers
 ever since 1799, and in the Augusts from 1779. When employed a
 few years after to construct perennial calendars, Dr. Forster indicated
 a number of meteors as a phaenomenon to be expected on the 10th of
 August.
   This became confirmed in 1831 by other observers, and they added
the second period of the 13th of November. M. Quetelet now adds
 April and December, while others suggest January, May, June and
 July. He thinks their usual height in the atmosphere is from six
 teen to twenty leagues or more, though they are occasionally seen
 slanting very near the ground. The most numerous sort, distin
 guished by the name of étoiles filantes, may revolve in trajectories
 by swarms, forming a belt round the sun, which we have occasionally
 to traverse. Then, owing to the earth's motion, these luminous
 corpuscles would naturally, as they have been observed to do, appear
 to “ have their point of divergence towards (3 Camelop. in August,
 and towards v Leonis in November, agreeing with our annual mo
tion in the ecliptic.” According to the known laws of optics, the
swarm would seem to separate in radii as we neared them, and,

222                          Royal Society.
owing to the compound velocities, seem to tend from N.E. to
S.W.
   Although meteors differ very much from each other in some in
stances, it is very difficult to classify them; but an abundance of
them seems connected with a change of weather, and especially with
cirrostratus and cirrocumulus clouds. As to their direction, though
they sometimes converge towards one point, they rush at others
towards every point of the compass. He therefore wavers only be
tween an electric and a gaseous origin, quoting electric experiments
referred to in England by the Abbé Bertholon, and gaseous ones by
Constable, as having produced excellent imitations.
   In the terrible night of the 7th of July 1834, a crowd of nimbi
collected around Vesuvius about 9 o'clock, shooting their lightnings
down towards the mountain accompanied by rain and hail. The
lightning was sometimes bluish and sometimes reddish.
   As to the periodicity of meteors, Dr. Forster finds that there are
decided changes in the electrometers also on the 10th of August and
13th of November; and the greatest number he ever saw fell on the
10th of August 1811, just after a violent storm; but when a storm
has happened some time before, the meteors are fewer at the two
periods observed. Also if one or more large meteors occur, there
are no small ones afterwards for a proportionate time, as if the atmo
sphere had been cleared of the requisite material. Also it may be
remarked in general, that the winter and the higher latitudes are
least prolific of them.
   Fiery balls do not often occur, but are very powerful. Thus the
one seen in France and in England the 17th of July 1771, must
have been at an elevation of fifty-four miles, and the report of its
explosion was not heard till two minutes after its occurrence, like
the rolling of thunder; but the observatory windows at Paris were
“ébranlées.” It appeared larger and brighter than the D, and its
swiftness was estimated at twenty-four miles per second.
   From the quickly-increasing rarity of our atmosphere, Arbuthnot
thinks that at the height of sixty miles (the estimated height of the
meteor in 1718) the air is 30,000 times purer than on the level of
the sea. Yet Pringle estimated the height of the meteor of 1738 to
have been ninety miles. The diameter of some globes has been
estimated at 1% mile.

   After premising an account of the views of several eminent phy
siologists, and in particular those promulgated by Haller, the author
shows that they resolve themselves into the general opinion that the
scalene or other muscles of the neck fix the first rib, in order to
enable the two sets of intercostal muscles to act either separately or
conjointly, as inspiratory or expiratory muscles. He then proceeds
to state the proofs that the intercostal muscles possess an action
which is independent of any other muscle, and also independent of
each other, so that any of the twelve ribs may be elevated or de
pressed by them either separately or conjointly. He demonstrates
the nature of this action by means of models, producing oblique
tensions between levers representing the ribs, and allowing of rota
tion on their centres of motion; and he shows that such tension in
the direction of the external intercostal muscles, elevates both the
levers until the tension ceases, or the position of the bars by proxi
mity obstruct each other. If the tension be exerted in a contrary
direction, as in the internal intercostal muscles, the bars are both
depressed. This movement was demonstrated by a model.            It was
farther shown that two tensions decussating can, according to the
position of the fulcra, be made to act as associates or antagonists to
each other.    Such motions are to be considered with reference to
the fulcra, bars with one fulcrum common to each having no such
action; and the author accordingly draws the following conclu
sions :-
    1st. All the external intercostal muscles are true inspiratory mus
cles, elevators of the ribs, and with this act they dilate the inter
 costal spaces, thus increasing the cavity of the chest.
    2nd. The internal intercostal muscles have a double action; the
 portions situated between the cartilages are associates in action
 with the external layer, and act as elevators of the cartilages, while
 the portion between the ribs are depressors, or antagonists of the
 external layer, and are here true expiratory muscles; with this they
 decrease the intercostal spaces.
    3rd. These muscles can elevate or depress the ribs independently
 of any other muscle, fixing the first or last rib. Any one lamella,
 or series of muscles, can, as required, independently perform in
 spiration or expiration at any one of the twenty-two intercostal
 SoaceS.
  P. In inspiration, the intercostal spaces increase, with a short
 ening of the muscle; and in expiration, they decrease their perpen
 dicular distance, with a shortening of the muscle.
    5th. All parallel intercostal muscles, acting with uniform force,
 concur in the same effect, whether near the fulcrum or more distant
 from it, and these muscles gain power with their increasing obliquity
 as well as speed.
    In the third part of the paper an account is given of the differ
 ence between the external thoracic space and the internal pulmonic
 space. The respiratory movements are described in health and
 disease, and it is shown that the chest is rarely enlarged at two
 places at one and the same time.

224                         Royal Society.
   In conclusion the author conceives that he has established the
following propositions:—
   1st. Costal breathing may be distinguished from abdominal by
determining which part is first put in motion, and the kind of re
spiration may be designated according to the name of such part.
   2nd. Healthy costal breathing begins with the motion of a supe
rior rib, which is followed by that of the lower ones in succession.
   3rd. Ordinary respiration in men is abdominal, in women, costal;
extraordinary breathing is the same in both sexes.
   4th. Any of the ribs, from the twelfth to the first, may carry on
respiration.
   5th. Diseased respiration is of various kinds; the movements may
be symmetric or not symmetric, costal or abdominal; all or none of
the ribs may move; the abdomen may or may not move;            the chest
may dilate in all its dimensions at one and the same time; costal and
abdominal breathing may alternate with one another; costal motion
may be undulating or not; and all these may be combined in one,
which the author terms “hesitating breathing;” and lastly, the quan
tity of air breathed is diminished when there exists pulmonary dis
eaSe.
   “On the Structure and Development of the Liver.” By C.
Handfield Jones, M.B., Cantab. Communicated by Sir Benjamin
C. Brodie, Bart., F.R.S., &c.
   The author gives a detailed description of the structure of the
liver in animals belonging to various classes of the animal kingdom.
He states that in the Bryozoon, a highly organized polype, it is clearly
of the follicular type; and that in the Asterias, the function of the
liver is probably shared between the closed appendage of the stomach
and the terminal caeca of the large ramifying prolongations of the
digestive sac contained in the several rays.     Among the Annulosa,
the earthworm presents an arrangement of the elements of the he
patic organ, corresponding in simplicity with the general configura
tion of the body, a single layer of large biliary cells being applied as
a kind of coating over the greater part of the intestinal canal. In
another member of the same class, the Leech, in which the digest
ive cavity is much less simple, and presents a number of sacculi
on each side, these elements have a very different disposition; and
the secreting cells, although some remain isolated, for the most
part coalesce to form tubes, having a succession of dilatations
and constrictions, and finally uniting and opening into the intes
tine. In Insects, the usual arrangement is that of long curved fila
mentary tubes, which wind about the intestine; these, in the meat
fly, are sacculated throughout the greater part of their course, till
they arrive quite close to the pylorus, where they open; near their
 origin they appear to consist of separate vesicles, which become
 gradually fused together, but occasionally they are seen quite sepa
 rate. The basement membrane of the tubes is strongly marked,
 and encloses a large quantity of granular matter of a yellowish tinge,
 with secreting cells; another portion of the liver consists of sepa
 rate cells lying in a granular blastema, which cells, in a later stage

                              Royal Society.                       225
  of development, are seen to be included in vesicles or short tubes
  of homogeneous membrane, often coalescing and exhibiting a more
  or less manifestly plexiform arrangement; this portion of the
 liver is regarded by Mr. Newport as really adipose tissue. The
 author has termed it the Parenchymatous portion of the liver, on
 account of its general appearance and mode of development, though
 he has not been able to determine whether the tubes always origi
 nate from it. Among the Arachnida, the follicular type of arrange
 ment prevails; and the same is the case with the Crustacea, the folli
 cles in these last being distinctly visible to the naked eye. In Mol
 lusca also, we find the follicular arrangement universally to obtain;
 yet in certain cases the limiting membrane of the follicles cannot be
 shown to exist, and the author therefore thinks that its importance
 is probably not great, but that it serves chiefly to fulfil the me
 chanical function which its synonym “basement” indicates. The
 quantity of retained secretion in the liver of molluscs seems clearly
 to imply that the bile in them is not an excrementitious fluid; it is
 used slowly on account of the imperfect character of the respira
tion.
    In passing from the Invertebrata to the Vertebrate division of the
 animal kingdom, and beginning with the class of Fishes, a great
 change is immediately manifest in the form and character of the
 biliary organ; it is now a gland of solid texture, to which the term
parenchymal is justly applied. Two portions may be distinguished
in it, namely, the secreting parenchyma, consisting of delicate cells,
or very often of nuclei, granular and elaborated matters in great
part, and the excreting ducts, which, though completely obscured
by the surrounding bulky parenchyma, may yet be satisfactorily de
monstrated, and traced often to their terminal extremities in the
following manner. If a branch of the hepatic duct be taken up in
the forceps, it may be dissected out without much difficulty from
the surrounding substance, which is very soft and yields readily to
gentle manipulation; when a trunk is in this way removed and
placed under the microscope, a multitude of minute ramifications
are seen adhering to it; among these not a few may be discovered,
which do not appear to have suffered injury; some are occasionally
seen terminating by distinctly closed extremities; more usually the
duct becomes very minute and gradually loses all definite structure,
appearing at last like a mere tract of granular matter; in either
case there is no communication by continuity with the surrounding
parenchyma. Large yellow corpuscles, peculiar cells, and a consi
derable quantity of free oily matter usually existing in the liver of
various fishes, seem generally to indicate a great superiority in the
amount of secretory over that of excretory action, and to betoken
clearly the feeble intensity of the aérating function.
   In Reptiles, there is the same arrangement in the liver, namely,
a secreting parenchyma of cells and an apparatus of excretory ducts,
which have the same essential characters as those of fishes; but
there exists very frequently in the parenchyma remarkable dark
corpuscles, which appear to be masses of retained biliary matter,
    Phil. Mag. S. 3. Vol. 31. No. 207. Sept. 1847.

226                         Royal Society.
the import of which, in the situation they occupy, is doubtless the
same as that of the similar masses existing in fishes.
   In Birds, the parenchyma of the liver is remarkably free from oily
or retained biliary matters; it often consists almost wholly of free
nuclei and granular matter, with scarcely a single perfect cell; the
excretory ducts often greatly resemble those of reptiles, sometimes
rather those of mammalia; the essential character is, however, always
the same, namely, that they terminate without forming any important
connexion with the parenchyma.
   In Mammalia, the parenchyma of the liver consists usually of per
fect cells, which are arranged often in linear series of considerable
length, radiating from the axis of each lobule; these unite at variouf
points with each other, so as to present a more or less decidedly
plexiform appearance. Each lobule, as described by Mr. Kiernan,
is separated from the adjacent ones by the terminal twigs of the
portal vein, and to a greater or less extent by a “ fissure,” though in
most animals the lobules are continuous with each other both above
and below the fissure.     The elaboration of the secreted product
seems to be most completely effected in the cells adjoining the
margins of the lobules, which are often seen to contain a larger
quantity of biliary matter than those in the interior, and to be appa
rently in the act of discharging it into the fissure; the margin of
the lobule then presents an irregular surface with large globules of
the secretion clustering together all over it. The capsule of Glisson
surrounding the vessels in the portal canals gives a fibrous invest
ment to those surfaces of the lobules which are towards the canal;
but when it has arrived in the fissures, it forms a continuous mem
brane lining the surfaces of opposite lobules; this membrane is often
 truly homogeneous, and closely resembles the basement tissue: there
 appears occasionally to be a delicate epithelium on its free surface;
but this, as well as the membrane itself, is often absent, when the
 margin of the lobules is in that condition which has just been de
 scribed and which may be termed active. The minute branches of
 the hepatic duct as they approach their termination undergo a re
 markable alteration in their structure; they lose their fibrous coat,
 which blends itself with the membranous expansions of the capsule
 of Glisson; their basement membrane becomes gradually indistinct,
 and at last ceases to exist, and the epithelial particles no longer
retain their individuality, but appear to be reduced to mere nuclei,
 set very close together in a faintly granular basis substance. The
 mode of their termination is not uniformly the same; frequently they
 present distinctly closed rounded extremities, between one and two
 thousandths of an inch in diameter; at other times they seem to
 cease gradually in the midst of fibrous tissue, the nuclei alone being
 disposed for some little way in such a manner as to convey the idea
 of a continuation of the duct. These ducts can seldom be dis
 cerned in the fissures, but have several times been seen in the
 “spaces,” where several fissures unite; they do not form anything
 like a plexus between the lobules. From the anatomical relation of
 the ducts to the parenchyma, and from the circumstance that a

                              Royal Society.                         227
distinct vessel conveying a different kind of blood is distributed to
the hepatic duct, as soon as the liver assumes the parenchymal form,
it seems probable that the mode in which the secreted bile is con
veyed out of the organ, is by its permeating the coats of the minute
ducts in obedience to an endosmotic attraction, which takes place
between the bile in which the ducts may be said to be bathed, and
a denser (perhaps mucous) fluid formed in their interior. The
large quantity of oily matter frequently existing in a free state in
the secreting parenchyma of the liver, which must be regarded as a
product of secretory action, seems to suggest the idea, that a cer
tain quantity of the biliary secretion may be directly absorbed into
the blood, and in this manner conveyed away from the organs, just
as occurs in the thyroid body, suprarenal capsules, and other
glands unprovided with efferent ducts.
    With respect to the development of the liver, the author considers
the opinion of Reichart to be decidedly the correct one, namely,
that its formation commences by a cellular growth from the germi
nal membrane, independently of any protrusion of the intestinal
canal. On the morning of the fifth day, the oesophagus and stomach
are clearly discernible, the liver lying between the heart, which is in
front, and the stomach which is behind; it is manifestly a parenchy
 mal mass, and its border is quite distinct and separate from the digest
 ive canal; at this period, the vitelline duct is wide, it does not open
into the abdominal cavity, but its canal is continued into an anterior
 and posterior division, which are tubes of homogeneous membrane,
filled, like the duct, with opaque oily contents; the anterior one
 runs forwards, and forms behind the liver a terminal expanded
 cavity, from which then passes one offset, which, gradually dilating,
 opens into the stomach; a second, which runs in a direction up
 wards and backwards, and forms apparently a caecal prolongation;
 and a third and fourth, which are of smaller size, arise from the
 anterior part of the cavity and run to the liver, though they cannot
 be seen to ramify in its substance; at a somewhat later period, these
 offsets waste away, excepting the one which is continued into the
 stomach, and then the mass of the liver is completely free and un
 connected with any part of the intestine. As the vitelline duct
 contracts, the anterior and posterior prolongations of it become
 fairly continuous and form a loop of intestine, the posterior division
 being evidently destined to form the cloaca and lower part of the
 canal. The final development of the hepatic duct takes place about
 the ninth day by a growth proceeding from the liver itself, and
 consisting of exactly similar material; this growth extends towards
 the lower part of the loop of duodenum, which is now distinct, and
 appears to blend with the coats of the intestine; around it, at its
 lower part, the structure of the pancreas is seen to be in process of
  formation.   The further progress of development of the hepatic
  duct will, the author thinks, require to be carefully examined, but
 the details he has given in this paper have satisfied him of the cor
 rectness of the statement that the structure of the liver is essentially
 parenchymal.

SUGGESTIONS        FOR   THE     OBSERVATION       OF   THE    ANNULAR
    ECLIPSE, oct. 9, 1847, MADE BY THE BRITISH Association
    For THE ADVANCEMENT of science, Oxford, JUNE 26,
    1847.
THE following directions and suggestions, relative to the ensuing
       annular eclipse of the sun, which will take place Oct. 9, 1847, are
 proposed for the assistance of less-practised observers, or those who
may not have better information at hand, but who may nevertheless
render great service by noticing and recording, as well as circum
stances permit, any of the various points herein alluded to.
    I. As a general direction as to the limits within which the eclipse
can be seen annular in England and Ireland, if on any map a line be
drawn through Greenwich and Gloucester and produced, it will give
the northern limit at which the eclipse ceases to be annular.
    A line parallel to the last, through Padstow in Cornwall on the
 west, and Torbay on the east (which will extend across the channel
 to Havre, &c., and passes just below Cape Clear on the west), will
be the line along which the eclipse is both annular and central.
   The southern limit lies wholly below England.                       -
    II. As a rough guide to the time, the commencement of the an
nulus will be nearly at 7" 23" A.M. (civil reckoning) for the extreme
south-west of Ireland, at 7" 24" for a line through Land's End and
Milford Haven, at 7' 25" through the Isle of Wight and Reading,
at 7h 25" 50° for Walmer (Greenwich mean time).
   III. For the observations requisite, a telescope of very moderate
power is best.    As the annulus will not last more than three or four
minutes, those unaccustomed to such observations should be cau
tioned against attempting to observe all the phaenomena, or they
may thus run the risk of observing none. If possible several observers
should combine for the purpose, and each agree to attend to one, or
some few of the phaenomena.
   IV. To obviate some of the difficulties arising from the rapid
passage of the phaenomenon, the observer may be referred to Capt.
Smyth's Cycle (i. 141, 146), where some valuable practical hints
are thrown out for tranquillizing the observer's nerves in so transitory
a phaenomenon; especially by previously making a careful drawing
of the spots (if any) existing on the sun's disc, which may be made
useful in marking and ascertaining the progress of the eclipse.
   V. With the view of correcting the moon's tabular north polar
distance and semidiameter, it is peculiarly desirable that observations
should be made along or near the line (passing through Greenwich
and Gloucester) on which the eclipse is barely annular. At some
of these the eclipse will be completely annular, and here the follow
ing observations should be made :-
   The time of beginning of annularity and end of annularity should
be observed. As the duration only is required, a common watch
showing seconds will suffice for this purpose.

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                 229
   If possible, by means of a graduated pearl scale or other equivalent
means, the breadth of the narrowest part of the annulus should be
measured several times about the middle of the time of the annular
appearance, as well as it can be estimated.
   At other places the eclipse will not be completely annular, and
here the principal object must be to make several measures of the
distance between the cusps about the time when that distance is
smallest. This measure may probably be made by means of a gra
duated pearl scale, or by means of a divided object-glass applied in
front of the object-glass of the telescope, or by the use of a common
sextant.
   VI. As to the particular points of physical interest to which at
tention should be directed, they may be stated as follows:—
   1. It will be desirable in general to notice the fact of the appearance
of what are denominated “beads” and “threads” by the late Mr.
Baily and others, just before and after the completion of the annulus.
      For details of older observations the observer should consult
         Ast. Soc. Memoirs, i. 142–146, x. 10–17, 33–38.
      The beads were observed by Mr. Baily, ib. x. 210, in 1842,
         when they were not seen by Mr. Airy, ib. x. 218.
      They were observed by Prof. Henderson at Edinburgh. Ast.
         Soc. Notices, v. 186.
   2. Whether in the neighbourhood of the cusp the limb either of
the sun or moon appears distorted P
   Whether the beads appear steady or waving, disappearing and
reappearing, &c. P
      See the observations of Mr. Caldecott at Trevandrum, Ast. Soc.
         Notices, vi. 81.
   Whether they present any peculiar changes when viewed through
differently coloured glasses, the observer alternating the colours,
which should be as dissimilar as possible, such as red and green 2
      See Silliman’s Journal, Jan. 1842.
   3. Whether they are seen when the eclipse is projected on a screen?
      In this way Prof. Chevallier saw none when others with coloured
         glasses saw them.     Ast. Soc. Notices, v. 186.
   4. The drawing out of the beads into threads when very near
junction; and whether they waver and change, and the number of them?
       See Ast. Soc. Mem., x. 15–17, 39; waving and changing, ib. x.
          12, 13; not seen in 1842 by Mr. Baily, Notices, v. 210.
   5. Whether before and after the formation of the threads the
moon's dark disc is elongated towards the point of contact?
      This was observed, ib. x. 29; and wavy motion in the limb,
         ib. x. 12, 14, 30.
    6. The beads are ascribed by some to lunar mountains: What
mountains exist at that part of the limb 2
       See Ast. Soc. Mem., x. 9, 16, 30–36.
    7. The exact intervals of time elapsed between the first and last
 complete contact, and that of the first and last formation of beads or
 other irregularities in or about the cusps, should be determined.
The difference of the times being all that is wanted, a good ordinary
 watch will be sufficient.

230            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
      The remarkable fact of a recurrence of cusps observed by Mr.
         Airy in 1842, and his explanation of it, should be attentively
         considered.   See Ast. Soc. Notices, v. 296.
   8. If possible, accurate measures should be taken of the apparent
diameter of the dark disc of the moon upon the sun, which may be
expected to be greatly less than the truth, owing to the irradiation
of the sun's light.
   9. It should be noticed whether any external luminous arch is
formed over the part between the cusps, a little before the first junc
tion and after the final separation, and the colour of the light.
      It was observed, and appeared brown to De Lisle (Phil. Trans.,
         1748, 490), reddish in other cases (Ast. Soc. Mem., i. 144,
         x. 37), and purple in others (ib. x. 16).
  ON THE PREPARATION AND COMPOSITION OF THE SALTS OF
                   ANTIMONY.           BY M. E. PELIGOT.
   Sulphates of Antimony.—When oxychloride of antimony (C1Sb2O3)
is treated with hot concentrated sulphuric acid, a salt is formed
which is deposited in acicular crystals, hydrochloric acid being at
the same time evolved.         This salt, as well as another sulphate to
be described, can only be obtained in a dry state by long remaining
in vacuo, or in perfectly dry air upon porous plates of pipe clay.
These plates were heated to redness before the crystalline magma
was placed upon them, and they were left to cool in air deprived of
moisture. This method of drying yields products which usually
contain a slight excess of sulphuric acid. If however the points of
contact between the salt to be dried and the absorbent earth be re
newed from time to time, and the absorption goes on for several
months, compounds of sufficient purity to remove all doubts of their
true composition may be obtained.
   One hundred parts of the sulphate of antimony, obtained by com
mon sulphuric acid and oxychloride of antimony, gave—
      Sulphuric acid . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 51.9
      Oxide of antimony (by carbonate of ammonia) . . . . 50.2
The composition of this salt is therefore—
                   4SO3 . . . . . . . .     2000               51-2
                    Sb2O3     . ... ..      1912                48.8

Another specimen gave 53 l of sulphuric acid, and 44.3 of oxide of
antimony.             -
   Another sulphate of antimony was obtained in the form of small
brilliant crystals, by treating sesquioxide of antimony with Nord
hausen sulphuric acid. After remaining ten months on the dried
clay, it gave—
            Sesquioxide of antimony . . . . 63.0                           64'3
            Sulphuric acid . . . . . . . . . . . . 37: 1                   35-0
   The formula 2SO9, Sb2O3 gives 65.6 oxide of antimony and 34.4
sulphuric acid.
   Mixtures of these salts in different proportions were also obtained;

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles,                     231
 but no analysis indicated the existence of the compound 3SO3,
5Sb°O°, which, according to Berzelius, would be the neutral sul
phate of antimony.
   On treating the above-described salts with hot water, a subsalt is
obtained, the composition of which is represented by the formula—

   The analysis of two other specimens is correctly represented by
the formula 2Sb2O3, SO3, 2HO.
   Nitrate of Antimony.—This salt was obtained in the form of pearly
crystals by dissolving the oxide in cold fuming nitric acid, and adding
water to the solution. Its composition is 2Sb2O3, NO3.
    Orychlorides of Antimony.—Powder of Algaroth was prepared by
treating chloride of antimony with cold water. After some days the
mass became crystalline; when well-washed its composition agreed
with the analyses which have served to fix the formula of this com
pound. This formula is more simply replaced by Cl Sb” O’.
   When the sesquichloride of antimony, or rather the sesquioxide
dissolved in a great excess of hydrochloric acid, is treated with hot
water, another oxychloride is obtained, which, on the cooling of the
liquor, precipitates in dense brilliant crystals.            Its composition is
represented by the following formula : —

   Tartrates of Antimony.—By allowing a syrupy solution of tartrate
of antimony, obtained by dissolving the oxide of the metal in tartaric
acid, to remain for a long time, large transparent crystals of tartrate
of antimony were obtained. The mother-water, after the separation
of the crystals, furnished more afterwards by spontaneous evapora
tion.

   On pouring alcohol into a concentrated solution of the acidulous
tartrate of antimony, a precipitate is obtained which, when dried at
320° F., yielded 16.4 of carbon and 13 of hydrogen. The compo

M. Peligot analysed contained a little more water than the quantity

another equivalent.
   Acidulous Tartrate of Antimony and Potash.-This salt was de

    Owalate of Antimony.—-M. Peligot prepared this salt by four pro
cesses:—1st, by boiling in a solution of oxalic acid oxide of antimony
prepared from the chloride by carbonate of ammonia; 2nd, by treat
ing the powder of Algaroth with oxalic acid; 3rd, by pouring hydro
chloric acid into a hot solution of the double oxalate of potash and
antimony; the oxalate of antimony precipitates in the state of a
crystalline powder; 4th, by adding oxalic acid to a solution of the
 same double salt.                             -                           -
   The oxalates of antimony obtained by these processes are similar
in composition. The author attempted, but in vain, by varying the
proportions, to obtain other compounds of oxalic acid and oxide of
antimony. This salt is crystalline and insoluble in water. It is
 decomposed by boiling water into oxalic acid, which dissolves, and
 sesquioxide of antimony.

      ACTION OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID IN THE FORMATION OF
                                     OXALIC ACID.
    M. Kopp states that the presence of hydrochloric acid in nitric acid
 is peculiarly favourable to the formation of oxalic acid. The resins of
benzoin and Tolu, treated with pure nitric acid, yield no oxalic acid;
but with an impure acid it is obtained.                   Pure nitric acid occasions
the formation of terebic acid only, in acting upon oil of turpentine,
 and to oxypicric acid, in oxidizing the gum-resins.                     By using nitric
 acid containing much hydrochloric acid, oxalic acid only is obtained
 under the same circumstances.—Ibid, Juillet 1847.
             PROJECTION OF ALDEBARAN ON THE MOON,
     At the British Association in Oxford a question arose respecting
 the apparent projection of Aldebaran on the disc of the moon in
 occultations. Prof. Airy and Dr. Forster stated having seen this
 phaenomenon, which Prof. Struve seemed disposed to attribute to
 to some mal-adjustment of the telescopes. On looking back, how
 ever, to the Philosophical Magazine, it will be found that this ap
  pearance has been three or four times recorded; as well as some
  other circumstances calculated to show that the light of different
 stars is very differently refracted. See Phil. Mag. for April and
 May 1824.
            THE PUFF PARLIAMENTARY : — DISINFECTION.
     The art of puffing has not yet exhausted its resources; and a
  Parliamentary Report well got up, printed at the expense of the
  public, and from which extracts may go the round of the news
  papers, seems to be the last and boldest device for the purpose,
  which however has been fearfully exposed in the Dublin Quarterly
  Journal of Medical Science.
     The Times newspaper in a leading article of the 20th of August,
  felicitates itself on having “the pleasant task of giving what publi
  city it may to a discovery made by a French gentleman, M. Ledoyen,

 234           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
 a Parisian chemist, in concert, it would appear, with a Mr. F. C.
 Calvert, who seems to have received his education as a chemist at
 Paris, and who is now lecturer at the Royal Institution of Man
 chester. This discovery, which, under the auspices of Lord Mor
 peth, has been submitted to the most searching tests by Dr. South
 wood Smith, Mr. Toynbee and Mr. Grainger, promises fair to be
 one of the greatest boons ever conferred on suffering humanity. The
 discovery is nothing less than the means of disinfecting all foetid
 animal substances and gases by a liquid which is very cheap, simple,
 and can be applied by any person with the greatest facility.
    “The three medical gentlemen appointed by Lord Morpeth to
 inquire into the real value of M. Ledoyen's discovery, present us in
 their report with a dismal catalogue of the offensive and dangerous
vapours from animal and vegetable substances which at all hours
 infect the air we breathe, in a greater or less degree, accordingly
as we more or less neglect their impure origins.” “The Commissioners
 state that they have tried the effect of this fluid,—1, on substances
already in a state of decomposition; 2, on substances undergoing
 that process; 3, on night soil; 4, on impure air. In every instance
excepting the second these experiments have been attended with the
most miraculous result.” “It would almost seem that some mysterious
poner had sent us M. Ledoyen and his discovery to compensate for
 the shortcomings of the Premier and Lord Morpeth *.”
    So far The Times.—We now give a few extracts from the Dublin
Journal, and refer our readers to the article which it contains for
the details of the means by which these puffs have been procured,
and for a full account of the matter.
    This boasted discovery professes to furnish “the means of disin
fecting all foetid animal substances and gases by a liquid which is
very cheap, simple, and can be applied by any person with the
greatest facility. It disinfects night-soil, not destroying but in
creasing vegetation, more particularly as regards agriculture, com
pletely preventing the disease in potatoes when the land is manured
with disinfected night-soil. It disinfects hospital-wards of miasma;
also cellars, water-closets, and buildings infected by impure gases.
It disinfects sailors suffering from fever on board of vessels; it will
also disinfect ships at sea, and under quarantine. It disinfects
patients suffering with infectious disorders and wounds, also dead
bodies, so that they may be kept nearly a month ; also different
parts of the body can be kept for the purposes of dissection, for
coroners' inquests, &c.”
   * No wonder that competitors should have started up asserting their
claims to so wonderful a discovery. Mr. W. Maddick thus begins his letter
to the Editor of the Times; of whose judgement in matters of science he
seems to have a most exalted opinion:
   “SIR,--All the world knows that a laudatory notice in your columns is a
very high honour; and as in your excellent leader of yesterday you have
highly eulogized Messrs. Ledoyen and Calvert for their alleged discovery,
I º      with confidence to the proverbial justice of The Times, &c. &c.
   “I boldly claim originality in this matter, and challenge these gentlemen,
or any other,” &c., &c.

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles,                    235
   “There is not a word of evidence in the document before us as
to the influence of this solution of nitrate of lead in curing, or ‘dis
infecting,’ as they call it, by its vicinity, fever or other infectious
diseases. Of course no professional man (except Dr. Southwood
Smith) could bring himself to support such an absurdity as that
would amount to. With respect to the potatoe disease, Dr. Smith
has been even less guarded. He manured portions of his garden
with his disinfected night-soil, and finds that potatoes grown on
these spots are finer than elsewhere. He says, “I have this day
had specimens of them examined by Mr. Alfred Smee, who pro
nounces them to be at present perfectly healthy.’ What! not a
single Aphis vastator / Oh, genius of humbug how numerous are
thy votaries! Truly, successful speculation constitutes the idolatry
of this age, and the wonder-workings of pseudo-science its super
 stition.”
    “Let us now briefly pass in review some of the evidence detailed in
this precious document—some of the ‘Letters and Reports received
by the Chief Commissioner of Woods and Forests,'—set forward
in a parliamentary folio, gravely ordered to be printed by the
British senate, and consequently paid for by the country. Always
premising that we do not deny to this, in common with many other
chemical substances”, the power of destroying some unpleasant
odours, or, to deal more in the phraseology of the Report, slinks,
But against the disgraceful quackery with which this book abounds,
—a quackery not equalled by the most offensive and indecent ad
vertisement, and the humbug of presenting such a book to the
country, we loudly and strongly protest.”
    “We have already alluded to the circumstance that this imposture
has been attempted to be bolstered up by the testimony of night
men, dissecting-room porters, ward-men, and other respectable
authorities of a similar kind. Some of the experiments made by
these intellectual and educated individuals may amuse our readers,
as they have doubtless enlivened the House of Commons. Speaking

examine the part which a      g.          of repute has taken in this trans

in the fooleries of the Report already spoken of, volunteers his in
 dividual testimony as to the efficacy of the fluid in obviating con

   “In the columns of newspapers, in the pages of journals, on the
covers of magazines, in the corners of railway guides, placarded on
dead walls and bankrupts’ shop-windows, dropped into the hat at
public meetings, thrust into the hand in streets, and forced upon the
attention at every turn, we thought all the modes of puffing quack
advertisements and indecent labels, either in prose or rhyme, had
been exhausted: but we find that we were mistaken.          A novelty in
this department has been introduced by Colonel Calvert; and in the
pages of a parliamentary report* we see puffs as gross, and language
as indelicate, as any that disfigure the lowest newspapers.”
   We can only add an expression of our regret that an important
public cause, that of sanitary improvements, should have to encounter
prejudices raised against it from the exaggerations, misrepresenta
tions, quackery, and jobbing which are too manifest in the conduct
of some of its advocates.
         A GRANT OF 200l. To M.R. wiLLIAM STURGEON.
    We are glad to learn, from a communication dated Downing
Street, 12th August, from Colonel Grey, the private secretary of
Lord John Russell, that his Lordship has been pleased to grant the
sum of 200l., from the Royal Bounty Fund, to Mr. William Stur
geon of this town. Mr. Sturgeon was formerly lecturer on experi
mental philosophy at the Hon. East India Company's Military Aca
demy, Addiscombe; and since his residence in Manchester, now
extending over a number of years, he has been superintendent of
the Victoria Gallery, delivering various courses of lectures there;
and subsequently he filled the office of lecturer to the Manchester
Institute of Natural and Experimental Science. For a long series
of years Mr. Sturgeon has honourably distinguished himself by his
investigations and discoveries in the various branches of electrical
science, especially in electro-magnetism and thermo-electricity.
          OBSERVATIONS ON CREATINE,             BY M. HEINTZ.
    About two years ago I described a peculiar substance which I had
discovered in the normal urine of man. From subsequent investi
gations I find that this substance is identical with that which M.
 Chevreul found in meat broth, to which he gave the name of crea
 tine, and the presence of which in the fresh muscular flesh of dif
 ferent animals has recently been shown by Liebig.
    The most advantageous method of procuring the substance is that
 subsequently pointed out by M. Pettenkofer; it consists in adding
    * That Parliamentary Reports are sometimes made vehicles of privileged
 detraction and calumny the public are already aware. A late instance with
 #. to the Greenwich Observatory has been exposed by the Astronomer
   oyal.

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              237
to the alcoholic extract of the urine an alcoholic solution of chloride
of zinc.; in a short time a deposit is formed, which contains the
creatine in combination with the chloride of zinc, together with a
small quantity of phosphate of zinc. These two substances are sepa
rated by boiling water, which dissolves the first, but is without action
upon the latter. The pure creatine is obtained from the aqueous
solution of its combination with chloride of zinc by precipitating the
zinc with hydrosulphate of ammonia; after having evaporated the
filtered liquid as far as possible without a precipitate being formed
in the boiling solution, absolute alcohol is added to it, when the
creatine is immediately deposited in the form of small crystals,
resembling those obtained in operating upon the alcoholic solution
of the aqueous extract of meat.
   After having washed these crystals with alcohol, I recrystallized
them from water. The elementary analysis of the pure crystals led
to the following formula, C8 Hº Nº O4 + 2HO, which is the same as
that advanced by M. Liebig.
   When creatine enters into combination with chloride of zinc, it
parts with 2 atoms of water besides the water of crystallization, and
in exchange takes up 1 atom of this salt. This combination is repre
sented by the following formula, C8H1N3O8 + CIZn, and the atomic
weight of creatine is consequently 1412.5.
   From the experiments of M. Liebig it results, that of all the
organs of the animal body it is only the muscles which yield crea
tine.   Now, as I have proved its presence in the urine of man and
animals, it appears placed beyond all doubt that this substance is
formed in the muscles, that it is absorbed by the lymphatics or
blood-vessels, and is finally secreted by the kidneys, like urea, &c.
We may therefore conclude that creatine should henceforth be
placed amongst the eacrementitious substances; and consequently it
is barely probable that it constitutes one of the most important ali
mentary principles of meat broth, as M. Liebig is inclined to think.
Is it not rather one of the ultimate products of the chemical actions,
the presence of which we have great reason to suspect in the act of
muscular contraction?—Comptes Rendus, March 22, 1847.
                       THE NEW PLANET IRIS.
   The following letter to The Times appeared on Wednesday,
Aug. 18th.
   SIR,-In addition to the Berlin maps, which we have revised, and
in some instances corrected, ecliptical charts of stars down to the
tenth magnitude have been formed for some of the hours of right
ascension, which it is Mr. Bishop's intention to publish as soon as
they are completed. On the 13th of August I compared Wolfer's
map with the heavens, and was surprised to find an unmarked star
of 8.9 magnitude in a position which was examined on June 22 and
July 31 without any note being made. The mere existence of a
star in a position where before there was none visible, would not
have been sufficient to satisfy me as to its nature; because during
an eight months' search I have met with very many variable stars, a

class which I believe to be far more numerous than is generally sup
posed. But, on employing the wire micrometer we were enabled in
less than half an hour to establish its motion, and thus to convince
ourselves that I had been fortunate enough to discover a new mem
ber of the planetary system. It may appear to many of your readers
rather bold to announce the existence of a new planet from the de
tection of so small an amount of motion as 2 s. 5 in. R.A.; but such
is the firm mounting of the large refracting telescope, and the per
fection of the micrometers (for which we have to thank Mr. Dollond),
that a far smaller change would have been sufficient to convince us
as to the nature of the object in question. Mr. Bishop has fixed
upon Iris as an appropriate name for the new planet; and we hope
that astronomers generally will join with us in its adoption. The
following are all the observations we have yet made :-

   We have been favoured with the following additional information
by Mr. Hind:—
   The planet was observed by Mr. Rümker at Hamburg, on Aug.
20, and by Prof. Gauss at Göttingen and Prof. Encke at Berlin, on
Aug. 21.     M. Leverrier announced the discovery to the Paris Aca
demy of Sciences on Aug. 16, giving at the same time a general
view of the various hypotheses which have been started respecting
 the group of small planets.      The orbit of Iris appears to be very
 excentrical, and the period longer than that of any other asteroid;
but further observations are required for the accurate determination
 of the elements.
    Prof. Schumacher's “Planeten-Circular” was despatched from
Altona on August 20, so that we may expect a general series of
meridian observations at the various European observatories during
the present apparition of the planet.
SUGGESTIONS FOR PROMOTING THE SCIENCE OF METEOROLOGY.
       To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
         GENTLEMEN,
   As I find the Meteorological Society is defunct, I beg leave to
suggest that in order that the science of meteorology may be im
proved and promoted, and not left to chance, and in order that uni
formity in the observations may be obtained, I propose that at the
several railway stations, the head clerk, or the cleverest man on the
premises, be supplied gratis with proper instruments, and that these
instruments should all be supplied by the same maker; then will
they all start fair, upon certain data, which by the present system can
not be done. And as my friend Mr. Luke Howard has suggested to

                         Meteorological Observations.                                 239
me, would not the electric telegraph be a capital means of transmit
ting the intelligence of a thunder or hailstorm, or any change that
has talken place in any part of the kingdom where railways obtain,
and by that means unravel nature's secret with regard to meteoro
logical phaenomena º
    But as those stations should be provided with every requisite for
taking all the necessary observations, so as to form a compendious
series of meteorological remarks, you will ask who is to furnish the
means ? In answer to that I would say, could not the Royal Society
do that, and might not the British Association take the concern
under their fostering care 2         You will also say, would not the atten
tion necessary to be paid to these observations lead to inattention in
respect to the trains? I hope not; and I believe, before long, such
improvements will be made in railways as to make it nearly a phy
sical impossibility for accidents to occur.

 § XIV. On the Commutators employed to render voltaic cur
     rents discontinuous, and to separate currents of induction.
 1 l G. IT is exactly a century since a remedy for various ail
               ments was first sought in the electric fluid. The first
 experiments were made at Geneva by Prof. Jallabert in 1747f.
 At a later period, when the voltaic battery was invented, its
 physiological effects were studied, and they are now employed
 for the cure of various affections, such as obstinate ulcers f,
 dumbness,deafness||,blindness", tic-doloureux *, paralysisti,
 &c. , Lastly, since the discovery of magnetic and electric in
 duction in 1831 by Mr. Faraday, it has been found that the
 induced currents, as well as the electrical discharges of the
 Leyden jar, have an extremely short duration, and produce
greater shocks than batteries of a large number of elements.
 The idea therefore has occurred of rendering the current of
the electromotor apparatus discontinuous, to approximate it

  242      Prof. E. Wartmann's fourth Memoir on Induction.
  to the cases of induced currents.           Dr. Neeff of Frankfort on
  the Maine, in 1835*, and M. Masson in the following yeart,
  have made very conclusive experiments on this subject. An
  instrument described by M. Poggendorff under the name of
  inversor<U+017F>, is intended to render the current of an ordinary
  battery at the same time discontinuous and in an alternate
  direction through a given conductor.
      117. At the present day the employment of induced cur
  rents seems to become more and more general. In place of
  the original magnets employed in the apparatus of Ritchies,
  Pohl ||, Pixii, Saxton’º, Clarkett, Störerji, and others, a
  simple voltaic pair has been substituted, and an instrument has
  been constructed, of small size, easy of transport, and producing
  almost unlimited effects, called an electro-electric machine, or a
  shock-machine. M. Bonjol constructs this machine with such
  perfection that it has been generally adopted, and there is at
  the present day scarcely an hospital where it is not found. It is
  employed in the treatment of a multitude of nervous affections;
 in that of amaurosis $$, in assisting parturition ||, and as a dia
 gnostic to ascertain the state of vitality of the foetus.
     118. I have had more than one opportunity of convincing
  myself that many persons make use of the shock-machine
 without understanding either its construction or its theory.
 This machine, arranged on a different plan, might be rendered
 both more intelligible in its mode of action and more useful to
 the physicist and the physiologist. I will point out some of
 the cases in which it may be employed, and afterwards the
 arrangement applicable to each of them.
     119. A voltaic current being given, it may be proposed—

 tion, in a conductor a ;

comes out of it”. These different systems are complicated,
and subject to several inconveniences. The rheotrope, which
I shall proceed to describe, and which is especially applicable
to electro-electric machines, combines with the advantage of
   * On the 18th of June, 1840, I communicated to the Society of Physics
and Natural History of Geneva an apparatus of this kind, the construction
of which presents no difficulty, and which is deposited in the Cabinet of
Physics in the Academy of Lausanne. The following is a description of it:-
“My commutator is composed of a pure copper stem a b (Plate II. fig. 1),
intersected in the middle by a piece of ivory c : the latter is hollowed into
the nut of a screw, in such a manner that the two halves of the stem screw
into it.   Between these metallic extremities some sealing-wax is run, in
 order to isolate them entirely. The cylinder thus formed is arranged ho
 rizontally, and each of its branches is furnished with symmetrical pieces at
 equal distances. These pieces are two copper teeth ef, placed perpendi
 cularly and at a right angle on the axis; then a copper circleg. Lastly, to
 one of the extremities of the stem is fixed a pulley h, in the groove of
 which there runs a cord i, which again passes over a lower pulley k, which
is much larger, vertical, and moveable by means of the handle m in one of
the supports of the apparatus.
    “The six projecting pieces of copper dip into a glass vessel n (fig. 2),
 placed on two small horizontal bars of it presents six isolated compart
 ments full of mercury.      The extreme circles remain immersed in this
liquid during the entire rotation of the stem, the arrangement of the teeth
 causing one to be immersed whilst the neighbouring one is not. It is
 easy to regulate the quantity of mercury in the troughs so that the immer
 sion of the one may correspond exactly to the exit of the other.
    “Supposing it be desired to emit into a rheometer the two induced cur
 rents, giving to them the same direction, it is sufficient to bring the extre
 mities of the wire in which the induction is produced in the extreme com
 partments reserved for copper circles. The ends of the wire of the mul
 tiplicator are tied to bars of copper connecting the troughs ef, ef, cor
responding on the right and left of the isolator c to the needles fixed at
a right angle. So likewise on connecting the extremities of the rheometric
 wire only with the troughs ff, or with the troughs e e, it is evident that the
direct or inverted induced currents only may be collected.                  -
   “I have combined with this arrangement one which M. Bonijol has
 employed in some of his apparatus. It consists (fig. 3) of planting one of
 the ends of the stem in a flattened wooden cylinder r, on which a spring s
presses, passing into a circular cylinder t of hard wood, and the free extre
mity of which u is placed by the rotation of r in contact with an amalga
 mated metallic capsule r, or is removed from it. Then, by connecting the
spring on one side, and the capsule on the other, with the wire which the
direct current of the pile traverses, we obtain by the simple rotation of the
stem any number of inductions.
   “This apparatus enabled me to discover that the thermo. electric cur
rents are capable of induction like the hydro-electric currents. I employ
a single bismuth-antimony pair, the solder of which is kept at 100° by steam.
The bismuth extremity is connected with the spring s, the antimony ex
 tremity with a wire covered with silk, which makes seventy turns on a
 frame, and terminates at the capsule w.    On the same frame is rolled an
isolated and finer copper wire which makes 1200 coils (110.), and both
 ends of which terminate in the troughs p q. The induced circuit is closed
by a very delicate rheometer (5 a), which deviates five degrees and more,

   of serving to solve all the cases above stated. p.,,,,, . . . !

   wires are wound ; one the inductor A, by which the current
   of the battery p n is made to pass; the other the induced B,
   intended to become the seat of the currents of induction.
 "Three brass wheels r, s, t, of the same diameter, are isolated
   from one another on a common axis; their circumference pre
   sents an equal number of parts alternately of metal and wood.
 *Two metallic springs a, b are fixed against the wheel r, in
 "such a manner that the first leans against a conducting arc,
  and the other against an insulating arc. The wheels s and t
  are each pressed by two springs c d, e,f, similarly arranged.
  The central metallic parts of the three wheels are in constant
  communication with the springs g, h, i.
      122. If it be desired to collect the voltaic current always in
  the same direction after having rendered it discontinuous, it is
  sufficient to connect the spring i with the pole p by a wire a,
  and the other pole n with the spring f, by means of any con
  ducting wire different from the wires A and B wound upon
 the reel.      If it is wanted to obtain, as with the inversor, the
 discontinuous current in directions alternately contrary, we
  must join the springs c and e as well as the springs d and f,
  and then connect the extremity of the conjunctive wire of the
 battery with the spring h.
      123. When it is desired to employ currents of induction,
 the contact of the extremity l of the inducting wire with the
"pole n is established permanently, and that of the extremity m
 with the spring.f. Now, to isolate the direct currents induced
 at the closing of the circuit A, we have only to connect the
 ends a and y of the wire B respectively with the springs b and
 g—To isolate the inverted currents, we unite a with h and y
 with d.—To cause the direct and the inverted currents to pass
 one after another in the same direction through the rheometer
 G, for example, we connect the springs a and c with the end
 s of the wire of the instrument, the springs b and d with the
 end t, the extremity a with the spring h, and the extremity y
 with the spring g.—To collect the induced currents alter
 nately in contrary directions, just as they are produced directly,
 when it is traversed by direct and inverted currents in the same direction.”

  pp. 173, 195.)
     Prof. Dove has demonstrated thermo-electric induction by a different
    rocess.  His researches were made at the same time as mine, and in an
  independent manner. (See Pogg. Ann., vol. xlix. p. 97. 1840.)

we disconnect the extremities a and y of the wire B from the
springs of the rheotrope.
    124. Lastly, if we propose to employ the reaction of the
induced wire B on the inductor A, and that of the inductor
wound in a helix on itself, we substitute for the wire & the body
which is to be subjected to the effects of these reactions.
 We then employ one of the four arrangements above described
(123.), according as we wish to obtain the totality of influence
of the two currents induced in the same direction, or in di
rections alternately opposed, or again, the separate influence
of the direct or the inverted currents. The simple induction
of the inductor on itself is obtained with a reel with a single
wire in place of the conductor a, and the arrangement de
scribed (122.).
    125. It remains for me to give some details on the con
struction of the rheotrope. The three metallic wheels r, s, t
 (fig. 5) present on their periphery twelve hollows filled in with
hard wood. These heterogeneous wheels have been worked
together by the lathe; they are each 0”80 in diameter, and
Om'06 in thickness.         A metallic tooth of the middle wheel
s exactly corresponds to one isolating part of the extremes r
and t. They are placed on the same brass axis kl, which is
turned by a winch n or a tooth-wheel. The spring i and the
wheel t are in metallic contact with the axis.         The wheels r
and s are, on the contrary, each isolated from it by an ivory
 ring covered externally with a brass cylinder. These two
 cylinders bear the wheels, and are constantly pressed by
 springs g, h, which embrace them on a semi-circumference.
 The three springs g, h, i terminate on the three heads g', h', i',
by means of which they can communicate together. Lastly, the
 six springs a, b, c, d, e,f are made of plates of hammered copper;
 they are fixed to the base of the instrument by screws, ",s', t',
 the heads of which, similar to g', and pierced like them with
two holes, can receive the metallic wires intended to establish
a connexion between the different wheels.           These springs are
 cleft in order that the groove may facilitate the adjustment of
 their length.     Above they bear a screw (fig. 6) in the part
 which has to rest on the circumference of the wheels; the
 opposite notch allows of regulating the elasticity of the spring
 and the degree of friction. The play of these pieces may thus
 be regulated with minute precision.
     126. If it is not wanted to impart the same direction to the
 two induced currents, the apparatus may be simplified by
 giving it only two wheels. One is reserved to render the cur
 rent of the battery intermittent; the other is joined to the in
 duced wire; and according as there is coincidence or alter

       Prof. E. Wartmann's fourth Memoir on Induction,                 247
nation in the closing of the two circuits, only either the direct.
or the inverted currents are received. This double effect may
be obtained by changing the point of contact with one of the
springs, or by varying the position of one of the wheels on the
axis relatively to the other. Two wheels do not permit of .
giving the same direction to the direct and the inverted cur
rents; because as it is evident that the induced circuit must
communicate with the two wheels when the principal current
is closed, a part of this current may proceed from the wire of
induction and modify the effect of the direct induced current,
   127. Lastly, if it be desired to isolate only the inverted in
duced currents, the rheotrope may be reduced to a single
wheel. It is sufficient for the proposed object to open the
induced circuit when the inducting circuit is closed, and vice
versé, But this arrangement would not be suited to isolate
the direct induced currents, because it would be necessary to
close simultaneously the two circuits, and the voltaic current
would be propagated in the double channel presented to it.
   128. It will be found convenient to mark letters on the dif
ferent pieces g’, h', i', r", s', t', and to repeat them at the extre
mities of the metallic conductors employed to connect these
pieces.    These conductors will be fixed to the interior of the
lid of the case which contains the whole electro-electric ma
chine; and a brief direction will indicate which ought to be
employed to produce the effects corresponding to the differ
ent possible cases.
   129. It is understood that the commutator with three or
with two wheels is applicable to all magneto-electric machines,
telegraphs, clocks, &c., whose motive principle is the electri
city of the magnet or of the battery.
   § XV. Employment of induced currents to restore sensation.
   130. The cases of nervous weakness which have yielded to
a judicious application of electro-physiological shocks and
discharges are too well ascertained to admit of any question.
Since the marvellous effects of aether have been known, I have
proposed to several physicians the employment of the electro
electric machine, or at least of intermittent currents of very
short duration, to obviate the dangers which the injection of
too strong a dose of this liquid, or a too prolonged inhalement
of it, might produce. I have made some experiments” with
a view to verify the accuracy of my expectations; and although
they are so few as to require to be repeated and varied, I shall

   three months old, a chicken nine months old, and some frogs
   of both sexes. They are all very sensitive to electric shocks.

   liquid.         * * * .   . . .. . . . . . . .  * -         -

   induction than by simple exposure to the air. In the frogs
   no difference in this respect was remarked.                    . . . .

   into a glass cylindrical vessel, in which boxes were arranged
   furnished with sponges moistened with aether ; it was covered
   with a piece of linen dipt in water. The internal atmo
   sphere was removed from time to time by removing the co
   vering.                 -
        134. The most remarkable case was presented by the
   chicken. A quantity of aether, more than sufficient to produce
   insensibility, was injected into its rectum. When it arrived
   at this state, two or three shocks of the electro-electric appa
   ratus (110.) were passed from one wing to the opposite leg,
   which shocks were effected by a Grove’s pair; immediately the
   eyes opened. On continuing the discharges in a very inter
   mittent manner, the animal was seen to struggle, to rise on
   its feet, and then to fly to the end of the laboratory, relapsing
   gradually into an insensible sleep under the influence of the
   portion of injected aether which had not as yet produced its
   effect.                                                      *  * * * * * *
        135. The rabbit and the chicken were subjected to several
   successive aetherizations. The former, young and weak,
   died six or seven hours after the fourth trial (injection). At
  the end of fifteen hours its body was stiff, as if death had re
  sulted from natural causes. Its nerves exhibited the soften
  ing mentioned by some anatomists. The chicken, on the
   contrary, survived, and even on the following day laid an egg
   with a soft shell. It subsequently produced several others
  perfectly healthy.           It did not appear to feel the effects of the
'shocks or injections to which it had been subjected. It ate
  corn greedily, and the rabbit lettuce leaves, as soon as the
 'stupefaction produced by the aether had terminated.

º         § XVI. Action of Induced Currents on Albumen.
     137. Brande was the first who pointed out the coagulation
  of albumen on the positive pole of the battery. M. Matteucci, in
"treating ol the physiological action of electric currents”, says,
“that if the pole which was first positive be rendered negative,
  the albumen is not seen to redissolve, and that consequently
  an electric current may very well produce a cataract, but not
"destroyi.      On the other hand, Prof. Zantedeschiaffirms that
  he has seen the liquefaction of the albumen at the negative
   ...,     Repeated experiments have never shown me this re
  turn to the fluid state, and lead me to adopt entirely the con
  clusion of the celebrated physiologist of Pisa.
     138. The coagulation of albumen does not present any re
  markable phase, when, under the immediate influence of a
  battery, we substitute either direct or inverted induced cur
  rents, or the voltaic current rendered intermittent and strength
  ened by the reaction of the induction which it has engendered
  in its own conductor and in the neighbouring conductor (124.).
  But the phaenomenon changes when the liquid is traversed by
 induced currents in alternate directions.
 * 139. Through the inducting wire A of an electro-electric
  machine furnished with a bundle of iron wires, I passed the
  current of five Grove’s pairs of Om 1 square surface. The
  extremities w and y of the induced wire B (fig. 7) terminated
  in cups gg full of mercury. The circuit was closed by two
  platina wires a, b of 1mm in diameter, one part immersed in the
  cups, the other in the glass o full of the white of egg. The
  latter immediately coagulated around each wire, especially
  round that which communicated with the extremity of the
  circuit B, from whence proceeded the inverted induced current,
  and which corresponded to the positive termination of the
  rheophorus A. At the end of a few minutes some bubbles of
  gas appeared on the circumference of the coagulum. Some,
  having increased in volume, rose lightly to the surface of the
  viscous medium in which they were formed. The albumen,
  riddled with holes, by which the gas escaped and continued

to be disengaged, turned black in several places: then a series
of luminous sparkles, and lastly real sparks of a bright yellow
glittered on the whole immersed part of the platina wire. At
the same time the induced wire B was heated around the reel,
the metallic pieces of the rheotrope rose in temperature, and
the upper sides of the glass, not filled with the albumen, were z
coated with aqueous vapour.                                       -
    140. This remarkable phaenomenon is doubtless compli
cated. The coruscations do not dart from one wire to the other
in the liquid ; they are seen along the wire. I thought at .
first that the combustion (for it was such) only took place on
one of the electrodes (139.); but on repeating the experiment
many times, I saw it alternate on both of them according
as I reversed the poles of the battery, or present itself first
upon one wire, then upon the other, without the direction of
the current being changed; or lastly appear upon only one'
of them, whatever changes were made in the positions of the
rheophori and the extremities of the induced circuit. I attri
bute this latter case, which only occurred when the surface of
the albumen was covered with a layer of aether, to the differ
ence of the conditions of contact of the two platina electrodes
with the liquid : one, in fact, was then only covered with a
slight coagulum, whilst the other gave rise to a considerable
quantity of gas. These gases were collected on the aether in
a tube traversed by a platina wire cemented at its top. They ,
presented neither free carbonic acid, nor oxygen, nor hy:
drogen. I think that they were a mixture of oxide of carbon
and carburetted hydrogens.                                      -
   141. The albumen solidified around platina conductors
acquires the consistence of very soft glue; it is ductile, brown
ish, even blackish, and diffuses a marked odour of burnt horn
or phosphoretted hydrogen. The platina does not take the
pulverulent appearance nor black colour which are communi
cated to it by discontinuous alternate currents in other media;
it preserves its metallic appearance. With the assistance of
Prof. Marignac I analysed the coagulum; it contained no
traCe of platina,   There is therefore here no catalytic action.
   142. These various remarks lead me to think that, in cir
cumstances of imperfect conductibility of the albumen, and of
great power in the induced currents employed, the immersed
wires become heated when the coating of coagulum and of
gaseous bubbles has put a new obstacle to the passage of the
alternate currents (an obstacle rendered evident by the eleva
tion of temperature of the external circuits), whence results a
true igneous decomposition and a burning, under the influence
of oxygen in a nascent state, of combustible elements exposed.

    143. Whatever value this opinion may have, it seems to
me that the decomposition of albumen by the passage of veryo
intense induced currents is a fact which deserves the serious a
attention of physicians and physiologists. The presence of
this body in the blood, in urine, in the eye, in amniotic liquors,
&c., requires caution in the employment of violent alternated

to be developed there more easily.                         ... .....       ..       .      . . . ...
   145. It is perhaps well to add, that the production of these
bright coruscations indifferently on the two electrodes negatives a
any explanation founded on a different polarity of the platina
wires, and all analogy with the phaenomena investigated by
M.M. Gassiotº, Haref, and Neef<U+017F>.                                             •        *     *

       XLII. On the Molybdate of Lead. By Mr. John BRowN*.
        Moºr;                   of lead was first analysed by Klaproth f,
               who proceeded in the following manner:—
           100 grains of the mineral finely pounded were treated with
       dilute hydrochloric acid, and the whole of the silica was thus
* if:
       separated. Upon cooling, the greater part of the chloride of
     'lead was deposited in fine crystals. The clear supernatant
       liquor was then drawn off, and when sufficiently concentrated
       the remaining chloride of lead was deposited. The whole of
       the chloride was then carefully collected together, dried and
       weighed. Its weight was 74.5 grs. From this the quantity
       of oxide of lead was ascertained, which was 64'42 grs. Every
        100 grains of molybdate of lead contain therefore 64:42, grs.
       of oxide of lead. When the solution had thus been freed <U+017F>rom
       lead, it was concentrated by evaporation. Nitric acid was

then added to the solution, which immediately became of a
fine blue colour. When sufficiently concentrated, a quantity
of molybdic acid separated. The solution was then evapo
rated to dryness, and the molybdic acid remained in the form
of a fine citron-yellow powder, which when completely dried
weighed 34.25 grs.                 -   *  *  ** * *   *    *   *     * * * *

   As Klaproth did not know the true composition of chloride
of lead, the quantity of PbO given above is wrong. Calcula
ting the quantity of oxide from the quantity of chloride which
he obtained, we get 59:59 per cent. of oxide of lead, which is
very near the theoretical quantity, or 60-57. But the great
error is in the molybdic acid. What Klaproth considered as
silica, was very probably molybdic acid, as that acid is not
entirely soluble in hydrochloric acid; and as he apparently
deducted this as impurity, he gets too little molybdic acid.
He also does not mention how he washed out the molybdic
acid from the chloride of lead.      It could not well have been
done with water, for chloride of lead is soluble to a great ex
tent. This is a great point of imperfection in the analysis.
   II. This mineral was next subjected to a close examination
by Charles Hatchett, Esq., whose analysis is recorded in the
Philosophical Transactions (vol. xviii.), of which the following
is a summary:—                                      -
   250 grs. of the ore, freed from as much impurity as pos
sible, were put into a glass flask, and digested with sulphuric
acid for some time under a strong heat. When the solution
cooled, the clear liquor was drawn off, and the residual sul
phate of lead washed by subsidence. This process was repeated
several times.    The acid solutions were then filtered, and the
filtered liquid neutralized by caustic ammonia. After standing
for twenty-four hours a pale yellowish-coloured precipitate fell
down, which was collected on a filter, washed and dried: its
weight was then 4:20 grs. It had a yellowish colour, and
when dissolved in hydrochloric acid gave a blue precipitate
with yellow prussiate of potash.                                          * *
   Part of the clear blue solution, which was composed of sul
phate and molybdate of ammonia, was then put into a retort
and evaporated down, the rest of the solution being added as
the liquid in the retort evaporated; the whole was then dried
and strongly heated. In this manner all the sulphate of am
monia was driven off, whilst the molybdate of ammonia was
decomposed into molybdic acid and ammonia, the former

  of which remained in the retort: the molybdic acid then
  weighed 95 grs. The sulphate of lead formerly obtained was
  then treated in the following manner:—It was boiled with four
  ounces of carbonate of soda in solution; the powder was then
  washed, and nitric acid much diluted, was poured on it. The
  whole dissolved except a small quantity of silica, which was
  thrown on a filter: this when washed and dried weighed 7 gr.
  The acid was then exactly neutralized with caustic potash,
  which precipitated the lead as oxide: this, when washed and
 dried, weighed 146:00 grs.                  -              .. . . .      .       ./
         The oxide of lead was then dissolved in nitric acid, and
 sulphuric acid was added. After standing for some time the
 solution was filtered and the filtered liquor saturated with
  NH3 : after standing for some time a small quantity of per
 oxide of iron was precipitated, which when filtered and dried
 weighed 1-0 gr. This, when added to the former quantity of
 peroxide of iron, makes the quantity 5-2 grs, and the quantity
 of oxide of lead 145 grs.
         The composition of 250 grs. of molybdate of lead is there

mineral was Göbel”.                                                           -              -

then collected together and dried; the weight was then foun
to be 72.5 grs., which is equivalent to 59 grs. of oxide o lead.
The solution freed from lead was evaporated to dryness:                         wº
perfectly dry a small quantity of nitric acid was added, an
the solution was again dried.               It was then heated to redness
in a close vessel and weighed: its weight was thus found to

    This method is essentially the same as that used by Klap
 roth.    The result however is much nearer the truth. Göbel
 however gets too much molybdic acid and too little oxide of
 lead. This was probably owing to some of the chloride of lead
 not being obtained, as it is soluble to a great extent in water
 (1 in 152 of water)*; and the analyst does not state how he
 washed the chloride of lead free from molybdic acid.
    IV. The methods hitherto employed being liable to very
great objections, the molybdate of lead was analysed by another
method, which had proved successful in the hands of Mr.
 William Parry last year in the Glasgow College laboratory.
    26'84 grs. of the mineral finely pounded were boiled for a
considerable time with nitric acid and filtered.           The unde
composed mineral, along with a quantity of molybdic acid,
remained on the filter. This was then completely washed:
ammonia was then poured into the filter. The molybdic acid
 was thus dissolved, and the insoluble matter remained on
the filter; this was then washed, dried, ignited and weighed.
The weight of the insoluble matter in 26.84 grs. was 1'15 gr.
    The solution containing the molybdate of ammonia was
then evaporated to dryness, and heated to redness in a close
vessel. The greater part of the molybdic acid was thus ob
tained. Its weight was 6'76 grs.
    The fivst washings from the molybdic acid and the insoluble
matter were then concentrated.          Caustic ammonia was added
in order to neutralize the excess of acid, and afterwards sul
phohydret of ammonia was added in excess. In this manner
the lead was precipitated in the form of sulphuret, while the
tersulphuret of molybdenum was redissolved in excess, giving
the solution a deep red colour. The sulphuret of lead was
then thrown on a filter, and washed with water containing
sulphohydret of ammonia. When completely washed, the
sulphuret of lead was dissolved in muriatic acid, and after
boiling for some time was filtered to get rid of the sulphur.
The filtered liquor was then concentrated, and the lead pre
cipitated by means of oxalate of ammonia. The precipitated
oxalate of lead was then thrown on a filter, washed and dried.
By ignition the oxalate of lead was converted into the oxide;

the quantity of which in 26'84 grs. was thus found to be 16:20
grs., which is equivalent to 60:35 per cent. of oxide of lead.
   The next thing to be obtained was the rest of the molybdic
acid. This was contained in the washings from the sulphuret
of lead in the form of tersulphuret of molybdenum. When
the solution was sufficiently concentrated, it was made slightly
acid by means of nitric acid : a brownish-coloured precipitate
fell down, which is tersulphuret of molybdenum. This was .
then thrown on a filter and washed. It was then dried at 212°
and weighed: its weight was 3.37 grs. From this and the
previous quantity of molybdic acid the quantity per cent. was
calculated, which was 39:30 grs.
   According to this analysis, the composition of molybdate of
lead is—                                            -

   V. In the course of the preceding analysis it was observed
that the sulphohydret of ammonia exercised a powerful solvent
action on the mineral itself. The following new method of
successfully analysing this mineral was therefore adopted.
    23:0 grs., after being reduced to a very fine powder, were
digested with the aid of heat in sulphohydret of ammonia.
 The solution became immediately of a deep red colour,
owing to the tersulphuret of molybdenum which was held in
solution by the sulphohydret of ammonia, while the lead was
precipitated as sulphuret, and fell to the bottom in the form
of a black powder. The clear supernatant liquor was then
drawn off, and a fresh portion of sulphohydret of ammonia
 was added. This, after standing for some time, was thrown on
a filter, and washed with water containing sulphohydret of
ammonia. The tersulphuret of molybdenum passed through
in solution, while the sulphuret of lead remained on the filter.
 When this was completely washed it was dissolved in dilute
 muriatic acid, which took up the sulphuret of lead and left
the undecomposed matter along with the sulphur. These
were then thrown on a filter and washed: the whole was then
burnt. The sulphur was thus driven off, while the insoluble
matter remained. The insoluble matter in 23 grs. amounted
to 24 gr., whilst in the former analysis it amounted to 1-15
in 23 grs.                  -
    When the washings from the sulphur were sufficiently con
centrated, the lead was precipitated by means of ammonia and
oxalate of ammonia.      The oxalate of lead was then thrown
on a filter and weighed. The quantity of oxide of lead in

 258             Mr. J. Brown on the Molybdate of Lead.
 22-76 grs. amounted to 13.71 grs., which is equivalent to 60:35
 grs. per cent.
     The next point was to precipitate the tersulphuret of mo
 lybdenum. This was done by making the solution in sulpho
 hydret of ammonia slightly acid by means of muriatic acid.
 The tersulphuret went down in the form of a brownish-coloured
 precipitate. This was then thrown on a filter, dried, ignited
 and weighed. The quantity in 22-76 grs. was thus found to
 be 991 grs., which is equivalent to 39:13 per cent. of molyb
  dic acid.
      The constituents therefore of molybdate of lead according
  to this analysis are—
                             Molybdic acid . . 39-19

      Phosphates and arseniates of lead were decomposed in the
  same manner; and it is evident this process would also answer
 with antimoniates, vanadiates and seleniets.

      Test for Arseniates, &c.—I may notice a simple and quick
  method of testing minerals containing arsenic in its various
  forms, phosphates, molybdates, vanadiates, &c. A few grains
 of the mineral to be examined are to be finely pulverized in an
 agate mortar and introduced into a test-tube, and boiled with
 bisulphohydret of ammonia for a few minutes. The mineral is
 partially decomposed; the sulphuret of lead precipitates, while
  sulphuret of arsenic, &c. is dissolved by the excess of the re
  agent. The tube is then allowed to stand at rest, and the
  supernatant liquor poured off or filtered. The excess of bi
  sulphohydret of ammonia being removed by evaporation, the
  yellow sulphuret of arsenic precipitates. A molybdate is
     * In these analyses the lead only was ascertained, and the deficiency
 was taken as molybdic acid.
     The two last analyses were made by means of sulphohydret of ammonia,
  the three preceding by nitric acid.

On Fossil Calamites in the Carboniferous Strata near Wigan. 259
detected at once by the fine orange-red colour which the re
agent assumes when it is heated in contact with that mineral.
   A vanadiate gives a dark colour, but possessing less of the
red shade than the molybdate. The liquor filtered from the
sulphuret of lead containing the vanadium in solution has a
green colour, becoming blue by the addition of hydrochloric
acid. Hence it appears that arsenic dissolved in bisulphohy
dret of ammonia does not alter the colour of that reagent, while
the liquor gives a precipitate of orpiment by concentration.
Molybdenum and vanadium, on the other hand, render that
reagent reddish, and give brown precipitates by concentration.
The liquor filtered from the sulphuret of molybdenum is
colourless, or its hue is similar to that of the reagent, while
the liquor derived from the vanadium precipitate is green.
   I have succeeded in decomposing a sufficient amount of
these minerals for quantitative analysis by the preceding pro
cess when they have been carefully pounded and laevigated.
The process is particularly advantageous in the analysis of
molybdate of lead, where the use of nitric acid for dissolving
the mineral is objectionable in consequence of its tendency to
form the molybdate of molybdenum, and where hydrochloric
acid, by producing a chloride of lead, renders the employment
of an inconvenient quantity of water necessary. I have found
this process for testing very convenient where it was desirable
to use minute quantities of crystals, and where rapidity is an
object in view, as in examining a large collection of minerals
of the preceding description; and I mention it for the sake of
those who may possess in their cabinets minerals of this nature
which they may desire to test, since it may be found a use
ful adjunct to the blowpipe test.
   The bisulphohydret affords a simple distinguishing test
between metallic arsenic and antimony, when spots have been
received on porcelain by Marsh's process. Arsenic dissolves
in the reagent, and leaves a yellow stain by evaporation. An
timony dissolves and leaves an orange stain. For this expe
riment it is convenient to use the inside of the cover of a
porcelain crucible.

260        Mr. E. W. Binney on Fossil Calamites in
ing lands, and had not grown in the position in which they
are now found. But although it is certain that plants which
have been drifted by water generally present a broken appear
ance, it is equally true that plants grown upon the spots where
they are now found, having been laid low by the action of
currents of water, or weighed down and buried by the weight
of mud or silt that had fallen upon them, afford similar ap
pearances, so that great care must be taken before we conclude
that a plant has not grown on the place where it is now found
merely because we find it in fragments.            tº
   A few years ago the whole of the fossil flora was generally
supposed to have been drifted. The first plant that was ex
cepted from this rule and recovered its proper place was the
Stigmaria, whose long stringy rootlets prevented it from being
so conveniently drifted by currents as the advocates of the
drift hypothesis could desire; therefore it was allowed to have
grown where it is found.
   When numbers of Sigillariae were found standing erect on
seams of coal, and their roots had not been traced to their
extremities, it was at first attempted to refer them to accident,
like the snags now found in the Mississippi and other rivers.
However, a more careful observation of these fossils, and the
great number in which they were found, at length induced
geologists to admit that they must have grown where they
are now met with. The discovery of the trees at Dixon Fold
on the Manchester and Bolton Railway by Mr. John Hawk
shaw, F.G.S., and so ably described by the late Mr. Bowman,
F.G.S., in the first volume of the Transactions of the Man
chester Geological Society, mainly contributed to establish
this view, which has been since clearly proved by the certainty
that Stigmariae are the roots of Sigillariae, as the fossil trees
of St. Helens and Dukinfield testify.                         º
   As yet, however, Sigillaria was the only tree that to any
extent could be said to have been discovered in situ.            s
   In the present communication, it is intended to show that
Calamites have been found standing erect on the places in
which they grew by the side of Sigillariae, and that the root
lets of the former very much resemble, if they are not identical
with, those of the latter plant.                      -   - -  -
   The rootlets of Calamites have been very correctly figured
and described by Messrs. Lindley and Hutton in vol. i. pp. 78
and 79 of their Fossil Flora of Great Britain; but it is believed
by the writer that although numbers of erect Calamites have
been observed in the coal-measures, still none of them to his
knowledge have been described with their roots standing in
the position in which they had grown.

     During an examination of the deep excavations through
  the coal-measures made in forming the Bury and Liverpool
  Railway in the vicinity of Wigan, I was so fortunate as to
  discover on the 21st day of April last, in the Pemberton Hill
  cutting about two miles west of Wigan, not only a whole forest
  of Sigillariae standing erect with their roots just as they had
  grown, but also many Calamites in a similar state of perfec

y tº The excavation in which the fossils were met with is about
  twenty-five feet deep, and consists chiefly of a light gray
  coloured silty clay known by the provincial name of “Warren,”
, containing nodules of ironstone. This deposit is very similar
  in composition to the strata in which the fossil trees at St.
, Helens and Dukinfield before described were found. It lies
  between two beds of coal each about two feet in thickness, and
  occupies a position in the higher part of the middle division
  of the Lancashire coal-field. The upper seam of coal is
  covered, and in some places partly removed, by a deposit of
  one or two yards in thickness of till. Near the bridge is seen
  a flexure in the strata, as shown in the woodcut.

 The interval of eight yards is in my opinion the deposit in
 which the fossil trees were met with.
    In a distance of about fifty yards of the cutting, on my first
 visit to the place, I observed full thirty upright stems of Sigil
 lariae, besides several flattened ones lying in a horizontal posi
 tion.   These trees exhibited no evidence of their former struc
 ture, being mere casts, having their insides filled with a similar
 material to the matrix in which they were found imbedded.
 Their outsides consisted of a coating of bright coal of about a
 quarter of an inch in thickness, and were ribbed and formed
 as Sigillariae usually are. In diameter they varied from one
 to three feet: their heights ranged from two to twelve feet;
 but, with one exception of a stem with another lying directly
 across it, none of them could be traced to their termination
 upwards. Some of them rested with their stems on the top of
 the lower seam of coal; others had their roots midway between
 the two seams; and others again were found just under and
 in the floor of the upper seam. Most of the trees, which on
 exposure retained their coaly envelope, presented the irregu
larly ribbed and furrowed appearance which the Dixon Fold
and St. Helen's trees exhibited, and which some geologists
contend are not sufficient to identify them with Sigillariae;
but six specimens were decorticated, and showed well-defined
scars and all the other characters of Sigillaria reniformis,
alternans and organum.         All the upright trees had roots of
Stigmariae with their rootlets traversing the silly clay in all
directions.
    Many stems of Calamites were found standing erect amongst
the last-described trees, some of which were traced four and
five feet in height without reaching their tops. These stems
varied in diameter from one to five inches: they showed no
structure internally, being mere casts filled with silty clay and
having a coaly envelope of about one-sixth of an inch in thick
ness, which on being removed exposed the ribbed character

              the Carboniferous Strata near Wigan.             263
and usual joints of this genus of plants. All those which
could be traced downwards exhibited rootlets proceeding from
the lower joints, less in size, but resembling those of Stigmariae.
   One of the erect Calamites was traced for about two feet
upwards, and then at first sight appeared to terminate; but
on more careful inspection it could be traced running in a
horizontal direction, but so much compressed as to remain
unseen without very close observation.
   The erect stems both of undoubted Sigillariae and trees
which did not exhibit all the characters of Sigillariae as well
as those of Calamites, occurred in all parts of the deposit of
silty clay, from the top of the lower seam to the floor of the
upper one.
   In the deposit where the trees occurred were found plants
of the genera Neuropteris, Pecopteris, Sphenopteris, Cyclo
pteris, Odontopteris, Asterophyllites, Pinnularia, Lepidoden
dron, Lepidophyllum, Lepidostrobus, Lycopodites, Spheno
phyllum, &c.
   Having thus given a hasty sketch of the locality where the
fossils occurred, and the fossils themselves as they appeared
to me on my first visit to the place, I shall proceed to describe
some erect stems of Calamites, which are intended to form
the chief subject of this communication.        These trees were
not only seen by myself, but by Dr. J. Hooker and M. Jobert,
two well-known geologists; and it is to the latter gentleman
that I am indebted for the drawings which accompany this
paper.
   On the 22nd of May last, in company with the above-named
gentlemen, I again visited the Pemberton Hill cutting. Many
erect specimens of Calamites, both with and without roots, had
been seen on my previous visits to the place; but the three
which it is now my intention to describe exhibited the lower
terminations, and more distinctly showed the rootlets than the
other specimens.
   The three fossils marked Nos. 1, 2 and 3, in the rough
sketch before given, and No. 4, an individual examined by me
on a previous visit, occurred in the excavation on the south
side of the railway. They were all found standing in an erect
position about two yards distant from each other, having their
tops, as far as bared, two yards under the upper seam of coal.
They were each exposed from twenty inches to two feet, and
all presented the same external characters with regard to their
stems, joints, and rootlets, and most resembled the Calamites
approximatus.
   The description of No. 1 will serve for the other two.
   This specimen appeared standing in the silty clay in a nearly

264          Mr. E. W. Binney on Fossil Calamites in
erect position, with the exception of a slight bend in its upper
part, as shown in the drawing. It was almost cylindrical, and
measured twenty-one inches from the base to its highest part,
which was exposed. Its greatest diameter, which occurred
near the top, was one and a half inches; it then tapered
slight towards the bottom, and terminated in a club-shaped
end. The exterior was covered with a coating of fine coal of
about one-eighth of an inch in thickness, which on being re
moved exposed the usual ribs, <U+017F>urrows and joints, character
istic of §. The interior showed no trace of structure,
being composed of the same kind of silty clay as the matrix
in which the fossil was found.
   The following is a sketch of No. 1 as it appeared in the cut
ting, one-eighth the natural size of the fossil. The upper
part had been removed before we saw the specimen.

    The rootlets appeared to have been originally cylindrical
and about one-eighth of an inch in diameter; but they were
now compressed, and their outsides covered with a thin coat
ing of carbonaceous matter. On a careful removal of the
outside a delicate longitudinal stria could be perceived on the
rootlets; there also appeared something like a pith in their
middle.
    Altogether the rootlets could not be well distinguished from
those of Stigmaria. They also appeared to come from the

              the Carboniferous Strata near Wigan.”          265
stems in something like quincuncial order, like the rootlets of
the last-named plant; but of this circumstance I cannot speak
with absolute certainty. .     . . . ""' "' "         '  ".    . .
    The specimen No. 4 differed from the other three only in
its base, which did not terminate in the same club-shaped
extremity which they did; but after the joints had gradually
approximated it turned inwards, and it could not then be seen
whether it ended or was inserted into some other stem.
    In addition to the above there were many Calamites, both
in erect, inclined, and horizontal positions, but no leaves or
branches were satisfactorily traced to them.
    In the course of his examination of upright stems of Sigil
lariae in the coal-measures, the writer has nearly always found
Calamites associated with them. At St. Helens they were
abundant, and their bases were found in contact with the
main roots of Sigillariae. One of the authors of the Fossil
Flora, Mr. Hutton, in describing the Burdiehouse fossils at
page 24, vol. iii. of that work, states as follows: “Amongst
vegetables, the characteristic fossils of this deposit are Lepi
dostrobi, Lepidophyllites, Lepidodendra, and Filicites; the
rarity of Calamites, which occur but seldom, and of a dimi
nutive size, and the almost entire absence of Stigmaria, are
very striking to those who are accustomed to view the fossil
groups usually presented by the beds of the carboniferous
formation; whilst the profusion of Lepidostrobi and Lepido
phyllites of various sizes and in various stages of growth asso
ciated with the stems of Lepidodendra and those of no other
plant, is an additional argument for the opinion which has
 always appeared highly probable, that they were the fruit,
 leaves and stem of the same tribe of plants. Of Sigillaria, a
 plant which in the flora of the carboniferous group generally
 is of so much importance, we could not observe a trace.”
    In the course of his own observations, the writer has never
 yet been able to meet with a stem of Sigillaria of so small a
 size as six inches in diameter, or a Calamites of so large a size
 as that. Doubtless there must have been young Sigillariae
 whether or not there were large Calamites. Now what are
 young Sigillariae? This is a question which yet remains to
 be answered.
    It is now admitted that little is known about the true nature
 of the genera Sigillaria and Calamites, except that they were
 not the hollow succulent stems which they were once supposed
 to be.
    The rootlets of Calamites, as previously shown, if not actu
 ally identical with, at least very much resemble those of Sigil
 laria. In some specimens of this latter genus, especially those

266         º, Messrs. Frankland and Kolbe on the
of the species approa'imatus, figured and described in plate 216,
vol. iii. of the Fossil Flora, and the cruciatus, figured in plate
 19 of Brongniart's Histoire des Végétauw Fossiles, their root
lets are arranged in regular quincuncial order. In the largest
 Calamites that to my knowledge has been figured, namely,
that called Gigas, plate 27 in Brongniart's work before alluded
to, the ribs and furrows begin to appear very like those of
Sigillaria, and the joints show indistinctly. The termination
of the root of a Calamites is exactly of the same form as the
terminal point of a Stigmaria, both being club-shaped.
 º, I am not aware that up to the present time much, if any
thing, is known of the structure of Calamites; but if it should
resemble that of Sigillaria, it may tend to prove that Calamites
are but young Sigillaria.
    In our observations it must not however be lost sight of,
that no central axis or pith has to my knowledge yet been
discovered in the stem of the Calamites like that found in Si
gillaria. Both plants are proved to have had similar habitats,
and therefore it is very probable that they might have had
rootlets resembling each other without being the same plant.
Still, however, as Sigillaria was so long considered a separate
plant from Stigmaria, it is unphilosophical to take no notice
of the analogies of what are now considered distinct genera.
Although it will not by any means be safe to affirm that Sigil
laria and Calamites are the same plant from their analogies,
still it is conceived that sufficient evidence has been adduced
in this paper to prove that the latter as well as the former
plants i. generally grown on the places where they are
now found, and that the reason why one is so much more fre
  uently found in an erect position than the other, arises from
the circumstance of the stem of the one being much stronger
than that of the other. A deposit of mud on the branches
and leaves of the slender stem of a Calamites might weigh it
down and prostrate it, whilst the stout trunk of the Sigillaria
would resist such action and continue erect.
XLIV. Upon the Chemical Constitution of Metacetonic Acid,
    and some other Bodies related to it. By E. FRANKLAND,
    Esq. and H. Kolbe, Ph.D.”
THE researches into the constitution of organic compounds
      certainly belong to the most interesting in chemistry.
   ut they are always attended with more or less danger, and
those who, leaving the safer road of experiment, plunge into
the depths of hypothesis, and build up theories apparently

ingenious, though often, untenable, frequently stumble and
fall amongst a host of contradictions. It is a common error,
as experience teaches, into which young chemists are very apt
to fall, that, persuaded of the infallibility of their own views,
and blind to well-founded objections, they endeavour to con
vince by quick and ready argument rather than by solid rea
soning, and consequently they either offend others or feel
themselves offended when contradicted.                 . .... . . . ..  . "
   When in the face of this danger we endeavour to advance
views concerning the rational composition of some organic
acids which do not accord with those generally received, we
do it with a certain degree of timidity, and with the most
strenuous endeavour to avoid those causes of error which have
been pointed out. It is far from our intention to give a de
cided preference to the mode of viewing the subject here pro
posed, or indeed in any way to force our own opinion, nor
is it unknown to us that even these views leave many facts
unexplained; but we feel convinced that no detriment can
accrue to the progress of science by looking at subjects of
such importance with an impartial eye from all possible sides.
    The starting-point of our experiments was the idea recently
 expressed by Berzelius, that acetic acid might be considered
as a conjugate oxalic acid, as methyl-oxalic acid, C, Hs C, Os.
 If this view of the subject, which explaims so readily the con
 version of acetic acid into chloracetic acid, and the remark
 able reconversion of the latter into the former, and which has
been further confirmed by the analogous relations of chloro
 carbohyposulphuric acid and methyl-hyposulphuric acid, is
correct, then the question arises whether it might not be ex
tended to those other acids, so nearly related to acetic acid,
namely, formic acid, metacetonic acid, butyric acid, benzoic
acid, &c. We are of opinion that this question cannot a pri
ori be answered in the negative; on the contrary, it appeared
to us, after pursuing the subject further from that point of
view, that the manifold metamorphoses which the above
combinations undergo might be explained in a very simple
manner, and we consequently have submitted the question to
careful experimental examination; and we believe that we
have gained a fact in support of the theory of conjugate com
pounds in its application to the acids in question, by the ac
tion which cyanide of ethyle exhibits with alkalies and acids.
   When benzoic acid is supposed to consist of oxalic acid
with the carburetted hydrogen, C12 Hs (phenyle), as a con
junct, then it is evident that benzoe-nitrile obtained by Feh
ling” in distilling benzoate of ammonia, must be a cyanogen

 completely analogous to the well-known formation of cyano
 gen by heating oxalate of ammonia, and to the formation of
 hydrocyanic acid from the formiate of ammonia.
     Benzoe-nitrile, viewed as cyanide of phenyle, would then,
 together with the analogous body recently discovered by
 Schlieper+, valero-nitrile (Cs Ho Cy, cyanide of valyle), be
 come died to cyanide of ethyle; and as these bodies in contact
with alkalies are so easily transformed into benzoic acid and
valerianic acid, it is to be presumed that cyanide of ethyle
under similar circumstances would become transformed into
ammonia and metacetonic acid.
     We prepared for this purpose pure cyanide of ethyle, ac
cording to the process of Pelouze, by the distillation of sul
phovinate of potash with cyanide of potassium. The yellow
coloured liquid which passes overt was mixed with water,
and separated again by chloride of sodium, dried over chlo
ride of calcium, and lastly distilled in a bent tube freed from
air and hermetically sealed. Purified in this manner cyanide
of ethyle is a limpid colourless liquid, having an odour much
resembling that of the terrible cacodyle. The analysis of the
substance gave the following numbers:–

     To settle the question started above, this cyanide of ethyle
was added drop by drop to a tolerably concentrated boiling
solution of caustic potash, and the product of distillation re
turned to the retort as long as it retained any smell. During
this operation a considerable portion of ammonia was given
off. The alkaline residue distilled with sulphuric acid pro
duced an acid liquid, which, neutralized with carbonate of
silver, baryta, or lead, gave the corresponding salts of those
bases. We had previously satisfied ourselves, by a carefully
conducted experiment, that no formic acid was present in
the acid solution.
    The silver salt crystallizes from its aqueous solution in
small acicular prisms. It is sparingly soluble in water, and
    * Annalen der Chemie, lix. p. 15.
   t We found, in contradiction to Pelouze's statement, that cyanide of
ethyle is tolerably soluble in water; but when the solution is saturated with
common salt, it again separates unchanged and comes to the surface.

   The lead compound has the sweet taste of acetate of lead :
it does not appear to crystallize, but dries up to a tough

gave exactly the quantity of oxide of lead, corresponding to
the formula PbO, C6H5 Os, namely,–                                       .             .

   From the above analyses, there can be no doubt that the
acid product of the action of caustic potash upon cyanide of
ethyle is metacetonic acid. The same result is produced by
weak sulphuric acid (1 part acid to 2 P. water). The silver
salt prepared from the acid product of distillation in this case
exhibited the properties described above, and an estimation
of the oxide of silver gave the following result:- . . . . .
   I. 0-150 grm. when ignited gave 0-090 grm. metallic silver,
corresponding to 64:30 per cent. oxide of silver; the i.

   The mode of decomposition of cyanide of ethyle described

  The assumption will be rendered still more palpable, if,
 as there is little doubt, at a future period we are able again to
 produce cyanide of ethyle from metacetonate of ammonia.
     If, on the contrary, metacetonic acid is considered as an
 oxide of the radical Ce Hs, then it must be assumed, that
 during the process of oxidation the two atoms of carbon, in the
 cyanogen, amalgamate themselves, as it were, with ethyle, in
 order to form the new radical metacetyle. Setting aside the
 great improbability attached to such an assumption, to which
 there would be at present no analogous case, we feel justified
in giving preference to the former explanation, because it is
 the more simple, and because it completely agrees with the
 known transformation of cyanogen and water into oxalic
acid and ammonia; and if, as one of us has found, valerianic
acid, placed in the circuit of the voltaic current, by the
assumption of 1 atom of oxygen, becomes converted into car
bonic acid and the carbo-hydrogen Cs Ho, we consider that
our view has gained by that fact an additional support, and
that the acid in question contains that carbo-hydrogen in
conjugate combination with oxalic acid.
   The foregoing observations lead to a great simplification of
our hypothesis in regard to organic radicals, inasmuch as
they do away with the necessity of supposing a specific ra
dical for each acid belonging to an alcohol. The series of
radicals which are produced by the addition of one or more
equivalents of the carbo-hydrogen C, H2 to 1 equivalent of
hydrogen, namely C2 Hs, C., Hg, &c., the hydrated oxides
of which form the alcohols, are again found in accordance
with our view in the acids derived from them, conjoined
with oxalic acid. It may be conceived that the oxygen, in
converting alcohol or oxide of ethyle into acetic acid, first
acts upon the equivalent of carbo-hydrogen C, H2, which
alone distinguishes ethyle from methyle, and that the suc
cessive products of oxidation of this body take up the re
maining radical methyle into conjugate combination; thus in
the formation of aldehyde and acetic acid,

   Moreover, it cannot be denied that our ideas concerning,
the functions performed by compound radicals are very much
enlarged by these considerations. For when we find methyle
and ethyle combining like the electro-positive inorganic ele
ments with the electro-negative non-metallic substances, the
property which they also exhibit of uniting with oxalic acid,
hyposulphuric acid, and with other, perhaps even neutral,
bodies to form conjugate compounds, evinces such an extensive
range of properties as is nowhere to be met with amongst the
more narrowly defined powers of combination of inorganic
substances; and it is probable that nature, when she brings
forth the innumerable and manifold products of the organic
kingdom by a wonderful combination of those few elements
which are at her disposal, may likewise make use of these sup
posed extensive combining powers of the organic radicals, as
the simplest means of accomplishing her greatest works.

   aurantium). By Messrs. THOMAs H. RowNEY and HENRY
    How$.
       R. the materials used in the following analyses we are
       indebted to the kindness of Mr. Da Cumara, who had
sent it over for investigation from his plantations on the
island of St. Michel, being desirous to become acquainted
with the mineral constituents of the orange-tree, which forms
the principal wealth of his country. The analyses were per
formed under the direction of Dr. Hofmann in the laboratory
of the Royal College of Chemistry.
    To prepare the ashes in a fit state for analysis, the different
 parts of the plant were heated in an inclined, open Hessian
 crucible, until the carbon was consumedf.             The ashes thus
 obtained were mixed with a small quantity of oxide of mer
cury and ignited a second time in a platinum capsule over a
 spirit-lamp, in order to reproduce the sulphates, which in the
former process had been reduced to sulphides.
   * Communicated by the Chemical Society; having been read April 5,
 1847.
   + To obtain the ash of the fruit, the oranges were cut into slices, and
after separation of the seed dried on the sand-bath in a covered porcelain
dish, and then burnt in a crucible.

 272         Messrs. Rowney and How’s Analysis of
    The same quantity of ash served to determine the potash
and soda, sulphuric and phosphoric acids, perphosphate of
iron, lime and magnesia, silicic acid and accidental sand and
charcoal. For this purpose, the hydrochloric acid solution
was evaporated to dryness, gently ignited and extracted with
hydrochloric acid. The solution thus obtained was divided
into different parts. The first portion served for the determi–
nation of the potash and soda.
   For this purpose the acids, lime, magnesia, &c. were re
 moved by baryta, the excess of baryta by carbonate of am–
 monia, and the ammoniacal salts by gentle ignition. The
 residue, potash and soda, were estimated partly by separating
 them by means of bichloride of platinum (analyses of the
 ashes of the root and seed) and partly by the indirect method,
 namely, by converting the mixed chlorides into sulphates,
 weighing these and ascertaining the amount of sulphuric acid
 by means of chloride of barium (analyses of the stem, leaves
 and fruit).
    In the second portion, sulphuric and phosphoric acids were
 determined, the former as sulphate of baryta, the latter by
 neutralizing the filtrate from the former with ammonia and
 precipitating the phosphoric acid by means of sesquichloride
 of iron and acetate of potash. This precipitate was dissolved
in hydrochloric acid, a sufficient quantity of tartaric acid was
 added, and the phosphoric acid estimated in the form of py
rophosphate of magnesia, by precipitating with ammonia,
chloride of ammonium and sulphate of magnesia. The latter
precipitate, frequently containing a small quantity of iron,
 was redissolved in hydrochloric acid, and after    the addition
of some tartaric acid reprecipitated by ammonia. A third
portion served for the estimation of perphosphate of iron, lime
and magnesia. For this purpose the liquid was neutralized
with ammonia, some acetate of potash was added, and the
solution strongly acidulated with acetic acid, in order to keep
the phosphate of lime, which might be precipitated, in solu
tion; on heating perphosphate of iron subsides, from which
the sesquioxide of iron was calculated according to the for
mula 2Fe, Os--3PO. From the filtrate the lime was preci
pitated by means of oxalate of ammonia, and after the sepa
ration of the lime, the magnesia by means of phosphate of
soda. Chlorine and carbonic acid were determined in sepa
rate portions of the ash. In this manner the following expe
rimental numbers were obtained:—

  The preceding analyses furnish a new confirmation of the
fact first observed by De Saussure, namely, that the largest
amount of mineral constituents is deposited in those parts of
the plant in which the process of assimilation appears to be
most active. While the ash left by the root, stem, fruit and
seed did not exceed from 3 to 4 per cent, the leaves left
not less than 13 per cent. of fixed residue on incineration.
   Regarding the composition of the different ashes, the great
amount of carbonic acid found in the ashes of the root, the
stem, and the fruit is at once obvious; proving that not only
the fruit, but also the roots and stem, contain a large quan
tity of organic acids.
   From the composition of the ashes of the root, the stem,
and the leaves, the orange-tree belongs decidedly to the lime
plants. In these three ashes the joint amount of lime and
magnesia exceeds the quantity of the rest of the mineral con
stituents.   In the ashes of the fruit and seed, however, the
alkalies are as prevalent as they have been found in analogous
cases. The amount of phosphoric acid (23-24) in the ash of
the seed is considerable, as might be expected, still it is in
ferior to the quantities (34.81 and 42'02) which Mr. Souchay
found on analysing the seeds of the citron (Citrus Medica)
and quince-trees (Pyrus Cydonia). Nevertheless the ash of
the orange-seed is very analogous in composition to the ashes
of the last-mentioned seeds, as may be easily seen on com
paring their analysis 4.

 ellipsoid, which was assigned in the preceding articles of this
paper (see the Numbers of the Philosophical Magazine for
Jane and September 1847), the significations of some of the
recent symbols are the following. The two constant vectors
 1 and x may be regarded as denoting, respectively, (in lengths
and in directions,) the two sides of the generating triangle
ABc, which are drawn from the centre c of the auxiliary and
diacentric sphere, to the fixed superficial point B of the ellip
soid, and to the centre A of the same ellipsoid; the third side
of the triangle, or the vector from A to B, being therefore de
noted (in length and in direction) by 1–2 : while p is the
radius vector of the ellipsoid, drawn from the centre A to a

spectively denoted by the two tensors, T(-|-px?") and Tp ;

product of these two tensors, that is by the tensor of the

of the lengths of the diagonals, AE, BD', of the plane quadri
   teral ABED' in the construction, this rectangle under BD and
AE is equal to the constant rectangle under BD and BD', that
is under the whole secant and its external part, or to the
square on the tangent from B, if the point B be supposed ex
ternal to the auxiliary sphere, which has its centre at C, and
passes through D, D', and A. Thus T(p + 2×) is equal to

process for the retranslation of the geometrical construction*
of the ellipsoid described in article 34, into the language of
the calculus of quatermions, from which the construction itself
had been originally derived, in the manner stated in the 80th
article of this paper. Yet it may not seem obvious to readers
unfamiliar with this calculus, why the expression –pxpº was
taken, in that foregoing article 38, as one denoting, in length
and in direction, that radius of the auxiliary sphere which was
drawn from c. to D; nor in what sense, and for what reason,
this expression —pxpº has been said to represent the reflexion
of the vector-4 with respect to p. As a perfectly clear answer
to each of these questions, or a distinct justification of each of
the assumptions or assertions thus referred to, may not only
be useful in connection with the present mode of considering
the ellipsoid, but also may throw light on other applications
of quaternions to the treatment of geometrical and physical
problems, we shall not think it an irrelevant digression to enter
here into some details respecting this expression—pxp-º, and
respecting the ways in which it may present itself in calcula
tions such as the foregoing. Let us therefore now denote by
& the vector, whatever it may be, from C to D in the construc
 tion (c being still the centre of the sphere); and let us pro
pose to find an expression for this sought vector a, as a func
tion of p and of x, by the principles of the calculus of quater

 which expresses that the two vectors q and x are equally long,

  those drawn from the centre c to the points D and A. And

 where V is the characteristic of the operation of taking the
 vector of a quaternion; which equation expresses immediately
  that the product of the two vectors a -x and p is scalar, and
     * The brevity and novelty of this rule for constructing that important
  surface may perhaps justify the reprinting it here. It was as follows:
  From a fixed point A on the surface of a sphere, draw a variable chord AD;
  let D'be the second point of intersection of the spheric surface with the
  secant BD, drawn to the variable extremity D of this chord AD from a fixed
  external point B; take the radius vector AE equal in length to BD', and in
  direction either coincident with, or opposite to, the chord AD; the locus
  of the point E, thus constructed, will be an ellipsoid, which will pass through
  the point B (and will have its centre at A). §: Proceedings of the Royal

  therefore that these two-vector-factors are either exactly
  similar or exactly opposite in direction; since otherwise their
  product would be a quaternion, having always a vector part,
 although the scalar part of this quaternion-product (a –x)p
  might vanish, namely by the factors becoming perpendicular
  to each other. Such being the immediate and general signi
  fication of the equation (12.), the justification of our establish
  ing it in the present question is derived from the consideration
 that the radius vectorp, drawn from the centre A to the sur
 face E of the ellipsoid, has, by the construction, a direction
 either exactly similar or exactly opposite to the direction of
 that guide-chord of the auxiliary sphere which is drawn from
 A to D, that is, from the end of the radius denoted by x to the
 end of the radius denoted by a . For, that the chord so drawn.
 is properly denoted, in length and in direction, by the symbol
 a'-x, follows from principles respecting addition and subtrac
 tion of directed lines, which are indeed essential, but are not
peculiar, to the geometrical applications of quaternions; had
 occurred, in various ways, to several independent inquirers,
 before quaternions (as products or quotients of directed lines
 in space) were thought of; and are now extensively received.
    41. The two equations (11.) and (12.) are evidently both
 satisfied when we suppose a = x ; but because the point Dis
in general different from A, we must endeavour to find anothers
 value of the vector a, distinct from x, which shall satisfy the
same two equations. Such a value, or expression, for this
sought vector a may be found at once, so far as the equation,
 (12) is concerned, by observing that, in virtue of this latter
equation, ºr—x must bear some scalar ratio to p, or must be
equal to this vector p multiplied by some scalar coefficient w, .

may perceive in the way just now mentioned, that it denotes
 a vector of which the square is equal to that of x; and that, if
x be subtracted from it, the remainder gives a scalar product
when it is multiplied into p : so that, if we denote this expres
sion by a , or establish the equation (17), the equations (11.)
and (12.) will then be satisfied, and the vector a will have the
same length as x, while the directions of a -x and p will be
either exactly similar or exactly opposite to each other... We

length and in direction, two radii of one common sphere, such,
that the chord-line a-x connecting their extremities has the

by the elementary property of a plane isosceles triangle, we
may see that, under the same condition, the inclination of rº
to p is equal to the inclination of x to —p, or of —x to p ; in
such a manner that the bisector of the external vertical angle
of the isosceles triangle, or the bisector of the angle at the
centre of the sphere between the two radii or and —x, is a new
radius parallel to p, because it is parallel to the base of the
triangle (AcD), or to the chord (AD) just now mentioned. tº
And by conceiving a diameter of the sphere parallel to this 2
chord, or to p, and supposing —x to denote that reversed
radius which coincides in situation with the radius x, but is ,

construction, from A to c), while o is still drawn from centre

px'=x'p, and the equation of perpendicularity gives px"= —x"p;
hence the proposed expression -pxpº’ resolves itself into the
 two parts,

The part —x' of this last expression, which is parallel to p, is
the same as the corresponding part of —x; but the part + x',
perpendicular to p, is the same with the corresponding, part
of +x, or is opposite to the corresponding part of —x; we
may therefore be led by this process also to regard the expres
sion (17.) as denoting the reflexion of the vector —x, with
respect to the vector p, regarded as a reflecting line; and we
see that the direction of p, or that of —p, is exactly interme

but this is the equation of a sphere concentric with the ellip

a circle, or the plane itself is a cyclic plane." We see also that
the vector x, as being perpendicular to this W. 23), is one
of the cyclic normals, or normals to planes of circular section;
which agrees with the construction, since we saw, in article 36,
that the auxiliary or diacentric sphere, with centre c, touches
one cyclic plane at the centre A of the ellipsoid. The same
construction shows that the other cyclic plane ought to be
perpendicular to the vector ; and accordingly the equation

and therefore conducts to the same equation (24.) of a con
 centric sphere as before; which sphere (24.) is thus seen to
 contain the intersection of the ellipsoid (21.) with the plane
 (25.), as well as that with the plane (23.). If we use the
form (9.), we have only to observe that whether we change
 px to —xp, or p to — pu, we are conducted in each case to the
 following expression for the length of the radius vector of the
 ellipsoid, which agrees with the equation (24.):

 And because x*—tº denotes the square upon the tangent drawn
 to the auxiliary sphere from the external point B, while
 T(-x) denotes the length of the side BA of the generating
triangle, we see by this easy calculation with quaternions, as
 well as by the more purely geometrical reasoning which was
 alluded to, and partly stated, in the 36th article, that the com
 mon radius of the two diametral and circular sections of the
tellipsoid is equal to the straight line which was there called
 BG, and which had the direction of BA, while terminating, like
 it, on the surface of the auxiliary sphere; so that the two last
 lines BA, and BG, were connected with that sphere and with
 each other, in this or in the opposite order, as the wholese

 cant and the external part. In fact, as the point D, in the
 construction approaches, in any direction, on the surface of the
 auxiliary sphere, to A, the point D'approaches to G.; and BD',
 and therefore also AE, tends to become equal in length to BG;
 while the direction of AE, being the same with that of AD, or
 opposite thereto, tends to become tangential to the sphere, or
 perpendicular to Ac: the line BG is therefore equal to the
 radius of that diametral and circular section of the ellipsoid
 which is made by º plane that touches the auxiliary sphere
 at A. And again, if we conceive the point D' to revolve on
 the surface of the sphere from G to G again, in a plane per
 pendicular to BC, then the lines AD and AE will revolve to
gether in another plane parallel to that last mentioned, and
 perpendicular likewise to Bc; while the length of Ar will be
 still equal to the same constant line BG as before : which line.

    in any manner transposed, with only a change (at most) in the
   positive or negative sign of the resulting scalar; from which
   it would have followed, by a process exactly similar to the

 feels to render them, to some extent, complete within them
 selves, or at least intelligible to those mathematical readers
 of the Philosophical Magazine who may be disposed to favour
him with their attention, to the degree which the novelty of
the conceptions and method may require, without its being
necessary for such readers to refer to other publications of his
 own, he is induced, and believes himself to be authorized, to
copy here a few other equations from that short and hitherto
unpublished Southampton paper, and to annex to them an
other formula which may be found in the Proceedings, already
cited, of the Royal Irish Academy : together with a more ex
tensive formula, which he believes to be new.

in the ratio of two cubes.                                             .           .         ..          .

ever of the form 6n:#1. Ierred in my former communication
in not excluding cubic factors of this form.
* 3. If 2" is the highest power of 2 which enters into ABC,
and 2" the highest power of 2 which enters into D, then either
m must be of the form 3n+1, or if not, then m must be greater
than 3n.                                                                                          - -      - -
    These three conditions being satisfied, the given equation
can always be transformed into another,                                 tº

that wherever A, B, C, D, besides satisfying the conditions
above stated, are taken so as likewise to satisfy the condition,-

cases a prime, then the given equation will be generally inso

of which it will in any case admit, is the solitary one found by
making two of the terms Aw’, By”, Cz’ equal to one another;

 equations equally insoluble. For instance, becausea" + y^+ 2*

 where u, v, w are rational integral functions of a, y, x.
    Hence each of the factors must be incapable of becoming
 zero”.
    As a particular instance of my general theory of transfor
 mation and elevation, take the equation
                           a"--y”--22°= Mayz.
 Then, with the exception of the singular or solitary solution
 w = 1 y=1, of which I take no account, I am able to affirm
 that for all values of M between 7 and —6, both inclusive,
 with the exception of M = -2, the equation is insoluble in
 integer numbers.
    Take now the equation where M--2, viz.
                         a”--y” +22°-i-2ayz=0.
 One particular solution of this is
                         was 1 y= –1 z= 1.
Another, which I shall call the second f, is
                         a = 1 y=3 z= —2.
From the first solution I can deduce in succession the follow
Ing:
     a'- 1 I                 3y-5                   z= – 7

                         &c.          &c.            &c.
From the second,
                was — 10085 y=8921               z= —8442
                a =&c.            y=&c.          z=&c.
As another example, take the equation
                          a8+y^+62°=6ayz.
One solution of the transformed equation
                          w” +2vº-H.3tw”=6www
is evidently
                          tl= 1     was 1    was 1.

be reduced to   }(M-48s).     that this impossibility exists for all the factors

        ORE than a century after its introduction the first inven
          tion of the Art of Printing became a subject of long-con
tinued controversy, remarkable for the insufficiency and fallacy
of the most confident assertions resting upon pretended tradi
tions and unsupported conjectures. And, as Hadrian Junius
in 1575 first disputed the claims of Gutemberg after so long a
period had elapsed, so did Atkyns as late as 1664 first deny
the title of Caxton to the honour of having introduced the
art into our own country. Hence one of the writers in this
controvers rem ks that “the Art of Printing, which has

He first brought the steam-engine to the assistance of the public

seemed fraught with difficulties as great as those which Fulton has
overcome on one element and Stephenson on another. To take off
5000 impressions in an hour was once as ridiculous a conception as
to paddle a ship fifteen miles against wind and tide, or to drag in
that time a train of carriages weighing 100 tons fifty miles. Mr.
Walter, who, without being a visionary, may be said to have thought
nothing impossible that was useful and good, was early resolved that
there should be no impossibility in printing by steam. It took a long
time in those days to strike off the 3000 or 4000 copies of The

                                                                     -
 father, who had   hitherto assisted him, became disheartened, and re
 fused him any further aid, The project was therefore for the time
 abandoned."     [Why abandoned,     we may ask, if so feasible, and on
 the very eve of success *]
    “Mr. Walter, however, was not the man to be deterred from what
 he had once resolved to do.      He gave his mind incessantly to the
 subject, and courted aid from all quarters, with his usual munificence.
 In the year 1814 he was induced by a clerical friend, in whose judge
 ment he confided, to make a fresh experiment; and accordingly the
 machinery of the amiable and ingenious Koenig, assisted by his young
 friend Bauer, was introduced—not, indeed, at first, into The Times
 office, but into the adjoining premises, such caution being thought
 necessary from the threatened violence of the pressmen.        Here the
 work advanced, under the frequent inspection and advice of the
 friend alluded to. At one period these two able mechanics sus-,
 pended their anxious toil, and left the premises in disgust. After
 the lapse, however, of about three days, the same gentleman dis-,
 covered their retreat”, induced them to return,   ºft them to their
 surprise their difficulty conquered, and the work still in progress.” "
    Who would not infer from the above, that Mr. Walter,
   aying determined
having        erm        “to make a fresh experiment,”
                                                   pe     -   >     pur."

 suance of those which he had long before abandoned (not
withstanding his early resolution that there should be no im
possibility in it), and “courting aid from all quarters with his
usual munificence,” had been actually the person that enabled,
Mr. Koenig to pursue his labours on Mr. Walter's premises,
“un º the inspection and advice of Mr. Walter's clerical
friend,” and thus to produce his invention? Whereas, in
truth, Mr. Walter knew nothing of Mr. Koenig till after his
invention had been completed. He was merely the first
newspaper proprietor who purchased from the Patentees the
Printing Machines long before invented by Mr. Koenig. Of
these patentees I was one, and as I am now the sole survivor,
it devolves upon me to contradict any erroneous statements
and unfounded pretensions. I feel this to be the more ne
cessary, as already the misstatements of The Times are cir
culated, with additions and exaggerations, in other journals.
   * To me this story appears not a little extraordinary:-the “discovery
of the retreat” of Messrs. K. and B.! who were every day to be found su
perintending our factory in Whitecross Street.—R. T.

                of Mr. Koenig's Printing Machine. … ." i<U+017F> 299.
Thus, in an article in the Mechanics’ Magazine for Sept. 18,
copied into the newspapers, I find the following passage:–
   “No sooner were presses made of iron, than the idea occurred o
working them by steam; and the first to welcome the new and happy!
thought was the proprietor of a journal which stood in instant need
of some such powerful auxiliary to enable him to keep pace with a
circulation unexampled in the history of the press, and who, with
out it, would most assuredly never have been able to attain to that,
 º influence which for many years past has at once asto
nished and awed the world. Koenig, the ingenious inventor of the
 steam-press*, found in the proprietor of The Times his natural and
best possible patron. With the liberal aid of the late Mr. Walter,
 he produced a machine of somewhat gigantic size, but nevertheless
possessing a completeness of design and purpose which cast all other
surface printing-presses into the shade."            - * .     .. . .
                                                                ‘. . .     ... .
    And again—                                                         **    * * *
    “The steam-press has given occupation to many thousands, who,
but for its introduction, would have been standing idle, and who
ought, one and all, to bless the memory of Mr. Walter for enabling
the inventor to work out his ideas, and perfect his great and glorious
undertaking.”                                                          - -         -
    Now the whole of this is a fable.             Mr. Walter was 'no'"
“natural and best possible patron” of Mr. Koenig's, gave
him no “liberal º in producing his machine,” nor did any
thing whatever to “enable him to work out his ideas.” These
had all been worked out long before; patents had been taken.
out, a machine had been made, and was in º on the
premises of the Patentees, before ever, Mr. Walter, or an
other newspaper proprietor, was applied to and invited to
adopt it. § Perry of the Morning Chronicle                      º                    r
alleging that he did not consider a newspaper worth so many
years’ purchase as would equal the cost of machines. Mr."
Walter, “being a cautious man of the world,” but enterprizing,
“it being,” as his biographer says, “his habit in the game
of life never to throw away a chance,” when he had fully sa- .
tisfied himself by seeing that the invention was accomplished,
and in effective operation, consented to give an order for two
 machines, for the cost of which he paid us a certain sum, and a
rental according to the number of copies printed; and this rent
we received, until it was commuted for a sum agreed upon, ...,'
    I do not mean to charge ''. in the Mechanics’ Ma
gazine with any intentional misrepresentation. He has evi
dently been misled by the articles in The Times, which though
they do not directly assert all that he has inferred from them,
yet they imply as much. Thus a story gains in the telling,
   * Mr. Koenig's invention is very inappropriately designated by the terms
“steam-press,” and “the working of iron presses by steam.” Its construc
tion is wholly independent of the motive power employed. tºo .

 till the lios vague and unfounded suggestions, if uncontra
 dicted, are assumed as indisputable facts; and it would be
 recorded tha i Koenig was the Gutemberg of the new dis
 covery, Walter was at least the Faust or Schoeffer of the
 affair, or rather, both in one.           -
     I am convinced that Mr. Walter, were he living, would
 disclaim the pretensions that have been made in his name:
 and indeed he has done so in the announcement which ap
 peared in The Times, Nov. 20, 1814, the day on which that
journal was first printed by the machines, and which contains
 the following passage:–                          . . .
  * That the completion of an invention of this kind, not the effect
 of chance, but the result of mechanical combinations methodically
 arranged in the mind of the artist, should be attended with many
obstructions and much delay may be readily admitted. Our share in
 the event has indeed only been the application of the discovery, under
an agreement with the patentees, to our own particular business.” "
                                                                 .   . .  .  )
    “The time for effecting the great revolution in the art of
printing,” says Mr. Walter’s biographer, “did not arrive till
the year 1814.” Now it was in 1809 that, together with the
late Mr. George Woodfall, I joined Mr. Koenig and Mr.
Bensley in taking out patents”, the machine being even then
so far advanced as to satisfy us as to the prospect of success,
and to enable us to have the specifications drawn up. Koenig.
had gone on with Bensley, to whom I had recommended him
some few years before, up to the year 1809, when the taking
of premises and the purchase of lathes, tools, &c., and the
employing of workmen, with the salaries of Mr. Koenig and
his able and excellent assistant Mr. Bauer, led Bensley to in
vite us to a partnership in the undertaking. For several years
it occupied much of our time and attention, and cost us much
money (from which we had no return f) and much anxiety.
Each experiment suggested some improvement, and one im
provement led to others, so that additional patents had to be
taken out.       But with Mr. Walter we had none of us any com
munication, until, as I have before stated, the machine had
been completed and was at work on our own premises. º
    I have thought it right, under the circumstances, to put on
   * One of the four patents bears date March 29, 1810 (See Phil. Mag.
vol. xxxv. 1st Series, p. 319). It was taken out in the name of Frederick
Koenig, and was assigned by articles of partnership to the firm of Bensley,
Koenig, Woodfall and Taylor.
   t Mr. Koenig left England, suddenly, in disgust at the treacherous con
duct of Bensley, always shabby and overreaching, and whom he found to
be laying a scheme for defrauding his partners in the patents of all the ad
vantages to arise from them. Bensley, however, while he destroyed the
prospects of his partners, outwitted himself, and grasping at all, lost all,
becoming bankrupt in fortune as well as in character.

versa, the author shows that {u, a ) will be identical with {r-u, a 3,
provided (v, r) is identical with {r—v, r}, and provided also {u-v,
a-r} is identical with {s-r—(u-v), a -r}. But this identity
actually exists when T consists of elements of one kind only, and
when T' also consists of elements of one kind only. For, in that
case, every term of the series'<U+017F> v,      r) and every term         of the series
 {u-v, r-r) is equal to 1. Let the elements of the single kind
which T contains, be different from those of the single kind which
T' contains. Then the identity in question will exist, when S con
 sists of elements, finite in number, of two different kinds: conse
 quently, it exists also when T consists of elements, finite in number,
 of two different kinds, and T' consists of elements, finite in number,
 of one or two other kind or kinds; that is, when S consists of ele
 ments, finite in number, of three or four different kinds. And there
 fore universally, in the case as well of finitely plural, as of singular
 elements, the following law obtains:
                             {u, a ={a-u, a 3. . . . . . (XII.)
 Hence it follows that in applying formulas (IX.) and (X.) to parti
 cular cases, the labour of computation will be shortened by substi
 tuting for the variable the lesser of the two numbers u and a —u.
    8. The author next considers how many different combinations
 can be formed from a given set of elements, when every combination
 is to be constructed in conformity with a given type; in which type
 there are m different kinds containing v elements each, m' other dif
 ferent kinds containing v' elements each, m" other different kinds
 containing v" elements each, and so on; and where, consequently,
 in each combination, z, the number of kinds, is m+m'+m" + &c.;
 and u, the number of elements, is inv--m'v' +m"v" + &c. The type
 remaining constant, any combination conformable thereto may be
 altered, either by changing the particular z kinds which are selected
 out of the s given kinds; or, the kinds remaining the same, by alter
 ing the distribution of the parts v, v, v', ... (m) v', v', v', ... (m')w",w",v",
 ... (m") &c., among those kinds. When all the elements are plural
 without limit, the changes of the former description will be repre
 sented by

two of a 7th, and one element of an 8th kind, out of which it is re
quired to construct combinations, each consisting of three kinds with
five elements each + two kinds with three elements each + one
kind with two elements.      Of such combinations there can be formed
                        43–1 32-1 21–1
   9. If it be required to determine how many different combinations
can be constructed, each containing u elements of 2 kinds, and the
given elements are all finite in number; we must form all the differ
ent z-partitions of u : and each of these partitions being regarded as
a type, we must determine, by formula (XIV.) or (XV.), how many
combinations correspond to each of these types; and the total num
ber required will be the sum of all these particular determinations.
But if the given elements may all be repeated without limit, it
follows from formula (XIII.), that the sum of all the particular de
terminations may be represented by

determine (u, v), by taking the sum of all the particular determina

and the number of types to be formed is [2u, u,I; which becomes
[2s, sil, if w=s. If u > s, the upper limit of z is s; and the number
of types to be formed is [u-Hs, sil. (See articles 4 and 5, Section I.)
But, if the repetition is finite, some of these partitions may fail to
yield combinations.
   11. If the elements A, B, C, &c. represent different prime num

primes, or the powers of those primes, are divisors.
                            III. On Permutations.
   1. Let the given elements be of s different kinds. We can de
termine in two known cases, by an explicit function of u, when the
elements are taken u at a time, in how many different ways they can
be permuted.       The number of the permutations is denoted, when
there is but one element of a kind, by sul-i ; and when in all the
kinds the elements are plural without limit, by s”. When the plu
rality is finite, it is only in the particular case of all the elements
being permuted at a time, that there is a known formula to express
the number of their permutations.
   2. Every combination constructed on a given type, u-mv-H m'v'
 +m"v" + &c., will generate the same number of permutations,

Therefore, if the number of the different combinations which can be
constructed out of the given elements in conformity with that type,
is represented by Q, Q X P will be the number of the permutations
corresponding to the type and to those elements. If the plurality
be without limit,

Every different partition of u that may be formed within the limits

Qx P; and the sum of all these particular products, SIQ × Pl, will
show how many different permutations can be formed from the given
elements, taken u at a time.          The author illustrates this method of
computing the number of permutations, by examples.
   3. Let P     {:}   denote how many different permutations can be
formed when u elements are taken at a time out of s kinds; and P
 {u, a # denote how many different permutations can be formed when
u elements are taken at a time out of ar, a finite number of elements.

    Since correcting his paper for publication, the author has had his
attention called to the work of Bézout on Elimination (4to. Paris,
1779, p. 469), as containing a formula similar in structure to that
numbered VIII*. in the present abstract.
   Bézout investigates the composition of a polynome function of s
quantities, A, B, C, &c., consisting of terms which are of the form
Ap Bº Cr, and of every dimension from 0 to u inclusive. Let [s]"
denote such a polynome, complete in all its terms, and NCs]" the
number of its terms.     Then, 1st,

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.            311
    He also observes (p. 39) that when A*, Bé, Cº, &c. are the high
 est powers of A, B, C, &c. which a polynome, agreeing in other
respects with [s]", contains, the terms of such incomplete polynome
will agree in point of number with those terms in [s]" which are
not divisible by either A*-F1, or Bº-F", or Cy-F1, &c. The polynomes
from which Bézout proposes to eliminate certain terms, contain
terms of all dimensions from 0 to u inclusive. The terms which are
to remain after the others have been eliminated, and which are emu
merated by means of the condition, that they are not divisible by
certain powers of A, or B, or C, &c., may be of all dimensions indis
criminately from 0 to u inclusive. Bézout's object is exclusively
Elimination, and he makes no allusion to any other application of his
formulae.
   The polynomes considercd by the author, taken in their entirety,
agree in their general structure with those considered by Bézout;
but the nature of the author's inquiries led him to confine his atten
tion to the composition of those particular terms in a polynome
which were of the same dimension ; and to seek to express the
number of the terms, not of all dimensions indiscriminately, but of
each particular dimension separately. To show how it has hap
pened that researches, very different at their point of departure,
have, as regards one point of investigation, ended in nearly similar
formulae, the author proceeds to deduce his formula (VIII*.) from
the investigations of Bézout. Such a deduction, he conceives, might
readily have been made by any one to whom it had occurred to make
it; and the application of such a deduction, when once made, to pro
blems in Combinations, would have been much too obvious to have
remained long unnoticed.
   Expressions of the form above considered are regarded by Bézout
as of the nature of Differences; and the truth of this view of the
subject may be shown in the following brief manner.
   If p(a) generates W(u),[1–24 Jø(a) will generate V(u)—º<U+017F>u-2),

ON THE ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTION OF MINERALS, AND ESPE
                    CIALLY OF PRECIO US STONES.
         EBELMEN states that the first results which he obtained
      • related to minerals of the family of Spinelles.
   The method adopted by the author to effect the crystallization of
these compounds, is based on the property which boracic acid pos

sesses of dissolving metallic oxides in the dry way, and the volati
lity of this acid at a high temperature. It occurred to him that by
dissolving alumina and magnesia, mixed in the proportions which
constitute spinelle, in fused boracic acid, and exposing the mixture
in open vessels to the high temperature of a porcelain furnace, that
the affinity of the alumina for the magnesia might cause the separa
tion of a crystallized aluminate and the expulsion of the boracic acid.
The proportions employed were about one part of fused boracic
acid, and two parts of a mixture of alumina and magnesia, composed
so as to constitute the compound Al" O' MgO ; and from T}r to
ºr of bichromate of potash were added to it. The ingredients,
well-mixed, were placed on platina foil, in a cup of porcelain, and
exposed to the highest temperature of the porcelain furnace of Sèvres.
A product was obtained the surface of which was covered with cry
stalline facets, and the interior contained cavities sprinkled with
crystals, the form of which was readily distinguishable with a glass.
These crystals were rose-red, transparent, scratched quartz readily,
 and had the form of the regular octohedron without any modifica
 tion. They were completely infusible by the blowpipe. These
 characters, combined with the composition of the crystals as deduced
 from synthesis, appear to M. Ebelmen sufficiently conclusive as to
 their identity with spinelle.
    By substituting the equivalent of protoxide of manganese for
 magnesia, a crystalline product was obtained in large laminae, ex
 hibiting the form of equilateral triangles or regular hexagons. The
 author considers these as constituting the manganesian spinelle Al-O"
 MnO, which has not hitherto been met with in the mineral kingdom.
    Oxide of cobalt substituted for magnesia, equivalent for equiva
 lent, yielded crystals of a black-blue colour, in regular octohedrons.
 They also scratched quartz, but not so readily as the two preceding.
    In employing alumina and glucina in the proportions which con
 stitute cymophane Al” O3 G10, a mass covered with crystalline
 asperities of great splendour was obtained. This product scratched
quartz and even topaz distinctly ; it therefore possessed hardness
 comparable to that of natural crystallized cymophane.
    Certain silicates, which are infusible by the heat of our furnaces,
 appear also to be produced by the same process. Thus, on fusing
 the elements of emerald with half their weight of boracic acid at the
 same temperature as in the preceding experiments, a substance is
 obtained which easily scratches quartz, and its surface presents a
 great number of facets, the form of which is the regular hexagon.
    The author proposes to continue these experiments, but at pre
 sent only states in addition, that it is possible to produce at tempe
 ratures lower than those obtainable in our furnaces, diaphanous
 crystals, the hardness and external characters of which are analogous
 to those of precious stones; and he also concludes that many mi
 neral species may be formed at a lower temperature than that re
 quired for their fusion.—Comptes Rendus, August 16, 1847.

   ANALYSIS of THE GRAY COPPER FROM MoURAA IN ALGERIA.
      M. Ebelmen states that a copper mine, apparently of great im
portance, has been for some time worked at the foot of the defile of
 Mouraïa in Algeria. The veins are composed principally of car
bonate of iron and gray copper ; the latter sometimes occurring in
 compact masses and sometimes in crystals, the prevailing form of
 which appears to be a rhombic dodecahedron, but with numerous
modifications on the edges and angles.
      The specimens received by M. Ebelmen for analysis contained
a great number of very brilliant small crystals of gray copper, on a
gangue composed of carbonate of iron and sulphate of barytes.
 These specimens were digested for some time in warm dilute hy
 drochloric acid, which dissolved the carbonate of iron without alter
 ing the gray copper, the crystals of which were then readily de
  tached.
      Qualitative experiments, conducted in the usual manner, showed
 that the ore contained sulphur, arsenic, antimony, copper, iron and
  zinc: lead, bismuth, and mercury were tried for, but not the smallest
  quantity was found. No notable quantity of silver could be de
 tected; and the fact that M. Berthier found 0.0008 in 1 part of the
 ore, shows that the silver is very irregularly interspersed through
  the veins.
      For the quantitative analysis of this ore, M. Ebelmen employed,
with a slight modification, the method proposed by M. H. Rose;
and taking the mean of several experiments, he obtained the fol
 lowing as the composition of this ore:—

314           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
                    ANALYSIS OF KUPFERNICKEL.
    M. Ebelmen states that this mineral comes from Ayer, in the val
ley of Annivier (Hº Valais). It possesses the usual characters of
Kupfernickel. It forms compact masses which are perfectly homo
#. but exhibit no traces             of crystals; the ore is mixed with
  aminar carbonate of lime, which is easily separated by dilute hy
drochloric acid. Its density is 7-89.
    The analysis was effected by treating the purified mineral with
aqua regia. The sulphuric acid was precipitated by chloride of ba
 rium and the excess of barium by sulphuric acid. The arsenic acid
 was converted into arsenious acid by means of ebullition with sul
phurous acid, and the arsenious acid was precipitated by sulphuretted
hydrogen. The sulphuret of arsenic obtained was, after drying and
weighing, analysed by aqua regia to obtain the sulphur; by heating
another portion in a current of hydrogen, a minute residue of anti
 mony was obtained. The liquor freed from sulphuret of arsenic was
 concentrated along with nitric acid, and precipitated by excess of
 ammonia; an abundant precipitate of peroxide of iron was formed,
which retained a little nickel, as appeared from its colour.
    It was redissolved on the filter by hydrochloric acid, and the
 liquor was then treated cold with carbonate of barytes. The peroxide
 of iron only was precipitated; the carbonate of barytes, with which
 it was mixed, was readily separated. The liquor containing the
 nickel was treated with sulphuric acid, and after filtration it was
added to the ammoniacal solution of the rest of the nickel ; this was
precipitated by excess of potash, and after drying and calcining, it
was weighed, and its quantity indicated that of the metallic nickel.
    The ammoniacal liquor, afterwards treated with hydrosulphate of

 ON THE DEHYDRATION OF MONOHYDRATED SULPHURIC ACID.
  . M. Barreswil observes that anhydrous sulphuric acid has been
hitherto prepared by distilling protosulphate of iron or dry bisul
phate of soda. These two processes produce an anhydrous salt
and sulphuric acid.    The author states that he is not aware that an

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.            315
 attempt has ever been made to deprive concentrated sulphuric acid
 of spec, grav. 1848 of its water, without previously causing it to
 enter into combination and form a salt. The same may also happen
 when monohydrated sulphuric acid is employed in the preparation
 of fluoboric and fluosilicic acids, which are considered as substances
 having great affinity for water.                                     -
    The reaction which M. Barreswil employs he considers as ex
 tremely simple.      He mixes anhydrous phosphoric acid with the
 sulphuric acid of commerce, and leaves them in contact, and the
 mixture is afterwards heated: the combination of the two acids pro
 duces an increase of temperature, and some acid vapours soon ap
 pear; but this is prevented by proceeding cautiously, and keeping
 the acids in a freezing mixture: by distillation anhydrous sulphuric
 acid is disengaged, and vitreous hydrated phosphoric acid remains;
 the distillation is effected in the same way as the Saxon acid.
    A circumstance which struck the author in this operation, is the
 fact of the innocuousness of the mixture of monohydrated sulphuric
acid and anhydrous phosphoric acid, with respect to organic matters,
stich as paper and cotton, which are instantaneously destroyed by
the Saxon acid. The author considers this circumstance as a proof
that the sulphuric acid in the mixture is not anhydrous, but becomes
so when heat is applied.
    Even if the reaction above described possesses interest in a theo
retical point of view, M. Barreswil admits that as a manufacturing
process it is unimportant, and will hardly be regarded as a ready
method of obtaining anhydrous sulphuric acid. The high price of
phosphorus, and the difficulty of preparing anhydrous phosphoric
acid, are obstacles to the employment of the process.-Comptes
Rendus, Juillet 5, 1847.
            OBSERVATIONS ON SILICA.          B.Y. M. DOVERI.
   It results from the experiments detailed by the author—
    1. That the alkaline silicates, when decomposed by acids, and
particularly hydrochloric acid, deposit the greater part of the silica
which they contain if the acid in excess be added drop by drop;
whereas the same quantity of acid added at once does not occasion
the precipitation of the smallest portion of silica.
   2. That silica, once precipitated, does not redissolve in acids,
whatever may have been its origin, whether precipitated from an
alkaline silicate by an acid, or from fluoride of silicium by water.
   3. That weak acids, as the carbonic, sulphurous, boracic and the
vegetable acids, decompose the alkaline silicates at common tempe
ratures, and precipitate the silica either as a jelly or in gelatinous
flocculi.
   4. That very finely-divided silica, whether anhydrous or hydrated,
is capable of decomposing the aqueous solutions of the alkaline car
bonates, and dissolving in the solution at a boiling heat.
   5. That silica precipitated at common temperatures from a solu

316           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
tion of an alkaline silicate or from fluoride of silicium, is a hydrate
of definite proportions, the composition of which may be represented
by the formula HO, Si Os. This hydrate, when heated to 212°F.,
loses one equivalent of water, and is converted into another com
pound, HO, 2SiO3.
   6. That when a solution of an alkaline silicate is treated with a
metallic solution, a precipitate is formed, which is a mixture of hy
drate of silica and a metallic silicate; the metallic silicate being
entirely dissolved by the mineral acids, while the free silica re
mains undissolved.
    7. That a limpid and very strong solution of silica in hydrochloric
acid may be obtained by dissolving in this acid silicate of copper,
and precipitating the copper by sulphuretted hydrogen.
    8. That a solution of silica in hydrochloric acid, slowly evaporated
under the receiver of the air-pump, gives hydrate of silica (HO, SiO2)
perfectly crystallized in very small transparent needles, grouped
either in stars or tufts.-Comptes Rendus, Juillet 19, 1847.
             ON NITRIC MANNITE.           B.Y. M. SOBRERO,
    Since the action of nitric acid on organic bodies has been
studied, a number of substances of great interest to science have
been discovered ; but the arts have hitherto acquired only fulmina
ting-cotton, the fate of which is as yet uncertain.      Whilst the ques
 tion as to cotton is under consideration, M. Sobrero announces to
the Academy another body which is fulminating in the highest de
 gree, resulting from the action of nitric acid upon mannite—the
 nitric mannite, the composition of which has been already given by
 MM. Flores Domonte and Ménard.
    Fulminating mannite possesses the property of detonating by the
 stroke of a hammer with as much violence as fulminate of mer
 cury, and produces, during its decomposition, sufficient heat to in
 flame gunpowder. As soon as the author was acquainted with this
 property, he set about to apply it, and prepared capsules with it
 instead of detonating mercury for the discharge of fire-arms, and a
 fowling-piece was discharged by it.
    With respect to its use, the author has arrived at the following
 conclusions:—
    1. Fulminating mannite must always be cheaper than fulminating
mercury.
    2. It is more conveniently prepared, and does not expose the
 workmen to the great danger which attends the manufacture of
 fulminating mercury.
    It must be cheaper than fulminating mercury, because the price
of mamma is not very high; because in the preparation of mannite
an uncrystallizable residue is obtained, mixed with a little mannite,
which may be employed in medicine and the veterinary art as a
 purgative ; and because, according to the analyses of MM. Flores

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.           317
Domonte and Ménard, the mannite, in becoming nitric mannite,
must increase considerably in weight (from 100 to 225),
   It is less dangerous in preparation and manipulation: in fact the
preparation is merely accompanied with the disengagement of some
vapour of nitric acid.
   Fulminating mannite requires for detonation a violent blow be
tween two hard bodies ; heat gradually applied to it fuses and after
wards decomposes it, but without detonation. In fact it may be
placed on paper and touched with a red-hot coal, and fused without
detonation; the paper on which it is put may be burnt, and it is
decomposed without detonation.
   Lastly, fulminating mannite is decomposed by the blow of a ham
mer, without, as far as appears, producing nitrous vapours. It
seems to be entirely decomposed into carbonic acid, water and azote;
besides which it keeps indefinitely without undergoing decomposi
tion.—Comptes Rendus, Juillet 19, 1847.
                  ON THE EXTRACTION OF SILVER.
                BY MM. MALAGUTI AND DUROCHER.
   From the numerous researches which the authors have made on
a large series of specimens from different parts of Europe, they have
inferred the general fact, that all metallic compounds which accom
pany or are found near argentiferous minerals contain more or less
silver; so that they deem it an established fact, that silver is pro
bably one of the most widely-diffused metals in nature,
   The researches of the authors have been made on sulphurets,
arseniurets, arsenio-sulphurets, some metallic oxides, and even native
metals. This fact being established, the mode in which the silver
exists occupied their attention. As the subject appeared a difficult
one, it was simplified by inquiring in what state the silver existed
in galena, blende and pyrites, and they supposed it could exist only
in the native state, as chloride or sulphuret. Experiments appeared
to show that in these sulphurets the silver is not in the metallic
state ; and experiments still more numerous and decisive seemed
also to prove that the silver could not be in the state of chloride ;
and on this occasion they remarked a circumstance which has hitherto
escaped the observation of chemists:—They found that all metallic
sulphurets, properly so called, and even some arseniurets, possess
the property of decomposing a certain quantity of chloride or bro.
mide of silver. This decomposition is effected more or less slowly
 when contact is effected merely by water; but it is produced much
more rapidly, and in some cases even instantaneously, when the
chloride or bromide of silver is in solution.
    By comparative trials the authors succeeded in determining the
 decomposing power of a great number of sulphurets and several
arseniurets.    Thus—

       100        - - - -   cobalt          166       -  - -  -
    In operating with natural sulphurets, the authors remarked very
 considerable differences in their decomposing power. They attri
 bute these differences to the presence of small quantities of sulphu
 rets or arseniurets of very high decomposing power; and they sup
 pose they may sometimes attach to the molecular condition of the
 bodies. They found, for example, that a very pure and well-cry
 stallized blende from Königsberg possessed decomposing power
 equal to that of artificial sulphuret of zinc ; while a blende equally
 pure and as well crystallized, but coming from Radna, had a decom
 posing power which was twice as weak, and yet these two blendes
 were of equal density.
    The authors draw the following conclusions from the results of
 their experiments:—
    All pure metallic sulphurets possess the power of decomposing,
 under certain circumstances, a given quantity of chloride of silver,
 and even of other insoluble chlorides. This power appears to be
 modified in some cases by the molecular condition.
    The decomposition of chloride of silver by sulphurets may be
effected,—1st, by double decomposition; 2nd, by reduction; 3rd,
 by simultaneous reduction and double decomposition.
    Natural sulphurets sometimes exhibit very high absorbent powers,
on account of the presence of minute quantities of foreign sulphurets
or arseniurets, acting by the reduction of the chloride of silver,
   The decomposing action of sulphurets is exerted    º              On
the bromide of silver, and it is but slightly appreciable on the iodide.
   In these phaenomena the solvent exerts no influence; for the
same results are obtained, except as to time, by simple contact aided
by water.
   The general fact of the decomposition of insoluble chlorides by
sulphurets appears then to render it probable that, in natural sul
phurets, the silver is in the state neither of chloride nor bromide.
   Having then shown the improbability of the presence of metallic
silver or chloride in the natural argentiferous sulphurets, the authors
are of opinion that it must exist in the state of sulphuret; but if
this conclusion were correct, how does it happen that blende, pyrites
and galena, do not yield silver to mercury 2 Is not the sulphuret
of silver almost as readily acted upon by mercury as metallic silver
itself? The authors propose shortly to communicate the second part
of this inquiry to the Academy.-Comptes Rendus, Juillet 26, 1847,

LI. Researches on the Voltaic Arc, and on the influence which
   Magnetism exerts both on this Arc and on bodies transmitting
   interrupted Electric Currents. By M. AUGUSTE DE LA Rive,
   Professor in the Academy of Geneva, Foreign Member of
   the Royal Society, Corresponding Member of the Academy
   of Sciences at Paris, &c.”
     HE luminous voltaic arc occurring between two conduct
      ing bodies, each communicating with one of the poles of
the pile, is not merely one of the most brilliant phaenomena in
physics, but, from the numerous aspects under which it may
be regarded, it is also one of the most important.
   As a source of light, this phaenomenon, when exhibited in
a vacuum, enables us to examine what influence this particular
origin of the light employed may have in various optical ex
periments. Compared with the solar light, the light of the
voltaic arc presents some curious differences and also resem
blances. If, on the one hand, we find in it the seven coloured
rays of the spectrum, on the other the black streaks are re
placed by brilliant ones, and these are differently interspaced.
In this field of inquiry, much, or rather all, yet remains to be
investigated.
   As a source of heat, the voltaic arc enables us to study the
fusion and solidification of even the most refractory bodies in
vacuo, and consequently under circumstances exempting them
from oxidizing action and other chemical influences, which
usually result from the application of a high temperature in
atmospheric air. It likewise allows us to determine the effects
produced upon bodies at a high temperature, by various gases
or vapours, distinct from those which enter into the composi
tion of atmospheric air, and at different degrees of density.
   As an electro-chemical power, the voltaic arc may be ap

  plied so as to submit to the electrolizing action of the electric
  current gaseous media, which, from some experiments already
  made, appear capable of decomposition by this process.
     As a mechanical power, the voltaic arc, by bringing bodies
  into a state of minute division, and impressing upon them, in
  this state, a tendency to motion, places them in a favourable con
  dition for the study of their molecular constitution, and of the
  relations which connect this constitution with electricity and
  magnetism. The struggle that takes place between cohesion
  and the expansive force of the electric current, the reduction of
 matter to the molecular state, and the form and nature of the
 deposits resulting therefrom, are so many phaenomena capable
 of throwing light on the obscure subject of molecular physics.
     The few preceding remarks suffice to give some idea of the
 extent of an investigation embracing the whole range of
 experimental research on the voltaic arc under its various
 aspects, which I am far from pretending to have attempted.
 I shall confine myself at present to a few details, and especially
 to such as exhibit the action of magnetism on the voltaic arc,
 and on those bodies which transmit interrupted currents. I
 shall begin by describing some particular phaenomena which
 I observed during my study of the voltaic arc under various
 circumstances, while employing different substances as elec
 trodes, both in the air and in a vacuum; I shall then proceed
 to examine the action of a powerful electro-magnet on this
 voltaic arc, and I shall conclude by describing some remark
 able experiments also illustrating the influence of magnetism
 on conducting bodies, of whatever nature, traversed by inter
 rupted currents.
        § 1. Some Phaenomena concerning the Voltaic Arc.
    Davy was the first who produced the phaenomenon of the
voltaic arc with two points of charcoal. More recently,
Messrs. Grove + and Daniellt employed with success the
points of different metals, and arrived at interesting results:
I also published some experiments I made on the voltaic arct
in 1841. Subsequently, MM. Fizeau and Foucault observed
some remarkable facts of the same kind on the occasion of an
investigation into the intensity of the light emitted by charcoal
in the experiment of Davy S. The researches made up to the
present time, have already led to many results, of which I
shall consider only the most important.
    1. That the voltaic arc may be produced, a pile of greater
tension is required than that which is necessary for the ordi

mary calorific and electro-chemical phaenomena. The neces
sity of this condition proves the great resistance presented to
the passage of the electric current by the minutely divided
matter, whatever it may be, which connects the two poles.
    2. The luminous arc cannot exist, unless contact be pre
viously made between the electrodes, and unless these, or at
least one of them, be terminated at the point of contact by
points fine enough to produce in them an increase of tempera
ture. When this increased temperature is once produced, we
may, by separating the electrodes gradually and with pre
caution from each other, obtain the luminous arc, the length
of which will depend on the intensity of the pile. Daniell
discovered the important fact, which was confirmed by M.
Van Breda in a very recent investigation inserted in the
Comptes Rendus de l'Académiel, that without contact having
taken place, the luminous arc may be produced between two
electrodes placed very near together, by causing the discharge
of a Leyden jar to pass between them: this is owing to the
discharge being always attended by the transference of highly
diffused  matter,for
time necessary      which               circuit
                             closes the of
                       the formation            during the instant of
                                           the arc.                  w
    3. The enormous elevation of temperature which accom
panies the production of the luminous arc, is also manifested
in the electrodes, especially in the positive ones, which become
much more strongly heated than the negative.
   4. Matter is thus transported from the positive electrode to
the negative, a fact which may be verified with electrodes of
all kinds, but particularly with those of charcoal.
   5. The various phaenomena presented by the voltaic arc,
are modified to a greater or less extent by the nature of the
electrodes and by that of the surrounding medium. Thus
Mr. Grove adduces facts from which it appears that the pre
sence of oxygen is necessary in most cases to produce a very
luminous and brilliant arc. It results also from his experi
ments, as well as those of other philosophers, that when two
different substances are made use of for the electrodes, it is
not a matter of indifference which of the two is placed at the
positive pole.                                    -
   I now proceed to my own researches. I commenced by
studying the production of a luminous arc between a plate and
a point of the same material in air, and in vacuo. By means
of a micrometer screw I was able to make the point recede
from the plate very gradually, and judge of their mutual di
stance with great precision. The limit of distance beyond
which the luminous arc ceases to appear, is constant for the
   [* See also p. 538 of the bºrº,2Number of this Journal for 1846.]

same plate and the same point: when, however, the plate
communicates with the positive pole, it is, in general double
that which it is when the point communicates with the same
pole. But in proportion as the strength of the pile is greater,
the difference is so much the smaller, , , , , . . . . . .  . .
   With respect to the absolute amount of this distance, it is
very variable, depending on the strength of the pile, on the
nature and molecular state of the electrodes, and on the time
occupied in the experiment. Thus, with a Grove battery
composed of fifty pairs of plates sixteen square inches in sur
face, it is two or three times greater than with a pile of seventy
elements of two or three square inches. With metals easily
fused or oxidized, as zinc. and iron, it is much greater than
with platinum or silver. The duration of the phaenomenon
influences the result, inasmuch as the high temperature of the
electrodes allows them to be drawn asunder to a greater di
stance without breaking the arc. The same effect may be
produced by heating them artificially, by means of a spirit
lamp. It is evident from what I have said that the length of
the luminous arc has a relation to the greater or less facility
which the substances composing the electrodes possess of being
segregated, a facility which may depend upon their tempera
 ture diminishing their cohesion, upon their tendency to oxi
dize (which produces the same effect), upon their molecular
state, and lastly upon their peculiar nature. Carbon derives
from its molecular constitution, which renders it so friable,
the property of being one of the substances, which produces
the longest luminous arc.                      ** * *
   The deposits of the transported matter, form upon he plate,
when it is negative and the point positive, a species of very
regular ring, the centre of which is the projection of the point
upon the plate. This takes place equally, whether the plate be
vertical or horizontal, plainly indicating a determinate direc

negative electrode; in the air and       .."...".
the deposits always consist of the oxidized dust of the metal,
of which the positive electrode is composed. . . . . . . .
   I shall here enter into some details. A plate and a point
of platinum have been used as electrodes in a vacuum, in air
and in hydrogen. In a vacuum with a Grove battery of fifty
pairs of plates, which had previously been used, I had only a
very feeble effect, and particularly when the plate served as
the positive electrode. The point was hardly removed a mil
limetre” from the plate when the arc broke; to re-establish it,
it became necessary to renew the contact between the point

 and the plate, by touching another point of the plate, the first
 point which was touched appearing to have undergone such
 a modification as to prevent theire-formation of the arc. The
 same effect is produced when the experiments are made in the
 air, but it ceases when the power of the battery is increased:
 this is probably due to an augmentation ofcohesion consequent
 on the increase of temperature in that part of the plate which
 acts as the positive electrode. Besides, when the experiment
 is made in air; the voltaic arc is more marked and of greater
 length than when it is made in vacuo, at least if the battery be
 weak; for when the battery is powerful, composed, for ex
 ample, of fifty pairs of plates freshly charged, it appeared to me
 that the contrary obtained.” I did not, however, perceive any
 great difference; but the vacuum in which I experimented was
 far from being perfect; it was that of a pneumatic pump, en
 closing therefore highly rarefied air.
* In the latter case, that is to say, with the pile composed of
 fifty pairs strongly charged, and in highly rarefied air, a bluish
 spot, perfectly circular and presenting the appearance of a
 coloured ring of Nobili, was formed on the plate of platinum
 when it served as the positive electrode. The same spot ap
 peared in atmospheric air, but its diameter was one-half less,
 and its colours much less vivid. In hydrogen, no coloured
'spot was formed; its formation is therefore evidently the result
  of the oxidation of the platinum at a high temperature when
 acting as a positive electrode in the ordinary atmosphere, and
‘still more so, perhaps, in rarefied air%. When the same plate
 of platinum was made use of as a negative electrode, the point
  ...i.                 became covered with a white circular spot,
  formed of a vast number of minute grains of platinum, which,
 having been raised to a high temperature, remained adhering
'to the surface. The white spot, like the blue one, was much
 larger in rarefied air than in a vacuum. If the experiment be
  prolonged for a minute or two when the plate is negative, the
  rod of platinum terminating in a point, which is positive, soon
  becomes highly incandescent; its end is fused and falls on the
  plate in the form of a perfectly spherical globule. When the
  plate is positive and the point negative, the latter is less heated,
  and does not become fused; but the plate, unless it be very
 thick, is liable to be perforated: besides, as may easily be
    * This effect may possibly have been owing to the action of the oxygen

 first described under the name of ozone. Indeed, in this state the oxygen
  may attack those metals which are supposed to be inoxidizable; and M.
  Marignac and I have shown that this may be effected by causing a succes
 sion of electric discharges to pass through the oxygen, even when very dry,
 with which the phaenomenon of the voltaic arc has a great resemblance.

 imagined, the phaenomenon lasts much longer in the latter
 case. The light is less brilliant, but it is accompanied by a
 reflexion of a superb blue, which may be seen when the ex
 periment is made in the interior of a bell, whether the air
 be rarefied or not.    This blue reflexion is observed on the side
 of the bell, and is to be seen whatever may be the nature of
 the electrodes, or the colour of the light to which these give          º
 rise in the centre of the bell; only when this central light is
 very brilliant, it becomes slightly paler by the effect of contrast.
    I substituted for the platinum point a point of coke, but
 the plate of platinum remained ; this being positive and the
 point negative, I obtained a luminous arc more than double
 the length of the arc produced by the point of platinum.
 With respect to the arc, instead of its being a cone of light,
 having its base on the plate and its apex at the point, as was
 the case when the latter was platinum, it was composed of a
 multitude of luminous jets diverging from different points of
 the plate, and tending to various parts of the point of coke.
 This fact shows clearly the influence that may be exercised by
 the negative electrode, the function of which is very far from
being a merely passive one. Let me add, that although the
 strength of the pile was precisely the same as when the point
 was of platinum, not only was the luminous arc much longer
 with the point of coke, but the heat developed in the plate of
 platinum was so much greater that it was soon melted and
 perforated. The coke being positive and the plate negative,
 the length of the arc was less than in the preceding case, and
particularly so in air, where it was sensibly less than in a
vacuum. The heat generated was however still very great,
the point of coke becoming quickly incandescent throughout.
I ought to add, that with the point of coke, the luminous arc
was so brilliant that the blue light which I have mentioned
almost entirely disappeared, which was not the case with any
other kind of point.                                                ** *
    Leaving the plate of platinum, I adjusted a zinc point. The
effects were most brilliant, but of short duration, the point.
speedily melting. In common air, a deposit of white oxide
was precipitated upon the platinum plate; in highly rarefied
air (the vacuum of an air-pump), a black deposit was formed:
in both cases it communicated with the positive pole. An
iron point being substituted for that of zinc, equally produced
in common air a brownish-red deposit of oxide of iron, and in
rarefied air a deposit of black oxide.                         -
    I call the attention of chemists to these two facts, as well as
that of the oxidation of the platinum at a high temperature in
rarefied air. They appear to prove the influence which the
state of greater or less density of the surrounding oxygen may

            M. De la Rive's Researches on the Voltaic Arc,            327
 exert on the phaenomenon of oxidation and on the nature of
 the oxide formed. A plate and a point of soft iron were used
 as positive and negative electrodes, both in a vacuum and in
 the atmosphere; the same results appeared with a plate and
 a point of silver, a plate and a point of copper, and a plate
 and point of argentaneº. The blue light was perceived in
 all the experiments; coloured circles were likewise seen on all
 the plates when they had acted as positive electrodes in rare
 fied air. The silver and copper plates presented in this case
 very decided cavities, caused by the passage of the matter
 from the positive to the negative pole. The points became
 incandescent throughout when they served as positive elec
 trodes; whereas when negative, they were heated only at their
 extremities. The copper point when positive became isolating
 at its extremity, and it was necessary to excite it by friction
 in order to renew the experiment. This circumstance is pro
 bably attributable to the formation of a thin film of oxide.
 The point and plate of copper gave out a luminous arc of a
 beautiful green light, which contrasted in a remarkable manner
 with the blue reflexion visible in this, as in the other experi
 ments, Mercury was likewise employed, both as a positive
 and negative electrode. In a vacuum as well as in atmospheric
 air, the luminous effect was most brilliant. The mercury was
 excessively agitated, rising up in the form of a cone when it
 was positive, and sinking considerably below the positive point
 when it was negative. The quantity of vapour thrown off by
 the mercury during this experiment filled the bell so quickly
 that it was not easy to observe the details.
  ... I shall terminate this section by stating a fact which appears
to me to be important; it is the influence which the nature of
the metallic points forming the electrodes exercises on the
temperature which they acquire in relation to the production
of the voltaic arc. If the two points are of the same metal,
both platinum, or both silver, the positive one alone becomes
incandescent throughout its whole length. If the silver point
be positive and that of the platinum negative, the latter be
comes incandescent, and the silver one is much less heated.
Thus, when the voltaic arc is formed, the circuit must be re
garded as completed, and then it is those parts of the circuit
which present the greatest resistance to the current which
become the hottest; at first it is that portion forming the arc
itself, and then, in the rest of the circuit, the metal which is
the worst conductor.         But if the conductors be of the same
material on both sides of the arc, or if there be only a slight

     Davy was the first who observed that a powerful magnet
  acts º voltaic arc as upon a moveable conductor, tra

  this repulsion and attraction manifests itself by a change in
 the form of the arc. Even the action of the magnet may, as
  I have found, break the arc by too great an attraction or re
  pulsion exerted upon it, causing the communication which the
  transmitted particles establish between the electrodes to cease.
     The action which I have justmentioned is not the only one
  which magnetism exerts on the voltaic arc. I have already
 stated the curious fact, that if two points of soft iron acting as
  electrodes, be both placed within a helix formed of thick cop
 per wire of several coils, the voltaic arc developed between
  the two points of iron ceases the moment a strong currentis
 passed    º               wire of the helices, and reappears if this
 current be arrested before the points have become cold. The
are cannot be formed between the two iron points when they
are magnetized, whether by the action of the helices, or by that
 of a powerful magnet, unless they be brought much nearer to
 one another, and the appearance of the phaenomenon is ***.

 A plate of platinum was placed on one of the poles of the
electro-magnet, and a point of the same metal was placed ver
tically above it; the voltaic arc, was produced between the
plate and the point, the plate being positive and the point
 negative. As soon as the électro-magnet was charged, a sharp
 hissing was heard; it became necessary to bring the point of
-the plâte nearer to enable the arc to continue, and the bluish

- Copper, and still more silver, present a remarkable pecu
 liarity. Plates of these two metals retain on their surfaces the
 impression of the fiction that took place in the experiments
just described. Thus, when the plate is positive, that portion
  of its surface lying beneath the negative point presents a spot
 in the form of a helix; as if ...'...'. this locality

  time that it was uplifted in the i. of a cone towards the

  point. Moreover, the curve of the helix is fringed throughout
  by minute ramifications, precisely similar to the tufts which
  mark the passage of positive electricity in a Leyden jar. When
  the plate is negative and the point positive, the marks are
  totally different, being merely a simple point, or rather a circle
 of a very small diameter, whence proceeds a line more or less
 curved, forming a kind of tail to the comet, of which the small
 circle might be the nucleus: the direction of this tail depends
 upon the direction in which the luminous arc has been pro
 jected. º'           -ºttº
     When, instead of a plate and a point, two points are used
 for electrodes, it is evident that no visible trace of this phaeno
 menon can be obtained; but both the sharp hissing and the
 detonations may be produced, which latter are sometimes so
 loud as to bear a resemblance to distant discharges of mus
 ketry. For this the electro-magnet must be very powerful,
 and the current which produces the arc very intense. I had
 observed that when I took for a positive electrode a point of
 platinum, and for a negative electrode a point of copper, and
 placed them between the two poles of the electro-magnet, the
 production of the voltaic arc between the two poles was ac
 companied by a sharp hissing noise; whereas in the opposite
 case, the copper being positive, and the platinum negative,
 the detonations were heard, attended by a frequent breaking
 of the arc. On examining this phaenomenon more closely, I
perceived that the fact I have just mentioned was due to the
platinum becoming heated much more rapidly than the copper
when they were employed as electrodes in producing the vol
taic arc; and I have satisfied myself that in order to obtain
the hissing sounds, it is necessary that the positive electrode
should be at a sufficiently high temperature to experience a
commencement of liquefaction; for without this condition,
only a series of detonations are heard. The hissing would be
the result of the easy and continuous transport of matter more
or less liquefied from the positive electrode, whilst the deto
nations would be the effect of the resistance opposed by the
same matter to the disintegration of its particles when it is not
sufficiently heated. Numerous experiments made with metal
lic points, whether of the same or different natures, as silver,
iron, brass, as also platinum and copper, some of which be
coine heated sooner than others under the same circumstances,
have quite confirmed me in this view of the subject. It is
merely necessary to be careful, in order to produce the hissing
noise, to maintain as much as possible the continuity of the
arc when once the positive electrode becomes incandescent;

    heard in the ordinary experiment of the voltaic arc. It This can
    arise only from the change which the magnet produces in the
    molecular constitution of the matter of the electrode, or rather
    in the highly diffused matter which forms the voltaic arc.
    This action is besides shown by the shortening of the arc, and
    by the remarkable difference which it presents in its appear
    ance; it is therefore not surprising that it should also be capable
    of producing a phaenomenon such as sound, which essentially
    depends, on the variations in the molecular state of bodies.
     This view of the subject appears to me to deserve very par
    ticular attention: the results at which I have arrived, in pur
    suing it more closely, form the subject of the following section.
    § 3. Influence of the permanent action of Magnetism on con
         ducting bodies traversed by interrupted electric currents..., ,
        Faraday's brilliant discovery of the action exerted by mag
     netism on a ray of polarized light, when that ray traverses a
     transparent body submitted to the action of a powerful electro
     magnet, had no sooner been announced by its illustrious
     author, than the majority of philosophers saw in it a proof
     that magnetism, when at a high degree of intensity, has power.
     to modify the molecular constitution of all bodies. They
     consequently attributed the phaenomenon observed by Faraday,
     not to the direct action of the electro-magnet on the polarized
     ray, but to the modification effected by this action on the mo
     lecular constitution of the substance traversed by the ray. I
     was of this opinion, and communicated it to Mr. Faraday,
     who alludes to it in his memoir.    Desirous, however, of found
     ing this opinion on facts of a different kind, I asked myself if
     it were not possible to find in the electric current, an agent
     capable of performing the same function for opake conducting
     bodies that polarized light does for transparent ones. I had
     stated in my paper on the sound emitted by iron wires tra
     versed by interrupted electric currents, that the nature as well
     as the intensity of the sounds were singularly modified by .
     the molecular state of the wire submitted to the experiment.
     I had particularly mentioned the influence of temper and an
     nealing, of greater or less tension, and of temperature.o I had
     shown that iron wire, when under the influence of an action
     which renders it magnetic, does not emit the same sound as

opinion; ti           at sounds, roduced under the influence of mag
netism in the experiments on the voltaic arc, are owing to a
molecular modification              º:                action of the magnet,
and the more so inasmuch as the voltaic arc may be regarded
as produced by a succession of interrupted currents, following
each other with extreme rapidity, rather than by a perfectly
continuous current. I accordingly took bars of other metals
besides iron, as of tin, zinc, lead, bismuth, &c. I placed them
on the poles of the electro-magnet, and I caused an interrupted
current from a Grove's battery of from five to ten pairs to
traverse them. They emitted no sound as long as the electro
magnet was not magnetized; but as soon as it was, sounds were
very distinctly heard, composed of a series of strokes corre
sponding to the interruptions of the current, and analogous to
 that produced by a toothed wheel. "The bars were ei hteel
 inches long, and from nine to ten lines square. #. o
 copper, platinum, and silver produced a similar effect; a rod
 of iron did not emit a much louder sound under the influence
 of the magnet than it did when not exposed to this action. . .
      What appeared to me most remarkable was, to find lead, a
 body so little elastic, yield a sound as powerful as those pro
 ceeding from the other metals, when placed under the same
 circumstances. The position of metallic bars with respect to
 the poles of the electro-magnet did not in any way modify the
 result of the experiment; they might be placed axially, that
 is to say, in the direction of the poles, or equatorially, that is,
 across the poles; the effect remained the same, being merely
 weakened as the distance between the bar and the poles in
 creased. In order to hear the sound distinctly, when not very
 powerful, it was sufficient to establish a communication be
 tween the metallic bar and the ear by means of a wooden rod.
 In this manner the sound was not unfre uently heard rolonged
 some seconds, though growing constantly feebler, until it ceased
 entirely, after the source of magnetism had been withdrawn
 from the electro-magnet. Mr. Faraday has remarked an
 analogous fact in the action of the transparent medium on the
 polarized ray, an action which does not cease immediately
 with the magnetism of the electro-magnet. Is this prolonga
  tion owing to the magnetization of the electro-magnet not
 ceasing in a sudden manner; or to its return to its primitive

 equally, whether the bar had been under the influence of the

 lowing experiments, as to the preceding.
      The intensity of the sound appears to depend much less on
  the nature of the substance submitted to the experiment, than
  on its form, its volume, and its mass. Tubes of platinum, of
 . and of zinc, emitted more marked sounds than massive
  cylinders of the same metals. I wound a leaden wire in the
 form of a helix round a cylinder of wood; I did the same with
  a very fine platinum wire, and also with copper, zinc, and tin
 wires, taking care to place the coils of the helices so far apart
 that each should be isolated.                  Placed like bars and tubes,
 whether in the direction of, or across the poles of the electro
 magnet, these helices emitted very powerful sounds when, the
  electro-magnet being charged, they were traversed º, the in
  terrupted current. Tt was particularly surprising to hear the
 lead wire emit so strong a sound. A helix constructed with
   copper wire, covered with silk, and composed of several coils
   wound round each other, emitted a very intense sound; it
   also emitted one, but much feebler, under the action of the
   electro-magnet.                                                                                        -
... It is almost needless to remark, that in all these experiments
"an ordinary magnet produces the same effect as an electro
   magnet.       But what is more interesting, is to replace the action
   of the electro-magnet by that of a helix traversed by a strong
   continuous current, in the axis of which helix is placed the
   bar, the tube or the coiled wire, through which the interrupted
   current is transmitted. Experiments have shown me that in
   this case the results are the same; the intensity of the sounds
   is not very different, especially when tubes and wires coiled as
   helices are used.
       If, between the exterior helix and the metal submitted to
    the action, a tube of soft iron is placed, the effect is a little

heightened: it is neither increased nor lessened when the tube
is of copper, only in this case another sound is heard which
seems to proceed from the copper tube. This tube, however,
is not traversed by a current, but it is probably acted upon
 by the currents of induction, which the interrupted currents
 traversing the conductor placed in the axis of the helix pro
 duce in it.  I constructed a double helix formed of two thick
 copper wires covered with silk and coiled, each forming several
 circumvolutions, the one exterior to the other. In making a
 continuous current pass through the exterior wire, and an
 interrupted current through the interior one, I heard a re
 markably intense sound. In the reverse case, the sound ex
 isted, but was much weaker. This fact is evidently connected
 with the known property of helices traversed by electric cur
 rents exercising scarcely any magnetic influence exteriorly,
 whilst in the interior this action is very energetic.
    Metals and solid bodies are not the only substances which
 produce the phaenomena I have just described; all conducting
 bodies, whatever may be their state or their nature, appear to
 be capable of producing them. Thus, I have observed them
with pieces of charcoal of all kinds and shape. Mercury also
produces them in a very marked manner. I have inclosed
mercury in a tube of glass an inch in diameter, and ten inches
long : the tube was completely full and closed with care, so
that the mercury could have no motion. As soon as it was
traversed by an interrupted current, transmitted by means of
two platinum wires, and the electro-magnet or the helix was a
made to act upon it, a sound was heard remarkable for its
intensity. When the mercury was placed in an open trough,
instead of being inclosed in a tube, it likewise produced a
sound, and in addition there was seen on its surface an agita
tion or vibratory motion, very different from the gyratory
motion observed by Davy, which appears under the influence
of the poles of a magnet when traversed by a continuous cur
rent.                                                       * -
   Dilute sulphuric acid, and what is even better, salt water,
were successively put in a capsule of platinum placed on one of
the poles of an electro-magnet. A point of platinum immersed
in the liquid, served, together with the capsule, to send an
interrupted current through it. A sound was again heard,
but less distinct, on account of the noise produced by the
disengagement of the gas: still it was so clear that no doubt
could be entertained of its existence.
    It may perhaps be thought that in the experiments I have
just described, the sounds are produced by the mechanical
action of attraction or repulsion exerted by the electro-magnet

          M. De la Rive's Researches on the Voltaic Arc.         335
on the substance traversed by an interrupted current, and
that, consequently, magnetism has no more share in the phae
nomenon than a finger might be supposed to have, when
pressing on a sonorous cord. The simple description of the
experiments shows this interpretation to be inadmissible." In
the first place, the sound is the same with the wires in a helix,
 whether these wires be stretched or not, or whether they be
 of lead, platinum, or brass. Besides, how could this account
 for the sound produced in large masses, especially in liquids,
 such as mercury, and for the fact, that the position of the
 conductor traversed by the interrupted current with regard to
 the poles of the electro-magnet does not exert any influence
 on the phaenomenon 2 Further, it must be remarked that the
 sound in question is not a musical sound, such as would be
produced by a string or mass made to vibrate by a cause acting
exteriorly at its surface; it is a series of sounds corresponding
 exactly to the alternations of the passage of the current; like
 a species of collision of the particles amongst themselves.
 Thus, the phaenomenon is molecular; and it leads to the de
 monstration of two important principles.
    The first principle is, that the passage of the electric current
modifies, even in solid bodies, the arrangement of the par
ticles; a principle which I have already deduced from the ex
periments contained in my preceding memoir on this subject.
The second principle is, that the action of magnetism, under
whatever form it may be exerted, modifies alike the molecular
constitution of all bodies, and that this modification lasts as
long as the cause producing it endures, and only ceases with
it. What is the nature of these two modifications 2          This is
what we must endeavour to investigate and to ascertain. I pur
pose to engage in this inquiry, and indeed I have already made
some attempts of which it would, however, be premature to
give any account. I shall confine myself at present to a single
remark, which does not appear to me to be devoid of interest:
it is, that the influence of magnetism on all conducting bodies
seems to impress on them, as long as it lasts, a molecular
constitution similar to that which iron, and generally all bodies
susceptible of magnetism possess naturally; for it developes
in them the property of producing, when traversed by inter
rupted currents, sounds identical with those emitted also by
iron and other magnetic bodies when transmitting these cur
rents, but produced in these last without requiring the action
of a magnet.

LII. Analyses of the Ashes of Rough Brown Sugar and Mo
              lasses. By Thomas Richardson*.
DURING          some inquiries which I had occasion to make in
       the manufacture of an artificial manure for the sugar
cane, it was necessary to know the composition of the . of
coarse brown sugar and molasses as imported into this country.
The results may be interesting to some of the readers of your
Journal.

       HAVE been for some time engaged upon a work in which
        you may perhapsº feel isome interest, —it is the exact de
termination of the difference of longitude between New York,
Philadelphia and Washington,                              K- *.
                                                                  by means of the magnetic

        of Longitude by means of the Electrici<U+017F>elegraph. 339
 telegraph. Morse's magnetic telegraph has been in operation
 between these places for a considerable time, and Prof. Bache
 proposed to use the line for the transmission of signals for the
 comparison of our local times for the use of the coast survey.
 Accordingly I erected a temporary observatory last season as
 near to this city as I conveniently, gould, and set up a transit
 instrument and clock. A wire º my ob
 servatory to the telegraph-office, thus, connecting me with the
 regular Philadelphia line. A wire was also carried from the
 Philadelphia telegraph-office to the High School Observatory
 in Philadelphia, and another wire was carried from the Wash
 ington telegraph-office to the National Qbservatory. Thus
 three observatories, at New York, Philadelphia, and Wash
ington, were in telegraphic communication; and having de
termined our local times by astronomical observations, we
only needed some signal which could be heard simultaneously
at the three places. This signal was afforded by the click of
a magnet in the usual mode of telegraphic communication.
Our plan of operation is as follows:—At ten in the evening,
when the usual business of the telegraph company is concluded,
our three observatories are put in communication with each
other. After corresponding with each other long enough to
ascertain that everything is in good order, New York com
mences giving clock signals. At the commencement of a
minute by my clock I strike the key of my register, and a click
is heard simultaneously at New York, Philadelphia, and
Washington. The three observers record the time each by
his own clock. At the expiration of 10* I give a similar sig
nal, and all three record; after another 10* I do the same,
and so on to twenty signals. Having waited one minute,
Philadelphia repeats the same series of signals, and all record
the time. We then wait another minute, and Washington
repeats the same signals. Thus we have obtained sixty com
parisons of our clocks, which will give our difference of lon
gitude with as great accuracy as we can determine our local
timeS.        * *       *\ . . . . . .      }   .. .. . . . . . . .
   In our first experiments we met with a great many disap
pointments, as might have been anticipated from the novelty
and delicacy of the undertaking; but we have triumphed
over them all. On five different nights we have transmitted
good signals back and forth, and we propose to continue the
comparisons until a further degree of accuracy is not to be
expected. The errors of our clocks have not yet been rigd
rously computed, and we have not obtained final results; b
we have made sufficient comparisons to know that the results
of different nights agree remarkably well with each other. I

think the extreme discrepancy of different nights’ work will
amount to only a smallifraction of a second. It appears to
me that this mode of determining differences of longitude
must supersede every other method between places which are
connected by a telegraphic wire. The observations can be
repeated indefinitely, and I think the longitude can be deter
mined with, a precision fully equal to that of the local times.
I presume the same cannot be said of any other method yet
practised. I have not heard of this method being tried in
any part of Europe, though the application is very obvious.
Can you inform me of any such trials?           *
   In my former correspondence with you, and in my printed
papers, I have more than once alluded to the importance of a
combined movement in this country for meteorological obser
vations. I am happy to say that the prospect of such a com
bination is brightening. You are probably aware that the
Smithsonian Institution has been organized, and Prof. Joseph
Henry has been placed at the head of it. The plan of orga
nization is to appropriate & 15,000 a-year to the promotion
of original researches. Prof. Henry is disposed to include in
this plan a grand meteorological campaign, to continue for
three years, to cover the entire area of the United States
with the greatest possible number of observers: we want 300,
and I think they could be obtained. I have been drawing up
a paper for Prof. Henry which will be placed before the
Smithsonian Institution, and also before Congress the coming
winter.   I think the plan will be carried into execution, pro
vided we can obtain the co-operation of the British Govern
ment. You know from the papers which I have sent you that
our great storms frequently extend far to the northward of
the United States. When the centre of a storm travels along
the valley of the St. Lawrence, its margin often extends to the
Gulf of Mexico. Observations spread over the entire United
States would frequently include only half the area of a violent
winter storm ; and this is the class of storms from which most
is to be expected, because their phaenomena are most strongly
developed. Unless therefore we could obtain simultaneous
observations from the British possessions on the north of us,
we should feel that our observations were deprived of more
than half their value. Will you not see if the British Govern
ment and the Hudson's Bay Company cannot be induced to
co-operate with us? What I propose is, that at every go
vernment station a register should be kept for a period of one,
two, or three years. . . I should hope 100 such stations could
be procured. The first cost of the instruments would not be

 IT      º: that the resolution of equations of the fifth           and
       higher degrees into factors, one of which is of the second
 degree, depends upon the solution of the proposed equation
 itself. This circumstance appears to me deserving of notice,
 as it seems to indicate the impossibility of solving such equa
 tions in finite terms. Suppose

 Multiplying the two factors, and comparing the result with
 the first member, we find
 ºb-a”-Hf=A, c-ab-Haf-B, bf–ac- C, cf-D.
  Eliminating b and c from these, we have
      ºut-              2af”—(a^+ Aa-HB)f+D=0
-*  *       -           jº–(a^+A)fº-H Cf--Da-0.

                (a^+Aa–B)fº-(2Ca–D)f–2Da”=0.
 Eliminating fº by 24fº-(a^+ Aa-i-B).f-D, we shall have
 two equations, in which f will be only of the first degree;
and then, by eliminating it from these, there results an equa
  tion in a of the tenth degree; and it is obvious that f, c, and
 b will be determined from a by simple equations.
... Now let at, a, &c. be the roots of the equation in a, and
 a'i, a 2, &c. those of (1.); then, since a”—aw-Hif-0 must con

                  (g-22B)#48*A*(g+22B)–84A*B=0.
By making g--22B=v in the first of these examples, and
gl-22B=vº in the second, the equations in v are similar to
those in w, and are no way in a more solvable form. .
      Let us now take the equation of the sixth degree,
    a 6-H Aa" + Barº-H Crº-HDai-H E= (a^+aa’--ba”--cr-H d)
                 (w”—aw-Hºf)=0.

    344.         The Rev. B. Bromwin on the Algebraic
    There are fifteen ways in which this may be done, and con
    sequently the equation in a will be of the fifteenth degree. As
    before,
    a1 = a1 + æ2, a2=41 + 4's, as=41 +44, a 4-a’i + æs, as = a + a 6,
    &c., and          * * * * *
                        0=a'l-Fara-Ha's-Hara-Ha's-Fag.
    If we eliminate aris a 2, &c. from these sixteen equations, we
    shall have ten resulting equations between ai, az, &c., which
    will give ag, az, &c. in terms of the first five of these quantities.
    The equation of the fifteenth degree is therefore reducible to
    one of the fifth, or
               *    a”--ma”--na”--pa”--qa +1=0,
    where                               -
                    —m = a1 + as + as + a_i + as–4a'i.
    The determination of m then will be the same thing as solving
    the given equation of the sixth degree. And it is easy to see
    that we shall arrive at results precisely the same in equations
    of a still higher degree.
       If we resolve the given equation into the factors w8+aw”
     + ba + c and wº—aa”--fir --g, we shall have
                a1=a' + re-Ha's,    a2-al-Ha'a-Ha'a, &c.,
    and the equation in a will be of the twentieth degree. But
    since an=–a1, als--a, &c., the equation in a” will be only
    of the tenth degree. The reduced equation however, whether
. . we find by it a or a”, will be of a higher degree than the fifth.
       Let us now return to (1.), or the equation of the fifth de
    gree, in order to find Lagrange's hi equation of the sixth
    degree.

 LV." Letter from Capt. J. H. LEFRoy, R.A., Director of
        the Magnetic Observatory of Toronto in Canada, to Lieut.-
        Colonel SABINE, R.A., on a great Magnetic Disturbance on
        the 24th of September 1847.
                                                                             Observatory, Toronto,
             MY DEAR Colon EL,                                                September 24, 1847.
This day has been distinguished by a greater disturbance
             than any we have had yet. The observed range of De
clination was 4° 2'; and I have little doubt that the actual
range was greater, as the non-commissioned officer on duty,
when he found that the movement was beyond the scale of
the Observatory declinometer, lost time in sending for me,
instead of at once lighting the lamp of the transportable one,
and following it up on that. The observed range of horizontal
force was over 600 divisions, or 0.052 of the horizontal force
The day has been raw and cloudy, with occasional rain, so that
if an aurora existed, it could not have been seen.                                     The disturb
ance seems to have begun between 21" and 22" Göttingen time
on the 23rd, as the observation at 22" was decidedly unusual;
but extra observations did not commence until 23h 20m.                                         The
extreme disturbance began about Oh 35m on the 24th, when
both the largedeclinometerand large bifilar went off their scales.

             Disturbance on the 24th of September 1847.                 34?
At this time I was called, and we began to observe the trans
portable declinometer and bifilar. The last also went off the
scale. The lowest reading of the former was 6925 at 1" On
Gött., and the highest 1126-0 at 1.h45*: this gives a range of
3° 36'7; but at a subsequent period (5h on Gött.) a reading of
1177.2 was obtained, thus giving the enormous range of
4° 2'-3°. I did not take a reading of your compass; but
looking hastily at it, I perceived that during the great shock
it was ranging more than 3° 20' from its usual position." As
both bifilar scales were exceeded, we can only say that the
range of that element between Oh and tº Gött. exceeded 600
divisions, or 0.052 of its whole amount, on the testimony of
two instruments; a fact which cannot, I think, but make it a
most interesting question, what is the nature of a force sub
ject to such immense variations, and how can they occur with
out affecting or being affected by the other physical agents in
the globe?" This disturbance was attended by a great degree
of motion in the magnets, a peculiar mechanical agitation,
which they only exhibit on rare occasions; it lasted, more or
less, down to 12" Gött.         As the results have not been made
up, I cannot state precisely the range of inclination, but per
haps may do so before I close this.
    After some little trouble, I think we have got Dr. Robin
son's Anemometer into beautiful working order. If the prin
ciple on which the velocity is estimated is correct, as we must
feel confident it must be, I think it has a great superiority over
any other instrument of the kind yet invented. The facility
and precision with which the velocity is measured, and the
beautiful manner in which sudden changes are shown, together
with the large scale on which directions are marked, make it
a pleasure to use it, and make Osler's instrument look quite
 clumsy beside it; it is a most elegant instrument, and will give
diurnal curves of velocity with a precision we have never
attained before.       I found on careful examination that Osler's
anemometer, which has been up seven years, was much the
 worse for wear, and not in a condition to give a satisfactory
comparison with the other; we have therefore, with a good
 deal of difficulty, taken it down. I have put it into the hands
of an engineer here, and he is to refit all the essential parts,
particularly the shoulder and collar of the vane, which were
 worn, and made the vane unsteady: we shall then be able to
compare pressures and velocities.                         -  -
                   Believe me, my dear Colonel,

 LVI. on the Decomposition of Valerianic Acid by the Vol
 * **         taic Current,     By H. Kolb E, Ph.D.”
THE very remarkable            changes which a series of organic
        compounds undergoes by means of the voltaic current,
 have induced me to make that mode of decomposition the
 subject of a thorough investigation. As however the nume
rous difficulties which present themselves in researches of
this nature, and the immense extent of the field which opens
 before us, do not admit of the results being communicated
 in a complete and connected form, I beg to lay before the
 Chemical Society a short preliminary notice of the changes
which valerianic acid undergoes when exposed to the oxidizing
action of the voltaic current, reserving a more complete de
scription of the products obtained till the investigation shall
have been brought to a close.
     When the voltaic current, excited by six pairs of Bunsen's
carbo-zinc battery, is permitted to act on a concentrated neu
tral solution of valerianate of potash in the cold, two plates
of platinum forming the electrodes, a brisk evolution of gas
takes place simultaneously from both ; the gases evolved
 consist of hydrogen, carbonic acid and a new carbo-hydrogen,
but contain no traces of oxygen gas as long as the solution
of valerianate of potash does not become too much exhausted.
At the same time a light oily liquid separates at the surface,
having an agreeable aethereal odour, and the alkaline solution
ultimately consists chiefly of carbonate and bicarbonate of
operationthe
potash,     in latter          form.generally separates during the
                        of which
                 a crystalline                                     f
 º The neutral aethereal oil is a mixture of two compounds;
the one containing oxygen, the other perfectly free from it.
By the action of an alcoholic solution of potash the former is
decomposed, and the latter can then, by means of water, be
separated unchanged. In the pure state it exists in the form
of a light colourless aethereal oil, possessing an agreeable
aromatic smell. It is insoluble in water, but soluble in al
cohol and aether; it boils at 108°C, without decomposition,
and has the composition Cs H9. Oxygen and iodine are with
out action upon it, but chlorine, bromine, and fuming nitric
acid form with it products of substitution.
    The oil containing oxygen, which in the first instance was
found mixed with this substance, I have not yet been able to
obtain in a pure state; but several circumstances render it
more than probable that it is formed by the union of vale
rianic acid with the oxide of the above carbo-hydrogen. An

1847.
      Communicated by the Chemical Society; having been read April 19,

   Dr. Kolbe on the Decomposition of Valerianic Acid.        349
alcoholic solution of potash treated with it is found to con
tain as a product of decomposition a considerable amount of
valerianate of potash. But on account of the small quantity
of material which has been at my disposal, I, have not suc
ceeded in separating the alcohol Cs Hio O2, which must have
been formed at the same time. . .     . . . , ,, ,,, , , ,
   The gaseous carbo-hydrogen, which is evolved with the hy
drogen, is a substance analogous to olefiant gas; it is cha
racterized by a peculiar aethereal smell, and has a specific
gravity double that of olefiant gas. It unites with chlorine
even in the dark, forming a heavy oily liquid, having a marked
similarity to chlorelayl, and is generally composed of a mix
 ture of several products of substitution. Its rational com
position is expressed by the formula Cs Hs. The changes
which valerianic acid undergoes, in accordance with the fore
going experiments, are capable of a very simple explanation,
if we consider that acid as a conjugated combination of the
carburetted hydrogen, or the radical Cs Hg with oxalic acid,
in a similar manner to the new view taken of the constitution
of acetic acid.     For whilst by the addition of one atom of
oxygen oxalic acid becomes converted into carbonic acid, this
 radical is set free; but a portion of it unites with the excess
 of oxygen to form an oxide, and this enters into combination
 with a portion of undecomposed valerianic acid, giving rise
 to a new aether, Cs HoO + Cs Ho C, Os:
    Another portion of the radical is probably decomposed at
 the moment of its formation, in consequence of the conco
 mitant evolution of heat into hydrogen and the gaseous carbo
 hydrogen Cs Hs. This latter view is supported by the fact,
 that if the temperature of the solution of valerianate of potash
 exceeds a certain point during the decomposition, not a single
 drop more of the aetherial oil is produced.
    The following formula will throw light on this decompo
 sition :-
               KO+C, H, C, O, U <U+017F> KO-H2CO,
                                O<U+017F> TUC, Hg.
    Both butyric and acetic acids are acted on in a similar
 manner to valerianic acid; the products of decomposition of
 acetic acid are all gaseous, and appear to contain oxide of
 methyle. Butyric acid gives in addition to the gaseous com
 pounds a volatile oil composed of Ce Hz.
    The minute description of this product will form the sub
 ject of a future memoir.                -

 the late session in the laboratory of Dr. Lyon Playfair, as

LVII. An      Account of Experiments with Galvanic couples

                              º! . . .
IN the years 1845 and 1846, I published in              the Edinburgh
    Philosophical Journal two series of experiments, made
with a view to prove that the action of the water battery was
maintained by absorbing oxygen from the atmosphere. Some
of these experiments+ show that it is the oxygen only that is
drawn from the atmosphere, and that the presence of the
other component parts is unnecessary. But there was one
given to show that zinc and copper elements placed in a her
metically sealed tube along with pure water did not act, there
being no flocculent deposit of oxide of zinc, which is formed
in abundance when a minute aperture admits the atmosphere
to the contents of the tube. After a lapse of two years, I ex
amined an arrangement of this kind which had been her
metically sealed since December 1844; there was no apparent
change, the water was transparent, and the metals bright.
I had scarcely put the tube down when it burst with violence;
this fact immediately satisfied me that the water battery must
have a true decomposition of water action when it acts on
zinc associated with copper or any other metal less oxidizable
than the copper, independent of the much more extensive
effect due to atmospheric oxygen. It is from a desire to trace
by experiment the double action of this battery that I respect
fully submit for the consideration of the Society the following

fibres of the thread, the water was repeatedly boiled, closing
and re-opening the capillary point at each boiling. When
the air was well-removed, the tube was hermetically sealed,

 minute transparent crystals; the largest crop of these was on
 a copper surface opposite a spot on one of the zinc plates, to
 which nearly the whole of the corrosion of the metal appeared
 to have been confined. The red ground of the copper sur
 face showed them most distinctly. On heating the copper
 the crystals parted with water of crystallization, and became
 circular white spots, very much resembling the protoxide of
  Z111C.                                    -              . .      . .     .   . .      . .     . .

 352       Mr. Adie’s Experiments with Galvanic Couples
 of iron, and treating the filtered liquid with hydrosulphuret
 of ammonia, which gave a yellowish white precipitate. This
 result proves that the minute transparent crystals among the
 fibres of the thread contained protoxide of zinc.                -
     On a former occasion I employed either the air-pump or
 ebullition to deprive water used in exciting voltaic couples, of
 absorbed air. I gave preference to the method of boiling the
 water in the battery cell, as the more severe test, for showing
 how far a battery’s action depended on oxygen from the atmo
 sphere. "The proof which appeared to me to furnish satisfac
 tory evidence of the assistance given by absorbed oxygen, was
 when the indication in the galvanometer fell near to zero by
 prèlonged boiling, and rose again when water holding dis
 solved air was thrown into the cell. According to this test,
 a zinc and platinum couple lose much of their action when
 excited by pure water boiled for near two hours. The galva
 nometer needles always indicated a slight action, however long
 thé boiling was prolonged; but as I found when care was
 taken to have an atmosphere of steam resting on the surface
 of the boiling water the action of the couple was at its lowest,
 I was led to think that what remained might be due to oxy
 gep from the atmosphere, which it was impossible to remove
#.              The experiment given above renders this view no
longer tenable; for if zinc and copper elements can at ordinary
temperatures slowly generate gas, it must follow that all the
 elements less oxidizable than copper will at boiling tempera
tures possess, when associated with zinc, a voltaic action
independent of oxygen from the atmosphere.
     To try the effect of a zinc and copper couple excited by:
pure boiling water, I attached a pair of plates to a more sensi
tive galvanometer than I had hitherto used: the plates were
placed in a Florence flask and covered to a depth of two
inches with pure water previously distilled in glass vessels;
there was only a small orifice in the cork at the top of the
flask for a steam escape, in order to preserve the boiling sur
face from the atmosphere.                                       *:

 ‘’When silver or platinum was substituted for the copper the

       immersed in pure water and in ory.<U+017F>enated water.       353
results were in the same order, giving the highest action at
the time the water is parting with dissolved air, and, lowest
when the water is thoroughly boiled. ... Where zinc, is, the
positive element the action falls considerably, as the boiled
water cools before it has time to re-absorb air.    With a little
common salt added to the water of a zinc and platinum couple,
ebullition serves greatly to exalt the action, for the arrange
ment is no longer dependent on oxygen from the atmosphere.
   These experiments, in extension of those I formerly sub
mitted to the public through the Edinburgh Philosophical
Journal, do not militate against the general conclusion then
drawn, that the water battery supported its action by absorb
ing oxygen from the atmosphere; they only show that there
is in addition a minute degree of action when two metallic
elements are excited by pure water.                    -      it.
   Perhaps the experiments of the most importance for deter
mining the theory of the action of gas absorbing galvanic
couples, are those where one metal only is excited by oxy
genated water; to illustrate this action I made the following
experiments:—                                             * -
   Two slips of zinc cut side by side from the same sheet were
placed in a running brook, the one opposed to a rapid part of
the current, the other in a still place at the edge. Connecting
these in the usual manner with the galvanometer, there was
a permanent deflection of 25°; and on changing the respective
places of the plates in the stream without disturbing their
attachments to the galvanometer, the needles immediately
passed to the opposite side of the card; in both cases the
piece of zinc in the current acted as a negative or platinode
plate. With both plates in still water and a tube filled with
oxygen inverted over one, the effect was the same. It is the
greater supply of oxygen to the plate in the current which con
verts it into a negative or platinode. A cell containing two
small silver wires and the cyanide of silver solution used for
electro-plating was attached in place of the galvanometer,
when, after a lapse of two hours, metallic silver was seen pre
cipitated in a minute quantity on the silver wire connected
with the piece of zinc in still water.
   Two plates of iron were placed in the stream, under like
conditions to the zinc ; after two hours metallic silver was
distinctly seen precipitated on the silver wire connected with
the iron plate in still water.                                    -
 - The fact here shown, of two similar pieces of iron giving
rise to a galvanic current capable of precipitating metallic
silver, appears to me to be important, for it proves that the
electricity in passing through the water intervening between.

     The fact of iron and oxygen, uniting together at ordinary

… The first of these views can only be supported by holding
  that the solution of oxygen so changes the affinities, that iron
  with its aid can at ordinary temperatures decompose water.
  I see no evidence sufficient to give probability to this hypo
 ºthesis, while, if the second supposition be admitted to meet
 fall the facts shown by experiment, it will establish the exist
 lenge of an electrolyte more easily decomposed than water,

   The plate in the centre of the stream shows less rusting
than the one at the edge in still water; but judging from the
analogous case of the copper sheathing of a ship, it should
waste away the fastest, the particles of peroxide of iron as
they are formed being removed by the force of the stream,
while the voltaic current developed during this action only
circulates to some other point of the same plate, or belongs
to what is called local action. . .         r
   From the above results, the benefit to be obtained in a con
stant battery by making the negative plate rotate, should be
apparent; but to prevent waste it would still be necessary to
employ one of the more costly metals, which are not liable to
oxidation.
   In concluding these experiments, I may again notice, that
a tube of oxygen suspended over a plate of iron in still water
has the same effect as the current of the stream, converting
the oxygenated plate into a platinode. The carbonic acid
present in all surface water may by some be thought to per
form an essential part in the ordinary rusting of iron. But
where every care is taken to exclude this gas from a tube
filled with oxygen, a small quantity of water, and a piece of
iron, the oxidation of the iron proceeds with rapidity, accom
panied by changes which appear to me to preclude the idea
that even a trace of carbonic acid can be essential. The oxy
gen gas disappears; at first an abundant formation of red or
peroxide of iron is seen; then, after the supply of oxygen has
decreased, the green-coloured protoxide is gradually formed.
These two oxides afterwards begin slowly to unite, and form
the well-known black or magnetic oxide. In an experiment of
this kind every trace of the red and green-coloured oxides had
disappeared at the end of three months from the time of
closing the tube, and there remained only an inky precipitate,
which was proved to be the black oxide of iron.         -
LVIII. On certain Improvements in the Construction and Sup
   ply of the Hydro-Orygen Blowpipe, by which Platinum.
   may be fused in the large way. By Robert HARE, M.D.”
 ON my return from Europe in 1836, I was very much in
      want of a piece of platinum of a certain weight, while
many more scraps than were adequate to form such a piece
were in my possession.     This induced new efforts to extend
the power of my blowpipe; and after many experiments, I
succeeded so as to fuse twenty-eight ounces of platinum into
One I<U+017F>la SS.

    Hydro-Oxygen Blowpipe for the Fusion of Platinum. 357
   Although small lumps of platinum had been fused by many
operators with the hydro-oxygen blowpipe as well as myself,
it had not, up to the year 1837, been found sufficiently com
petent to enable artists to resort to this process. I am in
formed by Mr. Saxton, that some efforts which were made
while he was in London were so little successful, that the pro
ject was abandoned. There was an impression that the metal
was rendered less malleable when fused upon charcoal, as in
the experiments alluded to. This is contradicted by my ex
periments, agreeably to which fused platinum is as malleable
as the best specimens obtained by the Wollaston process,
and is less liable to flake. Dr. Ure, on seeing specimens of
platinum which I had elaborated and fused in the form of wire,
of leaf, ingots and plate, said that there was no one in Europe
who .# fuse platinum in such masses. He also informed
me that it had been found so difficult to weld platinum, that
no resort was had to that process. In this I concur, having
had the welding tried by a skilful smith, both with a forge
heat, and with a heat given by the hydro-oxygen blowpipe.
An incorporation of two ingots was effected on their being
hammered together, when heated nearly to fusion; but on
hammering the resulting mass cold, a separation took place
along the joint by which the ingots were united.
   The difficulty seems to arise from the rapidity with which
the platinum becomes refrigerated. It seems to have a less
capacity for heat than iron; and, not burning in the air as
iron does, has not the benefit of the heat acquired by iron
from its own combustion with atmospheric oxygen.               -
   Lately, by means of the instrument and process which it is
my object here to describe, I have been enabled to obtain
malleable platinum directly from the ore, by the continued
application of the flame. . From some specimens of platinum
I have procured as much as ninety per cent. of malleable
metal. The malleability is not inferior to that of the best
specimens obtained by reducing it to the state of sponge,
through the agency of aqua regia and sal-ammoniac. There
is however a greater liability to tarnish, arising probably from
the presence of a minute portion of palladium.              -
   Of the fusion of iridium and rhodium, I have already given
an account in the Bulletin of the American Philosophical
Society, which was subsequently embodied in an article in
this Journal for August 1847.
   It remains now to give an account of the apparatus employed
in the fusion of platina on a large scale.

cock B. Being thus supplied, the cock F closed, and a commu
nication with a bell-glass, into which oxygen is proceeding from
a generating apparatus, being made by means of a flexible
leaden tube, on opening the valve-cock B and the cock E, the

of about twelve inches in diameter, which, from its construc
tion, renders it possible to introduce an additional supply of

out reducing the pressure within the reservoir, by permitting
the excess above the pressure of the atmosphere to escape.
This object is accomplished as follow                      |, º<U+017F><U+017F>
   The valve at the end of the rod attached to the lever L
being kept shut by the catch M, the screw-plug H removed,
the acid is introduced through the aperture thus opened. In
the next place, the plug being replaced, and the valve depressed
by means of the lever and rod, so as no longer to close the
opening which it had occupied, the acid descends from the
chamber into the cavity of the vessel beneath it. The valve
is of course restored to its previous position assoon as
has effected its descent.          -

   The lowermost vessel is furnished with a perforated copper
tray, supported by a copper sliding rod, in a way quite ana
logous to that already described in the case of the copper
reservoir. It is also supplied with zinc and its solvent in like
 manner, being made half-full of the diluted sulphuric acid.
 Of course, on contact bei              duced between the zinc and
its solvent, the generation of hydrogen will take place. So
 long as the communication between the upper portions of the
 two vessels is open, the gas will extend itself into both, occu
 pying the whole of the upper vessel, and that half of the lower
 one which is unoccupied by the liquid. But if in this way
 the pressure reaches to two atmospheres, as indicated by the
 gauge", on shutting t      º                    through the pipe B,
 the pressure in the inferior vessel W     will augment, that in the
 superior vessel remaining as before; but the liquid will con
 sequently begin to pass out of the infº vessel through the
 pipe A, and thus may lessen the contact between the acid and
zinc, and finally suspend it altogether. Meanwhile the gas in

 2 In order that nearly the whole of the acid shall be expelled
from the inferior vessel, the tray must be depressed till it
touches the bottom of that vessel.
 *The pressure being four atmospheres at commencement, as
soon as, by means of a pipe attached to the valve-cock N, an
escape of gas is allowed, the acid is forced again upon the
zinc, and thus prevents, a decline of pressure to any extent
sufficient to interfere with the process.
   The gases may be used from a receiver in which they exist,
in due proportion, safely by the following means: —
   Two safety-tubes are to be made, not by Hemming's pro
cess exactly, but as follows:
   A copper tube, silver soldered, of which the metal is about
the eighth of an inch in thickness, is stuffed with the finest
copper wire, great care being taken to have the filaments
straight and parallel. The tube is then to be subjected to
the wire-drawing apparatus, so as to compress the tube on its
contents until the draught becomes so hard, as that it cannot
be pushed further without annealing. The stuffed tube thus
made is to be cut into segments, in lengths about equal to the
diameter, by a fine saw. The surfaces of the sections are to be
filed gently with a smooth file. By these means they appear
to the naked eye like the superficies of a solid metallic cylinder.
Brass caps being fitted on these sections, they are to be inter
posed by soldering, at the distance of a foot or more, into the
pipe for supplying the jet. Under these circumstances, the
posterior section becoming hot, may allow the flame to retro
cede; but the anterior section being beyond the reach of any
possible combustion and remaining cold, will not allow of the
retrocession; and as soon as the flame passes the first section,
the operator, being warned, will of course close the cock, and
subject the posterior section to refrigeration before proceeding
aga I<U+017F>l.                                           -            -  -
 ‘’But this plan of operating may be rendered still more se
cure by interposing a mercury bottle, or other suitable iron
vessel, half-full of oil of turpentine, between the reservoir and
safety tubes, as in the arrangement of a Woulfe's bottle. A
leaden pipe proceeding from the reservoir is, by a gallows
screw, attached to an iron tube which descends into the bottle,
so that its orifice may be near the bottom.           The leaden
pipe communicating through the safety tubes with the jet
pipe, is attached to the neck of the bottle. Thus the gaseous
mixture has to bubble through the oil of turpentine in order
to proceed through the safety tubes to the jet-pipe. If, while

this process is going on,     . *.        should, by retrocession,
reach the cavity of the bottle, exploding in contact with the
turpentine, a compound is formed, which is, perse, inexplosive
from the excess of carbonaceous matter. Meanwhile the
shock, acting on the surface of the oil, drives it into the bore
of the iron tube, and thus, both, by its chemical and mecha

    For the fusion of either iridium or rhodium or masses of
platinum not exceeding the weight of half an ounce, an instru
ment with three jets has been employed, the bore of each jet
pipe being such as not to admit a wire larger than the #nd
of an inch in diameter. The flame produced by these means

ing five ounces, an instrument has been used capable of givi
seven jets of gas, issuing of course from as many pipes... O
these pipes, six protrude through the brass casting forming
the bottom of the copper case constituting the refrigerator, so
as to be equidistant from each other upon a circumference
 three-fourths of an inch in diameter, the seventh protruding
from the centre. The bores of these jets are such as not to
admit a wire larger than ºnd of an inch in thickness. Thos
of the larger instruments, represented by the accompanyin
engravings, were such as to admit wires of ºrth of an inch in
thickness.                                               --
    The jet-pipes may be made by the following process:–A
thin strip of sheet metal, somewhat wider than the length of
the circumference required in the proposed pipe, in.
roughly turned about a wire so as to form an         ºpº
is drawn through several suitable holes in a steel plate, as in
the wire-drawer's process. Under this treatment the strip
becomes converted into a hollow wire; the edges of the strip
 being brought into contact reciprocally, so as to leave only an
almost imperceptible crevice. Having drawn, one strip of
platina in this way, another strip sufficiently wide nearly to
 inclose it is to be drawn over that first drawn, care being taken
to have the crevices left at the meeting of the edges on con
trary sides. The compound hollow wire or tube thus fabri
cated, is finally to be drawn upon a steel wire of the diameter
of the requisite bore.
    The following method of making jet-pipes, though more

tº Agreeably to a trial made last spring, palladium may be
  used as a solder for platinum; and as it is nearly as difficult

  to gold, where great heat is to be resisted. No doubt by-em

  drawn tubes above mentioned, they might answer as well
  nearly as when constructed of solid platinum.             39(13

  - Now to compare my observation with the diagram and
notice sent you last year by Sir J. Lubbock, I conclude he
must have seen the meteor just before its disappearance; in
which case, the course being very much foreshortened, it
would occupy the portion of the heavens which he has indi
cated by a blurred mark of his pencil. On this hypothesis it
must have passed about 8° or 10° from the zenith of his place

 * I consider then that the meteor at the end of the phaeno
menon bore N. by 10° W. at Sir J. Lubbock's station at
an altitude of about 40°; at my station at the same instant it
bore N.E. at an altitude of 45°. From these data, I calculate
its height to have been sixty-one miles nearly." " " ".
   But taking its course as upon a meridian line, and the esti
mated altitude when due east of me, I make its height about
fifty-six miles. Considering the roughness of the data, I re
gard this degree of accordance, proceeding upon two inde
pendent methods, as tolerably satisfactory. Then, if my esti
mate be at all correct, it had a diameter of at least 700 yards,
and its velocity was thirty-six miles in a second. . . . . . ºv

Lxi. "On the Aurora Borealis, as it was seen on Sunday
   evening, October 24, 1847, at Blackheath. By JAMEs,
  'Glaisien, Esq., of the    IRoyal Observatory, Greenwich. . .
Tºš day having been remarkable for one of the most"
 1 brilliant displays of Aurora Borealis which it has ever
been my good fortune to witness, it has occurred to me that a
notice of its principal phases, so far as they fell under my own
observation, may not be unacceptable to your readers. ' ' ' '
    The barometer reading during the day previous had de
clined rapidly, and during this day it had increased as rapidly.
The day had been for the most part overcast, and light rain
had fallen occasionally; towards evening the sky became per
    Phil. Mag. S. 3. Vol. 31. No. 209. Nov. 1847.          2 B

370         Mr. J. Glaisher on the Aurora Borealis
fectly cloudless; the night was beautiful, and the full moon
 shone with unusual brilliancy.
   At about 6* 80*. P.M. a bright red streamer was seen to
 spring up from the N.W.
   At 6' 40m another streamer was seen in the N.W., and at
 the same instant one sprung up from the N.; both of which
 were of a beautiful red.
   At 6*56m a less brilliant streamer was seen in the N.W., and
within three minutes after this time, several faint streamers
 were seen in the N., N.N.W. and N.W.
   From 7h to 7h 12m a few streamers were seen, and after this
 time no trace of the Aurora could be seen for some time,
   Between 7h 30m and 9h 40m there were occasional streamers,
 both white and red, appearing between the N.W. and the
 E.N.E.                             -
   At 9° 55m a splendid column of red light appeared in the
 N.W., whose base was about 5° in breadth. This pyramid
exhibited all the tints of the most brilliant sunset, and appear
ed to be composed of streamers whose colours shaded from
the most intense crimson into the ruddiest and most brilliant
orange, which orange parts again contrasted with the ruddy
hue of the next portion, forming by means of contrast upon
contrast an endless gradation of shade and colour, -a truly
sublime and gorgeous appearance, About this time, the fur
nace glow which pervaded this appearance increased in in
tensity, and had all the appearance of the reflexion from an
immense conflagration; in the mean time the orange colour
entirely disappeared, and gave place to an uniform deep crim
son, increasing, as before stated, in intensity, and apparently in
denseness,
   At 10h Om the same appearance continued as above; but in
addition to it, there was a collection of vertical columns of
light from 2° to 3° in breadth; and from the E.N.E. there
was a column similar in form and colour to the one in the
N.W., with the exception of being less brilliant.      These two
red columns formed the east and west boundaries of the fan
like appearance of the whole mass, all the columns of which
converged to a point a few degrees S. of the zenith.
   The columnar appearances situated between the red columns
were of the most silvery light, shaded with a most delicate and
pure gray; they were perpetually glancing and shifting upwards
and downwards; the lower parts of each column would suddenly
glance into the place of the upper portion of the same column,
whilst the upper portion would shoot higher towards the zenith,
and then both together suddenly descend. This vibrating mo
tion was simultaneous in all the columns, excepting the splendid

                       of October 24, 1847.) . . . . i<U+017F>       3.71
red portions at either termination, which remained immove
able, though it rather appeared, that as the central silvery
light fluctuated, now bright, now dim, these rosy extremities
fluctuated in direct opposition, their rosy hue becoming fainter
and inclining to a neutral tint in proportion to the increase
of the silvery brightness. The whole variation of appearance
somewhat resembled the reflexion cast upon a wall by a Gothic
casement lighted from within, by some fitful and inconstant
light. Towards 10" 12" a considerable, diminution in the
brilliancy of the light, fleecy, silvery columns took place; the
regular and casement-like appearance disappeared by degrees
and assumed more of the character of the extremities, although
they still continued their fitful, glancing and radiating motion.
During these appearances two or three milk-white, cloud-like
masses came up from the N.W. and slowly moved towards
the S.E.; each of these masses seemed to have a kind of pulsa
tion within themselves,                                 -
   At 10h 19m little could be seen of the Aurora, excepting
the red column in the N.W.; this still retained much bril
liancy, though all else seemed merged into the sky, when at
times, like the bursting of a firework, a stream would spring
up from this column, white and brilliant, except at their upper
portions, which were tinged with rose colour.
   About this time, the moon, which had been shining upon
a cloudless sky, was suddenly surrounded with a splendid
corona, exhibiting concentric circles, first of a neutral tint,
next of violet, then green, and the outermost red; the ex
ternal boundary of the latter passed nearly midway between
the moon and the planet Mars; this appearance continued at
its extreme brilliancy a short time only, but more dimly it
continued for a long time.
   From 10h 30” to 11h 0°, with the exception of an occa
sional streamer, there was no appearance of the Aurora; and
at times no aurora at all was visible.
   At 11h 14m, to this time no arch-formation had been seen,
or bank of vapour; a bright arch however was supposed to
have formed at about this time, but, if so, it continued a short
time only.                  -
   Shortly after 11h 15” a faint stream or column of white light
 was seen in the N.N.E., and a splendid red patch of light, nearly
in the east, was seen, which grew very bright, and the phae
nomenon at midnight exhibited an appearance as beautiful as
 any of those that had preceded it. An arch appeared extend
 ing from the N.W. to the S.E.; from this arch very bright
 and flickering pencils of light darted out, both upwards and
 downwards.                             -

     I did not observe any halo, around the moon at any time,
 and the Aurora, with the exception of the beautiful white
 clouds, was confined to the northern hemisphere. (:

  "Many of the " receding               observations were          de by an
 assistant at my residence,"as my own attention was aimost
 completely occupied by observations of the magnetical instru
 ments; so much so, that I was obliged to neglect some of its
 finest appearances, but which I believe were pretty well ob
 served as above described. The watch by which the times
 were taken was compared at about midnight, so that the se
veral times are true Greenwich mean solar times.

 that the number and order of the operations in the solution are ex

 anything respecting the constitution of the medium more than this,
 that it possesses direct and lateral elasticity. By direct elasticity we
 mean that elasticity in virtue of which direct or normal vibrations

     Let AB be any line in a perfectly uniform medium, and conceive
the medium to be, diyided into elementary slices by planes perpen
dicular to AB; let OM(=a) be the distance of any slice PP' from
any particular point O of AB, and suppose this slice to suffer a dis

 and the other slices to be similarly displaced. Then<U+017F>it is evident
 that the medium suffers by these displacements a uniformly increasing
 expansion in the dire º: and a º: 'mly increasing condensa
 tion in the direction OA; the rate of increase both of the expansion
 and condensation being c. Now in all known substances, whether
 solid, fluid, or gaseous, 'a disarrangement of this kind would bring
 into play on the slice O a force along the line AB proportional to
 the rate of increase c, i. e. a force Ac, A being a constant depending
 upon what we may call the direct elasticity of the substance.
      Again, suppose that the slice PP receives a displacement Ca2       #
 in the direction OC perpendicular to AB, and the other slices similar
 displacements, & Then the line AB will become curved into a para
 bala AoP', and all the lines

 similarly curved tººls of curvature being equal tº and per
 pendicular to AB. Now in all known substances" a disarrangement
 of this kind would bring into play upon the slice O a force in the
 direction. OC proportional to the curvature c, i.e. a force Be depend.
  ing upon what we may call the lateral elasticity of the substance.
  vº Lastly, suppose that MP=y, and that the point P of the medium
  receives a displacement cry parallel to AB, and the other points
  similar displacements. Then the slice PP will, in consequence of
  this kind of displacement, turn through an angle tan- (ca.) into the
  dotted position, and the other slices will suffer similar rotations,
  those on the other side of O, such as QQ', turning the opposite way.
  Now it is easy to see that a disarrangement of this kind produces a
  uniformly increasing expansion in the directio QC, and a uniformly
  increasing condensation in the direction OC", the rate of increase
  both of the expansion an condensation being c, But the expansion
  and condensation here described are quite different from that pre
  viously noticed; since it is produced, not b displacements parallel

 *There is however a very simple way of finding the precise value
 of the force brought into play by a disarrangement of this kind; for
 if we turn the axes of w and y in the plane of the paper through an
 angle of 45°, it appears that this disarrangement is nothing but a
 combination of the two kinds of disarrangement previously noticed;
 and from this it immediately follows, in the case of an uncrystallized
 medium, that the force brought into play at O is (A–B)c ; in other
 words, the coefficient C, which must be multiplied into c, in order
 to give the force brought into play by the disarrangement cay, is
 equal to the coefficient of direct elasticity (A) minus the coefficient
 of lateral elasticity (B), --      ; ) 1-. . . .
    In the case of a crystallized medium, it may be shown that sia:
 relations, corresponding to the relation C=A–B, are most probably
 true, and are essential to Fresnel's theory of transverse vibrations;
 that is to say, the medium is capable of propagating waves of trans
 verse vibrations if these six conditions hold, but otherwise it is not.
    In employing the above considerations to determine the equations
 of vibratory motion, the directions AB and C/C are always taken so
 as to coincide with some two of the three coordinate axes; and it is
 this circumstance that makes the method peculiarly applicable to
 crystallized media. Indeed, if it were necessary to tº the lines
 AB and C'C in any directions but those of the axes of symmetry,
 the above considerations would not apply without considerable mo
 dification.                                                   -  - -
     The equations of vibratory motion obtained by this method for an
 uncrystallized medium, are the well-known equations involving the
 two constants A and B. The equations obtained for a crystallized
 medium are perfectly free from any restriction of any kind, are appli
 cable to all kinds of substance, whether we suppose its structure to
 be analogous to that of a solid fluid or gas, and hold for all kinds of
 disarrangement, whether consisting of normal or transverse displace
 ments, or both.                                                      -
     When we introduce the six relations between the constants above
 alluded to, and moreover assume that the vibrations constituting a
 polarized ray are in the plane of polarization, we arrive at Professor
 MacCullagh's equations”. If, on the contrary, we suppose the yi
"brations to be perpendicular to the plane of polarization, we arrive
 at equations which agree exactly with Fresnel's theory in every par
 ticular+.
     If f introduce these six relations into the equations for crystal
 lized media deduced from M. Cauchy's hypothesis, that the mole
 cular forces act along the lines joining the different particles of the
 medium, it will be found that these equations are immediately re
 duced to the equations for an uncrystallized medium. From this it
 follows that M. Cauchy's hypothesis cannot be applied to any but
 uncrystallized media. In fact, it may be easily proved that if the

     the rate of variation of U, when we pass from point to point in that

Royal gave orally a continuation, of   º:
cing the principal points that have been ascertained since his com
munication of Nov. 14, 1846. The planet having been actually dis
covered in the heavens by * of certain predicted elements, the
fair presumption was that those elements were very approximately
correct. Adopting these elements, therefore, Mr. Hind examined
Lalande's and other observations, with the hope of finding some
former observation of the planet as a star now missing, but satisfied
himself that there was home. In the meantime, the continuation of
 ..º.                the planet in the last months of 1846, and the
comparison of them with Professor Challis's early observations of
August, led to some unexpected conclusions. It was found that,
though one place of the planet might be very well represented by M.
Le Verrier's or Mr. Adams's elements, yet the apparent movement of
the planet could not be represented within several minutes, Elements
were then investigated from the observations themselves (without
any reference to the preceding deductions from the perturbations of
Uranus) by Mr. Adams in England (see Monthly Notices for March,
p. 244), and by Professor Pierce and Mr. Sears C. Walker in Ame
rica. Attention is particularly due to the former of these investiga.
tions, in which are exhibited, not only the results for the different
elements, but also for the probable error of each. The most import
ant conclusion was, that the planet certainly moved in a much smaller
orbit, and probably in an orbit of much smaller eccentricity, than
that indicated by the calculations of perturbation. With elements
thus roughly corrected, the orbit was again traced back through the
ancient observations; and it was found by Dr. Petersen of Altona,
and Mr. Sears C. Walker, that a star observed by Lalande on May.
 10, 1795, and now missing from the heavens, was very probably the
planet. The observation however was marked doubtful in Lalande's
    nted volume; and to this circumstance is probably due a most
remarkable discovery. The manuscripts of Lalande's observations
were some years ago transferred by his representatives to the obser
vatory of Paris. To examine into the presumption of doubt in the
observation, the astronomers of the Observatory of Paris referred to,
the originals, and there they found that the observation of May 10,
 1795, was entered without any expression of doubt at the time;
 that an observation of May 8, 1795, was omitted in the printed vo
lume; that it was omitted solely because it could not be reconciled,
 with the observation of May 10; and that, upon reducing both pro
perly, they exhibit most distinctly the retrograde motion of a planet'
 nearly parallel to the plane of the ecliptic, the right ascension and
 the polar distance having both changed in the proper proportion.
 It seems now inconceivable to us that an astronomer, having his atten
tion strongly called to the difference between the two days' results,
 should rather assume that there were in the observations two inde
pendent errors (one of right ascension and one of polar distance),
than that the body observed was really a planet. With the place of
the planet at an epoch so distant, its elements are ascertained with
great accuracy.                  a<U+017F>   : if it, <U+017F>º tº ,               * *

   It is remarkable that the missing star, to which allusion has been
made, is actually entered as an observed star in the Berlin Star-Map ;
and this circumstance prevented Mr. Adams from tracing the new
orbit of the planet so soon as he would otherwise have done. This
insertion of an unobserved star can be accounted for only on the
supposition that the star had been taken by the observer in his work
ing-catalogue as a zero-star, and had then been inserted as a matter
of course. . . . . . . . . . .  .                       *
   The mean distance of Neptune from the sun now appears, instead
of 38, to be something near 30; and its periodic time, instead of
220 years, to be nearly 166. It is certainly a most curious thing
(in which much is owing to chance) that elements, now known to
be extremely erroneous, should have accounted for the perturbations.
of Uranus through 150 years with such accuracy, and should also
have given the planet's place, for the particular year in which the
attention of astronomers was first strongly directed to it, with such
precision. It remains to be seen whether the new elements of Nep
tune will, with any possible, mass, explain the perturbations of
Uranus. In any case, Bode's law, on the assumption of which the
original investigations of M. Le Verrier and Mr. Adams entirely de
pended, fails completely,                                     -
   Calcul détaillé d'une Inégalité Nouvelle à Longue Période, qui
existe dans la Longitude moyenne de la Lune. By M. Hansen.
   The author states that he has lately made known to some astro
nomers a discovery of two inequalities in the motion of the moon,
whose periods are respectively nearly 273 and 239 years. Denoting
by g, g', g" the geocentric mean anomaly of the moon, and the helio
centric mean anomalies of the earth and Venus, these inequalities are—
               27" 4x sin (—g–169'+ 189"+35° 20'2)
             +23" 2x sin (8g"—13g'+315° 30');
of which the first depends on a new argument, while the second
depends on the argument of an equation of long period in the motion
of the earth, discovered by Mr. Airy.
   As the calculation of those parts of the coefficients which depend
on the product of the square and cube of the sun's disturbing force
by the disturbing force of Venus is extremely laborious, and is more
over connected with other unpublished calculations of other inequa
lities of the moon, it does not appear possible to publish it at pre
sent. Indeed M. Hansen does not consider himself able yet to
answer for their perfect correctness, though he has the strongest
reason to believe that they are very nearly correct.       The present
paper therefore includes only the calculation of that part of the co
                                                                          2
efficient of the first inequality which depends on the first power of
the disturbing force.                                               sº II
   It appears difficult to abstract very completely the remainder of
this paper, but the following indications will enable a person ac
  uainted with the developments of physical astronomy to follow the
whole process.
   The perturbing function () for the moon as disturbed by Venus
being formed, it will be found that it may be expanded in a rapidly

converging series of fractions, whose numerators contain successive
powers of r, the moon's radius vector, and whose denominátors
contain different powers of the same multinomial (which, when ec.
centricities and inclinations are omitted, is a trinomial) that occurs
in computing the perturbations of the earth by Venus. Upon ex
panding any of these fractions with <U+017F>trinomial denominator, there
occur terms depending on 169"—16 g', 179"—17g', and 18g"H-189":
then, upon introducing the inclinations and eccentricities, the first,
(among other combinations) will be multiplied by sin” # inclin. x
cos 2 g”–2 y (where w is the difference of longitude of node and pe."
rihelion of Venus), and also (in other terms) by e", cos 2g"; the
second by e". e' cosg"+g'; and the third by e”. cos 2 g'. Each of
these combinations produces terms whose argument is 18g"—16 g'.
Then upon multiplying these terms by a power of r, since the ex
pression for any power of r contains e. cosg, the product will contain
terms depending on 18 g”— 16 g’—g. The coefficient necessarily
contains one of the following products of three small quantities:
e. sin” # inclin., e. e”, e.e".e', e.e” (of which the first is the most im
portant), and it is therefore extremely small; but the resulting
perturbation is made important by the excessive smallness of the
divisor introduced in integration.          It is well known that the divisor.

 ... In this manner the greatest part of the term in question is pro
duced. Other parts arise from the circumstance that, the dimen
sions of the moon's orbit being slightly altered, the perturbing force
of the sum upon the moon is not the same as it would otherwise be,
       M. Hansen remarks that this term is remarkable as depending
upon higher multiples of the anomalies than have ever before been
considered, and as having the longest period in proportion to the
periodic time of the disturbed body that is yet known.
      The term depending on 8 g”— 13 g' arises mainly from the cir
cumstance, that, the earth's motion in its orbit being different from
what it would have been without the perturbation by Venus, the
disturbing force of the sun upon the moon is not the same as if that
perturbation had not existed.

    In concluding the account of this remarkable discovery, it is gra
tifying to add that it explains, almost precisely the observed inequa

    After the reading by the Secretary of a portion<U+017F> of this paper, the
 Astronomer Royal gave an oral explanation of its general subject in
 the followingmanner:--2 intromo- (-iº, I <U+017F>º dº <U+017F>º, tº -ºº.
    The disturbing effect of Venus upon the moon is not the whole
 attraction of Venus upon the moon, but the difference of the two
 attractions, of Venus upon the moon and of Venus, upon the earth.
Thus, when the moon is between the earth, and Venus, the attrac
tion of Venus upon the moon is stronger than that of Venus upon,
the earth, and therefore it tends to pull Venus away from the earth.
When the moon is more distant from Venus-than the earthis, the<U+017F>
attraction of Venus on the earth is the stronger, and tends to pull
it away from the moon, which, in regard to the disturbance of the
relative places of the earth and moon, is the same thing as pulling
the moon away from the earth. In both these positions, therefore,"
the disturbing force of Venus tends to pull the moon away from the
earth. When the earth and the moon are equally distant from Venus,
the attractions of Venus upon the two are equal, but not in parallel
lines; the attractions tend to draw them along the sides of a wedge
whose point is at Venus, and, therefore, to diminish the distance;
between them, or to push the moon towards the earth.        <U+017F>º ºf tº ºr
    Inasmuch as, in one pair of positions of the earth and moon, then
disturbing force of Venus tends to increase the distance betweent
them, and in another pair of positions it tends to diminish that ºdi
stance, it is important to ascertain which of these disturbances is the
greater. Suppose the distance of the moon, from the earth to beli
 Thi<U+017F> part of the distance of the earth from Venus. Then, when the
moon is between the earth and Venus, its distance from Venus is
+% of the whole; the force upon it is "º of that upon the earth;h
the excess of this (or the disturbing force tending to pull the moon :
away from the earth) is ºr, or nearly ºr of that on the earth-i In
like manner, when the moon is further from Venus than the eartho
is, its distance from Venus is ### of the earth's distance ; the force;
upon it is {{}}#} of that upon the earth; the defect of this (or then
disturbing force tending to pull the earth away from the moon) is
TÉ%r, or nearly ºr of that on the earth., But when the earth and ,
the moon are at equal distances from Venus, the proportion of their
relative approach (as produced by the action of Venus) to the whole,
effect of Venus upon them, is evidently represented by the inclina
tion of the two lines drawn from them to Venus, or is the same as
the proportion of the distance of the moon from the earth, to the
distance of the earth from Venus, and is therefore rºw of the whole.
Thus the force tending to pull the moon from the earth at one time
is about double the force tending to push the moon towards the earth
at another time; and therefore, upon the whole, the tendency of the

consequences of the motion of the line of apses, andvof the Irelative,
motions of the earth and Venus) sometimes-between the <U+017F>earth and

times 90° to the right, sometimes 90° to the lefti<U+017F>t<U+017F> We may assert:
therefore that, upon the whole, the disturbing force of Venus upon:
the moon, when she is in apogee, tends to draw her away from the
earth. The same may be predicated when the moonis in perigee, 13
    Next, it is important to ascertain-how the disturbing force dei<U+017F>
pends upon the moon's distance from the earth. For this purpose,
instead of supposing, as before, that the moon's distance is tº part:
of the distance of the earth from Venus, let us suppose it ºn part of
that distance. Then, when the moon is between the earth and Venus,
the force upon the moon is lºof that upon the earth, and there
fore the excess, or the disturbing force, is ºr,  ..º.
whole force upon the earth, oilm the former assumed instance it was,
#y. Thus, upon doubling the moon's distance from the earth, the
disturbing force is doubled.” And similarly for other distances of
the moon from the earth, the disturbing force (in similar positions'
with regard to Venus) is proportional to the moon's distance. Thus,
when the moonis at apogee, in a given position with regard to Venus,
the disturbing force is greater than when the moon is in perigee in
the same position. And, upon the whole, in all possible relative<U+017F>
positions of the moon and Venus, the action of Venus pulls away
the moon from the earth, more when she is in apogee than when she
is, in perigee, ºil  .-1 ºf wºod ºf , sº to . . . . ;h oil; to rust . . .
  *Now we may consider the general effect of these forces upon the
dimensions of the moon's orbit. So long as the force which draws,
the moon towards the earth is always the same at the same distance,
the moon will continue to describe an orbit of the same dimensions:
over and over again.” But if at any time the force directed towards
the earth suddenly-grows smaller, the moon will immediately rush off
in an orbit which, on the opposite side, is larger. If the force
towards the earth gradually grows smaller, the dimensions of the
orbit will gradually increase. And the periodic time in the orbit;
described at every successive revolution<U+017F> will undergo the change;
corresponding to the change of dimensions (that is, to the change of
major axis) of the orbit, and will ºtherefore become continually,
greater and greater...ºtel º mº " mo<U+017F>t nºtb •º ovº o nº
    These are the changes which produce the most serious disturbance?
in the apparent place of the moon. If a force, after acting for along,
time, produce a small change in the eccentricity of the moon's orbit,
the effect on the moon's place is simply the amount of the corre

sponding change in the equation of the centre, and cannot possibly
exceed that amount.) But if the force have been for a long time
gradually altering the major axis, and consequently the periodic
time in the moon's orbit, then during the whole of that time the
moon has been performing her revolutions quicker or slower than we
expected, and therefore at the end of that time she is in advance
or in retard of her expected place by an amount. equal to the accu.

which the change has been going on, The planetary inequalities of
long period are all of this kind.rº/The major axis here plays the same
part as the pendulum of a clock.d. If a small force acting for a year
pushed the seconds-hand forwards by an inch, the clock would be
merely a few seconds    Yº". the same time, it shortened
the pendulum by an inch, the clock would have gained fifty hours;
and if the time occupied by the change had been greater, the dis

 the moon produced by Venus, we must seek for some alternate in
crease and decrease, occupying a very long period, in the force by
 which Venus draws the moon from the earth., ºn 3 ºn tº ºt
    No such slow increase and decrease have been found in the general
force by which Venus disturbs the moon.º, º            to gº º or nº º
    The next point of inquiry is, whether a combination of the changes
 in the force of Venus with the changes in the position of the moon
 in its orbit can produce a force, which, for a very long time together,
 gradually increases the force drawing the moon from the earth, and
 then for an equal time gradually diminishes that force.        <U+017F>o, ºr ºl:
    A force which acts in opposite ways, nearly on, opposite sides of
 the moon's orbit (pulling the moon from the earth on one side and
 pushing it towards the earth on the other side), may produce this
 effect, provided the period of the change in the nature of the force
 (from pulling to pushing) correspond nearly, but, not eractly, with
 the time in which the moon moves from apogee to perigee,” For
 (as we have seen) the effect of a certain force of Venus is to produce
 a greater disturbing force on the moon at apogee than at perigee ;
 and this force, or a change in this force, will, at apogee, produce a
 greater effect on the dimensions of the moon's orbit than at perigee,
 both because the disturbing force is actually greater, and because it
 acts on the moon when the moon's velocity is smaller. Therefore,
 if a pulling force, gradually increasing in magnitude, act on the
 moon at apogee, it will gradually increase the dimensions of the
 moon's orbit: if a corresponding pushing force act, at perigee, it
 will gradually diminish the dimensions of the moon’s orbit; but the
 former prevails, and, the orbit will gradually increase in size. If
 after a time the pulling force at apogee gradually diminish, and at
 length become a pushing force, while the pushing force at perigee
 gradually diminishes, and at length becomes a pulling force, then
 the orbit will gradually diminish in size. And this change of forces
 would be produced by such a modification in Venus's force, as that
                                   *-   sº

                     Royal Astronomical Society,                     887
 of which we have spoken, namely, a force which acts in opposite
 ways on opposite sides of the moon’s orbit, and in which the period
in the change of the nature of the force coincides nearly, but not
exactly, with the time in which the moon moves from apogee to pe.
 rigee; for then the pulling force at apogee will after a long time be
changed to a pushing force, and the pushing force at perigee will in
 the same time be changed to a pulling force, ºff, for instance, the
 change in the disturbing forces of Venus (froth pushing to pulling)
 occupied fourteen days exactly, and if the moon’s motion from apo.
 gee to perigee occupied fourteen days and five minutes, then in 4032
 anomalistic semi-revolutions of the moon (which would bring her
 from apogee to apogee), there would have been 4033 changes of the
 force (which would change it from pulling to pushing), and there
 fore in this time, and no sooner, a complete pulling force at apogee
 would be changed to a complete pushing force at apogee.
tº It is necessary now to point out how such a modification of the
 force of Venus can be found.                                   . .. . ...
 * The only disturbing forces which are yet completely brought under
 the management of mathematicians are of two kinds; a constant
force (always pushing or always pulling with the same amount of
 force), and a force alternately pushing and pulling, having equal
periods and equal maximum magnitudes in each state. The latter
 of these, if projected graphically, with the time for abscissa, is re
presented by the ordinates of a line of sines: algebraically, it is ex
pressed by a.cos (bt+c). <U+017F>º 2 lºº, it i<U+017F> . . . / º ºf ,                  -
ºr Now, while the relative positions of the earth and Venus change,
 the disturbing force on the moon (estimated by the force which, on
 the whole, it exerts to pull the moon   º undergoes very
3. changes.        When Venus is nearest to the earth, this force is
   out 250 times as great as when Venus is furthest from the earth.
It declines very rapidly from its greatest magnitude. If therefore
we represent the disturbing force from one conjunction to the next
by a curve, this curve will be very high at the beginning and end,
and very near the line of abscissa at the middle, and through the
greater part of its extent.    tº       to   º º<U+017F> º º
   The separation of this force into a number of different forces, fol
lowing the two laws mentioned above, is effected by a process sug
gested and facilitated by algebra, but in which, nevertheless, every
step has its physical meaning. It may be stated at once, that this
remark applies universally to the algebraical operations of physical
mathematics. As a simple instance, we may refer to the equation
(a+b)+= a + 3 as b +3 a bº-Hbº, which probably was suggested by
algebra; but which may be illustrated by taking a cube, whose side
is a +5, and (by three saw-cats) cutting it into eight pieces, when
the single piece representing aº, the three pieces each representing
as b, the three pieces each representing abº, and the single piece
representing bº, will be found. And there is perhaps no better dis
cipline for the mind than thus tracing the evidence of the truth of
algebra, especially in its more profound processes.” " " . . . .
   The separation, then, of the force of Venus goes on by the fol
lowing steps:—

the time intermediate to the conjunctions, and pulling when Venus

   3rd. A force pulling when Venus is in conjunction, then pushing,
&c., going through its changes twice.
   4th. A force pulling when Venus is in conjunction, then pushing,
&c., going through its changes thrice.
   In this manner the forces go on, continually diminishing in magni
tude. When we arrive at the 18th, the force is extremely small.
   The algebraical expression for the collection of these terms, put
ting 5 for the difference of mean longitude of the earth and Venus, is
              A+B.cosº- c. cos 24-D. cos; 34-8c.
   This is on the supposition that the orbits of the two planets are
circular and in the same plane. But, in consequence of their eccen
tricities and inclinations, the forces of any one system alternately
pushing and pulling (Nos. 2, or 3, or 4, &c.) will not have the same
marimum magnitude throughout. But each can, in all cases, be
expressed by the combination of three such forces, in each of which
the maximum forces are equal throughout. Thus, if we combine a
large force, going through its changes twenty times in a certain
period, with a small force going through its changes nineteen times
in the same period, and another small force going through its
changes twenty-one times in the same period, then it will be found
that both the small forces increase the large force (whether in its
pulling or in its pushing state) near the beginning and the end of
the time; that both diminish the large force near the middle of the
time; and that the two small ones destroy each other at a quarter
 and three-quarters of the time. The effect of this combination is
therefore precisely such as is spoken of above.                    -
   Thus, then, for the complete expression of the force, we are
driven to an infinite number of forces following the law of alternately
pulling and pushing, but with very great variety of magnitudes of
force and of periodic time. The greatest portion of these produce
no sensible effect; some because (though their magnitudes are large)
they act for so short time in one way, or their periods are so little
related to the periods of any movement of the moon, that their effects
never accumulate; others because their magnitudes are small, and
there is no unusual circumstance favourable to their increase.
   But there is one of these forces which, in the algebraical expres
sion, depends on 18 x mean longitude of Venus — 16 x mean lon
gitude of the earth, whose coefficient is exceedingly small, but which
goes through all its changes, from pulling to pulling again, in the
time,

  Here we have a real instance, exactly corresponding to the case which,
  for the sake of explanation, we assumed a short time back, and the
  results are truly such as were there described. During about 4000
  half-revolutions of the moon, or 2000 revolutions, the pulling force
  at apogee is gradually diminishing till it becomes a pushing force,
  and during about 2000 more revolutions, the pushing force at apogee
  is gradually diminishing till it becomes again a pulling force; the
  opposite changes going on in the force at perigee : and thus, for
  reasons fully explained before, the moon's orbit is gradually con
  tracting during 2000 revolutions, and gradually expanding during
  2000 revolutions more. And although the change in the size of the
  orbit is totally insensible in observation (for, according to a rough
 calculation, the utmost accumulation of change in the major axis of
 the moon's orbit is only ten feet, sometimes in increase and some
 times in decrease), yet the consequent alteration in its periodic time,
 continued through so many revolutions, is sufficient to cause the
 irregularity in question. The inequality in longitude, as measured
 on the moon's orbit, exceeds thirty miles, sometimes in advance, and
 sometimes in retard.
 ... For a complete understanding of this matter, it must carefully be
 borne in mind that the force at the apogee, which has been described
 as a pushing force through 136 years, is not absolutely a pushing
 force through every month of that time, but that (in consequence of
 the motion of the moon's line of apses) if we take any period of nine
 or ten years, the moon's apogee will in that time have passed through
 every position with regard to Venus, and therefore, upon the whole,
 during that period of nine or ten years, the force at apogee will have
 been a pushing force. In like manner, in another period of 136
years, if we take any period of nine or ten years, upon the whole,
 during that period of nine or ten years, the force at apogee will have
 been a pulling force.         º                                  -   -
     The general cause of the inequality depending on the argument

 pectic acids are also formed during the action of acids or alkalies on
 pectin or pectic acid : the pectates may by long boiling be con
 verted into metapectates. These two acids are readily distinguished
 from each other; for the first precipitates barytes water, and the .
 second does not; they decompose the double tartrate of copper and
 potash, as glucose does. 1: To be certain that this property was not
 derived from the presence of sugar, the author had recourse to a
 polarizing apparatus and the action of yest.       Guided by the advice
 of M. Biot, M. Fremy found that the parapectic and metapectic acids
 effected no rotary action on polarized light, and that the presence of

-bodies, and found that by employing very weak agents, comparable
 to those which exist in vegetables, their acidity might be suc
 cessively developed, and from neutral bodies, which they originally
 were, they might be transformed into energetic acids, the author
 examined whether, during the act of vegetation, gelatinous substances
 did not undergo changest comparable to those which he had pro
 duced artificially. On following for two years, with this intention,
 the modifications which are effected in fruits during their matura
 tion, M. Fremy found that the gelatinous bodies which occur in
 them could pass through the different intermediate states which he
 has described; thus green fruits contain abundance of pectose. As
 maturation advances the pectose is changed into pectin; and when
 the fruits are perfectly ripe, the pectin is frequently completely con
 verted into metapectic acid.º. The modifications examined in this
 menoir are then precisely those which occur during the maturation
 of fruits.orº-do tº 1-5 o- 9 tº pº<U+017F><U+017F> tº 15 woºl ºnomºdº ºn 1
    The author found in the numerous analyses which he performed
 that the composition of the gelatinous bodies could not be repre
 sented by carbon and water, and consequently, that they were far
 removed from neutral bodies, properly so called. As nexperiment
 always indicates a larger quantity of hydrogen than really exists in
 organic bodies, the author states that he cannot attribute the differ
 ence which he has obtained to an error of analysis.” ni wº
    The table presented to the Academy shows that all gelatinous
 substances, similar to those which are derived from starch, are iso
 meric, or at least they differ only by the elements of water. This

 result might be foreseen; for when a mixture of pectase and pectin
 is put into a bottle, and it is hermetically sealed, the pectin is suc
 cessively, converted into pectosic, pectic, parapectic, and metapectic
 acids, without forming any secondary, product.
       The capacities of saturation given in the following table prove that
 the acidity of the gelatinous bodies increases in proportion as their
 equivalent diminishes. Thus parapectin, the equivalent of which is
 very heavy, forms, a neutral salt with lead which contains 10 per
 cent. of oxide, and does not redden tincture of litmus ; and meta
 pectic acid, the equivalent of which is very light, produces a salt of
 lead which contains 67 of oxide, and its acidity resembles that of
 malic or citric acid.        /   ºr z o.º i<U+017F>  tº Y

 well-washed it is to be digested at 133° F. in a solution of prot
acetate of tin, with a slight excess of acid, and of specific gravity

 oAmong the many advantages possessed by the Chemical Society,
it appears to me not the least, that it affords to its members a ready
mode of communicating to one another many of those little practical
facts and modes of operating, which, although perhaps not of suffi
cient importance to merit distinct notice in the scientific journals,
are nevertheless of considerable value to those engaged in the prose
cution iof the science.                      In furtherance of this view I will therefore
describe some new forms of apparatus which I have myself been in
the habit of using for some time past.                                 ºn tº . . .     . . . . . . . . .”
  * The first of these is a mode of closing the mouths of gas-bottles,
or indeed<U+017F> of any wide-mouthed vessel into which tubes are to pass,
as in Woolf’s apparatus, gas generators, &c. To effect this the top
of the bottle is first to be slightly ground, so as to procure a level
surface, a piece of sheet caoutchouc is then laid upon it, and this is
covered by a disc of wood of the same size as the top of the bottle,
and from a quarter to half an inch in thickness. The wooden cover is
held in its place by means of a small double clamp of brass or of
varnished sheet iron, which passes across the cover, and the ends of
which are bent under the rim of the bottle, against which they are
pressed by a screw fixed in the centre of the clamp. By turning
the screw the caoutchouc is sufficiently compressed to render the
joint perfectly air-tight, The tubes intended to pass into and out

 of the bottle are cemented into the wooden cover, usually on one
  side of the clamp; and they pass of course through corresponding
 holes inithecaoutchouc., By making these holes somewhat smaller
  than the diameter of the tubes, the caqutchouc contracts so closely
 around them, that not only is any liquid which might be accidentally
 thrownup effectually prevented from getting between the caoutchouc                                ‘.
 and the wooden cover, but the necessity of cementing the tube into
 the cover may be even dispensed with.0 This method is so effectual
 and easily arranged, that I am quite convinced it will supersede the
 use of corks in the preparation of all gases which only require the
 application of a moderate heat, and do not act; upon caoutchouc.
 Ground glass plates might of course be substituted where caoutchouc
 is inapplicable, or a sheet of ground glass might be eemented upon
 the lower part of the wooden cover; but these modes would be rather
expensive, and the cases in which they would be required are not
very numerous. In small bottles the use of a clamp is not essential,
as sufficient pressure may be obtained by inserting two wedges of
wood beneath a string tied around the neck, and over the top of the
bottle. . . ."        .                :: *t is    -   º, if 3--ºf 90 ºn                 ºf

     I will next direct the attention of the Members to a new mode of
cupelling, or rather to a new form of muffle. Cupellation is an ope
ration not often performed by amateurs, chiefly I believe on account
of the difficulty in doing it unless provided with furnaces built ex
pressly for the purpose. -The following plan I have found to afford
most accurate results, while it may be performed in almost any fur
nace:—The mouths of two black lead crucibles of the same size are
to be ground flat, so that when applied one to the other they may
stand quite steady.cº. An oblong or semicircular notch is to be cut
out of the mouth of one of the crucibles, and a hole is also to be

                Intelligence and Mistellaneous Articles.                      395
drilled through its bottom. This cruciblé, when placed upon the top
of the other constitutes the muffle, and of course resemblesfinishape
a skittle. To cupel with this apparatus, the lower crucible is nearly
filled with clean sand, set upon the bars of the grate in the centre of
the furnace, and brought to allow-red-heat. 11 he cupel containing
the lead and the alloy is then placed upon the sand and immediately
covered by the other crucible, taking care that the notch in its side
shall be oppositelito, and correspond2 with the furnace-door; more
fuel is added, during whichoit is well td cover theibole in the top
 of the mufflé with a crucible lid, in order to prevent the admission
of dirt.ro When the muffle has become throughout of a bright red
heat, the furnace-doorjis thrown open, and thesignited fuelgently
moved aside, so as<U+017F>tonpermit a<U+017F> view of the sideOopening in the
muffle. The current of air which is thus established through the
muffle instantly causes rapidioxidation of the lead, and this may be
 regulated at pleasure byoclosing: the door more or less, tº If from
the fuel falling down any difficulty should be experienced in main
 taining a free passage for the air, a portion of a porcelain tube or a
 gun-barrel may be passed through the furnace-door to within an
 inch of the muffle; but this proceeding is generally rendered quite
 unnecessary by taking care to place some large pieces of coke im
 mediately around the door of the furnace.
    In many cases it will be found advantageous to convert the lower
 crucible itself into the cupel by first half-filling it with sand and
 then ramming in pounded bone earth. I have found the above me
 thod to possess the following advantages:=In the first place, the
 crucibles may be maintained at a much higher temperature than can
 be readily obtained when the ordinary muffle is used, while the de
 gree of heat   *     the quantity of air admitted may be regulated with
 the greatest   º            Secondly, owing to the greater draught of air,
 the oxidation of the lead is more–quickly—effected; and lastly, by

 - The only inconvenience I have found in the process proposed by
 Drs. Will and Warrentrapp for the estimation of nitrogen in organic
 bodies, is the liability of the liquid in the gondenser being thrown
 backlinto the combustion-tube by sudden absorption taking place,
 or from too violent an evolution of the gases, part of it being ejected
 from the other extremity of the condenser,” So well-aware were its
 authors of this inconvenience, that they recommend in the analyses
 of substances rich in nitrogen the introduction of sugar, or some
 other body abounding in carbon, into the combustion-tube, a I have
 found that the necessity of this addition, which is of course open to
 many objections, may be entirely avoided by using a condenser
 nearly three times as large as that generally employed, and by sur
 mounting each of the bulbs with another bulb of about half its can
 pagity. The opening between the bulbs should be very wide, they
 being run into one another in the same manner as in the lower bulbs
 of Liebig's potash apparatus. With a condenser of this description,
 the large bulbs being la inch in diameter and about 4 inches †.
 I have never experienced the least accident, nor am I compelled to
 pay that constant attention to the progress of the combustion whic

    Mr. Taylor also exhibited a small instrument for holding Da
guerreotype plates during the process of washing off. It consisted
of two pieces of brass or plaited wire fitted into a wooden handle.
One of the wires is bent into the form of an acute triangle, its base
being slightly turned up, so as to form a ledge for the silver plate
to rest upon. The other wire is placed between the sides of the

of the plate, and keeps it in its place. By inserting the fore-finger
in the loop of the spring, the plate may be shaken violently without
becoming dislodged.

   MM. Poumarède           and Figuer state as a test of t e purity of 1 gnin,
that when immersed in concentrated sulphuric acid it is not ren
dered black. In order to procure it in this state, a piece of wood
is to be tº: are to be immersed in
soap ley for twenty-four hours; the mixture<U+017F> is then to be diluted
with once or twice its weight of water and poured off; the insoluble
residue is to be largely washed with water, treated with a slight ex
cess of dilute hydrochloric acid, and againwashed with water. After
this the ligneous fibre is to be treated with great exeess of a solution
of common salt; the digestion is to be continued with occasional
stirring for two or three days, a fresh portion of the solution being
once used; this being poured off, the fibrous matter is to be treated
with a weak alkaline solution till it comes away colourless; it is to
be again washed, and the remaining alkali is to be saturated by slight
excess of hydrochloric acid, and after again washing with distilled
water till litmus is not reddened, the product, placed on a sieve, is
to be dried either in the sun or a stove. . . . " " ºr                                   º' tº
   The lignin thus obtained, after being washed with alcohol and
aether, is not coloured by concentrated sulphuric acid, and is to be
considered as absolutely pure. It is white and silky, and possesses
the organic structure of the wood from which it has been obtained;
and the authors consider thenselves authorized to conclude that in
analysing this substance, they operate on the vegetable skeleton such
as it exists in plants,                                                   -º-º-º:
   The authors find that the results of their analyses differ but very
little from those obtained by M. Payen; they nevertheless deem it
necessary to state them as satisfactorily proving the agreement which
exists between the various kinds of lignin of very different origin.

    Papyrin-In employing sulphuric acid to determine the purity of
lignin, the authors have discovered a new substance which consti
tutes a very curious modification of ligneous tissues. It results from
the first action of sulphuric acid on lignin, and is the product which
arises before its conversion into dextrin.                . ." . . . . . ."
    Let blotting-paper be immersed for not more than half a minute
in concentrated sulphuric acid, and then be immediately washed with
a large quantity of water to prevent the action of the acid; and if
it be then immersed for a few moments into water containing a few
drops of ammonia, a substance is obtained which possesses all the
 physical characters of an animal membrane. When moistened with
 water, it has the soft and greasy feel of animal membrane softened
 in water; when dried it has the appearance and the toughness of
 parchment, and when glazed it has considerable transparency.º.º.
    This substance, which the authors call papyrin, is identical in
composition with lignin. It was found to yield–                  ---

solubility of cHLoRIDE of silver IN Hydrochloric Acid.
    M. Pierre states that concentrated hydrochloric acid is capable of
dissolving gººdth of its weight of chloride of silver; when it has
been diluted with twice its weight of water, it is capable of retain
ing more than gººdth of its weight.                    a
   M. Gerhardt observes that this fact is important, and says he
had previously stated it; and it appears to him to be the cause of
the difference of the numbers obtained by MM. Berzelius and Ma
rignac as to the theoretical number expressing the atomic weight of
chlorine according to Dr. Prout's law of multiples.—Ibid. Sept. 1847.

 402       Dr. Faraday on the Diamagnetic conditions
 but the ends were shaped to a form approaching that of a cone,
 of which the sides have an angle of about 100°, and the axis
 of which is horizontal and in the upper surface of the pieces
 of iron. The apex of each end was rounded; nearly a tenth
 of an inch of the cone being in this way removed. When
 these terminations are brought near to each other, they give
 a powerful effect in the magnetic field, and the axial line of
 magnetic force is of course horizontal, and on a level nearly
 with the upper surface of the bars. I have found this form
 exceedingly advantageous in a great variety of experiments.
    When the flame of a wax taper was held near the axial
 line, but on one side or the other, about one-third of the flame
 rising above the level of the upper surface of the poles, as
 soon as the magnetic force was on, the flame was affected;
 and receded from the axial line, moving equatorially, until it
 took an inclined position, as if a gentle wind was causing its
 deflection from the upright position; an effect which ceased
 the instant the magnetism was removed.
    The effect was not instantaneous, but rose gradually to a
 maximum. It ceased very quickly when the magnetism was
 removed. The progressive increase is due to the gradual pro
 duction of currents in the air about the magnetic field, which
 tend to be, and are, formed on the assumption of the magnetic
conditions, in the presence of the flame.
    When the flame was placed so as to rise truly across the
magnetic axis, the effect of the magnetism was to compress
the flame between the points of the poles, making it recede in
the direction of the axial line from the poles towards the middle
transverse plane, and also to shorten the top of the flame. At
the same time the top and sides of the compressed part burnt
more vividly, because of two streams of air which set in from
the poles on each side directly against the flame, and then
passed out with it in the equatorial direction. But there was
at the same time a repulsion or recession of the parts of the
flame from the axial line; for those portions which were below
did not ascend so quickly as before, and in ascending they
also passed offin an inclined and equatorial direction.
   On raising the flame a little more, the effect of the magnetic
force was to increase the intensity of the results just described,
and the flame actually became of a fish-tail shape, disposed
across the magnetic axis.
   If the flame was raised until about two-thirds of it were
above the level of the axial line, and the poles approached so
near to each other (about 0.3 of an inch) that they began to
cool and compress the part of the flame at the axial line, yet
without interfering with its rising freely between them; then,

                         of Flame and Gases.                  403
on rendering the magnet active, the flame became more and
more compressed and shortened; and as the effects proceeded
to a maximum, the top at last descended, and the flame no
more rose between the magnetic poles, but spread out right
and left on each side of the axial line, producing a double
flame with two long tongues. This flame was very bright
along the upper extended forked edge, being there invigorated
by a current of air which descended from between the poles on
to the flame at this part, and in fact drove it away in the equa
torial direction.
    When the magnet was thrown out of action, the flame re
sumed its ordinary upright form between the poles, at once;
being depressed and redivided again by the renewal of the
magnetic action.       -
    When a small flame, only about one-third of an inch high,
was placed between the poles, the magnetic force instantly
flattened it into an equatorial disc.
    If a ball of cotton about the size of a nut be bound up by
wire, soaked in aether and inflamed, it will give a flame six
or seven inches high. This large flame rises freely and natu
rally between the poles; but as soon as the magnet is rendered
active, it divides and passes off in two flames, the one on one
side, and the other on the other side of the axial line.
 | Such therefore is the general and very striking effect which
may be produced on a flame by magnetic action, the import
ant discovery of which we owe to P. Bancalari.              -
    I verified the results obtained by M. Zantedeschi with dif
ferent flames, and found that those produced by alcohol, aether,
coal-gas, hydrogen, sulphur, phosphorus, and camphor were all
affected in the same manner, though not apparently with equal
strength. The brightest flames appeared to be most affected.
    The chief results may be shown in a manner in some re
spects still more striking and instructive than those obtained
 with flame, by using a smoking taper. A taper made of wax,
coloured green by verdigris, if suffered to burn upright for a
 minute and then blown out, will usually leave a wick with a
 spark of fire on the top. The subdued combustion will how
 ever still go on, even for an hour or more, sending up a thin
 dense stream of smoke, which, in a quiet atmosphere, will rise
 vertically for six or eight inches; and in a moving atmosphere
 will show every change of its motion, both as to direction and
 intensity. When the taper is held beneath the poles, so that
 the stream of smoke passes a little on one side of the axial
line, the stream is scarcely affected by the power of the mag
net, the taper being three or four inches below the poles; but
 if the taper be raised, so that the coal is not more than an inch
                               2 D 2

404       Dr. Faraday on the Diamagnetic conditions
below the axial line, the stream of smoke is much more
affected, being bent outwards; and if it be brought still higher,
there is a point at which the smoke leaves the taper-wick even
in a horizontal direction, to go equatorially. If the taper be
held so that theismoke-stream passes through the axial line,
and then the distances be varied as before, there is little or
no sensible effect when the wick is four inches below: but
being raised, as soon as the warm part of the stream is between
the poles, it tends to divide; and when the ignited wick is
about an inch below the axial line, the smoke rises vertically
in one column until about two-thirds of that distance is passed
over, and then it divides, going right and left, leaving the space
between the poles clear. As the taper is slowly raised, the
division of the smoke descends, taking place lower down, until
it occurs upon the wick, at the distance of 0-4 or 0'5 of an
inch below the axial line. If the taper be raised still more,
the magnetic effect is so great, as not only to divide the stream,
but to make it descend on each side of the ignited wick, pro
ducing a form resembling that of the letter W ; and at the
same time the top of the burning wick is greatly brightened
by the stream of air that is impelled downwards upon it. In
these experiments the magnetic poles should be about 0.25 of
an inch apart.
   A burning piece of amadou, or the end of a splinter of wood,
produced the same effect.
   By means of a small spark and stream of smoke, I have even
rendered the power of an ordinary magnet, in affecting them,
evident. The magnet was a good one, and the poles were
close to each other and conical in form.
   Before leaving this description of the general phaenomenon
and proceeding to a consideration of the principles of mag
netic action concerned in it, I may say that a single pole of
the magnet produces similar effects upon flame and smoke,
but that they are much less striking and observable.
   Though the effect be so manifest in a flame, it is not, at
first sight, evident what is the chief cause or causes of the
result. The heat of the flame is the most apparent and pro
bable condition; but there are other circumstances which may
be equally or more influential. Chemical action is going on
at the time:—solid matter, which is known to be diamagnetic,
exists in several of the flames used: and a great difference
exists between the matter of the flame and the surrounding
air. Now any or all of these circumstances of temperature,
chemical action, solidity of part of the matter, and differential
composition in respect to the surrounding air, may concur in
producing or influencing the result.

   I placed the wires of an electrometer, and also of a galvano
meter, in various parts of the affected flame, but could not
procure any indications of the evolution of electricity-by any
action on the instruments.” . . . . ºf <U+017F>toºd ºftov toº sº tº
   I examined the neighbourhood of the axial line as to the
existence of any current in the air when there was no flame or
heat there, using the visible fumes produced when little pellets
of paper dipped in strong solutions of ammonia and muriatic
acid were held near each other; and though I found that a
stream of such smoke was feebly affected by the magnetic
power, yet I was satisfied there was no current or motion in
the common air, as such, between the poles. The smoke
itself was feebly diamagnetic; due, I believe, to the solid par
ticles in it.
   But when flame or a glowing taper is used, strong currents
are, under favourable circumstances, produced in the air. If
the flame be between the poles, these currents take their course
along the surface of the poles, which they leave at the opposite
faces connected by the axial line, and passing parallel to the
axial line, impinge on the opposite sides of the flame; and
feeding the flame, they make part of it, and proceed out equa
torially. If the flame be driven asunder by the force of these
currents and retreat, the currents follow it; and so, when the
flame is forked, the air which is between the poles forms a
current which sets from the poles downwards and sideways
towards the flame.      I do not mean that the air in every case
travels along the surface of the poles or along the axial lines,
or even from between the poles; for in the case of the glowing
taper, held half an inch or so beneath the axial line, it is the
cool air which is next nearest to the taper, and (generally)
between the taper and the axial line, that falls with most force
upon it. In fact the movements of the parts of the air and
flame are due to a differential action. We shall see presently
 that the air is diamagnetic as well as flame or hot smoke; i.e.
 that both tend, according to the general law which I have ex
 pressed in the Experimental Researches (2267, &c.), to move
 from stronger to weaker places of magnetic force, but that
 hot air and flame are more so than cold or cooler air: so, when
 flame and air, or air at different temperatures, exist at the
 same time within a space under the influence of magnetic
 forces, differing in intensity of action, the hotter particles will
 tend to pass from stronger to weaker places of action, to be
 replaced by the colder particles; the former therefore will have
 the effect of being repelled; and the currents that are set up
 are produced by this action, combined with the mechanical
 force or current possessed by the flame in its ordinary relation
 to the atmosphere.

  406        Dr. Faraday on the Diamagnetic conditions
     It will be evident to you that I have considered flame only
  as a particular case of a general law. It is a most important
  and beautiful one, and it has given us the discovery of dia
  magnetism in gaseous bodies: but it is a complicated one,
  as I shall now proceed to show, by analysing some of its
  conditions and separating their effects.
     For the purpose of examining the effect of heat alone in
  conducing to the diamagnetic condition of flame, a small helix
  of fine platina wire was attached to two stronger wires of cop
  per, so that the helix could be placed in any given position as
  regarded the magnetic poles, and at the same time be ignited
  at pleasure by a voltaic battery. In this manner it was substi
  tuted for the burning taper, and gave a beautiful highly-heated
  current of air, unchanged in its chemical condition. When
  the helix was placed directly under the axial line, the hot air
  rose up between the poles freely, being rendered evident above
  by a thermometer, or by burning the finger, or even scorching
  paper; but as soon as the magnet was rendered active, the
 hot air divided into a double stream, and was found ascending
  on the two sides of the axial line; but a descending current
  was formed between the poles, flowing downwards towards the
  helix and the hot air, which rose and passed off sideways
 from it.
     It is therefore perfectly manifest that hot air is diamagnetic
 in relation to, or more diamagnetic than, cold air; and, from
 this fact I concluded, that, by cooling the air below the natural
 temperature, I should cause it to approach the magnetic axis,
 or appear to be magnetic in relation to ordinary air. I had
 a little apparatus made, in which a vertical tube delivering
 air was passed through a vessel containing a frigorific mix
 ture; the latter being so clothed with flannel that the ex
 ternal air should not be cooled, and so invade the whole of
 the magnetic field. The central current of cold air was di
 rected downwards a little on one side of the axial line, and
 falling into a tube containing a delicate air-thermometer, there
 showed its effect. On rendering the magnet active, this effect
 however ceased, and the thermometer rose; but on bringing
 the latter under the axial line it again fell, showing that the
 cold current of air had been drawn inwards or attracted to
 wards the axial line, i.e. had been rendered magnetic in rela
tion to air at common temperatures, or less diamagnetic than
it. The lower temperature was 0°F. The effect was but
small; still it was distinct.
    The effect of heat upon air, in so greatly increasing its dia
magnetic condition, is very remarkable.       It is not, I think, at
all probable that the mere effect of expanding the air is the
cause of the change in its condition, because one would beled

                         of Flame and Gases.                    407
   to expect that a certain bulk of expanded air would be less
   sensible in its diamagnetic effects than an equal bulk of denser
   air; just as one would anticipate that a vacuum would present
   no magnetic or diamagnetic effects whatever, but be at the
   zero point between the two classes of bodies (Experimental
   Researches, 2423, 2424). It is certainly true, that if the air
   were a body belonging to the magnetic class, then its expan
   sion, being equivalent to dilution, would make it seem dia
   magnetic in relation to ordinary air (Experimental Researches,
   2367,2438); but that, I think, is not likely to be the case,
   as will be seen by the results described further on in reference
  to oxygen and nitrogen.
      If the power conferred by heat is a direct consequence, and
  proportionate to the temperature, then it gives a very remark
  able character to gases and vapours, which, as we shall see
  hereafter, possess it in common. In my former experiments
  (Experimental Researches, 2359, 2397) I heated various dia
  magnetic bodies, but could not perceive that their degree of
  magnetic force was at all increased or affected by the tempe
  rature given to them. I have again submitted small cylinders
  of copper and silver to the action of a single pole, at common
  temperatures and at a red heat, with the same result. If
  there was any effect of increased temperature, it was that of
  a very slight increase in the diamagnetic force, but I am not
 sure of the result. At present, therefore, the gaseous and va
 porous bodies seem to be strikingly distinguished by the power
 ful effect which heat has in increasing their diamagnetic con
 dition.
     As all the experiments, whether on flame, smoke, or air,
 seemed to show that air had a distinct magnetic relation, which,
 though highly affected by temperature, still belonged to it at
 all temperatures; so it was a probable conclusion that other
 gaseous or vaporous bodies would be diamagnetic or mag
 netic, and that they would differ from each other even at com
 mon or equal temperatures. I proceeded therefore to examine
 them, delivering streams of each into the air, in the first in
stance, by fit apparatus and arrangements, and examining the
course taken by these streams in passing across the magnetic
field, the magnetic force being either induced or not at the
tlme.                      -
    In delivering the various streams, I sometimes introduced
the gases into a globe with a mouth and also a tubular spout,
and then poured the gas out of the spout, upwards or down
wards, according as it was lighter or heavier than air. At
other times, as with muriatic acid or ammonia, I delivered the
streams from the mouth of the retort.      But as it is very im

408         Dr. Faraday on the Diamagnetic conditions
portant not       lº. field with a quantity of in
visible gas, I devised the following arrangement, which an
swered well for all the gases not soluble in water. A Woulf’s
bottle was chosen having three apertures at the top, a, b and c;
a wide tube was fixed into aperture a, descending within the
bottle to the bottom, and being open above and below; by
this any water could be poured into the bottle and employed
to displace the gas previously within it. Aperture b was closed
by a stopper.    º an external tube, with a stop
cock fixed in it to conduct the gas to any place desired. To
expel the gas and send it forward, a cistern of water was placed
above the bottle, and its cock so plugged by a splinter of
wood, that when full open it delivered only twelve cubic inches
of fluid in a minute. This stream of water being directed into
aperture a, and the cock of tube c open, twelve cubic inches
of any gas within the Woulf’s bottle was delivered in a minute
of time; and this I found an excellent proportion for our mag
net and apparatus.
    With respect to the delivery of this gas at the magnetic
poles, a piece of glass tube bent into this shape        ) was held
by a clamp on the stage of the magnet, so that it could easily
be slipped backward and forward, or to one side, and so its
 vertical part be placed anywhere below the axial line. The
 aperture at this end was about the one-eighth of an inch in
 ternal diameter. In the horizontal part near the angle was
 placed a piece of bibulous paper, moistened with strong solu
 tion of muriatic acid (when necessary). The horizontal part
 of the tube was connected and disconnected in a moment, when
 necessary, with the tube c of the gas-bottle, by a short piece
 of vulcanized rubber tube. If the gas to be employed as a
 stream were heavier than the surrounding medium, then the
 glass tube, instead of having the form delineated above, was
 so bent as to deliver its stream downwards and over the axial
 line. In this manner currents of different gases could be de
 livered, perfectly steady and under perfect command.
     The next point was to detect and trace the course of these
 streams. . A little ammonia vapour, delivered near the mag
 netic field, did this in some degree, but was not satisfactory;
  for, in the first place, the little cloud of muriate of ammonia
 particles formed, is itself diamagnetic; and further, the tran
 quil condition of the air in the magnetic field was then too
  much disturbed. Catch-tubes were therefore arranged, con
  sisting of tubes of thin glass about the size and length of a
 finger, open at both ends, and fixed upon little stands so that
  they could be adjusted either over or under the magnetic poles
 at pleasure. When they were over the poles, I generally had

                        of Flame and Gases.                   409
three at once; one over the axial line and one at each side,
When they were under the poles, the lower end was turned
up a little for the purpose of facilitating observation there.
   The gas delivered at the poles, as    ...'                COIl
tained a little muriatic acid (obtained from the solution in the
paper), but not enough to render it visible. To make it ma
nifest up which catch-tube it passed, a little piece of bibulous
paper, folded and bound round and suspended by a copper
wire, was dipped in the solution of ammonia and hung in each
of the tubes. It was then evident at once, by the visible fume
formed at the top of one of the tubes, whether the gas delivered
below passed up the one or the other tube, and which : and
yet the gas was perfectly clear and transparent as it passed by
the place of magnetic action.
    In addition to these arrangements, I built up a sheltering
chamber about the magnetic poles and field, to preserve the
air undisturbed. This was about six inches long by four inches
in width and height, and was easily made of thin plates of
 mica, which were put together or taken down in a moment.
 The chamber was frequently left more or less open at the top
 or bottom for the escape of gases, or the place of the catch
 tubes. Its advantages were very great.
    Air.—In the first place air was sent in under these arrange
 ments, the stream being directed by the axial line. It made
 itself visible in the catch-tube above by the smoke produced;
 but whether the magnet was active or not, its course was the
 same; showing that, so far, the apparatus worked well, and
 did not of itself cause any erroneous indications.
    Nitrogen.—This gas was sent from below upwards, and
 passed directly by the axial line into the catch-tube above;
 but when the magnet was made active, the stream was affected,
 and though not stopped in the middle catch-tube, part ap
 peared in the side tubes. The jet was then arranged a little
 on one side of the axial line, so that, without the magnetic
 action, it still ascended and went up the middle catch-tube:
 then, when the magnetic action was brought on, it was clearly
 affected, and a great portion of it was sent to the side catch
 tube. The nitrogen was, in fact, manifestly diamagnetic in
 relation to common air, when both were at the same tem
 perature; but as four-fifths of the atmosphere consists of ni
 trogen, it seemed very evident, from the result, that nitrogen
 and oxygen must be very different from each other in their
 magnetic relations.
     Oxygen.—A stream of oxygen was sent down through air
 between the poles. When there was no magnetic action it
 descended vertically, and when the magnetic action was on it

  410        Dr. Faraday on the Diamagnetic conditions
  appeared to do the same ; at all events it did not pass off
  equatorially. But as there was reason, from the above expe
  riments with nitrogen, to expect that oxygen would appear,
  not diamagnetic but magnetic in air; so the place of the
  stream was changed and made to be on one side of the
  axial line. In this case it fell perfectly well at first into a
 catch-tube placed beneath; but as soon as the magnet was
 rendered active, the stream was deflected, being drawn towards
 the axial line, and fell into another catch-tube placed there to
 receive it. So oxygen appears to be magnetic in common air.
  Whether it be really so, or only less diamagnetic than air (a
 mixture of oxygen and nitrogen), we shall be better able to
 consider hereafter.
     Hydrogen.—This gas proved to be clearly and even strongly
 diamagnetic; for notwithstanding the powerful ascensive force
 which its stream has in the atmosphere, because of its small
 specific gravity, still it was well deflected and sent equatorially.
 Considering the lightness of the gas, one might have expected
 that it would have been drawn towards the axial line, as a
 stream of rarefied air (if it could exist) would be. Its dia
 magnetic state, therefore, shows in a striking point of view,
 that gases, like solids, have peculiar and distinctive degrees of
 diamagnetic force.
    Carbonic acid.—This gas made a beautiful experiment.
 The stream was delivered downwards a little on one side of
the axial line; a catch-tube was placed a little further out, so
that the stream should fall clear of it as long as there was no
activity in the magnet. But on rendering the magnet efficient,
the stream left its vertical direction, passed equatorially, and
fell into the catch-tube; and by looking horizontally, could
be seen flowing out at its lower extremity like a spring, and
falling away through the air. Again, the magnet was thrown
out of action, and a glass with lime-water placed beneath the
lower end of the catch-tube; no carbonic acid appeared there,
though the fluid in the glass was continually stirred; but the
instant the magnet was made, the carbonic acid appeared in
the catch-tube, fell into the glass and made the lime-water
turbid. This gas therefore is diamagnetic in air.
    Carbonic oxide.—This gas was carefully freed from carbonic
acid before it was used. It was employed as a descending
stream, and was apparently very diamagnetic: but it is to be
remarked, that a substance which is so nearly the specific gra
vity of atmospheric air is easily dispersed right and left in it,
and therefore that the facility of dispersion is not a correct
indication of the diamagnetic force. By introducing a little
ammonia into the mica chamber, it was, however, easily seen

                      of Flame and Gases.     .              41 I
that carbonic oxide was driven away equatorially with consi
derable power; and I judge from the appearance, that it is
more diamagnetic than carbonic acid.
   Nitrous owide.—This gas was moderately, but clearly, dia
magnetic in air. Much interest belongs to this and the other
compounds of nitrogen and oxygen, both because they contain
the same elements as air, and because of the relations of ni
trogen and oxygen separately.
   Nitric owide.—I tried this gas both as an up and down
current, but could not determine its magnetic condition. What
with the action of the oxygen of the air, the change of the
nature of the substances, and the heat produced, there was so
much incidental disturbance and so little effect due to magnetic
influence, that I could not be sure of the result. On the whole
it was very slightly diamagnetic; but so little, that the effect
might be due to the smoke particles which served to render it
visible.
   Nitrous acid gas-Difficult to observe, but I believe it is
slightly magnetic in relation to air.
   Olefiant gas was diamagnetic, and well so. The little dif
ference in specific gravity of this gas and air, even creates a
difficulty in following the course of the olefiant gas, unless it
be watched for on every side.
   Coal-gas.-The coal-gas of London is lighter than air, being
only about two-thirds in weight of the latter. It is very well
diamagnetic, and gives exceedingly good and distinct re
sults.
   Sulphurous acid gas is diamagnetic in air. It was generated
in a small tube containing liquid sulphurous acid; this being
connected, in place of the gas bottle, with the delivery-tube
and mouthpiece by the vulcanized rubber tube. The presence
or absence of the gas in the catch-tube was well shown by
ammonia, and still better by litmus paper.
   Muriatic acid.—The retort in which it was generated was
connected, as just described, with the delivery-tube. The gas
was very decidedly diamagnetic in air.
   Hydriodic acid was also diamagnetic in air. When there
was an abundant stream of gas, its entrance into and passage
through the side catch-tube, on rendering the magnet active,
was very striking. When there was less gas, the stream was
dispersed equatorially in all directions, and less entered the
tube.
   Fluo-silicon.—Diamagnetic in air.                    -
   Ammonia.-This gas was evolved from materials in a retort,
and tested in the catch-tube above by muriatic acid in the
paper. It was well diamagnetic, corresponding in this respect

412         Dr. Faraday on the Diamagnetic conditions
with the character of its elements.” It could also be very well
indicated by reddened litmus paper held over the tubes.
   Chlorine was sent from the Woulf's bottle apparatus, and
proved to be decidedly diamagnetic in air. Either ammonia by
its fumes, or litmus paper by its becoming bleached, served
to indicate the entrance of the chlorine into the side catch
tube every time the magnet was rendered active.
   Iodine.-A piece of glass tube was so shaped at its lower
extremity as to form a chamber for the reception of iodine,
which chamber had a prolonged mouth directed downwards
so as to deliver the vapour formed within. On putting a little
iodine into the chamber, then heating it, and especially the
mouth part, by a spirit-lamp, and afterwards inclining the
apparatus, abundance of the vapour of iodine was generated
as the substance flowed on to the hotter parts, and passed in
a good stream from the mouth downwards. This purple
stream was diamagnetic in air, and could be seen flowing right
and left from the axial line, when not too dense. If very dense
and heavy, its gravity was such as to make it break through
the axial line, notwithstanding the action of the magnet; still
it was manifest that iodine is diamagnetic to air.
   Bromine.—A little bromine was put into the horizontal part
of the delivery tube, and then air passed over it by the apparatus
already described. So much bromine rose into vapour as to
make the air of a yellow colour, and caused it to fall well in
a stream by the axial line. A little ammonia delivered near
the magnetic field showed that this stream was diamagnetic,
and hence it may fairly be presumed that the pure vapour of
bromine would be diamagnetic also.
   Cyanogen.—Strongly diamagnetic in air.
   Taking air as the standard of comparison, it is very striking
to observe, that much as gases appear to differ one from an
other in the degree of their diamagnetic condition, there are
very few that are not more diamagnetic than it; and when the
investigation is carried forward into the relation of the two
chief constituents of air, oxygen and nitrogen, it is still more
striking to observe the very low condition of oxygen, which,
in fact, is the cause of the comparatively low condition of air.
Of all the vapours and gases yet tried, oxygen seems to be
that which has the least diamagnetic force. It is as yet a
question where it stands; for it may be as low as a vacuum,
or may even pass to the magnetic side of it, and experiment
does not as yet give an answer to the question. I believe it to
be diamagnetic; and this belief is strengthened by the action of
heat upon it, to be described hereafter; but it is exceedingly low
in the scale, and far below chlorine, iodine, and such like bodies.

   All the compounds of oxygen, and nitrogen seem to show
the influence of the presence of the oxygen, Nitrous acid
seems to be less diamagnetic than air. Nitric oxide mingled
with nitrous acid and warm, is about as air. Nitrous oxide is
clearly diamagnetic in air, though it, contains more oxygen:
but it also contains more nitrogen than air, and is also denser
than it, so that there is more matter present; still, I think
the results are in favour of the idea that oxygen is diamagnetic.
By referring to the relation of carbonic oxide to carbonic acid,
described further on, it will be seen that the addition of oxygen
seems to make a body less diamagnetic. . But the truth may
be, not that oxygen is really magnetic, but that a compound
body possesses a specific diamagnetic force, which is not the
sum of the forces of its particles.
   It is very difficult to form more than a mere guess at the
relative degree of diamagnetic force possessed by different
gaseous bodies when they are examined only in air, because
of the many circumstances which tend to confuse the results.
First, there is the invisibility of the gas which deprives one of
the power of adjusting by sight so as to obtain the best effect:
then, there is the difference of gravity; for if a gas ascend or
descend in a rapid stream, it may seem less deflected than
another flowing more slowly, though it be more diamagnetic;
and as to gases nearly of the specific gravity of air, whether
more or less diamagnetic, they are almost entirely dispersed in
different directions, so that little only enters the catch-tube.
Another modifying circumstance is the distance of the aperture
delivering gas from the axial line, which, to obtain the max
imum effect, ought to vary with the gravity of the gases and
their diamagnetic force. Again, it is important that the mag
netic field be not filled with the gas to be examined, and that
generally speaking only a moderate stream be employed; which
however must depend again upon the specific gravity.
   The only correct way therefore of comparing two gases to
gether is to experiment with them one in the other. For the
experiments made with gases, in gases or in air are differential,
and similar in their nature with those made on a former occasion
with solutions (Experimental Researches, 2362, &c.); I there
fore changed the surrounding medium in a few experiments,
substituting other gases for air; and first chose carbonic acid
as a body easy to experiment with, and one that would, pro
bably, be more powerfully than some other of the gases, dia
magnetic (I speak as to the appearances or relative results only)
In all",
   I constructed a kind of tray or box, by folding up a doubled
sheet of waxed paper; thus making a vessel thirteen inches

414         Dr. Faraday on the Diamagnetic conditions
long, five inches wide, and five inches high. This was placed
on the ends of the great magnet, and the terminal pieces of
iron before described, placed in it. The box was covered
 over loosely by plates of mica, and formed a long square
 chamber in which were contained the magnetic poles and field.
All the former arrangements in respect of the magnetic field,
the delivery-tube, the catch-tubes, &c., were then made; and,
lastly, the box was filled with carbonic acid by a tube, which
entered it at one corner; and was, from time to time, supplied
with a fresh portion of gas, as the previous contents became
diluted with gases or air. Everything answered perfectly,
and the following results were easily obtained.
    Air passed axially, being less diamagnetic than carbonic
acid gas.                                               -
    Oxygen passed to the magnetic axis, as was to be expected.
    Nitrogen went equatorially, being therefore diamagnetic,
even in carbonic acid.
   Hydrogen, coal-gas, oleftant gas, muriatic acid and ammonia
passed equatorially in carbonic acid, and were fairly diamag
netic in relation to it.
    Carbonic oxide was very fairly diamagnetic in carbonic acid
gas. Here the effect of oxygen seems to be very well illus
trated. Equal volumes of carbonic oxide and carbonic acid
contain equal quantities of carbon; but the former contains
only half as much oxygen as the latter. Yet it is more dia
magnetic than the latter; so, that, though an additional volume
and quantity of oxygen, equal to that in the carbonic oxide, is
in the carbonic acid added and compresed into it, it does not
add to, but actually takes from, the diamagnetic force.
    Nitrous oride appears to be slightly diamagnetic in relation
to carbonic acid; but nitric oxide gas was in the contrary re
lation and passed towards the axial line.
    Hence it seems that carbonic acid, though more diamag
netic than air, is not far removed from it in that respect; and
this position it probably holds because of the quantity of
oxygen in it. The apparent place of nitrous oxide close to it
appears, in a great measure, to depend on the same circum
stance of oxygen entering largely into its composition. Still
it is manifest that the action is not directly as the oxygen, for
then common air would be more diamagnetic than either of
them.     It seems rather that the forces are modified, as in the
case also of iron and oxygen, and that each compound body
has its peculiar but constant intensity of action.
   In order to make similar experiments in light gases, the
two terminal pieces of the magnet were raised, so that they
might be covered by a French glass shade, which, with its

                       of Flame and Gases.                       415
stand, made a very good chamber about them. The pipe to
supply and change the gaseous medium, and also that for
bringing the gas under trial as a stream into the magnetic
field, passed through holes made in the bottom of the stand.
The different gases to be compared with those employed as
media, were, except in the cases of ammonia and chlorine,
mingled with a trace of muriatic acid, as before described.
The gaseous media used were two, coal-gas and hydrogen.
 Whilst using coal-gas, I observed the direction of the currents
of the other gases in it by bringing a little piece of paper, at the
end of a wire and dipped in ammonia solution, near the stream.
In the case of the hydrogen, I diffused a little ammonia through
the whole of the gas in the first instance.
   Air passed towards the axial line in coal-gas, but was not
much affected.
   Oxygen had the appearance of being strongly magnetic in
coal-gas, passing with great impetuosity to the magnetic axis,
and clinging about it; and if much muriate of ammonia fume
were purposely formed at the time, it was carried by the oxygen
to the magnetic field with such force as to hide the ends of the
magnetic poles. If then the magnetic action were suspended
for a moment, this cloud descended by its gravity; but being
quite below the poles, if the magnet were again rendered active,
the oxygen cloud immediately started up and took its former
place. The attraction of iron filings to a magnetic pole is not
more striking than the appearance presented by the oxygen
under these circumstances.
   Nitrogen.—Clearly diamagnetic in coal-gas.
    Olefiant, carbonic owide, and carbonic acid gases were all
slightly, but more or less diamagnetic in the coal-gas.
   On substituting hydrogen as the surrounding medium in
place of coal-gas, more care was taken in the experiments.
Each gas experimented upon was tried in it twice at least;
first in the hydrogen of a previous experiment, and then in a
new atmosphere of hydrogen.
   Air.—Air passes axially in hydrogen when there is very
little smoke in it: when there is much smoke in the stream
the latter is either indifferent or tends to pass equatorially. I
believe that air and hydrogen cannot be far from each other.
   Nitrogen is strikingly diamagnetic in hydrogen.
   Oaxygen is as strikingly magnetic in relation to hydrogen.
It presented the appearances already described as occurring
in coal-gas; but as the jet delivered the descending stream
of oxygen a little on one side of the axial line, its centrifugal
power, in relation to the axial line, was so balanced by the
centripetal power produced by the magnetic action, that the

416        Dr. Faraday on the Diamagnetic conditions
stream at first revolved in a regular ring round the axial line,
and produced a cloud that continued to spin round it asiong as
the magnetic force was continued, but fell down to the bottom
 of the chamber when that force was removed, ºdolº, º ºs
    Nitrous oride—This gas was clearly diamagnetic in the
hydrogen, and gave rise to avery beautiful result in conse:

the experiment, the little oxygen contained in the conducting
tube passed axially; but the instant that was expelled, and the
 nitrous oxide issued forth, the stream changed its direction,

    Notwithstanding the many disturbing causes which interfere:
with first and hasty experiments of this kind, and producei
results which occasionally cross and contradict each other, stilli
there are some very striking considerations which arise in
comparing the gases with each other at the same temperature.
Foremost amongst these is the place of oxygen; for of all the
gaseous bodies yet tried it is the least diamagnetic, and seems;
in this respect to stand far apart from the rest of them...Ther
condition of nitrogen, as being highly diamagnetic, is also im-2
portant. The place of hydrogen, as being less diamagnetic thane
nitrogen, and of chlorine, which, instead of approaching toº
oxygen, is above hydrogen, and also of iodine, which is pro
bably far above chlorine, are marked circumstances. º ºx of
    Air of course owes its place to the proportion and the indi
vidual diamagnetic character of the oxygen and nitrogen in it.”
The great difference existing between these two bodies in re
spect of magnetic relation, and the striking effect presented by .
oxygen in coal-gas and hydrogen, bodies not far removed from.
nitrogen in diamagnetic force, made methink it might not be
impossible to separate air into its two chief constituents by:
magnetic force alone. I made an experiment for this purpose:
but did not succeed; but I am, not convinced that it cannot
be done. For since we can actually distinguish certain gases, .
and especially these by their magnetic properties, it does not.

   In the course of these experiments I'subjected several of
the gases to heat, to ascertain whether they generally under
went the same exaltation of their diamagnetic power which oc
curred with common air. For this purpose a helix of platina
wire was placed in the mouth of the delivering tube, which
itself was placed below the magnetic axis between the poles.
The helix could be raised to any temperature by a little vol
taic battery, and any gas could be sent through it and upwards
across the magnetic field by means of the Woulf’s bottle ap
paratus already described. It was easy to ascertain whether
the gas went directly up between the poles, or, on making the
magnet, left that direction and formed two equatorial side
streams, either by the sensation on the finger, or by a spiral
thermoscope formed of a compound lamina of platinum and
silver placed in a tube above. In every case the hot gas was
diamagnetic in the air, and I think far more so than if the gas
had been at common temperatures. The gases tried were as
follows: oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, nitrous oxide, carbonic
acid, muriatic acid, ammonia, coal-gas, olefiant gas.
   But as in these experiments the surrounding air would, of
necessity, mingle with the gas first heated, and so form, in
fact, a part of the heated stream, I arranged the platinum
helix so that I could heat it in a given gas, and thus compare
the same gas at different temperatures with itself.
   A stream of hot oxygen in cold oxygen was powerfully
diamagnetic. The effect and its degree may be judged of by
the following circumstances. When the platinum helix below
the axial line was ignited, the effect of heat on the indicating
compound spiral, placed in a tube over the axial line, was
such as to cause its lower extremity to pass through one and
a half revolutions, or 540°: when the magnetic force was
rendered active, the spiral returned through all these degrees
to its first position, as if the ignited helix below had been
lowered to the common temperature or taken away; and, yet
in respect of it, nothing had been changed. On rendering
the magnet inactive, the current of hot oxygen instantly re
sumed its perpendicular course and affected the thermoscope
as before.                                                 -     -
   On experimenting with carbonic acid, it was found that
hot carbonic acid was diamagnetic to cold carbonic acid; and
the effects were apparently as great in amount as in oxygen.
   On making the same arrangement in hydrogen, I failed to
obtain any result regarding the relation of the hot and cold
gas, for this reason:—that I could not, in any case, either
   Phil. Mag. S. 3. Vol. 31. No. 210. Dec. 1847.        2 E

418        Dr. Faraday on the Diamagnetic conditions
with or without the magnetic action, obtain any signs of heat
on the thermoscopic spiral above, even when the platinum
helix, not more than an inch below it, was nearly white hot.
This effect is, I think, greatly dependent upon the rapidity
with which hydrogen is heated and cooled in comparison with
other gases, and also upon the vicinity of the cold masses of
iron forming the magnetic poles, between which the hot gas
has to pass in its way upwards: and it is most probably con
nected with the fact observed by Mr. Grove of the difficulty
of igniting a platinum wire in hydrogen.
   When the igniting helix was placed in coal-gas, it was
found that the hot gas was diamagnetic to that which was
cold; as in all the other cases. Here, again, an effect like
that which was observed in hydrogen occurred; for when
there was no magnetic action, the ascending stream of hot
coal-gas could cause the thermoscopic spiral to revolve through
only 280° or 300°, in place of above 540°; through which it
could pass when the surrounding gas was oxygen, air, or
carbonic acid; and that even when the helix was at a higher
temperature in the coal-gas than in any of these gases.
   The proof is clear then that oxygen, carbonic acid, and
coal-gas, are more diamagnetic hot than cold. The same is
the case with air; and as air consists of four-fifths nitrogen
and only one-fifth oxygen, and yet shows an effect of this
kind as strongly as oxygen, it is manifest that nitrogen also
has the same relation when hot and cold.
   Of the other gases also I have no doubt; though to be quite
certain, they ought to be tried in atmospheres of their own
substance, or else in gases more diamagnetic at common tem
  eratures than they. The olefiant and coal-gases in air easily
É.     the elevation of the helix to a full red heat, without in
flaming when out of the exit-tube: the hydrogen required that
the helix should be at a lower temperature, Muriatic acid
and ammonia showed the division of the one stream into two,
very beautifully, on holding blue and red litmus paper above.
   There is another mode of observing the diamagnetic con
dition of flame, and experimenting with the various gases,
which is sometimes useful, and should always be understood,
lest it inadvertently might lead to confusion, I have a pair of
 terminal magnetic poles which are pierced in a horizontal
direction, that a ray of light may pass through them. The
 opposed faces of these vertical poles are not, as in the former
case, the rounded ends of cones; but, though rounded at the
 edges, may be considered as flat over an extent of surface an
 inch in diameter. The pierced passages are in the form of
 cones, the truncation of which in this flat surface is rather

                       of Flame and Gases,                      419
more than half an inch in diameter. When these poles were
in their place, and from 0.8 to 0-4 of an inch apart, a taper
flame, burning freely between them, was for a few moments
unaffected by throwing the magnet into action; but then it
suddenly changed its form, and extending itself axially, threw
off two horizontal tongues, which entered the passages in the
poles; and thus it continued as long as the magnetism continued,
and no part of it passed equatorially.
   On using a large flame made with the cotton ball and aether,
two arms could be thrown off from the flame by the force of
the magnetism, which passed in an equatorial direction, as
before; and other two parts entered the passages in the mag
netic poles, and actually issued out occasionally at their further
eXtrenltles.
   When the poles were about 0.25 of an inch apart, and the
smoking taper was placed in the middle between them level
with the centres of the passages, the effect was very good; for
the smoke passed axially and issued out at the further ends of
the pole passages.
    Coal-gas delivered in the same place also passed axially,
i. e. into the pole passages and parallel to the line joining them.
    A little consideration easily leads to the true cause of these
effects, and shows that they are not inconsistent with the
former results. The law of all these actions is, that if a par
ticle, placed amongst other particles, be more diamagnetic (or
less magnetic) than them, and free to move, it will go from
strong to weaker places of magnetic action; also, that particles
less diamagnetic will go from weaker to stronger places of
action. Now with the poles just described, the line or lines
of maximum force, are not coincident with the axis of the
holes pierced in the poles, but lie in a circle having a diameter,
probably, a little larger than the diameter of the holes; and
the lines within that circle will be of lesser power, diminishing
in force towards the centre, A hot particle therefore within
that circle will be driven inwards, and, being urged by succes
sive portions of matter driven also inwards, will find its way
out at the other ends of the passages, and therefore seem to go
in an axial direction; whilst a hot particle outside of that
circle of lines of maximum force will be driven outwards, and so,
 with others, will form the two tongues of flame which pass off
in the equatorial direction. By bringing the glowing taper to
different parts, the circle of lines of maximum magnetic inten
sity can be very beautifully traced ; and by placing the taper
inside or outside of that circle, the smoke could be made to pass
 axially or equatorially at pleasure.

experiment to decide such [. ; and the affirmative or ne

it may, very philosophically, be believed. . .           . .. .. .
     For myself I have always believed that the zero was re
presented by a vacuum, and that no body really stood with
it. But though I have only guarded myself from asserting
more than I knew, Zantedeschi (and I think also De la Rive),
with some others, seem to think that I have asserted the gases
are not subject to magnetic action; whereas I only wished to
say that I could not find that they were, and perhaps were
not; I will therefore quote a few of my words from the           º:
 perimental Researches. Speaking of the preparation of a
|...} medium at zero, I say, “Thus a fluid medium was ob
tained, which practically, as far as I could perceive, had every
 magnetic character and effect of a gas, and even of a vacuum,
&c.”—Experimental Researches, 2423. Again, at (2433) I
say, “At one time I looked to air and gases as the bodies
which allowing attenuation of their substance without addition,
would permit of the observation of corresponding variations
in their magnetic properties, but now all such power by rare
 <U+017F>action appears to be taken away.” And further down at (2435),
 “Whether the negative results obtained by the use of gases
 and vapours depend upon the smaller quantity of matter in a
given volume, or whether they are the direct consequences of
 the altered physical condition of the substance, is a point of
 very great importance to the theory of magnetism. I have
 imagined in elucidation of the subject an experiment, &c., but
 expect to find great difficulty in carrying it into execution, &c.”

bodies were sensibly affected by heat, but shall rº."ex

upon the diamagnetic gases, it may be observed that, speaking
generally, it is in the same direction as that of heat upon iron,
nickel and cobalt; i.e. heat tends in the two sets of cases,
either to the diminution of magnetic force, or the increase of
diamagnetic force; but the results are too few to allow of any
general conclusion as yet.                                         º

relations, and as the atmosphere is at different temperatures
in the upper and lower strata, such conditions may have some
general influence and effect upon its final motion and action, sub

letter of bodies as being magnetic or diamagnetic in relation
one to another, but I trust that in all the cases no mistake of
my meaning could arise from such use of the terms, or any

422     Prof. Zantedeschi on the Motions presented by Flame
ble fluids at the zero of the scale of action among magnetic
and diamagnetic bodies. On the 21st of September 1847, at
the Physical Section of the Ninth Italian Scientific Congress
in Venice, Padre Bancalari, Professor of Physics in the Royal
University of Genoa, read a memoir on the universality of
magnetism; and the argument was considered by philosophers
to be of such importance, that a desire arose to verify chiefly
the action of magnetism on expansible fluids.                 It was an
nounced by the Reporter Belli at the sitting of the 27th of
September, that it had been proved in the presence of various
philosophers that, on the interposition of a flame between the
two poles of an electro-magnet, it was repulsed at the instant
the electric current was closed, to return to the first position
the instant it was broken. This discovery received well
merited applause in the sitting of the 28th of September,
from the General Secretary and the Secretary of the Section of
Physics. A wish was expressed by some to witness the experi
ment of Bancalari; and a Daniell’s apparatus having been got
ready, often elements eighteen centimetres each in dimension, I
endeavoured to repeat the experiment in the Cabinet of Physics
of the Royal Imperial Lyceum of Venice; but I did not chance
to see the asserted phaenomenon. My temporary magnet
had the power of sustaining above 48 kilogrims, weight; but
as my principle is, that a negative argument never destroys a
positive one, I for my further information requested the
machinist Cobres to give me the particulars of the apparatus;
Belli not having treated of these in his report, and they having
escaped Prof. Zambra, the Secretary of the Section. I knew
that the two pieces of soft iron, which constituted the inter
rupted anchor, were perforated in the axial direction. “I
suspected that the repulsion of the flame was not the immediate
effect of the magnetism, but of two currents of air issuing from
the apertures of the perforated keeper generated by a vorticose
movement produced by the magnetism, as the celebrated
Faraday had observed in liquids + ; and I was confirmed in this
suspicion by the negative experiment which I had instituted in
Venice with solid pieces. On arriving in Turin, I communi
cated my doubts to the well-known mechanicians Jest, father
and son, who to their professional abilities unite a rare courtesy.
They soon furnished me in their laboratory with a Bunsen's ap
paratus, and constructed terminal pieces of soft iron forming the
interrupted anchor, both solid and pierced, of a parallelepipe
don and cylindric form, as I pointed out to them; and I have
repeated the experiments in their company: the temporary

            when under the Electro-Magnetic Influence.            423
 magnet, made in the shape of a horseshoe, was formed of a
 cylinder of soft iron of the length of Om'335 and the diameter
 of 0”015; and its electro-magnetic spiral was formed of a
 copper wire 33" long, and of a diameter of a millimetre and
 a third ; the internal distance of the poles was Om'027; the
 two solid parallelepipedon contacts, forming the interrupted
 anchor, were O*04 long; and of the sides Om'Ol 1 and Om:006 :
 and the hollow terminal pieces were 0”035 long; and of the
 side O*009. They were placed at a distance from one another
 of four to five millimetres, the magnet being kept in a vertical
 position, with the poles turned upwards. In front of the in
 terval of the separation of the contact pieces was placed the
 flame of a small candle, or of a little oil or alcohol lamp, so that
 it surmounted with its top by nearly a fourth the thickness of
 the contacts. The electric circuit was closed by copper wires,
 and the metallic unions were maintained both at the magnetic
 poles and at those of the pile by clamps: one of the wires
 therefore was divided into two equal parts, and the ends
 being dipped into a tumbler of mercury, allowed the closing
 and opening of the circuit at pleasure.
    I have constantly observed repulsion in the act of closing the
 circle, which lasted the whole time that the magnetism was kept
 up ; and, when in the act of opening the circle, I saw the flame
 return to its primitive position. Well-satisfied with having
 in this, manner confirmed this important fact which reflects
 honour on its discoverer, I applied myself to the study of the
 phaenomenon, and I found—
    I. That this happens with contacts of both solid and hollow
 soft iron; whereupon I abandoned my suspicion that the
 movement of the flame was attributable to currents of air; I
 convinced myself that it was an immediate action of the mag
 netism upon the flame, a fact of the greatest importance to
 SC1611Ce,
    II. That the repulsion, when it is quite distinct and the
jlame quite pure, and terminated in a well-shaped top, is ac
 companied by depression: repulsion and depression are simul
 taneously observed at the closing of the circle; the return of
 the flame and rising of the same, at the opening of the circle.
    III. That, ceteris paribus, the greatest effect takes place when
 the flame is touching the convew of the magnetic curves indicated
 by iron filings.
    IV. That the action is null, or almost null, when the flame
 is placed in the centre of the interval which separates the two
 contacts.
    V. That in the manifestation of the     <U+017F>º stated above, it is
 not necessary for the contacts to be entirely separated: they may

      must not forget, in concluding this article, to state that
the celebrated, Prof. Gazzaniga, starting from his numerous
experiments, which demonstrate the influence of magnetism,
upon the same aëriform fluids, in a manner therefore different
from that of Bancalari, was induced to consider the sun and                   y
all the other celestial bodies as so many enormous magnets;
by which he established that attraction is merely an . of .
the magnetism of the great celestial masses placed at an
enormous distance,—an idea which reappeared in 1846 in
Prussia, and in 1847 in France, as we see from the Comptes
Rendus of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris. The
mystery, that attraction operates at a distance without, inter
media would be removed in this case, and the phaenomena of
attraction would enter again into the class of those of common
dynamics.             -             •  *       -

it is an asymptotic cylinder of the second degree (which may
in certain cases degenerate into one or two cylindrical asymp
totic planes). Should the values of l, m, n, satisfying (9.) also
cause a, 3,7 to vanish from (10.), there will be no correspond
ing asymptotic cylinder, unless ºp-a=0; and in this case we
must equate the coefficient of r"T" in (5.) to zero, and we shall
have an asymptotic cone of the third degree; and so on.
  ... Hence, to determine the equations of the asymptotic cylin
ders to the surface (1.), we must find such values (if any) of
l, m, n as satisfy (9.), and substitute them in (10.); if all the
terms of (10.) also vanish, we must recur to the coefficient of
rº-" in (5.); and so on. There will be as many asymptotic
cylinders as there are sets of values of l, m, n satisfying (9.),
unless, after substituting any set in (10.), &c., the only term
that does not vanish is that independent of a, 3, Y, in which
case there will be no asymptotic cylinder for this set of values.

      The asymptotes to the surface (1.) passing through a given
  point (23%) will be found by determining the ratios 14-m-n

        Since (4.) is of the pth degree and (6.) of the (p-1)th, the
     equation resulting from the elimination of l (suppose) from (4.)
     and (6.) cannot exceed the p(p-1)th degree, and consequently
     there cannot be more than p (p-1) !. of the ratio m—-m.
      From this we learn, that through any point in space there
     cannot be drawn more than p(p-1) asymptotes to a surface
     of the pth degree.                                                 -
        This theorem suffers an exception, however, which I pro
     ceed to consider.
        It may happen that the point (23)) through which the
     asymptotes are to be drawn may be so taken as to cause (4.)
     and (6.) to have a common factor x, (which I shall suppose
... to be their greatest common measure).            In this case (4.) and
     (6.) will be satisfied if x, =0; and eliminating l, m, n from
     this equation by means of (2.), we have
   -                     2,3-a, y–6, 2–y)=0                   .  .. . . .. .
     for the equation to the asymptotic cone, which is the locus of
     the innumerable asymptotes that pass through the point (23)).
     (The factor x, may sometimes be resolvable into other factors,
     and then the preceding asymptotic cone of the qth degree will
     in fact consist of several cones of inferior degrees.) ''
        The division of (4.) and (6.) by x, will give two equations,
       p_z=0, and x", q_1=0, which admit of no common measure.
     Now (4.) and (6.) will be satisfied by these two equations; but the
     equations x', z=0, x", q_1=0, will determine not more than
     (p—q)(p-q-1) sets of values of the ratios l-i-m--n, hence
     (excluding the generators of the cone corresponding to x.)
     not more than (p-q)(p-q— 1) asymptotes can pass throß
     the point (2, 3, y).
        In order to find those points (if any) which are the vertices
     of asymptotic cones, eliminate one of the quantities l, m, n from
     (4.) and (6.), and find those values of a,3,7) that will renderall the
     coefficients of the resulting equation equal to zero. If no such
    values be possible, the surface (1.) does not admit of an asymp
    totic cone; but if values 21, 31, y, of 2,3,7) can be found, then
    the point (2, 31 y) will be the vertex of an asymptotic cone.
    To find the equation of this cone, we must substitute 21, 31, y1
    for 2,3,7) in (6.), and ascertain 0, the common measure of (4.)
    and (6.) thus modified; them will 6,(2–21, y–31, 2-yl)=0
    be the equation to the asymptotic cone, having its vertex at
    the point (2, 3, y). If the equation resulting from the elimi
    nation of l, m, or n from (4.) and (6.)can be rendered identically

             Cones and Cylinders to Algebraical Surfaces,         9481
zero by other simultaneous values of 2,3,7, there will be as many
asymptotic cones as there are sets of values. When the eli
 mination referred to above is effected by the process for the
 common measure, the factor. 3, will be the last of the remain
 ders that do not vanish when ap 31.7% are substituted for 2,3,7,
 It will sometimes be found, however, that (4.) and (6) have
 a common measure independently of a,3,7, arising from {4,3°
 and 4, being factors of t, and 4,-, ; and in this case we must
 proceed with this common measure in the way to be noticed
 presently.                                       * -     1 \, , , , ,
    When we know that (4.) cannot be resolved into factors,
 the determination of the asymptotic cone is very easy; for
 since (4.) admits of no measure but itself, and (6.) is of an in
Jerior degree, it is evident that if there be an asymptotic come,
 (6.) must be identically zero; hence if such values ai, 31, y1 can
 be given to 2,8,7, as to cause the coefficients of (6.) to vanish,
 there will be an asymptotic cone of the pth degree, namely,
                     £,(r-21, y-31, 2-Yi)=0;
 but if the coefficients cannot be rendered zero simultaneously,
 there will be no asymptotic cone. Since 2,3,7) enter (6.) in the
 first degree only, there will evidently be at most only one set
 of values of    º      that will render (6.) identically zero; and
 hence a surface of the pth degree may have one, asymptotic
 cone of the pth degree, but not more, and it is plain that there
  cannot be an asymptotic cone of a higher degree.
     If (4.) admits of being resolved into factors, and these <U+017F>ac
 tors can be found, the asymptotic cones may be determined
 as follows. . . Let }, be one of the factors of p, and let 0, itself
 be irresolvable into factors. Arrange (6.), or rather (8), and
  % according to the powers of either l, m or n (l suppose), and
 divide the former by the latter until the remainder is of lower
  dimensions in l than 4, ; then since 0, is irresolvable into fac
  tors, it is clear that this remainder must be identically zero:
  find therefore 21, 31, y1, the values of a,6,7, that make the coeffi
  cients of the remainder vanish, then 3,04–21, y–81, 8-yl)=0
  will be the asymptotic cone, . As a, 3, y enter (8.) in the first
  degree and do not enter 9, there cannot be more than one
  set of values of 2,3,7, if indeed there be any. The same pro
  cess being repeated with each of the other prime factors into
  which (4.) is resolvable, we shall have all the asymptotic cones
  which the surface admits of                              *       tº:

    It appears from the preceding reasoning, that if the equation
(4.), or, which is the same thing, the highest homogeneous
function in the equation to the surface (1.) can be resolved
into a factors of the first degree, b factors of the second de
É. c factors of the third degree, &c. (here a factor of the

admit of, but cannot have more than a asymptotic cones of the

cones of the second degree, c asymptotic cones of the third
degree, &c. Some of these cones may have the same vertex;

all the asymptotic cones to a surface can never exceed that of
the surface itself.                             -
    It will be seen that unless equal factors enter the highest
homogeneous function, the asymptotic cones to a surface de
pend only on the two highest homogeneous functions in its
equation; and hence (the above case excepted) all surfaces
having the two highest homogeneous functions in their equa
tions identical, will have the same asymptotic cones. Also
conversely, it is plain that those surfaces that have the same
asymptotic cones must have the two highest homogeneous
functions in their equations identical, providing the degree of
the equations to the surfaces be exactly equal to that of the
aggregate of the cones. Now this aggregate may be consi

or foundation, as indicated by the term itself. The glaze is
a thin transparent layer of º which covers the body and
fills up its pores, giving it a smooth surface with a j
and a finished appearance.        *    *           -
    I. The substances principally employed to form the bod
of earthenware are, clays of different kinds, flint and Cornis
Stone.                                 . . . . . ... ...
    Clay which constitutes the base of the body of earthenware
is distinguished from siliceous earth by becoming plastic when
mixed with water, and being very soft and not gritty to the
feel; also when burned, it keeps its form, and becomes firm
and solid; whereas siliceous earth crumbles into a powder
when burned. Clay when intensely heated, as in porcelain
manufactories, does not regain its plasticity, which it loses in
the burning, although pounded very fine, in which state it is
technically termed potsherd.
    Clay is obtained naturally from Cornwall, Dorset, and
Devonshire, and is the finer particles of decomposed felspar
deprived of its alkali,
    1. The finest clay (termed China clay) used in Britain is
obtained artificially from Cornwall, by running a stream of
water over decomposed granite, which carries with it the finer
particles of felspar, and is then received into catchpools or
ponds where it is allowed to subside.        The water is then run
off, leaving a fine sediment, which is removed and exposed to
the atmosphere for four or five months, when it is ready for
export. By analysis of this clay previously dried at 212°, I
found it to consist of

 curs both on the surface and several fathoms underground.
 It is termed marl, and is used principally in potteries for ma
 king saggars or vessels for placing the ware previous to burn
 ing to protect them from the flame; andzowing to its coarse
 particles, which cause the body to be very porous, is well
 adapted for strong heats: crucibles, or large pots for glass
 works, in which the glass is fused, are also made from fire
 clay, as well as bricks known under the name of fire-brick.

   10. Plaster of Paris or gypsum, which is employed in form
ing the moulds in which certain kinds of pottery are cast, is a
native sulphate of lime. It is a very important article to the
manufacturer of earthenware, owing to its singular property
of parting easily with the clay by the application of a slight
heat. Plaster of Paris requires to be dried at a high tempe
rature before using it; but if it is over-dried, it will not again
set for making moulds; the drier the stucco the harder are
the moulds that are made of it, and they will stand more
readily a greater degree of wear. Plaster of Paris casts, as
commonly prepared, cannot again be used for the same purpose.
   II. The colours used for printing and painting on ware are
similar to one another, excepting that the colours for painting
may not be so expensive as for printing; both however form
an important and extensive part of the materials of a pottery.
The manufacturers of earthenware are much occupied with
the improvement of the variety and beauty of the colours, as
well as of the patterns or styles that are produced, and hence
a great emulation exists among those employed in the trade.
   1. The blue colour in printing is produced from cobalt,
which is used with flint, ground glass, pearlash, white lead,
barytes, china clay, and oxide of tin in reducing its strength.
   2. The brown colour by ochre, manganese, and cobalt.
   3. The black colour by chromate of iron, nickel, ironstone,
and cobalt.                         -                          .      .     . . .

    The oil that is used for mixing with the colours, is made
 by boiling the following substances together; viz. linseed oil,
 rape oil, sweet oil, rosin, common tar, and balsam copaiba in
 various proportions.
    III. It is but recently since a new method has been applied
 to cause the colours to flow or spread over the surface of the
 ware. This object is effected by washing the saggars in which
 the ware is placed previous to its being fired in the glost kiln,
 with a mixture of                                               -
    1. Lime, common salt, and clay slip. Dry flows are also
 used, which answer equally well, the mixture being sprinkled
 on the bottom of the saggar. The following are some of those
 flows:—            -
    2. Lime, sal-ammoniac and red lead.
º, 3, Lime, common salt, and soda.
ºn 4. Whiting, lead, salt and nitre.
… 5. But there is a wash made of lime, clay slip, nitre, salt,
 lead, in general use for washing all the saggars employed in
 the glost kiln, which fuses on the inner surface of the saggar,
 making it perfectly close and not porous, otherwise the gloss
  required on the surface of the ware would not be obtained.
      V. The colours used in producing the dipt or sponged
  ware are of a very cheap kind, as it is only for common pur
  poses that they are employed. The colours when used for
 dipt ware are put on the ware before it is burned; and when
 used for sponged ware, are put on the ware in the biscuit
 state. The following are some of those colours :—
    1. A black dip is made from manganese, ironstone and
 clay slip.                                          -
                                                                      *
    2. A drab dip by nickel and slip.
  . 3. A sage or a greenish-blue dip by green chrome and slip.
    4. A blue dip by cobalt and clay slip.
    5. A yellow dip by yellow clay alone, or a compound of
 white and red clay, which produces the same results.
    6. A red dip is produced from the red or brown clay; but
 it is not every quality of this clay that will answer, as it re
 quires to burn red.                                               -
    The first four of these dips are prepared by mixing a little

 b2. Foreign manufacturers do not employ bone-earth; but
instead of it they use felspar, the alkali of which supplies the
place of the phosphate of lime. The Germans make the best
porcelain for chemical-purposes, as that body is more vitrified
and less liable to be acted upon by acids, as well as being
capable of standing a very strong heat; and hence it is exten
sively used by chemists. By the analysis of some specimens
of foreign porcelain, I obtained the following results:– “º

    VI. Earthenware is a very porous, and less compact body
than china or porcelain, owing to its containing little or no
alkali, which is the great difference between these bodies. I had
a piece of ware manufactured, resembling in appearance porce

     9. Salt glazed ware is made from sandy clay and a little.
sand, to keep the body open, or make it less compact; but
for large salt glazed ware, potsherd, which is ware that has

  442 Mr. R. A. Couper on the Chemical Composition of
  been fired and then ground, is employed to render the body
  still more open or porous, and also to give it a greater capa
  bility of standing sudden heats or colds. This ware is much
  used in public works for chemical purposes: it is exposed to
  the action of the flame, during burning, whereas other kinds
  of ware are protected by Saggars from the flames.
     VII. The glaze vitrifies the surface of the body, rendering
  it generally capable of withstanding acids. It is a very im
  portant point with the manufacturer to obtain a glaze which
  will adhere to the body without crazing or peeling off, as he
 may discover a good body, but not find a glaze to answer it,
 since every glaze will not adhere to the same body, and hence
 every manufacturer has a glaze of his own composition.
 tº 1. The substances used in the preparation of the glaze for
  white ware, are borax, china clay, flint, Cornish stone, Paris
 white, and white lead.                     * -                                * *
     In preparing the glaze, a substance technically termed frett
 is first made, consisting of borax, china clay, flint, Cornish
 stone, and Paris white, which are fused together in a kiln, and
 when ready allowed to flow into water, which shortens it,
 owing to the water being mechanically lodged in it, and keeps
 it from adhering to the bottom of the vessel, rendering it much
 easier to pound. Frett is a beautiful glass, coloured by a little
 iron, and is pounded and water-ground along with Cornish
 stone, flint, and white lead : this constitutes the glaze for white

    A piece of earthenware was brought from America, having
been discovered several feet under ground, the glaze of which
was tested, and found to be composed of silica, iron, alumina,
lime, sulphate of lime and antimony, which was a beautiful
rich white glaze concealing a common red clay body.
    2. The glaze of Rockingham ware possesses a beautiful
brownish metallic lustre, and is made from Cornish stone, flint,
manganese, red lead and clay slip, the latter substance being
a little clay mixed with water until it becomes of the consist
ency of milk.                               -   * * * *

*"These four last-mentioned glazes are made by stirring the
substances together with a certain quantity of water, and pass
ing it through a very fine sieve or search. Glazes do not re
 Juire such a high temperature to fuse them on the surface of
the ware, as the body does to be burned,” sº wºº
    6. The glaze for salt glazed ware is common salt, which is
thrown in at the top of the kiln through a number of small
apertures in the crown of it, and diffuses itself through all
parts of the kiln, giving the ware the required glaze. The
action that is supposed to take place, when the salt is thrown
into the kiln, is owing to its decomposition.” The chlorine of
the salt combines with the hydrogen of the water, which is
mechanically lodged in the salt, forms muriatic acid gas, which
passes off, while the sodium combining with the oxygen of the
water then unites with the silica in the ware, forming a sili
cate of soda which fuses on its surface. The salt is not thrown
in until the kiln has been raised to its greatest necessary tem
perature.” * - - ,                     * *

WHEN the light of the sun or of any self-luminous body
eWW has been transmitted through certain crystallized sub
stances, or has been reflected from, or refracted by, bodies
not metallic, it suffers a physical                e, to which the name
of plane polarization has been given. This physical change
consists in decomposing common light into two equal portions
of polarized light, one of which is polarized in a plane at right
angles to that in which the other is polarized.                  In doubly
refracting crystals, the two pencils are polarized in opposite
or rectangular planes; and when common light is reflected
from anybody not metallic, whether it is solid, or fluid, or
gaseous, a portion of the incident light enters the body; and
of the portions thus reflected and refracted, precisely the same
quantity is polarized,—the light polarized by refraction being
polarized in a plane at right angles to that which is polarized
by reflexion.                                                      . . . . . ... . . .
   If the earth had no atmosphere the sky would appearab
solutely black; and when the sun sets we should be left in
utter  à:             The existence of twilight, however, the blue
colour of the sky, and the refraction of the rays which emanate
from the stars and planets, place it beyond a doubt that the
   re air in which we live and breathe is capable of acting
upon light like all other bodies, and consequently of producing
that physical change which constitutes polarization. . The
polarization of the blue sky, or of the atmosphere, was there
fore observed and studied by different philosophers, both in
France and England; and it was speedily ascertained, in con
formity with the laws of polarization, that the polarization was
a minimum in the vicinity of the sun, where his light is reflected
at angles approaching to 90°, or where the incident and re
flected rays form an angle approaching to 180°; that it was
also a minimum in the region opposite the sun, where his light
is reflected at an angle approaching to 0°, or at a perpendi
cular incidence; and that it was a maximum in those interme
diate parts of the sky, which are distant about 90° from the
sun, and where his light is reflected at an angle of about 45°,
the polarizing angle for-air. º. ºut ºn tº <U+017F>º,                                    vº

A. K. Johnston, from the Seventh Part of their valuable Physical Atlas now

polarization of the atmosphere, and a considerable time elapsed
before its leading elements, were determined, and its more
important phaenomena observed, and Ameasured. It is to M.
Arago, to whom this branch of science owes such deep, obli
  ations, that we are indebted for the discovery of the first and
   ading faction which the law of atmospheric                 º
depends. In examining the region of the sky opposite to the
sun, he discovered a neutral point, or a point in whichºthere
is no polarization whatever. This neutrali point he found to
be 25° or 80° above the point diametrically opposite to the
sun, or what we may call the gantisolar-point; and we shall
distinguish this pole of no-polarization by the name of M.
Arago's neutral point, or the antisolar neutral point. *It is
best seen after sºunset. º. ººt ºn 911 º' tº 10 ºr ºf
     In the year 1840, M. Babinet discovered a second neutral
point, situated about the same distance above the sun as the
neutral point of M. Arago is situated above the antisolar point.
This point is most distinctly seen immediately after sunset,
but is generally much fainter than the other, owing to the
discoloration of the blue sky by the yellow light of the set
tling Sun.                                                      . ... . . . .. .

from the surfaces of transparent bodies, a certain portion of
it, and at a particular angle the whole of it, is polarized in the
plane of reflexion, or positively”; while precisely the same
quantity of the transmitted light is polarized in a plane at
right angles to the plane of reflexion or refraction, or nega
tively. “Now, in the part of the sky between the neutral point
 of M. Arago, and that of M. Babinet, the light is polarized
positively; while in the parts of the sky between the first of
 these neutral points and the antisolar point, or between the
 second and the sun, it is polarized negatively. , Hence it
 became obvious that the two neutral points must be produced
 by a compensation, in which light polarized negatively neu
 tralized light polarized positively, and that the negative light
 was either produced by re<U+017F>terion in a plane at right angles to
 that passing through the sun, the neutral point, and the ob
 server, or by refraction in a plane passing through these three
 points, or by both these causes combined. But in whatever
 way the negative polarization was produced, it was manifest
 that the same cause ought to produce a neutral point beneath
 the sun. After many fruitless attempts to discover this neutral
 point—owing chiefly to the predominance of the sun's light

446            Sir David Brewster on the Polarization
at the part of the sky where it should be found—I at last ob
served, under avery favourable state of the atmosphere, that
the polarization of the sky was negative in the space between
the risen sun and the horizon. This observation placed it
beyond a doubt that there must be a neutral point below the
sun, where that negative polarization passed into positive pola
rization; and by concealing the sun from view, and admitting
no light to the eye but what came from the probable place of the
neutral point, I succeeded in discovering it. After commu
nicating this discovery to M. Babinet.*, early in 1845, he made
several ineffectual attempts to confirm it; and it was not till
the 23rd of July 1846, when the state of the sky was peculiarly
favourable for the observation, that he succeeded in obtaining
a distinct view of it #.                                 - -   --          * * *

    I observed the first traces of this remarkable phaenomenon.
on the 8th of June 1841, at 5° 50', when the positive polari
zation was strongest close to the horizon, whetherland or sea,
and to about 14° above it. . . Hence, when M. Arago's neutral
point rose, it did not appear<U+017F>’rst in the horizon, but about 14°,
above it, the compensation being effected, where the positive
polarization was weaker than in the horizon. When this took
place, we had the singular phaenomenon of a neutral point
with positive polarization on each side of it. When this phae
nomenon was more fully developed, under a favourable state
of the horizon, the positive polarization was overcome by the
advancing negative polarization. The negative polarization
was then immediately below the ascending neutral point; but
at a certain distance, a few degrees below the neutral point,
the negative polarization was compensated by the excess of
positive polarization close to the horizon, and the beautiful
phaenomenon was seen of two neutral points separated by bands.
of negative polarization! This phaenomenon was best seen on,
the sea horizon, which was marked by an obscure band a few.
degrees high, that indicated the existence of a distant haze,
On the 21st of April 1842, I observed the secondary neutral
point under favourable circumstances. At 6'22' P.M., when the
primary neutral point was 15° high, the secondary one was
2° 50' high. At 7" positive bands were still seen above the
sea line, and were strongest upon the obscure band above the
visible sea line.

   This neutral point is situated        about 18° 30' above the sun,
when he is rising or setting in a very clear sky. It is not so
easily seen as that of M. Arago, and was therefore longer in
being discovered. It is above the horizon during the greater.
part of the year in great latitudes, and being above the sun,
it is of course always visible when the sun is above the horizon
in a clear sky. When the sun is in the zenith, this neutral
point coincides with the sun's centre. As the sun’s altitude
diminishes, it separates from the sun's centre, its distance gra
dually increasing till it becomes 18° 30', when the sun's alti
tude is nothing, or at sunrise and sunset.

   As theory indicated the existence of this neutral point, I
long sought for it in vain; but when I was assured of its ex
istence by the discovery of negative polarization, which often
extended from the sun to the horizoneven when the sun's altitude
was 30°, I took such precautions for excluding all unnecessary
light from the eye that I at last observed it near the horizon,
with a small portion of positively polarized light beneath it.
I afterwards observed it repeatedly when the sun had higher.
altitudes, and was able to measure its varying distance from
that luminary. On the 18th of February 1842, at noon, when
the sun's altitude was about 22°, I observed this neutral point.
in the most distinct manner, the polarized bands being nega
tive below the sun, and positive near the horizon. Its distance
from the sun, therefore, was about 15° or 16°. I afterwards
obtained the following measures of its distance from the sun:-->

450           Sir David Brewster on the Polarization
light different from that of the sky; the degree of polarization
is always affected whenever we measure it in parts of the sky
which have luminous clouds or illuminated terrestrial objects
in their vicinity, or any luminosity in the field of view of the
polarimeter. If the neutral point happens to be above or
 below any such object, its distance from the antisolar point or
 from the sun is increased or diminished”.
          V. On the Maximum Polarization of the Sky.
    After having ascertained the position of the neutral points,
or poles of no-polarization as we may call them, the next most
important element to be determined is the maximum polariza
tion of the atmosphere.
    When a ray of common light is reflected from any trans
parent body, at an angle whose tangent is equal to the index
of refraction, it is completely polarized; or when a ray of light,
completely polarized in a plane inclined 45° to the plane of
reflexion, is reflected from any such body, its plane of polari
zation is brought into the plane of reflexion; that is, its plane
is turned round 45°. Hence complete polarization is measured
by a rotation of 45°. When the polarized ray is reflected at
angles above or below the angle of maximum polarization, its
plane is less turned round, and its rotation is more or less
than 45°, according as the angle of reflexion is more or less
distant from the angle of maximum or complete polarization f.
    Different degrees of rotation below 45° may also be pro
duced by the refraction of the polarized ray at one or more
surfaces of glassi, the rotation increasing with the angle of
incidence. Hence we may measure the degree of polarization
wherever it exists, by observing at what angle of incidence it
is compensated or neutralized, by reflexion from a transparent
surface, or by refraction at one or more such surfaces. I have
found the last method the most convenient, and have therefore
constructed a polarimeter which measures the polarization of
the sky, by observing with it either the varying angle at which
   * On the 16th of May 1842, barometer 30.3, the sun was faintly seen
through a thick haze. At 8° 49' A.M. the polarization was positive all the way
from the sun to the horizon, so that the neutral point below the sun was
below the horizon. Immediately afterwards the sun was quite hid—a great
glare supervened, and a quaquaversus polarization was observed, in which
the polariscope gave no coloured bands.
   On the 17th of May, at 6' 30, the sun's disc was quite white through a
thick haze, and there was no neutral point either above or opposite the sun,
the polarization being everywhere positive. When the haze is thicker on
one side of the plane passing through the sun's spectrum, the neutral point
deviates from that plane.

                          of the Atmosphere.                       451
 it is compensated or neutralized by a fixed number of thin
glass plates, or the varying number of refracting surfaces, by
 which the same effect may be produced at a fixed angle, ca
 pable also of being changed”.
     With a polarimeter thus constructed, I have determined that
 the maximum polarization of a clear blue sky is equivalent to
 a rotation in the plane of a polarized ray of 30°; and that this
maximum takes place at a distance of from 88° to 92° from
the sun, and in the plane passing through the sun and the
zenith. This maximum is of course dependent on the state of
the atmosphere, both with respect to its magnitude and posi
tion; but we shall assume 30° as its amount, and 90° from the
sun as its position in a normal state of the atmosphere, and
when the sun is in the horizon.
  VI. On the Form of the Lines of equal Polarization in the
                             Atmosphere.
    It is obvious, from the phaenomena already described, that
the polarization of the atmosphere, produced by the reflexion
of the sun's light from the matter which composes the atmo
sphere, in planes passing through the sun, the point of re
flexion, and the eye of the observer, would have been equal in
circles of which the sun and the antisolar point are the centre,
had there been no disturbing causes, or had the atmosphere
been a perfectly transparent medium. In this case the pola
rization would have been complete, or 45°; and this maximum
would have occurred at a distance from the sun, the half of
which was the polarizing angle of the medium. There is ob
viously, however, a cause depending on the zenith distance of
the polarizing point of the sky, which acts in opposition to the
polarization produced by reflexion, and compensates it at the
neutral point already described. When the sun, therefore, is
in the horizon, these two actions are rectangular, as in biaxal
crystals; and we must therefore determine the form of the
lines of equal polarization when the sun is in the horizon, and
when the atmosphere is perfectly pure. When viewed, con
sequently, in their general aspect, the phaenomena of atmo
spherical polarization may be represented by the formula
          º             R=30°(sin D sin D'),
where R = rotation, or degree of polarization, and
D and D' = the distances of the point whose polarization is
required from the two neutral points.                                -
    This formula would make the lines of equal polarization

     Lemniscates, as in biaxal crystals, and consequently the po
     larization in the horizon greater than in the zenith, which is
     contrary to observation. I have therefore added a correction,
     depending on the zenith distance and azimuth, which makes
     the formula coincide better with observation, namely,
                R=334°(sin D sin D')—6° 34' (sin Z sin A);
       Z being the zenith distance, and A the angle of azimuth.
         Assuming, therefore, that the distance of the neutral points
       from the sun and from the antisolar point is 18° 30', when the
       sun is in the horizon, and that the atmosphere is perfectly pure
       and uniformly transparent, the lines of equal polarization will
      have the forms and the degrees of polarization represented by
       the formula. The direction of the polarization follows the
       same law as in biaxal crystals, the lines without bands or colour
       corresponding with the black hyperbolic branches in the pola
       rized rings produced by these crystals, being distinctly seen
       with the polariscope.
        VII. On the Construction of the Map of the Lines of equal
                                Polarization.
         Had the map been on a greater or a less scale than it is, it
       might have been desirable to appropriate a single curve to
       every single degree, or to every two degrees of rotation or
       polarization. On the present scale, the curves would have
       been too numerous and close had there been one to each
       degree; and with only one to each two degrees, they would
       have been too distant, in so far as that the form of the curves
       round the neutral points would not have been sufficiently seen.
       I therefore adopted such a number of curves, viz. iS), as
       enabled me to get the curves, No. 2, continuous round each
       neutral point. Hence the formula became
                   N=20:5 (sin D sin D')—3.9 sin Zsin A,
       or in the plane passing through the sun and the zenith, in
       which Z and A become zero,
                             N=25.5 (sin D sin D).
          In the zenith itself we have N = 18:45, and at P, P we
       have N=0.
          The curves thus obtained do not represent values of N in
       degrees of rotation, but in numbers, each of which is equal to
       1°-626. Hence R=N 1°-626, and the distance between each
       curve is 1°626. The following table contains the rotations or
       degrees of polarization, indicated by each of the curves num
      bered from # to 18:45 in the map :-

from the antisolar point is a maximum; it gradually ap

 difference arises from a difference in the methods of observa

 the observations were made, I am not able to determine.

 LXIX. On the Hydrates of Nitric Acid.            By Mr. ARTHUR
    SMITH, Assistant in the Laboratory of University College,
    London”.
 Sº doubt still hanging over the composition of the hy
      drates of nitric acid, especially of the first hydrate, I was
induced to try some experiments with a view of diminishing
this uncertainty. For this purpose a quantity of the red
fuming acid was procured, which I examined before com
lºcomºted by the           Chemical Society; having been read June 7,

          Mr. Smith on the Hydrates of Nitric Acid.           455
mencing my experiments very carefully for chlorine, and found
to be perfectly free from that impurity, and to have a specific
gravity of 1:500.
   Fourteen ounces of acid of the above-named strength were
mixed with 7 ounces of commercial oil of vitriol, and distilled
in a sand-bath over a gas flame; the first 2 ounces that came
over were rejected, and the receiver changed directly the red
fumes of nitrous acid were observed to fill the interior of the
retort. The acid collected was almost as dark in colour as
the acid before distillation. Its specific gravity was 1.522,
and it turned out to be perfectly free from the smallest trace
of sulphuric acid.
   I also examined the first two ounces of acid that came over
very carefully for chlorine, and found it to contain scarcely a
trace, nitrate of silver producing only a slight opalescence,
and that which came over afterwards, being the portion that
I selected for my experiments, contained none at all. This last
acid, when diluted with water, gave off nitric oxide gas with
a burst of effervescence, which was the principal reason why
it could not be employed to ascertain the exact amount of
real acid by saturation in its present dark-coloured condition.
   The apparatus employed in decolorizing the nitric acid
consisted of a capacious retort, capable of holding about a
pint, to the beak of which was attached a large tubulated
receiver, which was kept surrounded with water, to condense
any little acid that might come over during the process; to
the tubulure of this receiver was adapted a glass tube, bent
at right angles, fitting tightly with a cork, the other extremity
being in connexion with a large gas-holder, which was kept
constantly filled with water, to be used as an aspirator. To
the tubulure of the retort was also fitted a long glass tube
bent at right angles, the one end of which terminated within
an inch of its bottom, whilst the other was in connexion with
a couple of tubes, each 2 feet 11 inches long, arranged side by
side, and connected by means of a tube of a smaller diameter
bent like the letter U.
   These long tubes, through which the air was to be aspired,
were filled, the one with dried chloride of calcium, and the
other with pumice-stone moistened with oil of vitriol, and by
these means the absence of all moisture from the air was en
sured.
   In decolorizing the acid a quantity amounting to 6 or 7
ounces was introduced into the retort, and after having ascer
tained that the whole apparatus was perfectly tight, heat was
applied to the bottom of a small sand-bath in which the
retort was immersed, and the temperature kept up carefully
to 170°F. Then, by removing the plug at the bottom of the

    retort, º yel of which was kept 2 or 3 inches above the
    orifice    º in the interior, the only passage for the air
     being through the long desiccating tubes. Aspiration kept
     up for two or three hours was found to be generally sufficient
     to decolorize completely 6 or 7 ounces of nitric acid.         -
        The acid before decolorization had a specific gravity of
     1.522, and after the process fell to 1-503, Fifty grs. of the
     colourless mitric acid were accurately weighed out in a stoppered
     specific gravity bottle, to which was cautiously added, whilst
     in the bottle, with a view to prevent any loss from splashing,
     a known weight of perfectly pure carbonate of soda, recently
     ignited in a porcelain crucible, until the solution was perfectly
     neutral to test-paper. The absence of any sulphate or chlo
     ride in the carbonate had been previously ascertained.
        I. Carbonate of soda required 40:23 grs.
        II. Carbonate of soda required 40:23 grs.               -
        The quantity of carbonate of soda that 50 grs. of acid re
     quired for saturation, then, was 40:23 grs., which corresponds
     to 40.78 grs, of nitric acid, or 81°56 per cent.
        An acid containing 1% equiv. of water would contain in
     100 parts—

        A portion of the prepared acid, amounting to about 5
     ounces, was introduced into a small retort, through the tubu
     lure of which was fitted tightly, by means of a stopping of
     moist clay, a delicate thermometer, which was kept immersed
     in the liquid. The acid began to boil at 190°, and before the
     distillation had come to an end it had risen to 250°.        The
     acid coming over between 190° and 200° was collected apart
     to be examined by saturation.
        50 grs. of the acid which remained in the retort boiling at
     250° were then examined, and found to require 31-20 grs. of
     carbonate of soda in the first experiment, and 31-07 in the
     second, for saturation; the mean of the two experiments would
     correspond to 63.11 per cent. of nitric acid.
        50 grs. of the most volatile portion, namely, that which
     came over between the temperatures of 190° and 200°, were
     then weighed out exactly; this quantity was found to require
     no less than 41.92 grs. in the first experiment, and 41.91 in
     the second, corresponding to 84.96 per cent. nitric acid; but
     then it must be remembered that this acid had a very dark
     red colour.

  This would give, when compared with the theoretical compo
   sition of nitric acid with 1 equiv. of water, a deficiency of 97
   in the acid, and an excess of '98 in the water.
      This hydrate, when pure, was a perfectly limpid and colour
   less liquid, like so much water; it boiled at 184°, and had a
   specific gravity of 1:517 at 60°. It was found not to have
   the slightest action on tin or iron even when boiled. A por
   tion of this acid placed in a freezing mixture composed of ice
    and salt suffered no change.
       These experiments leave little doubt concerning the com
   position of the first hydrate of nitric acid, namely, that it is
   the true mono-hydrate, consisting of 1 equiv. of nitric acid
    and 1 of water, HO, NOg.               -
       Deuto-Hydrate.—In preparing this hydrate, I set out by
    obtaining a quantity of colourless strong nitric acid, the exact

  458        Mr. Smith on the Hydrates of Nitric Acid.
  amount of real acid in which was ascertained by saturation to
  be 79-79 per cent. To reduce this acid to the proper strength,
  so as to contain exactly 2 equivs. of water, it was found by
  calculation that it would require 63-86 grs. of water to every
  1000 grs. of acid.
     The proper proportions of acid and water were weighed out
  carefully in a stoppered specific gravity bottle, and the two
  mixed.    This mixture was cooled down to 60° and found to
  have the sp. gr. 1486.
     50 grs. of this hydrate were weighed out and saturated in
 the usual way with recently-ignited carbonate of soda. The
 quantities of carbonate of soda required were as follows:—
           Exp. Carb. of soda. Mean.
            #.   : .   ;}3749. or 74.98 per cent. acid.
    An acid containing 2 equivs. of water will contain 75 per
 cent. real acid.
    A portion of this acid was introduced into a small retort
 and distilled. It began to boil, as nearly as could be judged,
 at about 200°, it being difficult to come at the exact tempera
 ture on account of the very rapid rise of the thermometer,
 which continued to take place until it had gained the tempe
 rature of 218°; it afterwards rose when near the end to 250°.
    It appears, then, from these experiments, that no such thing
 as a deuto-hydrate exists, but that when a mixture is made
 in the proportions to form such a hydrate and subjected to di
 stillation, it divides spontaneously into the first and another,
at the same time suffering considerable decomposition; and
the acid which is found remaining in the retort has the exact
boiling-point of the tetra-hydrate, namely, 250°; and more
over, the first portion that came over had the exact density
of the first.
    A portion of this acid placed in a freezing mixture of ice
and salt, suffered not the least solidification.
    Tetra-Hydrate.—This hydrate was prepared in the same
way as the first, namely, by preparing a quantity of colourless
acid, ascertaining its saturating power, and mixing it with the
  roper quantity of distilled water, ascertained by calculation.

 On the Decomposition of Cuminate of Ammonia by Heat. 459
  The acid had a density of 1:424 at 60°; it began to boil at
250°, and distilled over perfectly colourless and unchanged;
towards the end, when slight decomposition commenced, the
temperature rose to 260°.
   Five or six ounces of very weak acid, of the density of 1,180,
were introduced into a retort and kept heated just below its
boiling-point for two or three hours; the heat was increased
from time to time so as to make it boil briskly, and a ther
mometer introduced through the tubulure; when that which
remained in the retort boiled uniformly at 250°, the heat was
withdrawn and it was allowed to cool.
   When the specific gravity of this acid was taken, it was
found to be close upon that of the tetra-hydrate, but not
exactly; probably if I had operated upon a large quantity,
and carried it on for a longer time, it would have been more
so; as found, its density was l'412 instead of 1:424, which
would make a difference of rather less than 1% per cent. de
ficiency in the acid.                  e
   This is, I have no doubt, the proper hydrate of nitric acid,
HO, NO3-1-3HO, as it is generally considered; and as Dr.
Dalton correctly observed, acids which are either stronger or
weaker than this acid, are brought to this strength by conti
nued ebullition, the former losing acid and the latter water.
LXX. On the Products of the Decomposition of Cuminate of
     Ammonia by Heat. By Mr. FREDERICK FIELD".
TH: peculiar mode of decomposition which the ammonia
     salts of inorganic acids exhibit when exposed to the ac
tion of heat, occurs likewise in the ammonia compounds of
organic acids, although the results in the latter instances are
usually of a more complicated nature. In most of these cases
a formation of water takes place, the hydrogen of which is
derived from the volatile alkali, while the acid furnishes the
oxygen, the residue of which combines in a more intimate
manner with the nitrogen of the ammonia. In decompositions,
however, of inorganic compounds this reduction seems to be
carried at once as far as it can go, the whole of the hydrogen
contained in the ammonia being converted into water; while
in organic salts this hydrogen is eliminated only by degrees,
an intermediate body being produced between the original
ammonia salt and the final product of the decomposition.
Thus we find that nitrite and nitrate of ammonia, when ex
posed to heat, are at once converted into water, and respect
ively into nitrogen and nitrous oxide. Oxalate of ammonia,
wºmmunisted by the Chemical Society; having been read June 7,

460    -\\ w, Mr. Field on    the Products of the   tº wº
on the other hand, if submitted to a gentle heat, loses only
two equivalents of water, the residue of both base and acid
combining to formioxamide, and only by a strong and brisk
application of heat Doebereiner converted it into cyanogen,
the rest of the hydrogen being eliminated in the form of water.
 *The dry distillation of oxalate of ammonia thus affords, the
prototypes of two series of compounds, which may arise from
ammoniacal salts by the elimination of two or four equivalents
of water respectively. There are few cases, however, in which
the decomposition of ammoniacal salts have been carefully
studied, and the instances in which we are acquainted with
the representative of the two types are exceedingly scarce.
We are indeed intimate with a very great number of amidogen
compounds analogous to oxamide (fumaramide, salicylamide,
succinamide, anisylamide, &c.), but only few of these have
been obtained from ammoniacal salts by the action of heat.
The greatest number of these bodies were produced by the
change most compound aethers suffer under the influence of
ammonia, a beautiful mode of decomposition pointed out
first by Professor Liebig in the transformation of oxalate of
ethyl into oxamide, or by the action of gaseous ammonia on
other substances related in some manner with the acid: thus
was chloride of benzoyle converted into benzamide by Wöhler
and Liebig, and lately lactide into lactimide by Pelouze.
   As yet, however, the members of the second class, those
compounds standing to other acids in the same relation as
cyanogen to oxalic acid, are very rare. From a beautiful ex
periment of Pelouze, we know that the vapour of formiate of
ammonia, when passed through a red-hot tube, is converted
into water and hydrocyanic acid. In their investigation on
the radical of benzoic acid, Wöhler and Liebig obtained a
peculiar oil by the action of heat on benzamide, which at that
time they did not study more closely. The same body was
at a later period obtained in the dry distillation of benzoate
of ammonia, and fully examined by Fehling, who found that
this interesting substance, to which he gave the name benzo
nitrile, has the composition Cha Hs N, and is produced from
benzoate of oxide of ammonium, exactly in the same manner
as cyanogen and prussic acid are formed respectively from
oxalate or formiate of ammonia. These facts did not long
remain isolated. Schlieper, in an excellent examination he
has lately published on the products of oxidation of gelatine
by chromic acid, discovered that in these reactions, among
other products, the body Clo Ho N is formed, valeronitryle or
valerianate of ammonia—4 equivs. of water.
  The members of this class acquire every day a greater
degree of importance. A remarkable paper, read before the

       Decomposition of Cuminate of Ammonia by Heat. 461
Chemical Society a short time since by Dr. Kolbe and Mr.
Frankland, has indeed opened a most interesting connexion
between these bodies and another class of substances, which
hitherto have been obtained by very different processes. The
conversion of cyanide of ethyl into metacetonic acid by means
of alkalies and acids, seems to indicate that cyanide of ethyl
is nothing else than-metacetomitryle. To<U+017F>his experiment is
likely to be of great importance, for it is exceedingly proba
ble that the whole class of substances alluded to must be con
sidered as a class of cyanogenicompounds. It is evident that
similar considerations may be applied to cyanide of methyl
and cyanide of amyl, lately described by Balard; and the con
version of these cyanides respectively into acetic and caproic
acids, which we have a right tozanticipate on treating them
with alkalies or acids, will prove that these compounds are
the mitriles of acetic and caproic acids—acetonitryle and
capronitryle—which as yet have not been obtained by the
action of heat on the ammoniacal salts of these acids.
   The following experiments on the action of heat on cumi
mate of ammonia have been made with the hope of contri
buting to the history of the nitryles, or organic cyanides, as
they perhaps should be more correctly designated.
   The cuminic acid employed in my experiments was prepared
by the action of solid hydrate of potash on oil of cumin, and
the product perfectly freed from the least traces of cymol
which it might possibly contain by precipitating the potash
salt by hydrochloric acid, dissolving the precipitated cuminic
acid in ammonia, reprecipitating by hydrochloric acid, and
crystallizing from water. The acid was then dissolved in
strong ammonia, and the solution subjected to heat. The
first portions which passed over, although consisting chiefly
of water and ammonia, together with cuminate of ammonia,
which is always carried over with the steam, presented more
or less an opalescent appearance, indicative of traces of the
oil. On evaporating the solution in the retort to dryness, a
portion of the salt is decomposed, ammonia is evolved, and
cuminic acid condenses in beautiful plates upon the sides and
neck of the retort, separation going on even on raising the
temperature; but simultaneously another decomposition takes
place, water is eliminated, in consequence of which there are
produced a peculiar white crystalline body, difficultly soluble
in water, and subsequently a colourless oil of a most fragrant
 odour; although the operation may seem very simple, expe
rience alone teaches the proper regulation of temperature me
 cessary to obtain these two bodies.
    Cuminamide-Observing in my first experiments evolution
 of ammonia and sublimation of cuminic acid on heating cu

462               Mr. Field on the Products of the
minate of ammonia, I thought that by heating it under pres
sure, the ammonia then not being able to escape, the desired
change might be effected. Accordingly a portion of the salt
was placed in a strong glass tube, and after sealing the other
end, gradually heated in an oil-bath to nearly the boiling
point of the oil, and allowed to cool. On cooling the mass
appeared to have been completely fused, but perfectly solid
and of a highly-crystallized texture. On examination it was
found to be insoluble in cold water and ammonia, but very
soluble in hot water, from which it solidified into a crystalline
mass as the temperature cooled; this alone sufficiently indi
cated that a complete change had been effected, the cuminate
of ammonia being readily soluble in cold water. In order to
ascertain the nature of the change it was dissolved in hot
water, and weak ammonia added to dissolve any cuminic acid
that might be mixed with it, and crystallized; the crystals
were separated by filtration, and once more dissolved in a hot
weak solution of ammonia, from which they separated on
cooling in brilliant white crystalline plates, similar in appear
ance to benzamide. These were dried at 212° in a water-bath,
and analysed in the usual manner.
    I. O-174 grim. of substance burnt with oxide of copper
yielded 0-470 of carbonic acid and 0.128 of water.

precisely the same relation to cuminate of ammonia as oxa
mide to oxalate of ammonia.
   In preparing large quantities of this substance the employ
ment of close tubes would be very inconvenient, and I soon
found that it could be obtained in a retort by the continued
application of a heat sufficient to keep the salt in a state of
semi-fluidity. The analyses II. and III. were made with the
product obtained in this manner.
   Cuminamide crystallizes like benzamide, in two forms, ac
cording to the state of the solution; if crystallized imme
diately, or from a strong solution, it separates in the form of
crystalline tables of great brilliancy, but if the solution be di
lute, it crystallizes after the lapse of some hours in long
opake needles, both forms having exactly the same compo
sition. It is soluble in hot and cold alcohol in any propor
tion, as also in aether.    This new amide differs from most
others that have been described in remaining intact on the
addition of strong solution of potash, or mineral acids; from
the former it crystallizes in large plates after some days.
Long boiling with alkalies or acids is scarcely sufficient to
produce the characteristic conversion of amides either into
ammoniacal salts or combinations of the base with the acid
and evolution of ammonia.
   Cumonitrile.—On heating cuminate of ammonia until it is
perfectly fused, and keeping the fused mass in a state of brisk
ebullition, large globules of a light yellowish oil pass over
with water, evidently derived from the decomposition of the
salt; when the globules began to diminish the process was
stopped, the oil was separated from the water in the receiver
by means of a pipette, the remaining distillate added to the
mass in the retort, and the process again repeated as before;
in this manner, after some half-dozen distillations, nearly an
ounce of oil was obtained; it was well-washed with ammonia
to remove cuminic acid, which seemed to be soluble in the
oil, then treated with hydrochloric acid to remove ammonia,
thoroughly washed with water, and digested with chloride of
calcium; after standing some days to separate chloride of
calcium, it was distilled and carefully rectified, the first por
tions being rejected, as possibly containing traces of water;
the middle portion was reserved and placed in a retort with a
coil of platinum; the liquid entered into ebullition at 239°C.,
at which point it remained stationary while at least a quarter
of an ounce was passing over. This portion was employed
in the following analyses:–

the residue in the retort consisted entirely of benzoate of am

differ only in a multiplier common to all three terms of each;

treated as identical with 2, 3, "y, which of course substantially
it is ; and it should be remarked that there is nothing to pre
vent the operations denoted by 3 and J introducing a com
mon factor into the systems which they serve to generate, and
the latter in particular will have a strong tendency so to do,
    I believe that this theorem may be extended with scarcely
any modification to the case where A, instead of being a prime,
is any power of the same, and to suppositions still more gene
 ral. I believe also that, subject to certain very limited restric
tions, the theorem may prove to apply to the case where the
 determinant 27A-M” becomes negative.                                  ------
    The peculiarity of this case which distinguishes it from the
 former, is that it admits of all the three variables w, y, z in the

 degree represented by the equation Yº-H X*-i- 1 =                  .  XY
  (in which I call the coefficient of XY the characteristic),
 which, as long as the quantity last named is less than 3, is
 a single continuous curve extending on both sides to infinity,
 as soon as the characteristic becomes equal to 3 assumes to
 itself an isolated point, the germ of an oval or closed branch,
  which continues to swell out (always lying apart from the
 infinite branch) as the characteristic continues indefinitely to
 1Increase.
     I ought not to omit to call attention<U+017F> to the fact that the
  theorem above detailed is always applicable to the case of the
 equation                                             -

  6i + 1 ; in other words, the above always belongs to the class
  of equations having Monogenous solutions, which for the sake
  of brevity may be termed themselves Monogenous Equations*.
  * Thus the equation a "+y^+Az*=0 alluded to by Legende is Monoge

       On the probable existence of such a class of equations I
  hazarded a conjecture at the conclusion of my last communi
   cation to this Magazine. As I hope, shortly to bring out a
   paper on this subject in a more complete form, I shall con
   tent myself at this time with merely stating a theorem of much
  importance to the completion of the theory of insoluble and
   of Monogenous equations of the third degree; to wit, that the
   equation in integers                  **        _*           -

 the Institut de France in 1818, have gone very elaborately
 into the examination of cochineal and obtained many interest
ing results.)     In  analysing this substance they employed the
following process:–They removed the fatty bodies by boiling
 aether, in which they found the colouring matter but slightly
soluble; these fatty substances, recovered by distilling off the
aether, were considered to consist of stearine, oleine, and an
aromatic acid, from which latter substance it was difficult toº
remove the adhering colouring matter. ººººººº "º
   The cochineal, exhausted with aether, was treated with al
cohol of 40° Beaumé, which dissolved the colouring matter,
together with a small quantity of fatty and nitrogenous sub

   On cooling, and by spontaneous evaporation, they obtained'
agranular red residue of a semi-crystalline appearance, and
which they considered to be the colouring matter contami

some fatty bodies, the greater part of which remained undis-,

once or twice they considered that the substance was ob

    After alcohol had dissolved out all the colouring matter
removable    by it, they extracted the last traces, by repeatedly
washing the residuº with boiling water, and along with it a
little fatty and some nitrogenous matter; the residue was a
brownish transparent mass. The later decoctions, contain
ing no red colouring matter, left likewise on evaporation a
brownish transparent mass, which they considered identical
with the organic residue of the insect. This animal matter
had, according to them, some analogy with gelatine, but dif
fered in many of its properties, as it did also from albumen
and fibrine, they therefore considered it as peculiar to the
cochineal insect; the alkalies and ammonia dissolved it
readily; chlorine precipitated it; all acids and acid salts pre
cipitated it, as also acetate of lead, salts of tin and copper, and
nitrate of silver; and they considered the latter reagent as a
good test of the purity of the colouring matter, as it did not
precipitate the latter if free from nitrogenous substances. If

   In the second part of the memoir they went into the theory
of the technical applications of the colouring matter; this

   M. Lassaigne, in 18194, examined Kermes (Coccus ilicis),
an insect common in the South of Europe, and employed as
a red dye before the discovery of America, and obtained by
following the methods of Pelletier and Caventou, substances
agreeing in their properties with the analogous ones found in
cochineal.
   M. F. Preissert, in an elaborate paper on the origin and
nature of colouring matters, has again drawn the attention of
chemists to the subject. This gentleman, from a study of a
variety of colouring substances, comes to the conclusion that
all resemble indigo in its behaviour with reducing agents.

He affirms that he obtained by the action of hydrosulphuric
acid on the lead compounds of a great number of organic
colouring matters, substances bearing, the same relation to
the original colouring matters as white indigo does to blue
indigo. In order to obtain the colourless modification of the
colouring matter of cochineal, he adds what he terms “hydrate
of oxide of lead” to an aqueous decoction of cochineal, the
fats being previously removed by aether. The colouring mat
ter is entirely removed by the so-called oxide of lead, which
is nothing but a basic nitrate of lead, 2(3PbO, NO3)4-3HO.
The lead compound suspended in water (hot?) was decom
posed by a stream of hydrosulphuric acid; the nearly colour
less filtrate deposited on cooling needles of a pale yellow
colour, which became perfectly white by washing with aether
and pressing between bibulous paper; these crystals, which,
according to his statement, are soluble in water and alcohol,
but less so in aether, assume in contact with the atmosphere
the purple-red of the colouring matter of cochineal. He more
over asserts that his colourless modification gives a white lead
salt on adding acetate of lead to its aqueous solution, and that
this assumes a purple colour in contact with the air.              5
     He proposes to give the name carmine, hitherto applied to
 the red colouring matter, to the white crystals, and to desig
 nate the red substance by the name “Carméine.”            * -
  1. The statements of Preisser, generalizing most beautifully
 under one head the chemical character of all colouring mat
 ters, making indigo as it were the prototype of them all,
 could but induce other chemists to work out more in detail
 the relations cursorily pointed out in the memoir of this che
 mist. Unfortunately a careful repetition of these experiments
 has not confirmed the basis on which his theory reposes.
     M. A. E. Arppe repeated Preisser’s experiments on the
 colouring matter of cochinealº. He found that by proceed
 ing in the manner described by Preisser that he could only
 obtain a red solution, which on evaporation was converted
 into white crystals of oxalic acid by the nitric acid derived
 from the basic lead salt,         -        -          -       - - -
     Arppe now prepared a pure oxide of lead by precipita
 ting acetate of lead with potash. He found that this would
 not take down the colouring matter in the cold, but by boil
 ing it is carried down as a blue lake, which he decomposed
 by hydrosulphuric acid; the supernatant liquor was nearly
 colourless, the colouring matter he found adhered with great
 obstinacy to the sulphuret of lead, from which water, alcohol
 and ammonia failed to separate it; but sulphuret of ammo

nium-and<U+017F> acids renderediit perceptible,ºr He likewise tried
to obtain the        †i matter in a state of purity by pre
cipitating with hydrated oxide of lead an aqueous decoction of
cochineal (previously purified from nitrogenous substances by
mitrate of silver). On treating the precipitate by hydrosui
phuric acid, he obtained ared liquor of strongly acid reaction,
the acid of which was not derived from the lead salt: on eva.
poration it left a dark red mass, emitting the smell of burnt.
sugar.” Wishing to separate the acid, which he thought
contaminated the colouring matter, he prepared a strong
aqueous decoction of cochineal, and after separating the ni
trogenous matter by means of nitrate of silver, filtering, and
then saturating by ammonia, and afterwards adding the
hydrated oxide of lead, he found that the supernatant am
moniacal liquor, which was nearly colourless, yielded by:
evaporation an acid liquid; and on decomposing the lead lake
with hydrosulphuric acid, he obtained a liquid slightly,
coloured (the colouring matteriadhering to the sulphuret of
lead), which was likewise acid. From this he concluded that
the colouring matter had not up to that period been obtained
in a state of purity. . .             . . . . . . . . . . . º. º. º.º.º.º. ºf
            Microscopic Examination of Living Cochinea.
    By the kindness of Sir James Clark, who furnished me with:
specimens of the living insect, I have been enabled to examine!
the physical characters of the colouring matter as it exists in:
the organism of this little insect before it is subjected to the
process of drying for commerce. On examination by the mi
croscope, the white dust which covers the insect and the ad
jacent parts of the cactus leaves, on which it feeds, has all the
characters of an excrement; it has a curled cylindrical form,
is of very uniform diameter and of a white colour. On re
moving the powder with a little aether and piercing the side
of the little creature, a quantity of a purplish red fluid exudes,
which contains the colouring matter in minute granules as
sembled round a colourless and larger nucleus, and these
groups float in a colourless fluid. It is evident from this,
that, whatever may be the function of the colouring matter, it
has a distinct and marked form, and does not pervade as a
mere tint the fluid portion of the insect.” . . ºf                   ºf

the investigation would be greatly facilitated by the employ

the inquiry different methods were adopted for the prepara

designate the various preparations; in gºing<U+017F>ºº gº, micrº<U+017F>o of
 , A. About 3 lbs of ground cochineal (technically known as
shelly black) was introduced into 15 gallons of boiling distilled,
water, and the mixture maintained at that temperature for
twenty minutes; the decoction, strained through a<U+017F>sieve, was
allowed to subside for a quarter of an hour and then decanted
off; whilst still hot the transparent liquid was mixed with
basic nitrate of lead, added with caution to avoid excess; a
fine purple lake was thus, obtained, the supernatant liquor,
retaining only a pale buff tinge. After decantation of the
supernatant liquor, the lake was thrown on a cloth filter and
washed with distilled water until the filtrate gave but a slight
opalescence with chloride of mercury, which was found to be
a test for the presence of nitrogenous matter. The lead lake.
was then suspended in distilled water and treated with a co
pious stream of hydrosulphuric acid, when a precipitate of
sulphuret of lead and a deep red supernatant liquid was ob
tained; on stirring the liquid this colour almost disappeared,
the colouring matter being evidently absorbed by the sul
phuret, agreeing perfectly with Arppe’s observation. A fresh
stream of gas reproduced the colour, which was again absorbed
on stirring; after continuous treatment with hydrosulphuric
acid, the lead lake being completely decomposed, the filtered
liquid was evaporated in a water-bath to a syrupy consistence,
and the evaporation finished as far as possible at a tempera
ture of 38°C. The semi-solid substance thus obtained was
of a deep purple colour, had a strongly acid reaction, and
evolved the smell of burnt sugar, as noticed by Arppe. The
weight of this substance, which I call crude carminic acid,
was 3} ozs., and 1 oz. more was obtained from the residue by,
similar treatment.º.º.          ºt.      tº º, … . . . . . . to 2,
   B. On repeating the same process the whole product was
lost. An excess of the basic nitrate having been employed,
the nitric acid set free by the hydrosulphuric acid caused a
violent decomposition, with [evolution of nitrous fumes, as
soon as the carminic acid arrived at a pasty consistence; this
agrees also with Arppe's experience.º. ºf ºn a ºn tº ºr ºf
 * C. In this operation a decoction of cochineal, made in the
described manner, was precipitated with a solution of acetate,
of lead acidulated with acetic acid (six parts by weight of
crystallized acetate, and one part of strong acetic acid). The
resulting lead lake, being very bulky, was washed by decan
tation with boiling distilled water, collected on a filter, dried
in a current of warm air, and finely powdered; 17 ozs., of
crude carminate of lead were thus obtained.                   ºf

478               Mr. De la Rue on Cochineal.
   D. Half a pound of cochineal was boiled with five pints of
alcohol, spec. grav. 830. The filtered tincture deposited on
cooling a granular precipitate, consisting chiefly of fatty
matter retaining a portion of colouring matter; on concen
trating the tincture by distillation a further quantity was
deposited, which was filtered off; the filtrate was evaporated
to dryness in vacuo, when after eight weeks a gummy resi
due was obtained. This mass dissolved with great difficulty
in a large quantity of absolute alcohol, a red flocculent
substance consisting chiefly of nitrogenous matter remaining
undissolved.    The alcoholic solution filtered off from this
deposit, concentrated by distillation and finally evaporated in
vacuo over sulphuric acid, dried to a tenacious semi-solid
mass, covered with a colourless oily fluid, and containing cry
stalline particles of a solid fat. After removal of the fats by
means of aether, this mass was digested in water at 38°C.,
which partly dissolved it with a fine red colour, leaving a
brown mass of resinous aspect behind, more of which de
posited on the cooling of the coloured liquid; the decoction
was now evaporated to the consistence of a syrup, and finally
dried in vacuo over sulphuric acid.                    -       -
   These are all the processes employed to extract the colour
ing matter from the cochineal; I may here remark, before
entering on the details of its further purification, that I ob

   Purification of the Carminic Acid.—In my first attempts
to purify the colouring matter I proceeded in the following
way:—An aqueous solution of the crude carminic acid (A)
was precipitated with acetate of lead, the precipitate of car
minate of lead well-washed and decomposed by hydrosulphu
ric acid; the red supernatant liquid was first concentrated on
the water-bath and finally dried in vacuo; a highly hygro
scopic purple residue was thus obtained.                 * * * * * * **
   I could not, by whatever means I adopted, effect the deco
lorization of the colouring principle. In several attempts I
heated the solution for some hours to 100°C., keeping up a
continuous current of hydrosulphuric acid, and in other ex
periments a stream was made to pass for several days through
the disengaged colouring matter, but without the slightest
change in its aspect. From these experiments, made with
the greatest care and at several periods, I am led to the same
conclusion as Arppe, that Preisser must have been mistaken
in his results, and I regret that I cannot throw any light on
the probable cause of his error.

                    Mr. De la Rue, on Cochineal,                             479.
   Several combustions of the carminic acid thus purified were
made, the resulting numbers however became useless by the
subsequent observation that this acid w S by no means pure.”
A sufficient quantity being inginerated left a residue of acid,
reaction, which was suspected to contain phosphoric acid,
Carminic acid burning only with great difficulty, it was re;
converted into carminate of lead, the oxide of lead dissolved
out of the residue obtained after fuming by acetic acid, which,
left a white residue of metaphosphate of lead, together with a
little lead. The white residue was soluble in dilute nitric
acid, and exhibited, when treated before the blowpipe, the
characters of metaphosphate of lead; other tests likewise,
confirmed the presence of phosphoric acid, . It will hereafter
be seen that the process of extracting the colouring matter by
alcohol (D) does not exclude the phosphoric acid, which in
all probability existed in the colouring matter analysed by,
Pelletier. It is further evident that the presence of phos
R.       acid explains most satisfactorily the facts observed by
   rppe, , , , , . . . . ..  . . . ...    * *       *   *     -      11.     <U+017F>º-º:
  ya. In order to separate the phosphoric acid, another por
tion of crude carminic acid (A) was precipitated with acetate
of lead. Three-fourths of the carminate of lead produced were
decomposed by hydrosulphuric acid and evaporated to dry
ness in the way already mentioned. The dry mass being dis
solved in cold absolute alcohol, and filtered from a slight floc
 culent brownish residue, was heated to ebullition in a water
bath and mixed with the remaining fourth of the carminate
of lead, which had been previously reduced to a fine powder;
the ebullition was continued for a few hours. In this method
the free phosphoric acid combined with the lead, liberating
an equivalent proportion of carminic acid, which was taken
up by the alcohol. The alcoholic solution was filtered whilst
hot, concentrated by distillation, and then evaporated in vacuo
in the presence of sulphuric acid; it dried into a granular
mass of a deep purple-brown colour, detaching itself sponta
neously from the sides of the vessel, and on examination by
the microscope was found to be a beautiful transparent crim
 son substance, exhibiting only slight, if any, signs of crystal
line structure; by pulverization it became of a fine scarlet
 colour; it left a mere trace of ash, and was found to be per
fectly free from phosphoric acid. It was highly hygrome

 to the composition of the colouring matter, but was evidently
 due to some foreign substance, and not improbably to am
 monia. In order to purify the carminic acid still more, the
 same specimen (d) was dissolved in a small quantity of boil

 times its bulk of anhydrous aether; a splendid scarlet precipi
  tate was immediately produced, which absorbed water rapidl

   by precipitating crude carminic acid with acidulated acetate
   of copper, which salt was found to carry down the carminic
   acid, and to leave in solution by far the greater portion of the
   phosphoric acid. The carminate of copper, which occupied
   a long time in washing, was collected and decomposed by
   hydrosulphuric acid. The filtrate was evaporated to dryness,
   dissolved in boiling absolute alcohol, filtered, concentrated
   by distillation, and again evaporated to dryness in vacuo. It
   still contained a trace of phosphoric acid.” On evaporating

 was dissolved in boiling absolute alcohol, and filtered from a
 slight residue ; the remainder, about an eighth, was converted
 into carminate of lead and digested with the boiling alcoholic
 solution for some hours; the alcoholic tincture filtered off
 whilst hot and mixed with about six times its volume of an
 hydrous aether; this threw down a bulky precipitate of a fine.
 red colour, which was separated by filtration and the filtrate
 concentrated in a retort, and finally evaporated to dryness in

 mined a precipitate which was no longer of a fine red but of
 a brown colour, and on re-solution and similar treatment it di
 minished in quantity and became darker in colour, leaving
 the colouring matter in solution. From the filtrates a quan
 tity of carminic acid (i) was obtained on evaporating to dry
 ness in vacuo. It therefore appears that the aether precipi
 tates a nitrogenous body which carries down with it variable
 quantities of carminic acid, according as a larger or smaller
 relative proportion is present. The carminic acid (h) was
 found to be free from phosphoric acid as well as nitrogen. ...

    From this analysis I venture to assert that the colouring
principle of cochineal contains no nitrogen, thus fully con
firming the anticipation of Berzelius. We can now under
stand from the preparation of the specimen of carminic acid
(e), that the method employed by Pelletier for the prepara
tion of the substance he analysed was calculated to accumu
late all the nitrogenous matter contained originally in his
alcoholic decoction; a fact which fully explains the large
amount of nitrogen he obtained in his analysis,

 ties. It is a purple brown friable mass, transparent when
 viewed by the microscope, and pulverizing to a finerred
  powder; soluble in water and alcohol in all proportions, yery
  slightly soluble in aether, which does not however precipitate
it from its alcoholic solution if free from      ..º.
  It is soluble without decomposition in concentrated hydro
<U+017F>chloric and sulphuric acids. It is decomposed by chlorine,
 iodine and bromine, which change its colour to yellow, and
  the latter on warming or by standing gives a yellow precipi
ºtate soluble in alcohol. • Nitric acid decomposes it even if
  highly diluted: I shall have occasion to refer to this decom
  position presently.” It bears a temperature of 136°C. with
..out decomposition; on gradually increasing the temperature
  a quantity of an acid liquor is produced, and at a red heat it
  intumesces and gives off a small quantity of red fumes, which
  condense: it gives no trace of oily matter.             e

      ºr lºg Action of Nitric Acid on Garminic Acid, “ . . .

  this acid in several of its          º                 M. Arppe found that
  the acid produced was oxalic acid. In my experiments I ob
  tained the following results:—One pound and a half of crude
  carminic acid was gradually introduced into ten pounds, of
  nitric acid, spec, grav. 1:4, and digested at a moderate heat;
  a violent evolution of nitrous fumes succeeded each addition
  of the carminic acid; after the whole quantity had been in
  troduced and the action had somewhat subsided, the mixture
  was transferred into a smaller vessel and the action continued
  at the boiling-point for about two hours; by this time the
  greater part of the nitric acid had evaporated, and on with
  drawing the vessel from the fire and allowing the mixture to
  cool, a crystalline cake was obtained, which on examination was
  found to consist partly of a new acid and partly of oxalic acid.
  To separate the oxalic acid, it was dissolved in a large quan
  tity of boiling water and treated with nitrate of lead as long
  as any precipitate formed; this was collected and decomposed
  by boiling with dilute sulphuric acid; the filtrate from the
  sulphate of lead yielded a large quantity of prismatic crystals
  of oxalic acid, which were obtained perfectly white and pure
  after two or three crystallizations with the aid of a little animal
  charcoal.                                                          -   -     *, , z-
      The yellow liquid filtered from the oxalate of lead was con
  centrated and separated from a fresh portion of oxalate which
  deposited on concentration, the evaporation was then continued
  until a large quantity of crystals formed; the solution on
  cooling deposited a very bulky mass of yellow rhombic prisms,
  which were drained and dried, and re-dissolved in a sufficient
  quantity of boiling water, which on cooling deposited the acid
  (for which I propose the name of nitrococcusic acid) in
  beautiful crystals free from any lead salt; it was recrystal
  lized twice more, by which means it was obtained perfectly
  pure.                                                   -

     Properties of Nitrococcusic Acid –It is of a yellow colour,
 crystallizing in rhombic plates, and presenting very different
 aspects, according to the circumstances under which it is cry
 stallized. Its solution stains the skin yellow, it is soluble in
 cold, but considerably more so in hot water; soluble in al
 cohol, and very soluble in aether. All it salts dissolve readily
 in water, and inost of them in alcohol; it deflagrates violently
 on being heated; it dissolves iron and zinc, becoming dark
 coloured. It is decomposed by sulphuret of ammonium with
 separation of sulphur and the formation of the ammonia salt
 of a new acid, which I have not yet examined.
             º Compounds of Nitrococcusic Acid, ºn
     Nitrococcusate of Potash.-I have prepared this salt by
 two     º methods.                        º:             º'
     a. A solution of nitrococcusic acid in boiling water was
 accurately saturated with carbonate of potash; by evaporation
 to a small bulk and cooling, the salt was obtained in small
  yellow crystals; it was purified by draining and recrystallizing.
   ºb. An aetherial solution of the acid was precipitated by the
  cautious addition of an alcoholic solution of. ; the pale
  yellow precipitate washed with aether and dried, º:
 in as small a quantity of cold water as possible, and the solu
  tion poured into about five times its bulk of absolute alcohol;
  after standing some time the salt crystallized in well-formed
   erystals; it was washed with aether and dried. The aetherial
   washings being added to the mother-liquor, a further portion
   was obtained and washed with aether. The latter process is
   less troublesome than the process a                   .   . . ..     ..

   I was not successful in preparing a nitrococcusate of potash
with one equivalent of fixed base; the method I adopted was
saturating a given weight of acid with carbonate of potash,
and then adding the same amount of acid to the bibasic pot
ash salt; on washing with aether the greater part of the ex
cess of acid was removed, leaving the bibasic salt behind.
   Nitrococcusate of Ammonia.-This salt was prepared by
passing an excess of dry ammoniacal gas through an aetherial
solution of the acid dried in the atmosphere; the solution be
came turbid, and by standing for a short time deposited the
salt in clusters of needles adhering firmly to the sides of the
vessel; these were removed, washed with aether, and dried on
bibulous paper. It is volatile, and sublimes on being heated,
most probably with decomposition.
   I. 60ll grim. of the salt dried in vacuo was dissolved in a
small quantity of boiling water and decomposed by strong
hydrochloric acid, which immediately separated the acid in
crystals; the mixture was dried in a water-bath, and the ni
trococcusic acid removed by aether, a little bichloride of pla
tinum and alcohol being added to the aetherial washings to
precipitate a trace of chloride of ammonium. The residue,
precipitated as ammonio-chloride of platinum, gave 8208
grim. of the double chloride.

     The experiments of MM. Cahours and Laurent on the
oxidation of the oils of anise and of tarragon (Oleum dracun-º
 culi) have made us acquainted with anisic acid, the composi
tion of which is Cha Hs Og.         The formula agrees with the
composition of the hypothetical hydrated coccusic acid." "
     Anisic acid, however, as well as nitranisic acid, being mono
basic, it was not probable that the further introduction of then
elements of hyponitric acid would convert it into a bibasicº
one; nevertheless it was my intention to have studied the
further action of nitric acid on the acids mentioned; in order,
to obtain if possible trinitroanisic acid, and to compare this
substance with the acid obtained from carminic acid, when and
account of some new experiments of M. Cahours came under
my notice, of the action of a mixture of concentrated sulphuric r
and nitric acids on anisic acid, by which he has succeeded in
preparing trinitroanisic acid...The experiments of M. Ça-.
hours have not yet been published in detail, and from his.
short account it was not possible to decide on the identity or
non-identity of nitrococcusic and trinitroanisic acids. A small,
specimen of anisic acid at my disposal was treated in the
manner described by him; after acting for some time water
threw down an acid, from the insolubility of which I conclude
that these acids are only isomeric.                              -                -->

     Careful and repeated examinations for sulphur proved the
 absence of this element as a component of the new white sub
 stance. I have been unable to produce a compound to eon
trol the proposed formula, though several methods were
 adopted; amongst others, I attempted to form a lead com
 pound by adding acetate of lead to an ammoniaeal solution of
 the substance; I obtained merely a bulky precipitate, con
 sisting of little else than oxide of lead.
     This substance is sparingly soluble in cold water, much                            -
 more so in boiling water; insoluble in alcohol and aether;
 soluble in hydrochloric acid, which appears to be driven off
  by evaporation, leaving the substance in large erystals. In a
  large quantity of nitric acid it dissolves with a slight evolu
  tion of gas; the solution evaporated spontaneously furnishes
  long crystals, which are in all probability a new acid; if dis
  solved in a small quantity of nitric acid, the mixture becomes
  spontaneously heated, violent action takes place, and the pro
  duct is lost; frequently the substance becomes blackened into
  charred masses.          It is soluble in ammonia, from which it is
  again recovered by the evaporation of the ammonia. It is
  soluble in the fixed alkalies, and is precipitated from these
   solutions by saturating with an acid.                                -          ºf:
       In a short paper, entitled “Valerianic Acid and a new
   body from Casein,” Baron Liebig” describes a new substance
   obtained by fusing casein with hydrate of potash until an
   evolution of hydrogen takes place along with ammonia, On
   saturating with acetic acid the aqueous solution of the fused
   mass an aggregate of fine needles was produced, which were

498 Sir David Brewster on the Easistence of Crystals
last spring, when I discovered cavities in topaz filled with the
most beautiful crystals of various form, that I was induced to
undertake a new investigation of their nature and properties.
In this investigation I have examined, with various magnifying
powers, and both in common and polarized light, more than
900 specimens of topaz from Scotland, New Holland, and the
Brazils; and I have had the good fortune to observe many
new phaenomena connected with mineralogy, chemistry, and
physics, which, in addition to the interest which they may
possess as scientific facts, promise to throw a strong light upon
the existing theories of crystallization, and to bring before us
some of those recondite operations which had been going on
in the primitive rocks of our globe, before the commencement
of vegetable or animal life.
 1. On the Form and Position of the Strata in which the Cavities
                                lie.
    The cavities which contain the two new fluids, and their
 accompanying crystals, sometimes occur single, and in groups
 more or less numerous; but, in general, they exist in millions,
occupying extensive strata, which affect the transparency of
 the mineral, and render it unfit for the use of the jeweller, or
 even for the cabinet of the collector, who has not learned that
 it is in the deviations from her ordinary laws that Nature often
 discloses her deepest mysteries.                                  s
     Although the strata of cavities sometimes occur, as in arti
 ficial salts, in planes parallel to the primary or secondary
 forms of the crystal, yet they occupy every possible position in
 reference to these planes; and we therefore cannot account
 for them by supposing that certain spaces have been left in
 the crystal, without the primitive molecules which ought to
 have been there deposited. The strata of cavities, too, have
 every possible curvature. From a plane surface they pass
 into a curved one, sometimes of variable curvature, and some
 times of contrary flexure, cutting and intersecting each other
 in the most capricious manner.
     In the shape of the strata the same irregularity presents
 itself; their outline is sometimes rectilineal, sometimes curved,
 and sometimes singularly irregular. In some specimens the
 whole crystal is intersected with the strata; and it is extremely
 probable, though it is impossible to determine the fact, that in
 every specimen some edge or angle of the stratum touches the
 surface.                                                        -
     The succession of the cavities in composing the stratum,
 and their form in relation to the character of the stratum,
 present interesting phaenomena.      I have found specimens in

                   in the Cavities of Minerals.               499
which the cavities lie in concentric arches, and have their sides
concentric, and, as it were, a portion of the same arches, as if
they had been formed under the influence of a rotatory force.
In other cases they occupy parallel lines, and are sometimes
so equidistant that they might be advantageously used as mi
crometers for microscopes. In one remarkable specimen they
radiate from a centre, each radiation having a character of its
own. One radiation will sometimes throw off a diverging
branch, while two or more radiations will converge and then
diverge again, subsequently uniting themselves into a single
radiation.
   When different strata of cavities lie parallel to each other
in the specimen, which they sometimes do, to the number of
four or five, each stratum has generally a distinct character;
flat and exceedingly thin cavities occupying one stratum, very
deep cavities occupying another, minute cavities which the
highest magnifying powers can scarcely resolve occupying a
third, while a fourth consists of the most irregular and inde
scribable forms.
    When the forms of individual cavities are related to that of
the stratum which contains them, they, of course, cut at all
angles the primary and secondary planes of crystallization;
and the same is true of insulated cavities of great length, which
are sometimes turned, and twisted, and bent in the most ca
pricious manner. It is impossible to read these details, and
still more so to study the phaenomena themselves, without
being driven to the conclusion, that the strata of cavities must
have been formed under the influence of forces propagated
through a soft and plastic mass, and carrying along with them
gases and vapours which came to a position of rest previous
to the regular crystallization of the topaz. This conclusion,
which I have been led to draw, in another paper, from a series
of entirely different facts, will be still further confirmed by
 the phaenomena of imbedded crystals, to which I shall have
 to refer in another section.
  2. Additional Observations on the Nature and Properties of
                       the two New Fluids.
   In re-examining the phaenomena exhibited by the two new
fluids, I have found no occasion to modify or to correct any
of the results contained in my former papers. In the cavities
which appear to contain only one fluid, namely, the dense
fluid, I have sometimes found a very small quantity of the
volatile fluid, which, with a slight rise of temperature, passes
into vapour, and prevents the apparent vacuity from disap
pearing by the application of k strong heat. When there is
                              2 K. 2

500 Sir David Brewster an the Eristence of Crystals
no volatile fluid present in such, cavities, the vacuity is a real
one, and disappears entirely by the application of such a heat.
If the heat is not instantly, withdrawn on the disappearance of
the vacuity, the crystal never fails to burst with great violence,
- In some specimens of Brazilitopaz. I have found cavities
with two fluids, and without any vacuity in, the volatile fluid
at the ordinary temperature of an apartment.               In such cases
I have generally produced a vacuity by the application of ice.
Had heat been applied, the crystals would have burst, as there
were no empty spaces into which, the fluids could expand, , , ,
    When the cavities are flat, and have their faces perpendi
cular to the axis, of the crystal, or parallel to the planes of
easy cleavage, the application, of heat, does not burst the cry
stal, but produces a very, remarkable <U+017F>phaenomenon, , The
cavity opens at its weakest point, and the fluid passes by starts,
through a succession of resting places, to another part of the
crystal where it finds the readiest exit. The fluid penetrates,
as it were, the solid gem, and the laminae which it has forced
asunder in its passage, again close into optical if not into me
chanical contact.       If the heat is, withdrawn when the first
minute drop has passed, the laminae, unite, and, we can
discharge the rest of the fluid whenever, we please till the
cavity is exhausted. ... This phaenomenon is represented in
Plate III. fig. 1, where ABCD is a shallow cavity in a plate
of topaz MN, and EF another cavity, which has been emptied
of its fluid contents by reaching the surface at N, where it had
been broken through. Upon looking at the cavity ABCD
when slightly heated, I observed dark portions of fluid rushing
from its sharp termination at D through the cavity at a, and
then reappearing at b and c, and then passing into the empty
cavity EF. The small lakes, as we may call them, at a, b
and c, disappeared entirely when the discharged portions of
fluid had passed, and reappeared with a change of form and
size when the operation was repeated.              º             ºf , ºf M i<U+017F> . . . .
   In a specimen of topaz possessed by Major, Playfair, and
seen by many individuals, a white ball passed from one cavity
to the edge of the specimen, as if projected from a mortar;
but by the application of too strong a heat it was shattered in

p  In my first paper of 1823*, I have described and figured
a phaenomenon of an analogous kind; but as it appeared un
expectedly, and was instantly followed by the explosion of the
crystal, I could neither observe it accurately, nor confirm what
I did observe, by a repetition of the experiment. ... I have,
therefore, some satisfaction in describing a similar phaeno

   I come now to describe a property of the dense fluid, sº
new and remarkable that it cannot fail to excite the attentio
of chemists. This fluid occupies the whole of a large cavity
ABCDE, fig. 2, with the exception of a bubble at Å, which
must be either a vacuum, as it is in all cavities containing only
this fluid, or a bubble of the expansible fluid, or the vapour
of the dense fluid, or some gaseous body.” It cannot be a
vacuum, because it expands with heat, in place of being filled
up by the expansion of the fluid. It cannot be the expansible
fluid, because cold would contract it, and produce a vacuity.
It cannot be the vapour of the expansible fluid, because there
is no expansible fluid to throw it off, and it has not the optical
properties of its vapour. * It cannot be the vapour of the fluid
in the cavity, for it does not disappear by the application of
cold, and does not become a        ...        which fills up by the
expansion of the fluid. It is therefore an independent gas,
which exhibits the following phaenomena. " ' " " ' ". .
 *When heat is applied, the bubble A expands, not by the
degradation of its circular margin passing into vapour, as in
the vapour cavities described in a former paper, but by the
rapid enlargement of its area. When it attains a certain size,
it throws off a secondary bubble B, which passes over a sort
of ridge or weir mno, in the bottom of the cavity, and settles
at B. If the heat is continued, these two bubbles increase in
 size; but it was instantly withdrawn when B had begun to
 swell. “As the topaz began to cool, both the bubbles A and
 B quickly contracted.      #. ...;          bubble A returned gra
 dually to its original condition, and B, when reduced to a
 single speck, would have disappeared, had the cooling not
 been stopped. This speck swelled again by the application of
 heat, and so did the bubble A. "When the speck at B was
 allowed to vanish, which it did on the spot which the bubble
 occupied, the fresh application of heat did not revive it at that
 spot, but merely expanded the primary bubble A, which
 again threw off a secondary bubble B, which exhibited by
 heat and cold the same phaenomena as before. These ex
 periments I repeated many times with the same result. It will
 naturally be asked, what was the condition of the fluid itself
 which has the property of expanding by heat; and what be

came of it while a part of the space which it occupied was
appropriated by the bubble B, and the addition to the bubble
A2     An accidental circumstance enables me to answer this
question, which would have been otherwise a very perplexing
one. Having applied too strong a heat to the specimen, the
bubble A threw off beside B two or three smaller ones, which
moved along the upper edge A.E. My attention having been
thus directed to this part of the specimen, I was surprised to
observe a great number of capillary lines or pipes PQ, rising
from the edge AE of the cavity, and into which the fluid was
forcing itself, oscillating in these minute tubes like the mercury
in a barometer, and sometimes splitting the laminae between
them. The force of cohesion, thus overcome by the expan
sive efforts of the fluid, predominated over the capillary attrac
tion of the tubes and surfaces, and pressed back all the fluid
into the cavity, when the body of fluid had contracted in
cooling.
   If we now consider the body which occupies the vacuity A
as a gas, and, consequently, the other bubble B as the same,
it follows that the whole of the gas in B was absorbed by the
fluid while cooling, and again given out by an increase of tem
perature. The gas, when in the act of being discharged, took
its course to the locality of the speck at B, and to the bubble
 A ; but to the bubble A alone when the speck had disap
peared.
    Upon repeating these observations the cavity burst; and I
 have now before me its two halves, forming its upper and its
 under surface. The portion of the cavity at A has the same
depth as the portion below mno, all the rest of the cavity being
 much shallower. There was a fine doubly refracting crystal
at MN, which polarized the blue of the second order; and its
 outline is still left on the cavity. There was a sort of crystal
line powder disseminated round MN to a considerable di
 stance, and the roof of the bubble B, when the roof of the
cavity was entire, was always mottled with this powder.
    In a former paper, I have distinguished vapour cavities
from common cavities, by the manner in which the vacuity in
the expansible fluid disappears. In the one case, the vacuity
gradually enlarges by the degradation, as it were, of its mar
gin, as the fluid passes into vapour; in the other, the vacuity
gradually diminishes till it disappears, I have since found
cavities of an intermediate character, in which the vacuity, on
the first application of heat, diminishes, and then, when it has
contracted to a certain size, it begins to expand; and its
margin becoming thinner and thinner, it finally passes into
vapour.

  3. On the Form and Position of Crystals in the Cavities of
                               Topaz.
   In a former paper I have described a moveable group of
crystals of carbonate of lime, which I discovered in a cavity
in quartz from Quebec, containing a fluid with the properties
of water. The crystals to which I am about to call attention.
are of a very different kind, and possess a very different kind
of interest.            -
   The crystals which occupy the fluid cavities of topaz are
either fixed or moveable. Some of the fixed crystals are often
beautifully crystallized. They have their axes of double re
fraction coincident with those of the crystal, and, as I have
ascertained by the examination of exploded cavities, they ac
tually form part of the solid topaz, though they exist in the
fluid cavity. One or two of these are shown in fig. 4, plate
19, of my paper of 1826*, and they may be distinguished
by their attachment to the sides of the cavity. In the same
figure, as well as in figs, 10, 13, 20, and 21 of my paper of
1823 f, I have drawn others which I then believed to be fixed,
but which I have no doubt are moveable, and produced from
one or other of the new fluids.
   In re-examining my specimens of topaz, I have been sur
prised at the great number of cavities which contain crystals.
In some there are only one; in very many there are two,
three, and four; and in a great number of specimens the
cavity is so crammed with them, like a purse full of money,
that the circular vacuity has not room to take its natural shape,
and often can scarcely be recognised, in its broken-down con
dition, among the jostling crystals.
   The crystals of which I am treating are sometimes found in
the volatile, and sometimes in the dense fluid, but chiefly in
the latter. They are often found in an amorphous state in the
narrow necks and narrow extremities of cavities, positions in
which they remain fixed while they continue solid; and some
times regularly formed crystals remain fixed between the pris
matic edges of cavities, in consequence of having either fallen
into that position, or of having been formed there.
   The crystals in topaz cavities are, in general, beautifully
crystallized, and have a great variety of forms. I have ob
served the following:—
   1. The tetrahedron.
   2. The cube.
   3. The cube, truncated on its edges and angles.

 ... Although it would be desirable to submit these crystals, as
well as the fluids which contain them, to chemical analysis,
yet the task is too difficult to be accomplished in the present
state of chemical science... I must therefore limit my obser
vations to such of the physical properties of these crystals as
can be rendered visible to the eye. …out 2.1-rºo ºf , i.
     When I first applied heat to the crystals under considera
tion, I employed a very fine specimen, with large and nume
rous crystallized cavities, of a prismatical form, containing both
the new fluids,     In this specimen, there were seven, cavities.
unlike all the rest, and each of them containing a single cry
stal, and apparently but one fluid, namely, the dense one. The
cavities were exceedingly flat, and irregular in their shape,
and very unlike one another, . Upon applying the heat of only,
a lighted paper match beneath the plate of glass on which the
specimen lay, I was surprised to see the crystals gradually,
lose their angles, and then slowly melt, till not a trace of them.
was visible. In this state one of the cavities had the appear
ance shown in fig. 3, where V was the vacuity, and v, v' other
two bubbles, one of which v soon joined the principal one V.
In all the other six cavities the crystals were speedily repro
duced, always at the point where they disappeared, provided
a small speck remained unmelted; but otherwise in different
parts of the cavity. In the cavity AB, however, fig. 3, the
crystal was very long in appearing. In the course of an hour,
however, a fasciculus of minute crystals appeared in the centre
of the vacuity, as in fig. 4, and to them the principal crystal
attached itself, as in fig. 5, which exhibits a perfect rhomboidal,
plate, truncated on its obtuse angles. The elliptical vacuity
was pressed into the shape of a heart; and, by the application.
of ice, I succeeded in precipitating the vapour of the expan
sible fluid, which existed in a very minute quantity in all the
seven cavities. The expansible fluid is shown between the two
heart-shaped outlines in the figure, and I repeatedly threw it.
into vapour, and reduced that vapour to a fluid state. The
phaenomenon, now described, of the melting of the crystals,
and their subsequent recrystallization, I have shown to various

    Upon applying heat to other cavities containing several
crystals, I obtained very different results." Some of them
melted easily, others with greater difficulty; and some were
not in the slightest degree affected by the most powerful heat
I could apply. When the crystals melted easily, they were
as quickly reproduced; sometimes . ring more perfectly
formed    than before,
and granular               but frequently running

 * In some specimens of topaz all the crystals in the cavities
refuse to melt with heat, and seem not to suffer the slightest
change in their form. Hence we are entitled to conclude,
that the crystals possessing such different properties must be
different substances; and this conclusion is amply confirmed
by an examination of their optical properties. . . .” º
  "In making this examination, I used a polarizing microscope,
so constructed that the plane, passing through the optical axis
of the topaz, could be readily placed either parallel or per
pendicular to the plane of primitive polarization." In this case
 the field of the microscope is wholly obscure, in so far as the
depolarizing action of the plate of topaz is concerned; but if
 there is any crystal in the topaz, either imbedded in its mass,
 or included in its cavities, that crystal will exhibit its doubly
refracting structure, if it has any, by its depolarizing action.
 It may, indeed, happen, and it does happen, --that the plane
passing through their optical axes coincides, either accurately,
 or so nearly, with that of the topaz, that its depolarizing action
 is a minimum; but an experienced observer will have no dif
ficulty in distinguishing this want of depolarization by position,
 from the want of it by structure. * * * * * * * * * *
  *When the specimen of topaz is rich in cavities full of cry
 stals, the display of luminous and coloured crystalline forms in
the dark field of the microscope, indicating, too, the        ".
sonment of fluids, and the condensation of gases before vege
table or animal life had visited our primaeval globe, was as
interesting to the imagination and the judgement as it was
 beautiful to the eye. Having had the privilege of being the
 first to see it, I felt the full influence of the sight; and I have
 again and again contemplated it with renewed wonder and
delight. When the cavities are so numerous as to mock cal
 culation, and so infinitely small as to yield no visible outline
to the highest powers, the bright twinkle of a crystalline atom
 within them reveals to us their nature as well as their contents.
    In the examination of the individual crystals, many interest

506     Sir David Brewster on the Eristence of Crystals
ing facts present themselves to our notice. . The crystals of
the tessular class, which are modifications of the cube, are
very numerous, and have no action upon polarized light.
 Many of them melt easily, while others refuse to yield to the
action of heat; and hence there must be two different sub
stances in the cavities which assume the same shape. In like
manner, some of the doubly refracting crystals melt readily,
others with very great difficulty, and others not at all ; so that
there must be three different substances, which belong to the
classes of forms that give double refraction; a conclusion
which is confirmed by the different secondary forms which I
have already enumerated,            -
   I have seldom found any crystals in these cavities which
depolarize white light, or the highest order of colours. I have
found some that depolarize four orders of colours; and when
the crystal which does this is a flat hexagonal plate, it is highly
interesting to see it pass through all the tints which these
orders include, while slowly melting, and again reproducing
them during its recrystallization.
   In a cavity which was so placed as to be entirely black from
the total reflexion of the light which fell upon it, I observed
three white openings, a, b, c, of a crystalline form (see fig. 6).
These appeared to be fixed crystals, or rather parts of the
topaz, surrounded by a cavity. I found, however, that the
hexagonal one C depolarized white light, while the rest had
no action upon polarized light. Upon applying heat, the
crystal c melted, and took up a position at c, fig. 15, in a nar
rower part of the cavity, where it remains of an irregular
form, having been repeatedly melted and recrystallized. Upon
turning the cavity into a position where it became transparent,
I found that there was no fluid whatever in the cavity; so that
we have here an example of a crystal melting and recrystal
lizing without having been dissolved in one of the fluids. From
the irregular state of the laminae close to this cavity, there is
every appearance of the fluids having escaped from one of its
extremities.                                                . .
   In the course of these observations, I observed a phaeno
menon, produced by heat, of the most novel and surprising
kind, and one which I feel myself utterly unable to explain.
It presented itself when I was studying the very interesting
collection of crystals in the cavity AB, fig. 8. This cavity is
filled with the dense fluid, in which there is a vacuity.V: the
fluid swells to such a degree with heat as to diminish very
perceptibly the size of this vacuity; and as I can find no trace
of any portion of the volatile fluid, I have no doubt that this
vacuity would disappear by an increased degree of heat. The

                  in the Cavities of Minerals. . . . . º.    507
fear, however, of bursting so rare and interesting a cavity,
has prevented me from making this experiment. The cavity
contains a great number of crystals of different forms, not one
of which melts with heat, and almost all of which possess
double refraction. When I first submitted this cavity to the
microscope, there were five small crystals lying between D and
the vacuity V; one a flat prism, another a hexagonal plate, a
third amorphous, and a fourth and fifth two irregular halves
of a hexagon. Upon the first application of heat, one or two
of these crystals leapt from their resting place, and darted to
the opposite side of the cavity. In a few seconds the others
quitted their places one after another, performing the most
rapid and extraordinary rotations. One crystal joined an
other, and, at last, four of them thus united revolved with such
rapidity as completely to efface their respective shapes. They
then separated on the withdrawal of the heat, and took the
position which their gravity assigned them. On another oc
casion, a long flat prism performed the same rotation round
its middle point; and I have repeated the experiment so often,
in showing it to others, that the small crystals have been driven
between the inclined edges of the cavity, from which I cannot
extricate them. I have succeeded, however, in conducting a
fine octohedral crystal, truncated on its edges and angles, into
the arena at D, where I have just seen it perform its rotation,
as indicated by the concentric circles on the right-hand of D.
* In seeking for the cause of so extraordinary aphaenomenon,
 we are reminded of the rotations of camphor and other vola
tile substances; but in this case no gas or matter of any kind
could be thrown off without becoming visible in the fluid. The
pyro-electricity oftopaz next suggests itself as a moving power;
but though it might produce attractions and repulsions, we
cannot see how it could turn a crystal upon its axis. The
experiments of Libri and Fresnel, on the repulsions which
heated bodies exert upon each other at sensible distances,
afford us as little aid. They may enable us to account for
the mere displacement of the crystals by the application of
heat, or for their sudden start from their places of rest, but
they do not supply us with a force fitted to give and to sustain
a rapid rotatory movement. . . . . " " ' " ºr .
   I have already had occasion to state, that the cavities often
burst when too much heat is applied to the specimen. This
generally takes place by a separation of the laminae, which
fly off in splinters; but when the burst cavity is large and
insulated, a piece of the solid crystal is scooped out on its
weakest side. Sometimes a great number of cavities explode
at the same time, and when they are small, or exist in a part

is merely driven . §: laminae to a small distance around

When the cohesion of the laminae is great, it resists the ex

are’ i.       to a considerable distance around it, and remains
between the laminæ, either as a sort of powder, or as a con

to show their depolarizing action. When the laminae sepa
rate, we find this crystalline matter either fluid or indurated;
exhibiting, when fluid, the extraordinary properties described
in my former papers. "If we breathe upon the indurated
matter it becomes fluid, recrystallizes in            ..º.º.           cry

from the dense fluid being a condensed gas, or from some

passed through a great number of large flat cavities, the brown
matter has been lodged near to the edges of each º

were filled almost solely with the volatile fluid; and since the
faces of the cavities are corroded as if by the action of a "sol
vent, developing crystalline forms, there is reason to think that
the fluid has exercised this action, and that the phaenomenon
is analogous to that external action, on the faces of hundreds

  LXXIV. Observations on Chloric Acid and the Chlorates.
                       By LEwis THoMPson.
  To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
AN      easy and oeconomical mode of preparing chloric acid
      and some of the chlorates has not been described in any
chemical work that I am aware of: the following will be found
to answer extremely well.
   Dissolve in two separate portions of boiling water one atom
(122-81) of chlorate of potash, and one atom (168'34) of bi
tartrate of ammonia; mix the two solutions together, and set
the whole aside in order that the bitartrate of potash may
crystallize; then mix the clear solution with an equal bulk of
alcohol, and filter or pour off the alcoholic solution of chlorate
of ammonia, which must now be boiled in a flask or other
narrow-necked vessel, with an excess of recently-precipitated
carbonate of baryta, until the ammonia is expelled, water being
occasionally added; then filter the fluid, evaporate, and cry
stallize. In dissolving the chlorate of potash and bitartrate of
ammonia, as little water must be used as possible.
   The chlorates of strontia and lime may be prepared in a
similar manner; and the metallic chlorates are easily prepared
by decomposing the chlorate of baryta by means of a sulphate
of the base required.
   Chloric acid is best obtained by dissolving a given weight
of chlorate of baryta, and adding no more sulphuric acid than
is sufficient to combine with the base; several hours or even
days, however, appear necessary to effect this decomposition
in the cold; after which the whole may be filtered and care
fully evaporated at a low heat. When sulphuric acid is added
to a solution of the chlorate of baryta, as long as it gives a
rºute
aCld,
                I have always found an excess of it in the chloric

             Sir W. Rowan Hamilton on Quaternions.                 511
   The bitartrate of ammonia may be readily made by dissol
ving tartaric acid in water, saturating one-half of the solution
with ammonia or its carbonate, and adding to this the remain
ing half of the liquid tartaric acid; the bitartrate of ammonia
immediately precipitates. ºº i<U+017F> "ºb on ºil tº 19.
    For pyrotechnical purposes, the chlorates of baryta, stron
tia, lead, &c. may be made without alcohol. With combus
tibles containing hydrogen, the chlorate of baryta produces a
green flame of surpassing brilliancy; and the chlorate of

 it is now proposed to point out some of the modes of combining,
 transforming, and interpreting the system of these two equa
 tions, consistently with the principles and rules of the Calculus
 of Quaternions, from which the equations themselves have been
 derived.
    52. Whatever two vectors may be denoted by , and r, the
 ternary product rur is always a vector form, because (by
 article 20) its scalar part is zero; and on the other hand the
 square r" is a pure scalar: therefore we may always write
                         rir=Prº, r = ºr, . . . . . (52.)
 where u is a new vector, expressible in terms of and r as
 follows:
                            Pi—tit"; .    .   .  .  .  .  .   (53.)
 so that it is, in general, by the principles of articles 40, 41,
 42, 43, the re<U+017F>terion of the vector with respect to the vector
 w, and that thus the direction of r is exactly intermediate be
 tween the directions of 1 and wº. In the present question, this
 new vector u, defined by the equation (53.), may therefore
 represent the reflexion of the first cyclic normal 1, with re
 spect to any reflecting line which is parallel to the vector r,
 which latter vector is tangential to one of the curves of cur
 vature on the ellipsoid. Substituting for tir its value (52.), in
 the lately cited equation (49.), and suppressing the scalar
 factor rº, we find this new equation:
                            S.vux=0; . . . . . . . . (54.)
which, in virtue of the general equation of coplanarity assigned
in the 21st article (Phil. Mag. for July 1846), expresses that
the reflected vector u, the normal vector v, and the second
cyclic normal x, are parallel to one common plane. This result
gives already a characteristical geometric property of the lines
of curvature on an ellipsoid, from which the directions of those
curved lines, or of their tangents (r), can generally be assigned,
at any given point upon the surface, when the direction of the
normal (v) at that point, and those of the two cyclic normals
( and x), are known. For it shows that if a straight line tº be
found, in any plane parallel to the given lines v and x, such
that the bisector r of the angle between this line u and a line
parallel to the other given line i shall be perpendicular to the
given line v, then this bisecting line r will have the sought
direction of a tangent to a line of curvature. But it is pos
sible to deduce a geometrical determination, or construction,
more simple and direct than this, by carrying the calculation
a little further.

and may regard these two vector parts of these two quater

long straight lines. Consequently the vector + wr, which has
the direction of the line represented by the pure vector pro
duct v(a + i), or by the sum V. ww.--V. v. of two equally long
vectors, has at the same time the direction of the sum of the
two corresponding versors of those vectors, or that of the sum

which expresses that the three vectors v, u, x are coplanar,
shows also that the two vectors W. Wu and V. vi. are parallel to
each other, as being both perpendicular to that common plane
to which w, w, and x are parallel; hence we have the following
equation between two versors of vectors, or between two vec

 In this expression for a vector touching a line of curvature, or
 parallel to such a tangent, the two terms connected by the
 sign + are easily seen to denote (on the principles of the
 present calculus) two equally long vectors, in the directions
 respectively of the projections of the two cyclic normals and
 x on a plane perpendicular to w; that is, on the tangent plane
 to the ellipsoid at the proposed point, or on any plane parallel
 thereto. If then we draw two straight lines through the point
 of contact, bisecting the acute and obtuse angles which will in
 general be formed at that point by the projections on the tan
 gent plane of two indefinite lines drawn through the same
 point in the directions of the two cyclic normals, or in direc
 tions perpendicular to the two planes of circular section of the
 surface, the two rectangular bisectors of angles, so obtained, will
 be the tangents to the two lines of curvature: which very simple
 construction agrees perfectly with known geometrical results,
 as will be more clearly seen, when it is slightly transformed as
 follows.                                                                  -

 were what it has been since proposed to name direction-units.

ples of the calculus of quaternions, a third vector rectangular
to both; we shall therefore only pass by this multiplication,
so far as directions are concerned, from one to the other of the
tangents of the two lines of curvature: consequently we may
omit the factor v- in the second member of (62.), at least if
we change (for greater facility of comparison of the results
among themselves) the ambiguous sign + to its opposite.
We may also suppress the scalar coefficient t, if we only wish
to form an expression for a line r which shall have the required
direction of a tangent, without obliging the length of this line
r to take any previously chosen value. The formula for the
system of the two tangents to the two lines of curvature thus
takes the simplified form :
                         r=UV. v. EUV. v. ; . . . . . (63.)
in which the two terms connected by the sign + are two vec
tor-units, in the respective directions of the traces of the two
cyclic planes upon the tangent plane. The tangents to the
two lines of curvature at any point of the surface of an ellipsoid
(and the same result holds good also for other surfaces of the
second order), are therefore parallel to the two rectangular
straight lines which bisect the angles between those traces; or
they are themselves the bisectors of the angles made at the
point of contact by the traces of planes parallel to the two
cyclic planes. The discovery of this remarkable geometrical
theorem appears to be due to M. Chasles. It is only brought
forward here for the sake of the process by which it has been
above deduced (and by which the writer was in fact led to
perceive the theorem before he was aware that it was already
known), through an application of the method of quaternions,
and as a corollary from the geometrical construction of the
ellipsoid itself to which that method conducted him *. For
that new geometrical construction has been shown (in a recent
Number of this Magazine) to admit of being easily retranslated
into that quaternion form of the equation f of the ellipsoid, .
namely
             T(p+px)= x*-*, equation (9.), art. (38.),
as an interpretation of which equation it had been assigned by
the present writer; and then a general method for investiga
ting by quaternions the directions of the lines of curvature on
any curved surface whatever, conducts, as has been shown (in

those tangential vectors r which satisfy the system of the two
conditions in art. 51, may be derived from observing that
those conditions fail to distinguish one such tangential vector
 from another in each of the two cases where the variable nor
 mal w coincides in direction with either of the two fixed cyclic
 normals, and x; that is, at the four umbilical points of the
 ellipsoid, as might have been expected from the known pro
 perties of that surface. In fact if we suppose

 which is here a vector-form, because by (64.) the product ir
 denotes in this case a pure vector, so that its square (like that
 of every other vector in this theory) will be a negative scalar, by
 one of the fundamental and peculiar” principles of the present
 calculus; the scalar part of the product writx therefore vanishes,
 or the condition (49.) is satisfied by the suppositions (64.).

 cyclic normals, and x, into two partial or component vectors,

tangent of the angle of rotation in that plane from the direction
of the line r to that of the line '; while a similar interpretation
applies to the second member of either of the same two equa
tions, the sign – in that second member signifying here that
the two equally long angular motions, or rotations, from r to
l', and from r to x', are performed in opposite directions.
Thus the vector r, which touches a line of curvature, coincides
in direction with the bisector of the angle in the tangent plane
between the projections, ' and x', of the cyclic normals there
upon; or with that other line, at right angles to this last bi
sector, which bisects in like manner the other and supplemen

LXXVI. Contributions to the Chemical History of Gun-Cotton
    and Xyloidine. By Mr. JoHN HALL GLADston E, of Uni
   versity College, London”.
 AT the commencement of the present year, having perceived
       that considerable doubt rested on the ultimate composi
tion of gun-cotton, I undertook a series of experiments with
a view to ascertain it, if possible; and during my investiga
tion my attention was drawn to various papers that appeared
on the subject, where I found contradictory accounts, not
only of the results of analysis, but also of the action of va
rious reputed solvents. The experiments detailed below,
although they are far from exhausting the subject, may serve
to explain some of these anomalies, and to point out a few
facts, which, as far as I have been able to learn, have not
been hitherto noticed.
   The cotton employed was that used by jewellers, well
carded, perfectly white, and free from imperfections. An
analysis of the substance by combustion with oxide of copper
in a stream of oxygen yielded the following results:—

   The excess of hydrogen doubtless arises from moisture
absorbed by the oxide of copper during the unavoidable delay
in mixing it with the cotton.

520          -    . . Mr. Gladstone on the
... This cotton, which may be considered as pure lignine, was
steeped until thoroughly wetted in a mixture of nitric acid of
spec. grav. 1502, and nearly an equal bulk of strong sul
phuric acid, then well-washed with water, and dried at a
temperature not exceeding 212°. In one instance 38°38 grs.
of cotton became 66:84 grs, being an increase of 28°46 grs.,
 or 74:15 per cent. In a second experiment 59.3 grs. of cot
 ton gave an increase of 437 grs., or 73°7 per cent. The gun
 cotton, or pyroxyline, thus produced resembled the original
 cotton in physical properties very closely, and exploded at
 about 370°, producing no smoke and leaving no residue.
    The action of various solvents and reagents upon this sub
 stance was found to be as follows:—It is absolutely insoluble
 in pure water, and nearly so in strong alcohol, aether, whether
 hydrated or anhydrous, and in a mixture of aether with Tºth
 part of alcohol; but acetic aether instantly destroys its fibre,
 and dissolves it in large quantity. The solution yields on
 spontaneous evaporation a white powder of the same weight
 as the original pyroxyline, but I have found it very difficult
 to drive off the last traces of the solvent. The action of sul
 phuric acid upon it differs from that exerted upon unaltered
 cotton; for, while the latter is instantly dissolved by the
 strong acid, and charred upon a slight elevation of tempera
 ture, pyroxyline dissolves with difficulty unless the acid be
 warmed, evolving at the same time nitric oxide and other
 gases, and not being charred even upon boiling. With the
 aid of heat it dissolves immediately in a solution of potash.
 By means of these three last-mentioned tests I was able to
 prove the absence of any unaltered cotton in the product
 under examination. The action of other reagents upon gun
  cotton was not so decided; it was dissolved, but not without
 long boiling, by ammonia, the alkaline carbonates, hydro
 chloric acid, acetic acid, both glacial and dilute, and weak
 sulphuric acid. These solutions, as well as the two preceding,
  contained nitric acid; nothing could be precipitated from
 them by dilution or neutralization; and when evaporated
 they yielded only a dark brown amorphous matter. It is
  evident that none of these reagents restore the lignine in its
  original condition; and they do not afford any means of
 ascertaining whether the compound contains the elements of
  nitric or hyponitric acid.
     As there exists a great discrepancy in the accounts given
  of the increase of weight in making gun-cotton, I examined
  whether the length of time it was immersed in the acid liquor,
  or the proportions of the acids employed, were the cause. The
  length of immersion I found to produce no alteration; but

upon employing two measures of sulphuric acid to one of
nitric acid, I obtained a product resembling in all respects
ordinary pyroxyline, yet 42.77 grs. gave an increase of only
24-31 grs., or 56.84 per cent. Upon a repetition of this ex
periment I found the increase to be 59-93 per cent, and again
70.6 per cent. Suspecting from the disparity of these results
that something might be dissolved in the acid liquor, I im
mersed 6.7 grs. of cotton in a large quantity of the mixed
acids, but it increased 4-9 grs., or 73°1 per cent. Perceiving
that I had obtained an opposite effect to that anticipated, I
treated 12-64 grs. of cotton with just sufficient of the mixture
to wet it thoroughly: the fibre was evidently somewhat de
stroyed; the increase in weight was only 6.54 grs., or 51.74
per cent., and the acid liquor squeezed from the cotton, neu
tralized with ammonia, evaporated to dryness, and heated,
gave abundant evidence of organic matter being present.
Lest however it might be supposed that the whole had
not been converted into pyroxyline, it was treated again with
the mixed acids, but that produced an increase of only 0-12
gr. The action of various solvents confirmed its identity
with ordinary pyroxyline, while its solubility in potash proved
that the transformation had been very nearly complete. A
repetition of the experiment gave similar results. It thus
appears that the small increase in weight in the preparation
of pyroxyline takes place when there is not sufficient nitric
acid present to prevent the peculiar action of the sulphuric
acid, namely, that of dissolving and altering it. When how
ever the increase amounted to about 74 per cent., I was never
able to detect the presence of oxalic acid or other organic
matter in the acid liquor; and as no gas is evolved during
the preparation of pyroxyline, it may be concluded that there
is no secondary product containing carbon.
   Subsequently, when Dr. Schönbein had specified his me
thod of making gun-cotton, I treated 1878 grs. of cotton
with a mixture of three parts of sulphuric acid and one of
nitric acid, sp. gr. 1-5, following his directions. The result
was 32.92 grs. of a substance similar to that produced in
former experiments, being an increase of 75:20 per cent. On
another occasion 80-95 grs. of cotton gave an increase of
61.10 grs., or 75'47 per cent. The action of solvents and re
agents confirmed the identity of this pyroxyline with that
obtained in my previous experiments, and I was equally able
to establish the absence of any secondary product containing
carbon.                                     -
   In determining the ultimate composition of pyroxyline
several precautions were found to be necessary. In the ana

522     .             Mr. Gladstone on the
lyses recorded below it was cut into small pieces, and, after
the weight was taken, mixed carefully with oxide of copper.
To prevent its caking together the admixture of a little as
bestos was found useful. This was introduced into a long
combustion-tube, then some fresh oxide of copper, and upon
it again some fused into lumps so as to fill the whole bore for
about 7 inches. Lastly, was added a mixture of copper turn
ings and reduced copper for about 9 inches. The combus
tion conducted cautiously in the usual manner gave the fol
lowing results; the pyroxyline burnt in the sixth experi
ment having been prepared by Schönbein’s method.

   In order to determine the amount of nitrogen the differ
ential mode was adopted, as the method of MM. Will and
Warrentrapp is inapplicable to substances containing this
element in so highly oxidized a state. The same precautions
were taken as in the estimation of carbon; and the collected
gases gave the following results after due correction for baro
metrical pressure:–

   The volumes of the gases represent respectively equivalents
of carbon and nitrogen, and since no secondary product is
formed in the conversion of lignine into pyroxyline, the 24
equivalents of carbon in the former must be found in the
latter. This will give the following ratio in equivalents of
carbon and nitrogen according to the three experiments above
cited :-

   In order to compare pyroxyline with xyloidine, I treated
starch with fuming nitric acid until the whole was converted
into a gelatinous mass. The addition of water then threw
down a white powder, which was subsequently well-washed
and dried. The iodine test proved the absence of all unal
tered starch. The xyloidine thus obtained explodes at about
360°, leaving a carbonaceous residue. It is slightly soluble
in aether, with which it is capable of forming a peculiar com
pound not yet investigated; more so in alcohol, but most of
all in aether mixed with a small proportion of alcohol, or in
acetic aether. It is dissolved by strong sulphuric acid with
out the aid of heat, and by boiling solutions of potash, am
monia, hydrochloric acid and dilute sulphuric acid. These
solutions contain nitric acid, and nothing is precipitated
from them by dilution or neutralization. Xyloidine is also
soluble in strong acetic acid, or in nitric acid, whether fuming
or of sp. gr. 1:25, but is reprecipitated from either by dilu
tion.
   It was also found that nitric acid of ordinary strength (sp.
gr. 1'45) answered equally well in the preparation of this
substance; but when acid of sp. gr. 1-4i was employed no
such result was obtained.     Starch treated with a mixture of
equal measures of nitric and sulphuric acids produced a sub
stance of greater combustibility, and more closely resembling
pyroxyline, but differing from it in being soluble in glacial
acetic acid, and in a mixture of aether with one-tenth part of
alcohol, as also in the action that acetic aether exerts upon it.
 Xyloidine also when subjected to the mixed acids gave a pro
duct identical with the above, as far at least as the action of
solvents can prove.
   Xyloidine burnt by means of oxide of copper, with the
usual precautions, gave the following results. The sub
stance employed in the third experiment was made from
arrow-root.

                 ºOoo, in which the per-centage of carbon would
be 31:37, and of hydrogen 3'70; yet the amount of nitrogen
is somewhat too great, and there is far from being sufficient
evidence to prove the definiteness of the substance itself.
The wide difference also in the results obtained by various
chemists can scarcely be accounted for, except upon the sup
position that they have operated upon very different sub
stances.
   The solubility of xyloidine in nitric acid led me to examine
whether any alteration could be effected upon pyroxyline by
similar means. The most dilute acid which I found to have
any effect upon it in the cold was that of sp. gr. 1414; but
the alteration took place by means of this only after long
standing, and but to a slight extent. Nitric acid of sp. gr.
1'45 however is capable of dissolving pyroxyline, and alters
both its composition and properties, as will be presently de
scribed; whilst fuming nitric acid has not the slightest effect
upon it. The new product just mentioned is acted upon
somewhat differently by various solvents, according to whe
ther it exists in a fibrous condition, or in powder as precipi
tated from solution; yet I have found by experiment that no
alteration in weight is effected by this change of condition.
When in fibre it is slightly soluble in strong alcohol, aether, a
mixture of aether with one-tenth part of alcohol, and acetic
aether; but when in the pulverulent state it is very soluble
in these menstrua, and in glacial acetic acid. In either con

dition it leaves a carbonaceous residue on combustion, is
dissolved by nitric acid, whether of sp. gr. 1:25 or 15, and
reprecipitated upon dilution. Strong sulphuric acid also
dissolves it in the cold, and chars it at a temperature below
180°. These two last properties show that the original pyr
oxyline

          was perfectly free from admixture
                                   * * * *.
                                              withit this new sub
    There occurs a considerable decrease of weight through
this transformation.     In the first experiment 32 grs. of sub
stance operated upon gave 25-82 grs, of the new product; in
the second 43-64 grs. of the one yielded 34°68 of the other.
Now assuming the increase in the preparation of pyroxyline
to be 75 per cent., the weight of the new product above that of
the original cotton would be, as calculated from these figures,
41.1 and 39:05 per cent.
    When this new product, whether in the fibrous or the pul
verulent condition, was treated with a mixture of equal parts
of nitric and sulphuric acids, it increased considerably in
weight, and the resulting substance had all the properties of
 pyroxyline as prepared in the usual manner. 11’ 16 grs. of
the one yielded 13-56 grs. of the other; the quantity that
 should theoretically have been obtained, calculating it from
the decrease in making the new product, is 13-84 or 14.04
grs. Again, 12'35 grs. of the substance as precipitated from
solution gave 1575 grs., the theoretical amount would have
 been 15:31 or 15:54 grs. This result proves the distinct
 ness of the new product from xyloidine, a fact that could not
have been ascertained from the action of the before-mentioned
 solvents.                                                 -
    Whilst engaged in obtaining these results, I also examined
 the action of nitric acid of various degrees of strength upon
pure cotton. By treating it with nitric acid of sp. gr. 1.5
 I obtained a product evidently different from gun-cotton, but
 as it did not appear to be homogeneous throughout, I passed
 on to investigate the action of a weaker acid. That of sp. gr.
 1.45 gave a substance which proved to be identical with the
 product of the action of the same acid upon pyroxyline.
 Upon a repetition of the experiment 68-54 grs, increased in
 weight 14-61 grs., or 21.31 per cent.—a smaller increase
 than might have been anticipated, but which may easily be
 accounted for by the fact that the whole cotton had not been
 transformed, as was proved by a considerable portion being .
 left undissolved by a boiling solution of potash. Nitric acid
 of sp. gr. 1'414 produced the same alteration, but only to a
 small extent, and after long standing. 23.75 grs. of cotton

and increased in weight 13:49 grs., or 56.8 per cent. ; the
action of various solvents upon the resulting substance indi
cated that it was a mixture of pyroxyline and the new pro
duct. On another occasion, when the transformation by
means of nitric acid sp. gr. 147 proved to be complete, 29'52
grs. of cotton increased 9-51 grs., or 32-89 per cent. But in
order to obtain a substance sufficiently pure for analysis 16:29
grs. of cotton were treated with enough nitric acid to dissolve
the whole; the new product was precipitated by dilution,
and the increase in weight was found to be 5'34 grs, or
32.78 per cent. In these instances there occurred a secondary
product containing carbon not precipitable by water.
   When this was subjected to combustion with oxide of
copper, the following results were obtained:—

the carbonic acid. Hence the composition of the new pro

   Under this supposition the increase in weight in the pre
paration would be 41.66 per cent. ; very similar to that cal
culated from the results obtained by the action of nitric acid,
sp. gr. 1:45, on pyroxyline, namely, 39.05 and 41.1 per cent.
   In order to add an additional proof of the identity of the
two substances obtained by the action of nitric acid of sp. gr.
1:45 on cotton and on pyroxyline, and also of the fact that
pyroxyline is reproduced by the action of mixed sulphuric
and nitric acids upon the new product, the experiment was re
peated with a portion of the substance made from pure cotton :
the result was pyroxyline. In the transformation 26-56 grs.
became 38.04: now these 26-56 grs. were produced from
21.81 grs. of the original cotton; hence the increase upon the
cotton itself would be 16:23 grs., or 74.4 per cent., coinciding
with   the amount usually obtained in the preparation of pyr
oxyline.                                        -                  r

woody fibre by nitric acid raised to its highest degree of
strength by the addition of sulphuric acid, 5 equivalents of
the acid combine with 1 of lignine to produce pyroxyline,
displacing 5 equivalents of the elements of water, as indicated.

   In this case the synthetical experiment would give an in
crease of 69.44 per cent.—nearly the amount obtained in the
best experiments. My own analyses however have yielded a
somewhat larger amount of carbon.

    Whilst completing my examination of this substance, my
 attention was drawn to the communication of M. Payen in
the Comptes Rendus of Jan. 25th, where some properties of
“coton hypoazotique” are described. It is possibly the
 same; yet, in order to express its distinctness from pyr
 oxyline, I would propose as the appellation of my substance
 cotton-xyloidine.
    Before concluding I would acknowledge my obligations to
 several chemists whose published investigations on the same
 subject have suggested many of my experiments, and more
particularly to Professor Fownes for the valuable advice with
which from time to time he has favoured me.

June 1 1,      N the Opinion of Copernicus with respect to the
   1847.        Light of the Planets. By Professor De Morgan.
   The common story is, that Copernicus, on being opposed by the
argument that Mercury and Venus did not show phases, answered
that the phases would be discovered some day. The first place in
which I find this story is in Keill’s Lectures. It is also given by
Dr. Smith, in his well-known Treatise on Optics, by Bailli, and by
others. But I cannot find it mentioned either by Melchior Adam or
Gassendil, in their biographies of Copernicus; nor by Rheticus, in his
celebrated Narratio, descriptive of the system of Copernicus; nor
by Kepler, nor by Riccioli, in their collections of arguments for and
against the heliocentric theory; nor by Galileo, when announcing
and commenting on the discovery of the phases; and, what is most
to the purpose, Müler, in his excellent edition of the great work of
Copernicus, when referring to the discovery of the phases of Venus,
as made since, and unknown to, Copernicus, does not say a word on
any prediction or opinion of the latter.
   This story may then be rejected, as the gossip of a time posterior
to Copernicus. If we try to examine what the opinion of Copernicus
on this matter really was, a point of some little curiosity arises. It
depends on one word, whether he did or did not assert his belief in
one or other of these two opinions,—that the planets shine by their
own light, or that they are saturated by the solar light, which, as it
were, soaks through them. I support the affirmative : that is to
say, I hold it sufficiently certain that Copernicus did express him
self º the effect that one or the other of these suppositions was the
truth.
   If we take the first edition of the work De Revolutionibus, which

                      Royal Astronomical Society.                  529
was printed from the manuscript furnished by Copernicus himself,
there is little doubt about the matter. There are but two passages
which bear or can bear upon the question. The first is in the ad
lectorem, in which the writer (Osiander, though even Delambre make
him Copernicus) asks whether any one acquainted with geometry or
optics can receive the Ptolemaic epicycle then used to explain the
motion in longitude of Venus But the meaning of the allusion to
optics is explained in the next sentence, by a reference (and by no
means a fortunate one) to the changes of apparent diameter of Venus
derived from that epicycle; changes which, as they made the peri
gean diameter more than four times as great as the apogean, were
assured to be falsified by common experience. The second passage
is the one on which this discussion must turn. In book i. chap. x.,
after noting that some had theretofore believed Mercury and Venus to
come between the earth and sun, he mentions the difficulty arising
from the absence of the remarkable phase, which we now call the
transit over the sun's disc.    He describes the opinion just mentioned
favourably, referring, not to his own view, but to that of those
others who had held it.      This is not an uncommon idiom: persons
advocating an unpopular opinion are very apt to describe the main
tainers of it in the third person, though themselves be of the number.
But when he comes to describe what he takes to be the necessary
consequence of the opinion, he lapses into the first person as fol
lows:—“Non ergo fatemur in stellis opacitatem esse aliquam lunari
similem, sed vel proprio lumine, vel solari totis imbutas corporibus
fulgere, et idcirco solem non impediri . . . . .25
   These are the words of the first edition (Nuremberg, 1543).
That Copernicus could have answered any objection, either by word
or writing, is impossible, since he drew his last breath within a few
hours of the time when, not able to open it from weakness, he saw
the first printed copy. The second edition (Basle, 1566) is usually
said to have been edited by Rheticus. The reason of this is that the
name of Rheticus appears in the title-page. But this appearance
only arises from the Narratio, &c. of Rheticus being added to the
 edition; and it is only the description of this edition which brings
 Rheticus into the title-page. There is no mark whatever of his
having been the editor; and as the work was printed at Basle, where
I cannot find that Rheticus ever sojourned, and as the latter was
 deeply engaged at the time in his enormous trigonometrical calcu
lation, some proof of his editorship must be given before it is ad
mitted. As the point is of importance, I will notice, that unless
Rheticus had made some stay at Basle, it is very unlikely he should
have edited a work printed there. He did not edite the first edition,
only because it was found convenient to print it at Nuremberg in
stead of at Wittemberg; and it was accordingly entrusted to Osiander.
Now, if ever there were a connexion between two men, and between
one of them and the book of the other, which made it desirable and
even necessary that the first should edite the second, it was the case
of Rheticus and the first edition of the De Revolutionibus, &c.; and
yet no arrangement could be made by which the sheets printed at
    Phil. Mag. S. 3. No. 211. Suppl. Vol. 31.                 2 M

530                  Royal Astronomical Society,
Nuremberg could be revised at Wittemberg. It is very unlikely,
then, that Rheticus should have edited the second edition, when, as
far as we know, a similar impediment existed.
    The third edition, by Müler (Amsterdam, 1617), has no authority
as to the text above that of the second.
    Now both the second and third editions change the word fatemur
into fatentur, thus causing Copernicus to throw the opinion in
question upon his predecessors, instead of directly making it his
 own.    Not that it would be conclusive, even if the emendation were
adopted: for, as I have said, Copernicus is evidently speaking with
 approbation of the opinions which he describes; and it would be
 difficult to say why comperiunt or putant in one sentence should
imply approbation, and fatentur, in the next, should be at least dis
 avowal, if not disapprobation. If Rheticus, who knew the mind of
 Copernicus better than any one, had been the editor, I can conceive
 that stress ought to be laid upon the change of the first into the
 third person as an emendation; that is, I should be somewhat stag
 gered by Rheticus having thought it necessary to make such an
alteration.                                             -
    But, Rheticus not being in the question, as I think, for the rea
 sons given above, the next best authority on an opinion of Coper
nicus is Galileo. Now the latter, in speaking of the phases of Venus,
 expressly attributes to Copernicus the maintenance of one of the
two alternatives,—that the planet is either self-luminous or perfo
rated by the solar rays. Of these alternatives, he says, in his letter
to Velser (Works, vol. ii. pp. 88, 89), “Al Copernico medesimo
convien amettere come possibile, angipur come necessaria una delle
dette posizioni.”     And that such was the opinion of Copernicus is
also assumed by the writer of the note on the Sydereus Nuncius in
the volume just mentioned, and by others, even down to our own
time; as by Mr. Drinkwater Bethune, in his life of Galileo. In fact,
with the exception of the unsupported story mentioned at the be
ginning of this paper, there is nowhere, that I can find, anything
against my conclusion. And it is to be remembered, that Copernicus
nowhere shows any of that acumen in matters of physics, apart from
mathematics, which has often enabled the cultivators of the former
to make steps more than proportionate to their knowledge of the
latter. Ptolemy, the great promoter of the old theory, and Coper
nicus, its destroyer, were both mathematicians in a peculiar sense;
Ptolemy being far the more sagacious in questions of pure experi
ment. Their grounds of confidence are mathematical; and Coper
nicus, in particular, dares to face his own physics (for there is no
reason to suppose he was beyond his age in mechanical philosophy)
with reasons drawn entirely from probabilities afforded by mathe
matics.
   There is much reason to regret the practice of associating with
the names of those who have led the way in great discovery the
glory which is due to their followers. The disadvantage is twofold.
In the first place, it introduces into the history of science an index
error of from one to two centuries; secondly, those who come to in

                       Royal Astronomical Society.                       531
  quire are disappointed to find that they must lower their opinion of
  great men, and are perhaps led to do it to a greater extent than jus
  tice requires. Our usual popular treatises speak of Copernicus as if,
  besides himself, he had in him no inconsiderable fraction of Kepler,
  Galileo, Newton and Halley. What is a person to think who comes
  from those histories to actual investigation, when he finds in Coper
  nicus himself the immovable centrum mundi (only reading sun for
  earth) of the Ptolemaists, their epicycles, and a suspicion, at least,
 of the solid orbs?
     On the Formation and Application of Fine Metallic Wires to
  Optical Instruments. By Mr. Ulrich.
    Dr. Wollaston, in the Philosophical Transactions for 1813, pro
 posed a method of forming wires of gold or platinum of any degree
 of tenuity. The discovery does not appear to have been much used,
 owing, as Mr. Ulrich supposes, to the difficulty of application.
    Mr. Ulrich forms the fine wire by inserting a gold or platinum
 wire in the centre of a silver cylinder of much larger dimensions,
 which is afterwards drawn out by the usual process. When the
 silver wire has been sufficiently extended, Mr. Ulrich cuts it into
 short lengths and attaches platina rings to each end. The rings are
 hooked upon a hooked fork, and the whole is plunged into heated
 nitric acid, when the silver coating is dissolved.
    The artist may now wire his cell according to his fancy. Mr.
 Ulrich's plan seems to be, to hold one end by an overplate; then to
 allow the wire to be stretched by its platina ring, and to fix the other
 overplate. He recommends using a cell of the same material as the
 wire, as, otherwise, a difference of expansion might break or slacken
 the wires.
    On the properties of Rock as a foundation of the Piers of Meridian
 Instruments, with an Account of the Detection of a hitherto un
 suspected Cause of Error in the Edinburgh Transit. By Professor
 C. P. Smyth.
    Some years ago doubts were expressed of the fitness of a rock
 foundation for an observatory. It does not appear that any experi
 ments were made, or that any reason was adduced beyond this, that as
 tremor was unfavourable to the performance of large telescopes, and
 as rock was more capable of transmitting tremors than less compact
 material, therefore rock was to be avoided when choosing a site for
 an observatory. The author or authors of this opinion were pro
 bably but ill-acquainted with the mode of working an observatory,
 or the requisites for obtaining accuracy in meridian observations;
 yet it is certain that an undue importance was attached in some cases
 to these very idle surmises. At the present time it is not likely that
 any intelligent person would be misled by such authorities, and it
 is therefore unnecessary to mention here the mischief they have
 caused”. It is to be wished that the founders of future observatories,
   * The effect of tremor on a telescope is probably familiar to every read
er of this notice. It causes a sort of burr round the object, and destroys
the sharpness of outline and definition. This is probably more injurious in
reflecting than in refracting telescopes; but we may fairly doubt whether it

who can command a rock foundation, should make use of their good
fortune; and that those who cannot, would look carefully to the
possible effects of moisture, which are probably more extensive, and
vary more rapidly, than those of temperature.
    The observatory of Edinburgh is placed on the Calton Hill. This
is chiefly of a porphyritic formation. The apex was blasted away
to obtain a level area, on which the observatory was erected. The
site of each pier was cut away until a sound part of the rock was
arrived at (it was not necessary to go deeper for this purpose than
 six or nine inches), when the exact size of the foundation was at
 once marked out and the space carefully levelled. The foundation
 stone was also carefully smoothed, and then laid in its place with
milk of lime. As the foundation and stone were both rather hollow,
 except for three inches at the outer edge, which was polished, the
 fitting was very perfect. There are no vertical joints, and each stone
 was laid in the same manner as the foundation stone.              As one of
 the principal thoroughfares of Edinburgh runs about 100 feet below,
 and only 300 feet distant from, the observatory, tremors were con
 fidently predicted by the alarmists. Professor Henderson, however,
 found none, nor any interruption to his observations in mercury.
 Professor Smyth adds that he finds no annoyance from the railroad
 about 300 feet below, and at a horizontal distance of 500 feet.
    So far the observatory founded on a rock came out victoriously
 from its ordeal, but Professor Henderson, in the course of his work,
 found a well-marked annual variation of the level of the transit,
 which he attributed to the expansion of the rock.           This variation
 seemed so intimately connected with temperature that he latterly
 took his factor for level correction from the thermometer, having
 found a constant agreement between this and the indications of the
 spirit level. The maximum of this change amounted to between
 0*2 and 0°3 in the value of the level factor, and the variations were
 tolerably regular.
     On computing the azimuthal factors for 1841, Professor Smyth
 is more felt on solid than on loose foundations. In a standard observatory,
  where observations are made principally in the meridian, tremor scarcely
 affects the accuracy of observation at all, unless it is so excessive as to
  change the position of the microscopes, piers, &c. Now this is obviously
 the least likely to happen when the foundation is on rock; the tremors are
  propagated through the substance, without in any respect altering its form.
  Sudden and discontinuous changes, which obey no law, are those only which
 are to be feared in a well-directed observatory. Tremor is chiefly objec
  tionable as disturbing the mercurial horizon, which, however, is now mostly
 used as a verification, not as the ordinary mode of observing; and when
  this inconvenience only occurs occasionally, it can generally be avoided or
 pººl by a little contrivance       or foresight. Unless the adjustments are
   ept in a fluctuating and uncertain state by occasional small oscillations
  (and we believe no careful experiments have been directed to this point),
 they are minor evils. The experience of the Oxford and of the Edinburgh
 Qbservatory is, so far as it goes, conclusive against any danger from mo
 derate gours to tremors in a well-founded and well-managed observa
 tory.—S.

was very much disturbed on finding variations, which sometimes al
tered the factor as much as 0°:3 in a day, and more than 1":0 in the
course of the year. These changes in azimuth had been remarked by
Professor Henderson, and were attributed to the irregular action of
the counterpoises, which were consequently removed. On a com
parison of these errors with the indications of thermometers plunged
in the rock there were apparent marks of correspondence.
   There are several thermometers inserted at different depths in the
rock near the observatory, which had been carefully observed in the
year 1841*. The indications of these thermometers were projected
on paper, and the curves thus formed compared with a curve traced
according to the course of the azimuthal deviation. It was thus
made evident, that the curve of azimuthal deviation, though having,
like the other curves, an annual maximum, did not otherwise resem
ble the curves belonging to the deep-seated thermometers at all; and,
in fact, it came nearest the curve traced out by the thermometer at
tached to the barometer and by the free thermometer exposed to the
outer air.    Hence the cause of the deviation was not to be looked
for in the effect of temperature on the foundations or on the massive
transit piers, but on smaller parts more readily affected, such as the
metallic mounting. These were accordingly examined. In the
azimuthal Y, the construction was found to be much as usual, but
the artist has adopted an adjustment for the vertical Y, which seems
liable to suspicion. There are two vertical screws applied from be
low ; one, pushing, on the north side of the middle, and the other,
pulling, at the south side. The Y is prevented from turning in a
vertical plane by jamming horizontal screws, which press a plate
against the north face of the Y so as to bring the whole tightly
against a stopping-piece, which blocks the south face, Professor
Smyth's present opinion is, that the effect of expansion on the two
screws, which are in contrary states of constraint, is to alter the ad
justment; certainly the arrangement looks unmechanical. In the
ordinary mode of construction, in this country at least, the elevating
Y is either raised by one central screw, or by two screws, one on
each side of the centre; in which case a drawing-screw may be placed
at the centre. There is thus no tendency to twist, and the side
plates which confine the Y laterally have to exert little restraining
force. Professor Smyth has communicated with MM. Repsold, the
makers of this magnificent instrument, and is awaiting their reply
before adopting any remedyt.
   * Some years ago, Professor J. D. Forbes had fourthermometers sunk in
the rock with their bulbs at the depths of 24, 12, 6, 3 French feet and a
fifth on the surface merely covered with sand.
   t Sudden and lawless changes in azimuth forbid independent determina
tions of the azimuthal deviation (which are also the best), viz. from the
consecutive semidiurnal transits of circumpolar stars. The possessor of an
imperfectly mounted instrument must content himself with assuming the
fundamental places of his close circumpolar stars, and determine his azi
muthal error from each of them. This will, with proper caution, be found
quite sufficient for objects not too near the pole, especially when the clock
error stars are pretty numerous, and situated above and below the object
to be determined.

 ON OSMIAMIC ACID.         BY MM. J. FRITZSCHE AND H. STRUWE,
       HEN caustic ammonia is added to a solution of osmic acid in
        excess of potash, the deep orange colour of the liquid becomes
rapidly a bright yellow, and a new salt is produced and separated,
either immediately or by evaporating the liquid at a gentle heat,
which is a yellow crystalline powder.
   The formation of this new compound does not necessarily depend
on the presence of potash or any other oxide, but uniformly upon
that of ammonia; the ammoniacal salt is, however, subject to altera
tion, and decomposes during evaporation.       It is better therefore to
cause a basic oxide to intervene.
   M. Gerhardt remarks that the formula of the osmiamates which the
authors have given requires correction; they agree, he states, with
the formula OS, OSN (M).
   The properties of the osmiamates are as follows: they decompose
by heat with explosion; and several of them undergo the same de
composition when struck. Among the products of this decomposi
tion are metallic osmium, an osmiate, or a less oxygenated osmic
compound. Protosmiamate of mercury volatilizes without explosion,
when heated quickly; and it diffuses a strong smell of osmic acid.
   Osmiamic acid can be obtained only in solution in water. In
order to prepare it, osmiamate of barytes is to be cautiously decom
posed by sulphuric acid, or recently prepared and moist osmiamate of
silver is to be decomposed by dilute hydrochloric acid. After fil
tration a bright yellow-coloured solution is obtained, which may be
preserved for several days, if it be sufficiently dilute; on the other
hand, if too concentrated, it becomes brownish and decomposes with
the disengagement of gas, osmic acid is set free, and a black non
explosive substance is deposited which contains osmium.
   The same metamorphosis occurs when the weak acid is evaporated
over sulphuric acid.
   Osmiamic acid not only expels carbonic acid from carbonates,
but also decomposes chloride of potassium. In fact crystals of os
miamate of potash are obtained, if a crystal of chloride of potassium
with a drop of solution of osmiamic acid be exposed to evaporation
on a strip of glass.
   Zinc dissolves in solution of osmiamic acid, with the evolution of
a little gas; part of the acid is decomposed, and the zinc is covered
with a very adherent black deposit, and flocculi appear in the liquid
which possess the odour of osmic acid. When all the undecomposed
acid is saturated with zinc, the metamorphosis ceases.
   In the cold, acids do not decompose osmic acid or the osmiamates:
sulphuric, nitric or hydrochloric acid may be added to their solutions
without inconvenience; but decomposition readily occurs when heat
is applied, and it is rendered apparent by the disengagement of osmic
acid and by the brown colour of the liquor; the products vary ac
cording to the nature of the acid employed.

   Osmiamates are obtained, either directly by the action of osmic
acid on a solution of bases in ammonia, as the salts of potash, zinc,
and silver, or by precipitating the potash salt by metallic salts, or
by decomposing the silver salt by chlorides.
   MM. Fritzsche and Struve have stated that these salts yield no
hydrogen by analysis. In two experiments the potash salt gave by
combustion with oxide of copper only 0.072 and 0.033 of hydrogen;
whereas 0.34 are required for one equivalent of hydrogen.
   The osmiamates undergo an interesting decomposition by the
action of hydrochloric acid. The products vary according to the
concentration of the acid.    If the potash salt be sprinkled with con
centrated acid, energetic action immediately ensues, accompanied
with the disengagement of chlorine and probably of its oxide; the
hydrochloric acid assumes a fine purple tint, and the crystals of
osmiamate of potash are covered with a crust of small red crystals of
two different kinds; if the salt employed be powdered, and the action
of the hydrochloric acid be long enough continued, all the osmiamate
undergoes this change; the nature of which the authors have not
hitherto succeeded in explaining.
   If dilute hydrochloric acid be added to a solution of osmiamate of
potash saturated cold, no decomposition occurs at common tempera
tures, the metamorphosis taking place only at a higher temperature.
It is then more complicated, the liquor temporarily assumes a red
and brown tint, and soon emits a smell of osmic acid, which is
abundantly disengaged as soon as the liquor is heated to ebullition.
If the solution be evaporated to the crystallizing point, as soon as it
ceases to emit osmic acid, a mixture of salts is obtained, among
which, as shown by the microscope, are hexagonal green tables, green
needles, and another red salt, &c. These salts appear to be decom
posed by water, for they were not obtainable by solution and re
crystallization.—Journ. de Ph. et de Ch., Octobre 1847.
   ON THE PREPARATION AND PROPERTIES OF SOME OSMIA
             MATES.     BY MM. Flt. ITZSCHE AND STRUWE.
   Osmiamate of Potash.--This salt is best prepared by dissolving
solid osmic acid in a concentrated solution of caustic potash, with
the addition of ammonia during the agitation of the mixture. The
solution becomes of a bright yellow tint, and the osmiamate of potash
is deposited in the state of a yellow granular powder.    The product
of the distillation of osmic liquors may also be directly passed into a
solution of potash, containing ammonia and properly cooled; the
simultaneous distillation of nitrous vapours must be carefully avoided,
as they would decompose the osmiamate of potash.
   In both cases, the mother-water which has deposited osmiamate
of potash is to be evaporated with a gentle heat; carbonate of pot
ash may be used instead of caustic, but not so advantageously; the
osmiamate of potash is to be dissolved in a very small quantity of
boiling water; on cooling the solution yields small crystals of the
salt of a lemon-yellow colour; these crystals are of considerable size

when prepared from a cold saturated solution by spontaneous evapo
ration, their form being an acute octahedron with a square base.
    Osmiamate of potash is much less soluble in alcohol than in water;
it dissolves without alteration, and decomposes, but very little when
the solution is evaporated; it contains no water of crystallization;
it may be heated to 356°F. without decomposing, but it becomes
brownish and is rapidly decomposed at a higher temperature, with
violent projections.           -                    s

    Osmiamate of Soda is best obtained from the silver salt and chlo
 ride of sodium; the crystals are prismatic, contain water of crystal
 lization, and are very soluble in water.
    Osmiamate of Ammonia is prepared in the same manner. It forms
large anhydrous crystals, which appear to be isomorphous with the
salt of potash; at 258°F. it decomposes with explosion. This salt
is very soluble in water and in alcohol.
    Osmiamate of Barytes readily crystallizes in yellow brilliant needles
 of several lines in length. This salt is readily soluble in water, and
 explodes at about 300°F. It yielded by analysis—

the formula according to M. Gerhardt being OSO-N(Ba).
    Osmiamate of Ammonia and Zinc is obtained either by dissolving
osmic acid in a solution of a salt of zinc in caustic ammonia, or by
mixing a solution of osmic acid in ammonia with the solution of a
salt of zinc. A yellow, bright crystalline powder is soon deposited,
which is deprived of the mother-water by washings with ammonia.
    This compound is very permanent; it may be dried in the air, and
remains without losing ammonia. It is nearly insoluble in ammo
nia, water decomposes it even when cold; when boiled in water it
is completely decomposed with the deposition of oxide of zinc, the
disengagement of half of its ammonia, and yielding osmiamate of
ammonia. Formula according to M. Gerhardt OSO3N(Zn), 2NH9.
    Osmiamate of Lead.—A solution of nitrate of lead is not precipi
tated by a concentrated solution of osmiamate of potash; after some
time some crystals are however formed, which are not sufficiently
stable for examination. A solution of acetate of lead gives with the
solution of the osmiamates a non-crystalline precipitate, which is at
first of a dirty yellow colour, but it soon becomes of a purple tint
with the extrication of osmic acid.
   If a solution of chloride of lead, or a solution of nitrate of lead with
the addition of hydrochloric acid, be added to a solution of osmia
mate of potash, a yellow crystalline precipitate is soon obtained, which
the authors consider to be a compound of equal equivalents of chloride
and osmiamate of lead.

   Osmiamate of Silver is obtained directly by dissolving osmic acid
in an ammoniacal solution of a salt of silver, and afterwards super
saturating with nitric acid. It may also be obtained by adding to a
solution of osmic acid in ammonia nitric acid in excess at first, and
then a salt of silver.   It may also be prepared by double decompo
sition with the salts of silver and soluble osmiamates.
   Osmiamate of silver is a crystalline powder of a lemon-yellow
colour; it is very slightly soluble in water and in cold nitric acid,
more soluble in ammonia, and may be combined with it. It may be
dried in the dark without blackening, in vacuo, over sulphuric acid;
eventually, however, it suffers decomposition, and then gives out
osmic acid; at 176°F. it decomposes suddenly and with violent de
tonation; it is also decomposed by percussion, and likewise when
sulphuretted hydrogen is passed over the dried salt; nitric acid de
composes it readily when heated; the liquor first acquires a brown
tint, and gradually becomes colourless with the disengagement of
osmic acid.                                  -

    ON SULPHATO-CHLORIDE OF COPPER,-A NEW MINERAL.
                     BY ARTHUR CONNELL, ESQ.
   This mineral occurs in small but very beautiful fibrous crystals, of
a fine blue colour, which is pale when the fibres are delicate, but
much deeper when they become somewhat thicker. Their form,
according to Mr. Brooke, is a hexagonal prism with the edges re
placed, thus belonging to the rhombohedral system. They possess
considerable translucency, and have a vitreous lustre. On account
of the small quantity which he possessed, Mr. Connell was unable
to state the specific gravity, hardness, or fracture. Their locality is
Cornwall.    Mr. Brooke is aware of the existence of only a very few
specimens of the mineral: one is in the British Museum.                 -
   Like atacamite, this mineral colours the blowpipe flame as well
as the simple flame of a candle, of a fine greenish-blue, indicating the
presence of chloride of copper. Reduced to powder, and mixed in
sufficient quantity with charcoal powder, and then heated in a close
tube, it gives decided, although not strongly marked, indications of
the presence of sulphuric [sulphurous PJ acid by the smell, and
partial bleaching of Brazil wood paper, the remainder of the paper
being reddened, doubtless by muriatic acid vapours.       Alone, in the
close tube, it yields a little water, and other appearances resembling
those afforded by atacamite.      Heated alone on charcoal before the
blowpipe, it decrepitates strongly; but when previously deprived

 538          Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
 of the greater part of its water by gentle heat, and then powdered
 and moistened, and heated on charcoal, it gives no traces of arsenic,
 although arsemiate of copper is associated with it in the specimens,
 The residue is a dark reddish slag or globule.
    The crystals are not soluble in boiling water, but dissolve entirely
 and pretty readily in nitric or muriatic acid, especially by the aid of
 a gentle heat. The solutions have the colour belonging to copper
 solutions; and in the act of dissolving a very few bubbles of gas
 may be observed to arise, indicating probably the presence of a mi
 nute quantity of carbonate. The solutions yield, with barytic salts,
 a white precipitate insoluble in acids; and the nitric solution gives,
with nitrate of silver, a white and curdy precipitate insoluble in acids
or water, but soluble in ammonia.       Ammonia in excess, added to
the original solution, gives the fine deep blue of copper.
   These appearances, in conjunction with the blowpipe reactions,
are sufficient to show that the constituents of the mineral are sul
phuric acid, chlorine, copper, and a little water; but Mr. Connell
had not sufficient of the mineral to determine the proportions of its
constituents. The chloride is apparently more abundant than the
sulphate.—Jameson's Journal, October 1847.
ON THE FORMATION OF WALERIANIC ACID.                  B.Y. M. THERAULT.
   The author remarks that it has been long known that the oil of
potatoes yields valerianic acid under the influence of the caustic alka
lies; and it has also been stated that the oil of valerian gave analogous
results. M. Therault thought it would be an interesting subject of
inquiry to determine in what manner this transformation occurs, and
whether it is complete or only partial; and in the latter case to ex
amine into the nature of the non-acidifiable product; whether the
alkalies directly produced a true chemical reaction on the elements
of the oil; and lastly, whether the intervention of other agents is not
requisite to effect the transformation.
   In order to resolve these questions, the following experiments were
performed, care being taken to operate with oil perfectly deprived of
any trace of acid.
   1. A portion of oil was mixed with distilled water, and divided
into two parts, one of which was exposed to the contact of the air,
and the other put into a bottle to prevent its action.
   2. Another portion of the oil was mixed with caustic potash, per
fectly dry and reduced to powder, and divided as in the preceding
experiment.
   3. A mixture was prepared of six parts of oil and three parts of
potash, previously dissolved in one part of water, and the mixture
was divided as in the foregoing experiments.
   The following observations were made on these mixtures. After
the contact of a month, that portion of the mixture of the first ex
periment which had been submitted to the action of the air, had
become sensibly acid; in the second portion no change had occurred.
In the second experiment no sensible trace of valerianic acid was

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.             539
produced; the potash and the oil had nearly retained their original
properties.                                           -             -
   Circumstances were quite different in the third experiment. The
mixture had hardly been made when it became of the consistence of
honey, and of a red colour of considerable intensity : perfect saponi
fication might be suspected. M. Bonastre had previously remarked
this action of the caustic alkalies on some essential oils, and had
proposed it as a means of distinguishing mixtures of them; and he
noticed the partial combination of the oil of valerian with soda. This
fact might induce the belief that this oil was a substance of a com
plex nature; M. Therault is, however, of opinion that this is not
the case, but that the observation of M. Bonastre was derived from
the circumstance of the oil which he employed containing valerianic
acid, which would explain in this case the partial combination with
soda. The author attentively examined the nature of this mixture:
it was perfectly homogeneous, and comparable to crotonic soap.
Treated with water and suffered to remain undisturbed, the oil soon
collected on the surface; it was separated, and the filtered liquor was
saturated with acetic acid. No sensible trace of oil was reproduced,
nor was the formation of valerianic acid detected ; it was therefore
certain that no chemical action had occurred; and the name of com
bination given to this mixture appears to the author to be improper
under these circumstances.
    M. Therault relies upon this last fact as corroborating the result
of the third experiment. The portion of the mixture kept from the
contact of the air, underwent no change of properties after one
month; no combination had occurred between the oil and the pot
ash; no valerianic acid was formed, or at any rate no appreciable
 quantity.                                                            -
    On the contrary, that portion which had been exposed to the action
of the air contained valerianic acid, in minute quantity certainly,
but it was very appreciable: the matter was slightly decolorized.
The action of the air was allowed to continue, and after six months’
exposure nearly the whole of the oil had disappeared, and the mix
ture was almost entirely decolorized, a slight amber tint only re
 maining.
    The decoloration occurred nearly in direct proportion to the quan
 tity of acid formed: the action of the air was however continued, to
 ascertain whether the whole of the oil could be acidified; the opera
 tion required nearly six months, but it was then complete; the
mixture had assumed the aspect of white, slightly grumous honey;
 well-defined crystals of valerianate of potash had formed, and were
dispersed throughout the mass. It was covered with a solution of
this salt and of potash, without any trace of oil.
    It may be concluded from the experiments detailed, that valerianic
acid does not pre-exist in valerian root; that it is entirely the pro
duct of the oxidizement of its oil; that this oxidizement is due to
the oxygen of the air; and that water and the caustic alkalies greatly
facilitate this oxidizement.     The author also concludes that the
caustic alkalies exert no direct action on the elements of the oil;
that they act only by the property which they possess of forming an

540.          Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
intimate mixture with the oil, and exposing it in a state of perfect
division to the oxygen of the air. Lastly, M. Therault is of opinion
that oil of valerian is not a substance of a complex nature, and that
it may be entirely converted into valerianic acid.
   This conversion is readily explained. According to Ettling, the
formula of valerianic acid is C20H18O3 + H2 O ; if that of oil of va
lerian be C* Hºo O*, and if two atoms of oxygen be made to inter
vene, one of which combines with two atoms of hydrogen to form
water, and the other be added, we shall have the following equation:
                  C20 Hºo O2+ 2O=C20H18O3 + H2O.
   M. Therault finishes his memoir with observing, that the process
for extracting valerianic acid, proposed by Messrs. Smith of Edin
burgh-in the Journal de Pharmacie for January last, appears to be
a good one ; excepting that he would propose to use a caustic
instead of a carbonated alkali, and after having boiled the mixture, to
expose it for a month to the air, stirring it several times a day; not
to subject the residue to pressure, and to distil with the roots, which
greatly facilitate the operation. When afterwards the distilled liquor
has been saturated by means of an alkali, and the valerianate of pot
ash or soda has been concentrated, it is essential not to employ an
excess of sulphuric acid to separate the valerianic acid; it would be
better to leave a small portion of the valerianate undecomposed, for
towards the end of the distillation, the organic matter mixed with
the salt is carbonized and sulphurous acid is formed, which appears
to react upon the valerianic acid.—Journ. de Pharm. et de Ch., Sep
tembre 1847.

                    NATIVE CARBONATE OF       NICKEL.
     This new mineral was exhibited last year at the Philosophical
Society's exhibition in Glasgow, and was examined at the time, at
the request of Dr. R. D. Thomson, by his pupil Mr. John Brown,
in the College Laboratory. It occurs in the form of thin green cry
stalline layers, on the surface of chrome iron ore from America. It
 dissolves with effervescence in dilute hydrochloric acid. The solu
 tion is precipitated black by sulphohydret of ammonia; is precipi
 tated and dissolved in excess by caustic ammonia, yielding a cha
 racteristic coloured solution.   Caustic soda precipitates the solution
 green, without resolution. It is accompanied, apparently in union,
 by carbonates of lime and magnesia—isomorphous bodies. The fact
 of its occurring on the surface of chrome iron, and having been mis
 taken for sesquioxide of chrome, renders it probable that oxide of
 nickel may exist in that mineral occasionally.—R. D. T.
    AN ExAMINATION AND ANALYsis of THE “NADELERz,” or
        NEEDLE ORE OF BISMUTH.          B.Y. E. J. CHAPMAN, ESQ.
  THE “needle ore” occurs in thin prismatic crystals, generally forming
 more or less radiated groups imbedded in quartz, at Ekatherinen
  burg in Siberia, the only known locality in which it has been hitherto
  found.    The crystals are too imperfect to admit of measurement;
  but they appear to belong to the Trimetric or Prismatic system, and
  to have for the primary form a right rectangular prism, or perhaps
  more correctly a right rhombic one, in which the angle MM closely
  approaches a right angle.                        -
      The colour of this mineral is dark steel-gray on the fractured sur
  face, but externally the true colour is usually masked by a yellow
  tarnish. The powder or “streak” is black; the degree of hardness
  20 to 25, or between that of rock-salt and calc-spar; and the spe
  cific gravity about 6'1.
      Before the blowpipe it fuses instantly and may be almost entirely
  volatilized, forming a yellow incrustation of the mingled oxides of
  lead and bismuth on the support. The presence of bismuth and
  copper may be ascertained by fusion with “microcosmic salt” and
  a little tin on charcoal in the reducing flame, when the lead, which
   is clear whilst hot, becomes on cooling of a grayish-black colour
  with red patches.      With carbonate of soda on charcoal in the same
  flame, it forms an alkaline sulphuret. The lead is best detected by
   boiling a fragment in nitric acid, filtering, dissolving the residue
   (sulphate of lead) in caustic potash, diluting the solution, and re
   precipitating by sulphuric acid.                                   -

   The first analysis does not admit of any rational formula; but if
we consider the loss, more than 5 per cent, to be sulphur, we may
obtain by a little latitude,
           Cu2S + PbS + Biº S3, or               2[º] + Biº S3,
a formula analogous to that of the kobellite from Ilvena in Sweden,
analysed and named by Setterberg, and in which the electro-negative
atoms in the base are to the electro-negative atoms in the acid as 2
to 3. The following is its formula:—
                              2{ij} + Bes'.
   The second analysis yields also but an inexpressive and unsatis
factory result. The formula, if such it can be termed, obtained
from it is—
  Cu° S + 2PbS + 3BiS, or otherwise Cuº S, BiS + 2(PbS, BiS).
   I have now to enter into the details of a third analysis, executed
lately by myself, on a specimen kindly given to me by Colonel
Jackson, F.R.S., who brought it with him from Russia. The ore
was accompanied in the quartz by minute tufts of malachite, which,
together with the matrix, were carefully removed, by the aid of a
microscope, from the substance analysed.
   8:38 grs. of the mineral in powder were boiled in strong nitric
acid.
   A residue of 4.92 grs. of sulphate of lead remained, and 0.26 grs.
of sulphur. The 492 grs. of sulphate of lead (obtained, it should
be stated, after solution of the residue in potash and subsequent re
conversion) = 3:36 grs. of lead and 0.52 of sulphur.
   Carbonate of ammonia in excess was then added to the clear so
lution; and after remaining for three hours at a gentle heat, it was
filtered from the precipitate, which (after being well-washed with

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles,                  543
the same reagent, and the “washings” added to the original solu
tion) was dissolved in acetic acid; and a slip of pure lead being im
mersed in the solution, the whole was covered up immediately and
suffered to stand for four hours. The slip of lead weighed 22.63 grs.
    The four hours having elapsed, the lead was taken from the solu
tion, and, after separation of the precipitated bismuth, dried and
weighed. It weighed 19°21 grs. ; loss, 3:42 grs. On the addition
of sulphuric acid, 5:03 grs. of sulphate of lead were obtained, which
are equal to 3'435 of lead; and this amount corresponding so nearly
with the loss in the metallic precipitant, the whole of the lead pre
sent in the mineral may be considered to have been converted into
PbO, SO3 by the first operation.
    The bismuth precipitate was washed with cold distilled water
(which had been boiled), dissolved in nitric acid, and again thrown
down by carbonate of ammonia. The oxide of bismuth weighed
2.60 grs., equivalent to 2.33 grs. of bismuth.
    To the original solution (containing carbonate of ammonia) a few
 drops of ammonia were added, and it was then gently evaporated
 until the ammoniacal odour was entirely destroyed. Solution of
 potash was then added, and the whole boiled. The black oxide of
 copper, well-washed with hot water, ignited, and weighed in a
 covered crucible, came to 1-31 grs., an amount equal to 1:05 of
 copper.
    Finally, chloride of barium was added to the potash solution,
 which produced a precipitate of sulphate of baryta weighing 572
 grs., an amount corresponding to 0-79 of sulphur. The whole of
 the sulphur present in the mineral was therefore                             -
                         1:57 grs. (0.52 + 0.26 + 0.79).
    The following table exhibits the above analysis and its atomic de
ductions:—                               -                             -

                       3Cu2S, Biº S3 + 2(3PbS, Biº Sº).
    This formula is identical with that of the bournonite (from the
analyses of H. Rose, Smithson, &c.), substituting only Biº Sº for
Sb2S3, as below:—
           Bournonite = 3Cu2S, Sb2S3 + 2(3PbS, Sb2S3).
    In each ore, the electro-negative atoms in the basic compounds
are, to the electro-negative atoms in the acid compounds, as 1 to 1,
as expressed in the accompanying general formula:—                       -
                                   Cu2S       Sb2S3
                             * {{`s } + i Biºsº }.
    As the bournonite crystallizes also in the same system as the
needle ore, and indeed affects probably the same primary form within
close measurements, the isomorphous relationship of these minerals
is sufficiently apparent.                                   -               -

   Most English mineralogists give a right rectangular prism for the
primary form of the bournonite; but Dufrénoy, in his recent Treatise,
vol. iii. p. 18, after an examination of numerous crystals, considers
a right rhombic prism in which the angle MM = 93°40' to be the
correct primary form. The modified rectangular prism in which
the bournonite usually occurs is in this light a secondary form, de
rived from the primary by the replacement of its lateral edges by
the planes g'h' in the notation of Hauy.
   The specimen of the needle ore which furnished the above ana
lysis, exhibited here and there in the quartz transverse rhombic
sections, in which an accustomed eye might easily perceive that the
obtuse angle was included between 90° and 100°.
   I could not detect in this specimen the presence of tellurium,
found by John in the needle ore; it is however perfectly conceivable
that, under certain circumstances, a portion of the PbS may be re
placed by PbTe,       From the Chemical Gazette for September 1, 1847.
  ACTION OF ANHYDROUS PHOSPHORIC ACID ON AMNIONIACAL
                         SALTS.        BY M. DUMAS.
   The author finds that when anhydrous phosphoric acid is made to
react upon crystallized acetate of ammonia, there distils a liquid the
fixed boiling-point of which is 170° F., and which is miscible with
water in all proportions. When purified by digestion with a saturated
solution of chloride of calcium, and them distilled from solid chloride
of calcium and from magnesia, it still possesses the boiling-point
above mentioned.
   Analysis gave the following numbers:—

                                              99-2       100-0
   The density of the vapour gave the number 1:45. The above
results lead to the very simple formula C*H3N, which differs from
acetate of ammonia by four equivalents less of water. Its composi
tion is similar to that of nitroguret of acetyle.
   But a point of view, which the reactions will warrant, would give
to this substance the following rational formula, C* NH, C*H*, which
would make hydrocyanate of methylene of it, or an isomeric of it.
   The reactions which have been examined gave rise to some curious
phaenomena. Thus solution of potash at a boiling heat disengages
ammonia and regenerates acetic acid ; chromic acid has no action;
nitric acid is not decomposed by this liquid even when heated to
ebullition. Potassium acts vividly in the cold, and with the disen
gagement of heat; cyanide of potassium is formed, and an inflam
mable mixture of free and carburetted hydrogen gases is evolved.
    It is well known that M. Fehling obtained a substance of analo
gous composition to that now described by distilling benzoate of
 ammonia with a naked fire : he did not however attach to the dis
 covery the views which have been now developed, nor did he study

                           Meteorological Observations.                                                                            545
  its reactions., M. Dumas proposes to examine, under the new point
  of view described, the action of anhydrous phosphoric acid on the
  ammoniacal salts formed by the volatile organic acids.
     M. Dumas remarks that if the product which he has obtained
  should constitute a compound identical with hydrocyanate of methy
  lene, all these ammoniacal salts, treated in the same manner, should
  yield athers corresponding to certain alcohols, according to the ge
  neral formula—
               Cn Hn O*, NH3=Cn Hn–l N=Cn–2 Hn-2, C2 NH.
     In decomposing the latter by potash, there might be produced
 alcohol C*-*H*-*, 2HO, and prepared by this method, all the
 alcohols from the fatty acids.-Comptes Rendus, Septembre 13, 1847.
