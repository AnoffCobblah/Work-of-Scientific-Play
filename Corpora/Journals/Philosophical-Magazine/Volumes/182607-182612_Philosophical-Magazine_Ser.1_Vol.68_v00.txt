I.    On the Ellipticity of the Earth as deduced from Eaperiments
     made with the Pendulum.      By J. Ivory, Esq. M.A. F.R.S.*
THE  experiments made with the pendulum are now very
  numerous, and the great difficulty is to reconcile them,
and to deduce from them the best-founded result with respect
to the figure of the earth. Hitherto it has been thought suf
ficient to proceed on the theory delivered by Clairaut,
                                                                           neg
lecting the square and       higher   powers    of the    ellipticity.      The
reason        is,
             that the square       the earth's ellipticity
                                                of                 very small,     is
and    atleast     the same order with the unavoidable errors
                     of                                                                            of
the experimental quantities, and                            in     all
                                                    probability even                              of

magnitude much less considerable than those errors. As this
                            well founded,
                                   be            can hardly           expected          be

to stratum, there must be a small central body which may be
considered as of uniform density, and which, like a nucleus,
will mould the figure of the rest of the mass. This case there
fore is in no respect different from a nucleus, except that it is
requisite to know previously the figures of equilibrium of a
homogeneous fluid.
    There is an essential distinction between the equilibrium of
a fluid of variable density, covering a nucleus, and that of a
homogeneous fluid, which takes place when the particles of
the fluid attract one another, as happens in the planets.                    In
the first case the conditions of          equilibrium      bind  together   the
whole fluid mass between the outer surface and the nucleus.
If  an additional stratum be spread over the external surface,
the conditions of equilibrium cannot be adjusted unless the
whole fluid mass to which the stratum is added, undergo a
modification of         figure. And
                            its                                an

figure  of      surface       order   in  restore the equilibrium. The

                                      equilibrio, we must conceive that

others are so far removed from it that the variation of the
pendulum may be supposed                          great in proportion to the

  tients of the pendulums, the exactness of which will depend
  upon the accuracy of the experiments.             Now it may be af
  firmed that, when the pendulum is expressed in English inches,

  figure in the fourth decimal place, and                           all

    We shall only  add the pendulum at Unst, which has been
determined both by Captain Kater and M. Biot, and which
the latter thinks is one of the most certain that has yet been
found experimentally. The two results, however, are different
•000007 of a metre, or 00027 of an inch *.
   Now if the lengths of the pendulums be uncertain in the
fourth and following places of figures, the same must be true

Neglecting the terms containing N, we have two new deter

obtain from the pendulums          London and Paris.       incer                                            It   is

results derived from these propositions differ from the results
of experiment; and it is so important that the resistances of
fiuids should be established on true principles, that one naturally
expects, the subject to have been investigated with more than
ordinary care. Under, such an impression it is not without

form,      I believe, the only sources of information at present
existing in Europe, respecting the geological structure and
productions of the north and western coasts of Australia.
     In order to avoid the interruption which would be occa
sioned by detail, I shall prefix to the list of specimens in Cap
tain King's and Mr. Brown's collections, a general sketch of
the coast from whence they come, deduced, principally, from
the large charts”, and from the narratives of Captains Flin
ders and King, -with a summary of the geological informa
 tion derived from the specimens.             But I have thought it ne
cessary to subjoin a more detailed list of the specimens them
 selves; on account of the great distance from each other of
many of the places where they were found, and of the general
 interest attached to the productions of a country so very re
 mote, of which the greater part is not likely to be often visited
 by geologists. The situation of such of the places mentioned,
 as are not to be found in the reduced chart annexed to the
 present publication, will be sufficiently indicated by the names
 of the adjacent places.
                         General Sketch    of the Coast.
      The north-eastern coast of New South Wales, from the la
  titude of about 28°, has a direction from south-east to north
 west; and ranges of mountains are visible from the sea, with
 little interruption, as far north as Cape Weymouth, between
 the latitute of 12° and 13°.          From within Cape Palmerston,
 west of the Northumberland Islands, near the point where
  Captain King began his surveys, a high and rocky range, of
  very irregular outline, and apparently composed of primitive
  rocks, is continued for more than one hundred and fifty miles,
  without any break; and after a remarkable opening, about the
  latitude of 21°, is again resumed.            Several of the summits,
  visible from the      sea, in the front of this range, are of conside
  rable elevation:-Mount Dryander, on the promontory which
  terminates in Cape Gloucester, being more than four thousand
   five hundred feet high. Mount Eliot, with a peaked summit,
   a little to the south of Cape Cleveland, is visible at twenty
  five leagues' distance; and Mount Hinchinbrook, immediately
   upon the shore, south of Rockingham Bay, is more than two
   thousand feet high. From the south of Cape Crafton to Cape
   in 1815.   It contains a brief and clear account of the
                                                           <U+017F>º.        of the
   expedition; and affords some particulars connected with the physical geo
   graphy of the places described, which are not to be found in the other
   volumes.
      * These charts have been published by the Admiralty for general sale.
                                                              Tribulation,

16           Dr. Fitton    on the Geology                  of Australia.
  Tribulation, precipitous hills, bordered by low land, form the
 coast; but the latter cape itself consists of a lofty group, with
 several peaks, the highest of which is visible from the sea at
 twenty leagues.     The heights from thence towards the north
 decline gradually, as the mountainous ranges approach the
  shore, which they join at Cape Weymouth, about latitude 12°;
 and from that point northward, to Cape York, the land in
 general is comparatively low, nor do any detached points of
 considerable elevation appear there. But about midway be
 tween Cape Grenville and Cape York, on the mainland south
 west of Cairncross Island, a flat summit called Pudding-Pan
  Hill is conspicuous; and           its
                                   shape, which differs from that                          of

   The land, on the east and south of the Gulf of Carpentaria,
is so low, that for a space of nearly six hundred miles,—from
Endeavour Strait to a range of hills on the mainland, west of
Wellesley Islands, at the bottom of the gulf—no part of the
coast is higher than a ship's mast-head”.     Some of the land
in Wellesley   Islands is higher than the main; but the largest
island     is,

in   heightf;  and low-wooded hills occur            the mainland, from on

and Mount Caledon, on the west side of Caledon Bay, seems
likewise to consist of that rock, as does also Melville Island.
This part of the coast has afforded the ferruginous oxide of
manganese: and brown hematite is found hereabouts in con
siderable quantity, on the shore at the base of the cliffs; forming
the cement of a breccia, which contains fragments of sand
stone, and in which the ferruginous matter appears to be of
very recent production;–resembling,        perhaps, the hematite
observed at  Edinburgh    by  Professor   Jameson,    around cast
iron pipes which had lain for some time in sand".
   The general range of the coast, it will be observed, from
Limmen’s Bight to Cape Arnhem, is from south-west to north
east; and three conspicuous ranges of islands on the north
western entrance of the Gulf of Carpentaria, the appearance
of which is so remarkable as to have attracted the attention of
 Captain Flinderst, have the same general direction: a fact
which is probably not unconnected with the general structure
of the country. The prevailing rock in            these islands ap

above the sea, and that               of the hills not more than from three
to four hundred feet.
    On this part of the coast, several hills are remarkable for
the flatness of their tops; and the general outline of many of
the islands, as seen on the horizon, is very striking and pecu
liar. Thus Mount Bedwell and Mount Roe, on the south of
Cobourg Peninsula; Luxmoore Head, at the west end of Mel
ville Island; the Barthelemy Hills, south of Cape Ford; Mount
 Goodwin, south of Port Keats; Mount Cockburn, and several
of the hills adjacent to Cambridge Gulf-the names given to
which during the progress of the survey sufficiently indicate
their form, as House-roofed, Bastion, Flat-top, and Square-top
Hills;–Mount Casuarina, about forty miles north-west of
 Cambridge Gulf;-a hill near Cape Voltaire;—Steep-Head,
 Port Warrender;-and several of the islands off that port,
York Sound, and Prince-Regent's River;-Cape Cuvier, about
latitude 24°;—and, still further south, the whole of Moresby's
flat-topped Range, are                     all

Cambridge Gulf, Goulburn Island, and the Gulf of Carpen

   York Sound, one of the principal inlets on this part of the
coast, is bounded by precipitous rocks, from one to two hun
dred feet in height; and some conical rocky peaks, which not
improbably consist of quartz-rock, were noticed on the eastern
side of the entrance.          An unpublished sketch, by Captain
King, shows that the banks of Hunter's River, one of the
branches of York Sound, at seven or eight miles from                                                          its

yet been observed.       One large inlet especially, on the south
 east of Cape Lévêque, appears to afford considerable promise
 of a river; and the rise of the tide within the Buccaneer's
 Archipelago, where there is another unexplored opening, is
 no less than thirty-seven feet.
    The outline of the coast about Cape Lévêque itself is low,
 waving, and rounded; and the hue for which the cliffs are re
                             i.
 markable in so many parts of the coast to the north, is also
 observable here, the colour of the rocks at Point Coulomb
 being of a deep red:—but on the south of the high ground
 near that Point, the rugged stony cliffs are succeeded by a
 long tract, which to the              voyagers (for it was not ex
 amined by Captain King,) appeared to consist of low and sandy
 land, fronted by extensive shoals.        It has hitherto been seen,
however, only at a distance; so that a space of more than
 three hundred miles, from Point Gantheaume nearly to Cape
 Lambert, still remains to be accurately surveyed.
                             gº.
   Depuch Island, east of Dampier's Archipelago, about lati
tude 20° 30', is described by the French naturalists as consist
ing in a great measure of                rocks, which they supposed
to be volcanic; and they found reason to believe          ãº   the ad
joining continent was of the same materials”.            It is not im
probable, however, that this term was applied to columns be
longing to the trap formation, since no burning mountain has
been any where observed on the coast of New Holland:—nor
do the drawings of Depuch Island, made on board Captain
                                           º
 King's vessel, give reason to suppose that it is at present
eruptive. Captain King's specimens from Malus Island, in
Dampier's Archipelago, (sixty miles further west) consist of
green-stone and amygdaloid.
    The coast is again broken and                   about Dampier's
Archipelago, latitude 20° 30'; and on the south of Cape Pres
ton, in latitude 21°, is an opening of about fifteen miles in width,
between rocky hills, which has not been explored.                From
thence to the bottom of Exmouth Gulf-more than one hun
dred and fifty miles, the coast is low and sandy, and does not
exhibit any prominences. The west coast of Exmouth Gulf
itself is formed by a promontory of level land, terminating in
the North-west Cape; and from thence to the south-west, as
far as Cape Cuvier, the general height of the coast is from
four to five hundred feet; nor are any mountains visible over
the coast range.
    Several portions of the shore beween Shark's Bay and Cape
Naturaliste have been described in the account of Commodore
Baudin's expedition; but some parts still remain to be sur

veyed.    From the specimens collected by Captain King and
the French descriptions, it appears that the islands on the west
of Shark's Bay abound in a concretional calcareous rock of
very recent formation, similar to what is found on the shore
in several other parts of New Holland, especially in the neigh
bourhood of King George's Sound;—and which is abundant
also on the coast of the West Indian Islands, and of the Me
diterranean. Captain King's specimens of this production
are from Dirk Hartog's and Rottnest Islands; and M. Péron
states that the upper parts of Bernier and Dorre Islands are
composed of a rock of the same nature. This part of the coast
is covered in various places with extensive dunes of sand; but
the nature of the base, on which both these and the calcareous
formation repose, has not been ascertained.
    The general direction of the rocky shore, from North-west
Cape to Dirk Hartog’s Island, is from the east of north to
the west of south.      On the south of the latter place the land
turns towards the east. High, rocky and reddish cliffs have
been seen indistinctly about latitude 27°; and a coast of the
same aspect has been surveyed, from Red Point, about lati
tude 28°, for more than eighty miles to the south-west.             The
hills called   Moresby's    flat-topped    Range,     of which Mount
 Fairfax, latitude 28° 45', is the highest point, occupy a space
of more than fifty miles from north to south.
    Rottnest Island and           vicinity, latitude 32°, contains

 which the existing animals are so different from those of other
parts of the globe. It is remarkable, also, that no lime-stone
is among the specimens from the northern and western shores,
except that of the recent breccia; and although negative con
clusions are hazardous, it would seem probable, from this cir
cumstance, that lime-stone cannot be very abundant or con
spicuous at the places visited.—No eruptive mountains, nor
any traces of recent volcanic eruption, have yet been observed
in any part of Australia.
     V. The recent calcareous breccia, of which a description
will be found in the “Detailed list of specimens,” is one of
the most remarkable productions of New Holland. It was
found, during the expedition of Commodore Baudin, to exist
throughout a space of no less than twenty-five degrees of
latitude, and an equal extent of longitude, on the southern,
west, and north-west coasts”; and from Mr. Brown's speci
 mens it appears to occur also on the shores of the Gulf of
 Carpentaria. The full account which M. Péron has given
 of this formation, sufficiently shows           resemblance     its
                                                                   the                     to

on the shores             of
                     the Mediterranean, the West India Islands,
and     in several other parts                 of

of that rock”.        A calcareous compound, apparently of the
same    kind,  has been recently mentioned, as of daily production
in Anastasia Island, on the coast of East Florida +; and will
probably be found to be of very general occurrence in that
quarter of the globe. And Captain Beaufort's account of the
process by which the gravelly beach is cemented into stone,
at Selinti, and several other places on the coast of Karamania,
on the north-east of the Mediterraneant, accords with M. Pé
ron's description of the progress from the loose and moveable
sands of the dunes to solid masses of rock 5.          In the island of
 Rhodes, also, there are hills of pudding-stone, of the same
 character, considerably elevated above the sea.          And Captain
 W. H. Smyth, the author of Travels in Sicily, and of the Sur
 vey of the Mediterranean recently published by the Admiralty,
informs me, that he has seen these concretions in Calabria, and
on the coasts of the Adriatic;-but still more remarkably in
the narrow strip of recent land, (called the Placca,) which con
nects Leucadia, one of the Ionian Islands, with the continent,
and so much resembles a work of art, that it has been consi
dered as a Roman fabric. The stone composing this isthmus
is so compact, that the best mill-stones in the Ionian Islands
 are made from          butit;         fact nothing more than gravel

render doubtful the opinion generally received respecting the
age of these remarkable deposits, and a full and satisfactory
account of them is still a desideratum in the geology of Eng
land.—When, also, our imperfect acquaintance with the tra
 vertino of Italy, and other very modern lime-stones containing
        º
fresh-water shells, is considered”,     the continual deposition
of which, at the present time, cannot be questioned, (though
probably the greater part of the masses which consist of them
may            to an aera preceding the actual condition of the
earth's  surface),        -it

newer calcareous formations requires elucidation: and, if the
inferences connected with them do not throw considerable
doubt upon some opinions at present               received, they
show, at least, that a great deal more is to be learned respect
ing the operations and products of the most recent geological
                        º
epochs, than is commonly supposed.
    Since it appears that the accretion of calcareous matter is
continually              on at the present time, and has probably
taken    place  at        all
                        times,   the stone thus formed, independent
of  the   organized   bodies which       envelopes, will afford

                                           in

dred feet above the sea, evidently brought up by the surge

of Sicily, and in several other places, at heights too great, and
their preservation is too perfect, to admit of this mode of con

recourse must be had to more powerful means of transport.
    The occurrence of corals, and marine shells of recent ap
pearance, at considerable heights above the sea, on the coasts
of New Holland, Timor, and several other islands of the south,
was justly considered by M. Péron as demonstrating the for
mer “abode of the sea” above the land; and very naturally
suggested, an inquiry, as to the nature of the revolutions to
which this change of situation is to be ascribedt.          From                                         si
milar appearances at Pulo Nias, one of the islands off the
western coast of Sumatra, Dr. Jack also was led to infer, that
the “surface of that island must at one time have been the
 bed of the ocean;” and after stating, “that by whatever means
it obtained          its
                  present elevation, the transition must have been
effected with little violence               or

warmer latitudes. Dr. Paris has given an account of a mo
dern formation of sand-stone on the northern coast of Corn
wall*; where a large surface is covered with a calcareous sand,
that becomes agglutinated into a stone, which he considers as
analogous to the rocks of Guadaloupe; and of which the spe
                 I
cimens that have seen, resemble those presented by Captain
Beaufort to the Geological Society, from the shore at Rhodes.
—Dr. Paris ascribes this concretion, not to the agency of the
sea, nor to an excess of carbonic acid, but to the solution of
carbonate of lime itself in water, and subsequent percolation
through calcareous sand; the great hardness of the stone arising
from the very sparing solubility of this carbonate, and the
consequently very gradual formation of the deposit.—Dr. Mac
Culloch describes calcareous concretions, found in banks of
sand in Perthshire, which “present a great variety of stalactitic
forms, generally more or less complicated, and often exceed
ingly intricate and stranget,” and which appear to be analogous
to those of King George's Sound and Sweer's Island:—And
he mentions, as not unfrequently occurring in sand, in different
parts of England (the sand above the fossil bones of Norfolk
is given as an example), long cylinders or tubes, composed of
sand agglutinated by carbonate of lime, or ‘ calcareous sta
lactites entangling sand, which, like the concretions of Ma
deira, and those taken for corals at Bald-Head, “have been
ranked improperly, with organic remains.”
    The stone which forms the fragments in the breccia of New
Holland, is very nearly the same with that of the cement by
which they are united;—the difference consisting only in the
greater proportion of sand which the fragments contain:—and
it would seem, that after the consolidation of the former, and
while the deposition of similar calcareous matter was still in
progress, the portions first consolidated must have been shat
tered by considerable violence. But, where no such fragments
exist, the unequal diffusion of components at first uniformly
mixed,—and even the formation of nodules differing in pro
portions from the paste which surrounds them, may perhaps
admit of explanation, by some process analogous to what takes
place in the preparation of the compound of which the ordi
nary earthenware is manufactured;—where, though the ingre
dients are divided by mechanical attrition only, a sort of che
mical action produces, under certain circumstances, a new
arrangement of the partsi.           And this explanation may, pro

 THdiversity
         ERE are few subjects on which there has been a greater
                   of opinion than on the laws according to which
 heat is distributed in different bodies, or in the same body un
 der different forms.         To Dr. Black we are indebted for the
 first important discoveries on this intricate subject; and from
 his time, many others, following up his researches, have gra
 dually added to our stock of knowledge. That absolute cer
 tainty is by no means yet attained on many leading points con
 nected with this inquiry, there can be little room to doubt;
 and as an instance of primary importance, it need only be re
 collected what different opinions are still entertained regarding
 the scales of thermometers, or whether the influx of 'heat be
 exactly proportional to the corresponding expansion: many
experiments favouring the notion, that whilst the heat increases
uniformly, the expansion, in a variety of bodies, proceeds with
 an accelerated velocity.
     It had been for some time suspected and even so far sanc
tioned by experiment, that under equal volumes the specific
heats of the simple gases are equal; and more lately, Mr. Hay
 craft seems to have added considerably to the evidence in
favour of the same opinion; though his mode of operating,
probably the most correct yet used, seems to be still a little
 open to objection.
by being first separately diffused in water to the consistence of thick cream,
and when mixed in due proportion are reduced to a proper consistence by.
evaporation.    During this process, if the evaporation be not rapid and im
mediate, or if the ingredients are left to act on each other, even for twenty
four hours, the flinty particles unite into sandy grains, and the mass be
comes unfit for the purposes of the manufacturer.      I am indebted for this
interesting fact, which, I believe, is well known in some of the potteries, to
my friend Mr. Arthur Aikin. And Mr. Herschel informs me, that a similar
change takes place in recently precipitated carbonate of copper; which,      if
left long moist, concretes into hard gritty grains, of a green colour, much
more difficultly soluble in ammonia than the original precipitate.

oxygen into carbonic acid, but of a union of two ingredients
into a compound having an absolute capacity for caloric
equal to one of the ingredients only; namely, the oxygen gas:
consequently the whole absolute heat of the carbon is rendered
free.” Now on this it need only be remarked, that Mr. Hay
craft seems to have entirely forgotten that we are still totally
in the dark as to the absolute quantity of heat in bodies.                                      In
deed, we do not even know which of two bodies of different
compositions contains most heat; and whilst this is the case,
it is no wonder that we are ignorant of their exact propor
tions.   Mr. Haycraft has, no doubt, at great trouble and ex
pense rendered an important service to science, by showing in
a more satisfactory way than had been done, that, under equal
volumes, the specific heats of the gases are equal: but we are
not therefore warranted to conclude that their absolute heats
are equal. That a knowledge of the specific heats throws little
or no light on the absolute, quantity, is plain from the cir
cumstance, that steam, though inferior to water in the former
quality, much exceeds it in the latter. If such be the case
with the same body under different forms, how much   -     more
so of different bodies?

weight of water.     But the quantities of heat thus expended in
filling the two equal cylinders, will be as the above numbers
multiplied by the respective densities of the vapours.            Now
the specific gravity of such alcoholic vapour, according to the
Doctor, is 2-3 times that of steam. Hence the expense of
heat in the two engines will be as 1055.6° to 1115-7°, or 60° in
favour of steam.
    A compensation is wanting in both cases for the heat spent
in warming the glass of the condensing globe, and of the ex
terior vessel in the apparatus.     The steam warmed it 6°5, and
the other 3°.     But these compensations, if of uncertain mag
nitude, are proportional to the ranges through which the glass
was heated, multiplied by the densities of the respective va
pours; that             is,

        VI.    On the Diving-Bell.               By       A Correspondent.
THE        following remarks were written after a conversation
     with one of the first scientific characters of the present
day. That gentleman is so unreserved among his friends,
that I could not readily distinguish my own ideas from his.
He has, however, published a masterly article on the subject
in the Encyclopædia Metropolitana, and is entitled to any ob
servations in which we coincide, perhaps, to more, if worth
                                                       -
claiming.
   There are two principal defects in the construction of the
diving-bell; viz. the want of independent locomotion, and the
                                                   ---          -
impurity of the air:
   I. It is no doubt possible to invent a submarine boat, in
dependent of assistance from the surface; but the common
bell admits an improvement of this nature.        Let us suppose
the frame of a carriage without the body, of sufficient weight
to sink in water.    Let the bell consist of wood, sufficiently
.
light when containing air to rise with the persons in it to
the surface; and let the bell be attached by a rope to the
carriage frame.      The persons inside by winding up the
rope, may draw the bell down to the frame, and can leave it
        at pleasure.    The frame may be so constructed as to
allow the bell to reach the ground; and the frame with the
bell attached, can be moved from place to place, by any of
the contrivances used for putting chairs and carriages in mo
tion from the inside.     This plan is only applicable to a level
shore or   sea-bank;  in other cases the buoyancy of the bell ad
                                                                                  ...i
mits contrivances for keeping it vertical, if the frame should
be overturned. An instrument might be contrived for feelin
the way before
                       it;   if,
                         for instance, two wheels were
with the bell        by
                     rod,
                       a    the rise    the rod  of the bell would        in
show the descent          of
                        the wheels, while     torsion would showits
the descent        of one of them.                                    -
  II.   The impurity  the air arises from the following causes:
                              of
  1.    The vapour generated:—We are told that some stores
for gunpowder          on
                    the continent are coated with sheets       lead,                     of
on which       found that the
              itis              vapour  settles and runs down the
sides, leaving the air dry. This       easily tried, but would per
                                                 is
                                                  of

haps only succeed        cool state
                             ina         the lead and air.    Some
bells are grooved for the same object, but with little effect.
Perhaps              substances, such        are used      as
                                                          Professor
Leslie's experiments       the     on

   2.  The temperature
           air
                               great inconvenience:
                                    is
                                    a                      allowing
the hot    to   escape     the top at            of

wasted.      might

joining water in a pipe; or an additional bell might be used
 of such a form as to expose a great surface to the water, in
which it should be frequently moved about.     It is worthy of
 remark, that any substance which would absorb vapour as
before suggested, would also tend to cool the air. A metallic
 bell by conducting heat more quickly has an advantage over
 wood.
     3. The generation of carbonic acid is the great cause of air
being wasted; air becomes unfit for respiration by a small
 admixture of carbonic acid.         Agitation in water will be of
 little use towards the  absorption   of the acid; lime-water might
 be more successful.
     4. The want of oxygen:—This is generally sent down
   mixed with azote in the form of common air] from the sur
face in barrels, or by a condensing pump; and no method can
 be better where the bell is fixed, a constant circulation of air
obviating          all
                  the former difficulties, and not occupying the
time      of
           the   persons  otherwise employed below.           Air may,
however,        be
                 drawn down from above.          for  instance,    pipe  If                                a

                                    of at

any substance which will yield           the pressure      tothe water.
Some naturalists describe insects which rise and fall                the                                   in
water, and are connected with the surface     tube    variable             by   a                 of

length. Perhaps ultimately the oxygen will      supplied                         be                            a
chemical process from the surrounding water,        from the                                 or

other substance taken down      the machine.         in
I   will add two remarks on the most valuable memoir above
referred to.

VII. Statement of a Plan for making a minute Survey of the
  Heavens and for the Formation and Publication of some new
  Celestial Charts under the Superintendence and Direction of
  the Royal Academy of Sciences at Berlin".
                                Advertisement.
THE   Council of the Astronomical Society are happy in be
  ing able to lay before the members, a plan which has been
suggested for a minute survey of the heavens;–a grand desi
deratum in modern astronomy;-and, in fact, one of the prin
cipal objects for which this Society was originally established,
and which it has constantly laboured to promote.
    The plan, here alluded to, appears to have originated with
M. Bessel, who has himself observed upwards of 32,000 of the
smaller stars, situated between 15° north and 15° south decli
nation. With a view to render the survey of this zone of thirty
degrees more perfect (so as to comprehend many other stars
not yet observed         him or by any preceding astronomer), it
is proposed
                           º,
              that it should be divided into 24 equal parts; each
part containing 1" in AR. And that every person, who is dis
posed to take a share in the undertaking, should devote him
self to a minute examination of all the stars situated in that
portion of the heavens which may be allotted to him:-1°. by
zeducing to the year 1800            all

   The modern celestial charts, by Flamsteed, Bode, and
Harding, contain only those fixed stars whose places at the
time of their publication were astronomically determined. The
number of these, however, has gradually increased from 3000
(marked in Flamsteed's catalogue and the atlas founded on                                          it)

catalogue; the whole                  of
                           which are marked       Harding's charts.          in
Nevertheless, these celestial charts are very far from containing

                         this instrument.     Indeed we can never
expect       to
           obtain charts that are   absolutely   perfect; and      we                         if

   Before the discovery     telescopes such       limit was fixed        a                         by
the power         of

                         added many new stars, remained far
behind the perfection attainable even          his time: and

them      remain contented with noticing only those stars that
          to
were   astronomically  determined; leaving many others un
noticed, which, although     equal brilliancy, had not yet been

nated field,) we shall seldom or never find a deficiency in the
astronomical application of the charts, and shall obtain a re
sult, the surpassing of which would not only be extremely dif
ficult, but would É. prejudicial for obtaining a general view,
owing to the excessive number of stars which it would be ne
     j
cessary to introduce.        But this detail being once attained, the
charts will show us at once any thing new, on comparing any
part of them with the heavens, provided the magnitude of the
star be not less than the limit assumed.          Besides the interest
naturally attached to a more correct view of the heavens ge
nerally, and the facility thereby obtained for many astronomi
cal observations, such charts would also offer the surest means
of enlarging our knowledge of the solar system, by the disco
very of new planets.         Nay, such a result will be highly pro
bable, whilst without such special celestial charts they can
only be found by some lucky chance.                                    -
              there have been repeated attempts towards con
structing charts of this description: and although they have
not been crowned with success, it will be sufficient to enume
rate the causes that have impeded their execution, in order to
show that they are not now insuperable.              The perfection of
the celestial charts to a certain limit can only be attained by
first laying down on a network”, or scale, those stars that have
been determined by meridional observations, in order that                                                       all

    May 19.-A paper entitled “Notes on the Geological Po
sition of some of the Rocks of the N.E. of Ireland;” by Lieut.
Portlock, R.E. F.G.S. was read.
    In this paper the author alludes to the communications on
the same subject by Dr. Berger, Dr. Buckland, and the Rev.
W. Conybeare, published in the Geological Transactions.—
And after some remarks on the granite and mica-slate rocks
of the Mourne Mountains, the Carlingford, and another group
occupying a large portion of the north of Derry (the barome
trical measurement of which is given), he proceeds to notice the
phaenomena of the basaltic range, and to observe the con
nexion of the indurated chalk with the basalt; beginning at the
south near Belfast, where it is underlying and almost in con
tact with the basalt of Mount Divis, tracing it at various points
northwards to Ben Evanagh, and high up in Benbradda, and
describing the gypsiferous marl, having the same dip (30°
 N.W.) and line of direction as the chalk, next to which and
between it and the basalt, there is generally a thin stratum of
ochre. To the south of the line of chalk and resting on the
Dromore porphyry, a highly indurated argillaceo-siliceous
schist is found, passing by various shades into a clay-stone por
phyry, being, however, in       simple state, harder than the basis
                                        its
of  the  porphyry.
    The author concludes,                by
                                 giving his opinion that the den
sity and crystallized structure       basalt,  of not affectedis    the                   by

In the bed immediately above were discovered the scale of a

From the presence of two species of Serpula, the author sup
poses that this series of strata might have been formed in an
estuary.   The shells, from the occurrence of which the exist
ence of marine strata in Hordwell Cliff had been before                                             in

angle   of elevation is continually increasing, and the last forms
the summit of Craig y Cae.
    From hence to the margin of the crater, the space is occu
pied by alternations in nearly vertical beds of soft glossy slate;
of coarser slate, with ochry spots and small cell; of grauwacké;
of porphyritic quartz and slaty pot-stone.        About the middle
of the series is a single bed of brownish-gray rock, appearing
     be ferruginous quartz, intimately mixed with carbonate of
i.Inne.
    The next bed forming part of the summit of Cader Idris,
composed of globular concretions, very hard, containing specks
of pyrites, and melting in very thin shivers into a black glass,
is supposed to be a trap rock.
    After minutely detailing the other beds of Cader Idris, their
position and angles, the author proceeds to a mountain (forming
the northern boundary of the little valley wherein the Goat's
 Pool and another small lake are situated) extending for about
two miles parallel with Cader Idris. This he calls “the stony
mountain.”       It is composed of rounded tubercular crags and
hemispherical bosses of trap, like enormous ovens rising group
above group.       Their surfaces are comparatively smooth, and
                                        .
generally reticulated with veins of quartz (which sometimes
occurs in areas four or five yards across) several inches thick,
of an obscurely slaty structure and adhering to the surface of
the trap. Many of the groups when seen in profile appear
to be of a very irregular and thick            structure; but when
visited in front or looking down upon them, they are evidently
clusters of columns, laterally aggregated, and intersected by
oblique irregular joints.
    The large quarry of sienite on the Tawyn Road is noticed,
as showing the connexion of the trap and of the stratified
rocks; and this is also shown, in a very interesting manner,
on the descent northwards from Guy Graig, the eastern ex
tremity of Cader Idris.
    From these and other facts detailed in his paper, the author
considers it evident that Cader Idris, and the ground between
that mountain and the Mawddoch, as well as the northern
boundary of the valley, consists of various well-known transi
tion rocks, rising in general N. by E. or W.; that the beds
both at the northern and southern extremities are at low an
gles, not greater than 20°: that the intermediate beds are at
 high angles, approaching to vertical; that they rest upon and
are interrupted by trap rocks more or less columnar; that the
trap rocks are surrounded in many places by mantle-form
strata, which in some instances are obviously of the same ma
terials as the trap, and differ only in structure; but which,
                                                         sometimes,

sometimes,  bear a less obvious resemblance to the trap, and
from exhibiting transitions from that to the rocks that com
pose the regular strata, are probably the latter more or less
changed by contiguity with the trap.

    The first of these societies is in active operation. A neat.
laboratory has been established, and the members are devoting
much of their attention to the analysis of minerals. Perhaps
no part of the Union offers a richer field for researches of this
kind than the state of Rhode Island. As the objects of both
these societies are precisely similar, we should imagine that
more would be effected by a united effort, than by divided and
rival institutions.

These experiments were strangely overlooked, and the priority
claimed by Dr. Clarke of England, in a work published in

laer School, recently established by Stephen Van Rensselaer, of Albany,
which bids fair to become a nursery for Naturalists.         It is now in success.
ful operation. Its object is to qualify teachers for instructing the sons and
daughters of farmers and mechanics, by lectures or otherwise, in the appli
cation of experimental chemistry, philosophy, and natural history, to agri
culture, domestic oeconomy, the arts, and manufactures. Mr. Eaton is
Professor of Chemistry and Natural Philosophy, and Lecturer on Geology,
Land Surveying, &c. Dr. L. C. Beck, a gentleman already advantageously
known as a botanist, is Professor of Botany, Mineralogy, and Zoology.
Well cultivated farms and workshops are established in the vicinity of the
school, as places of scholastic exercise for students, where the application
of the sciences may be most conveniently taught. They are also exercised
in giving lectures by turns on      all

of Mr. Maclure, and the zoological communications of Messrs.
Say and Lesueur, will deeply interest the American naturalist.
   23. Linnaean Society. Philadelphia. Instituted 1807. We
believe that the members of this society have ceased to assem
ble for some time past.     It was founded by the late Professor
Barton, whose discourse “On some of the principal desiderata
of American Natural History” was pronounced at the opening
of this institution.
.
   24. Academy of Natural Sciences.          Philadelphia.   Incor
porated in 1818.      Meet weekly.      This active society has      al
ready published four volumes octavo, under the title of “Jour
nal of the Academy of Natural Sciences,” and have nearly
completed a fifth volume.        It has the most complete and ex
tensive library of works upon Natural History, in the United
States, for which they are chiefly indebted to the liberality of
Mr. Maclure, a gentleman equally celebrated for his zeal in
prosecuting scientific inquiry, and his generosity towards those
engaged in similar pursuits.       The Journal of the Academy is
            indispensable to every American naturalist.
   In addition to the means of acquiring scientific information,
afforded by these societies in Philadelphia, the University of
Pennsylvania has a Professorship of Natural History, at pre
sent filled by Mr. Thomas Say.          Dr. Hare is Professor of
Chemistry;     M.    W. H. Keating, of Mineralogy, applied to
the arts; Dr. Barton, of Botany; and Dr. Hewson, of Compa
rative Anatomy.      No salaries are attached to these professor
ships, and they are compelled to give at least ten lectures an
                               -
nually.
   The Philadelphia Museum was incorporated a few years
since, and as a corporate body were privileged to appoint
Professors. . Accordingly the following gentlemen have been
elected, and have already given several courses of lectures.
Dr. Troost, on Mineralogy and Geology; Mr. Say, Zoology;
Dr. Godman, Physiology; and Dr. Harlan, Comparative Ana
tomy. It is gratifying to see in one city, these various efforts
to promote and extend the study of the natural sciences:—may
others follow this good example.
   25. Academy of Science and Literature. Baltimore, Mary
land. Instituted 1821. Arrangements are making to com
mence a volume of their Transactions.                              -

blished in 1818.     The objects of this institution are, as stated in
the public Address, to form an extensive museum of 1. Our
metals and minerals, generally including petrifactions. 2. Of
our indigenous animals, embracing the remains of those now
extinct. 3. The relics of the unknown people who constructed
the ancient works now found in our country. Agreeably to
these views, an extensive cabinet has already been formed,
which is rapidly increasing.
   28. Literary and Philosophical Society. Charleston, South
Carolina.     Instituted      . This society has a choice cabi
net; but has hitherto, we believe, published no Transactions.
The distinguished Mr. Elliot is the President.
   29. Lyceum of Natural History. New Orleans, Louisiana.
Instituted 1825. Recent information respecting this society
represents it as already in a flourishing state.
   The above is as complete a list as I have been enabled to
make out, and perhaps many others are still omitted.               For
these omissions I am not responsible, as it is extremely diffi
cult, if not impracticable, to obtain information respecting our
societies in the interior.  On the spot where I am now writing,
it is much easier to obtain information from Petersburg or
 ’avia, than from Cincinnati, Pittsburg, or Natchez.            I trust
to your superior means of information, for supplying                all

    A  SIMPLE METHOD OF GRADUATING GLASS HYDROMETERS.
                        BY CHARLES MooRE, Esq.
 ASusually
         hydrometers of glass are irregular in shape, they are
               graduated by immersing them in fluids of different
 specific gravities.    But as a considerable number of fluids are
 required, and as they are liable to change by evaporation, a
 different method may be found useful.
     In trying the specific gravities of fluids by a bottle of known
 capacity, we compare together the weights of equal volumes;
 but in using a hydrometer we compare the volumes of equal
 weights; as the instrument sinks until it displaces a volume
                                                                   of

thod of  graduating   a                    the help of one fluid only.
   Water, being the standard, is the most convenient; and as

                DR. F. Fox’s CAPILLARY THERMoMETER.
      The subjoined notice of this instrument is derived from
   “Notes,” lately published at Derby, of Mr. D. Fox's Lectures
   on Anatomy and Chemistry delivered at the Mechanics’           In
   stitution in that town. We have not seen the capillary thermo
  meter, nor have we received information respecting it from any
  other source.
      “This instrument will detect a variation in temperature equal
  to the thirtieth part of a degree of Fahrenheit. The length
  of a degree on the scale of a common thermometer seldom
  exceeds one-eighth of an inch, but on this instrument the de
  grees are more than an inch in extent; and any person con
  versant with small measurements must know how visible the
 twentieth or thirtieth part of an inch is to the naked eye. To
 É.     an idea of the delicacy of the capillary thermometer, the
  lecturer stated, that eight drops of water, at the heat of 200
 degrees of Fahrenheit, were dropped into a pint of cold water (at
 60°) when the quicksilver instantly rose one-eighth of an inch.
 Here the portion of hot water was only a fifteen-thousandth
 part, in proportion to the cold water to which it was added.
 Dr. Francis Fox, in making some extremely delicate experi
 ments upon heat, found that the most minute instruments ca
 pable of being filled in the usual way with mercury, fell very
 far short of the accuracy required by him. Notwithstanding,
 therefore, the great difficulty of filling thermometers of very
 fine calibres, particularly where the tube is excessively minute,
 as in the present instance, the Doctor succeeded in construct
 ing the extraordinary and beautiful instrument then exhibited
 by the lecturer. The method pursued was this: A bulb, or
 ball, was blown at one end of a common thermometer-tube.
 This was filled in the usual way, by applying heat to the
bulb, on which the atmosphere forces the mercury into the
partial vacuum within the ball. This done, the tube was made
red hot in the flame of the blowpipe, and drawn out into a
fine capillary tube: this may be finer or larger, according to
the intended delicacy of the instrument. During this opera
tion, the capillary tube contained no mercury, which remained
in the lower part of the original thermometer-tube, occupying
also the whole of the bulb.        A small piece of writing-paper
was then tied round the       extremity  of the tube, so as to form
a   cavity, into which a little  mercury is poured. . The tube thus
prepared is suspended by the upper end with the fingers; and
              #.
the mercury in the ball being very gradually expanded by
heat, in a           time rises up and fills the whole tube, until
it comes in contact with the mercury in the paper cavity at
the top. Then, if the instrument be allowed to cool, the mer

cury will pass again into the minute tube, and, by cohesion,
will draw an additional portion after it out of the paper cavity,
until the whole tube is filled at the common temperature of
the air of the room. The bulb should be placed in water of
the temperature to which the thermometer is desired to rise,
which will cause the superfluous quicksilver to flow out at the
top. The capillary tube may then be hermetically sealed
and fixed on a graduated scale. The thermometer of this
kind, exhibited on this occasion, was made by Dr. Francis
Fox.”

        OBITUARY.-John TEMPLETON, Esq. A.L.S. &c.
   As neither  the decease, nor the scientific labours, we believe,
of this gentleman,    have yet been recorded in any permanent
medium of scientific information, though some months have
elapsed since his death, we think our readers will not be dis
pleased with the following neat obituary notice of him, ex
tracted from “The Irishman.” Belfast newspaper of Decem
ber 23, 1825.
   “On Thursday, the 15th December, 1825, died John Tem
pleton, Esq., of Cranmore, Malone, near Belfast, aged 60 years
—a man of primitive simplicity of character, and eminent sci
entific acquirements.     The early part of his life was not much
distinguished from that of country gentlemen in general,
being addicted to shooting, and other rural occupations; but
for more than thirty years past, his attention had been actively
and successfully turned to the study of botany, natural history,
geology, and mineralogy. In the first of these branches, and
especially in the more abstruse and difficult departments, he
attained a rank equal to any botanist in these islands, and pro
bably to any in Europe. He was an able and expert draughts
man, and possessed a singular facility in taking accurate like
nesses of vegetables and animals; and by a diligent use of this
enviable talent, he has left an immense collection of drawings,
many of them of the rarer plants of the country; and those #.
elucidating the natural history of Ireland are of unequalled
extent and value.     The modesty of his nature, and a wish to
bring his scientific researches to still further perfection, made

 to  the public; and           on
                                this account, many less scrupulous, and
 with inferior pretensions, obtained fame and emolument, which
 should more justly have been the recompense                       his talents.of
     “As    a  man,   the late Mr.     Templeton     was   highly   esteemed by

 his   neighbourhood,         for  whom,     however,     his exertions were
 often frustrated        by the apathy            of
                                               others, and the want           ne              of

     This month    has been remarkably dry, warm, and calm,

sunshine at intervals.                       -

30th; and the sun having attained and is now returning from
his greatest North declination, the heat at the earth's surface,
after an unprecedentedly dry spring, is powerful. But it is not
only the descending caloric contained in the               angle which
the meridional solar    rays  make with the visible horizon at this
time that causes us to feel the heat so oppressive, but the com
bined effect of the incident and reflected rays, and radiations,
by which we are placed as it were between two fires, or in a
double heat; and so long as the rain keeps off in a peculiarly
dry season, the heat naturally increases, because the nocturnal

  To the Editor of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
     My dear Sir,
        T
       a time when the doctrines of spherical and numerical
     divisions in nature are attracting much attention, it can
not but be interesting to the public to be put in possession of
the latest opinions of M. Fries, who is the founder of the
system of quaternary arrangement, and the authority to which
the most philosophical of our writers upon the subject has
so repeatedly referred.     These opinions are contained in
the Introduction to a work published by M. Fries in 1825,
under the name of Systema Orbis Vegetabilis, and may be said
to exhibit the most condensed and well-arranged statement
of the theory which has yet appeared.
   As the work is at present very rare in this country, the fol
lowing abstract of such part of     contentsits immediately re  as
fers    the principles
        to               the theory may possibly deserve your
                               of
notice.

or disagree with the various theories which have been lately
proposed among ourselves.
   Such points only           as
                       have appeared     me               to         toapply less         to

of them have been omitted.

being themselves resolved into other wholes until the human
mind sinks under ideas of sublimity and subtilty which are
imperceptible to it,-of the universe and of atoms.
     An atom is a whole (an individual), a plant is a whole, the
    earth is a whole, the universe is a whole: hence                things which                 all
    exist are  parts     one    highest

     It is necessary not to confound with systems, properly so called,

complete evolution, but it does not admit of arbitrary altera

      Not that any absolute system can ever be contrived; for I am
   by no means of the opinion of those who expect that a system is
   to be as unchangeable as if it were petrified.

86          Mr. Lindley's   Account         of the Spherical and
  follow in enumerating the productions of nature; but if one way
  is more certain and more facile than another, that is surely to be
   preferred.
     To me it appears most advisable to commence with that which
  is most perfect, most completely developed, and therefore most
   easily understood; and thence to descend to forms of a more im
    erfect kind, and therefore of a more doubtful nature. The
  half-developed portions of the lower forms would never be under
  stood, if they were not more completely developed in the higher
  forms. This is the path which is pointed out both by experience
  and common sense; the idea of a seed is not derived from an
   Uredo, nor that of a vegetable from an Erineum ; but the re

  Verse.
     This is especially true of those lower spheres which bring up
  the rear: the last point of             will never be attained, and
  will never be determined; although our microscopes are daily
  extending our views, the poles of vitality will never be reached.
  It is better therefore to set out from a certain point (the centre)
  than from an uncertain point (the circumference) which may be
  extended to infinity.
     So it is more wise in studying Man, to take our notions of hu
  manity from those in whom it exists in the highest degree of per
  fection, rather than to search over-curiously for a man whose in
  tellect is approximating to that of animals.
   § 13. In a systematic arrangement the higher forms are                    al
ways to be taken before the lower.
     The highest arrangement is always to be taken from the highest
  and most essential characters—from each highest character ori
  ginates a particular section—and           all
                                              the sections which are sub

  and importance.

     Nature      always passing into series
                 is                               polar opposition: hence
                                                   in
 a  dichotomous mode       of distribution    isnot only the most natural,
 but almost the     only  true one.     Logic  and nature, which are ever
  in  accordance, prove this continually.         Thus, for instance, na
 tural bodies are more properly divided into organic and inorganic,
  than, overlooking this distinction, into minerals, plants, and ani
  mals;     so
             also    the distribution
                      is                of vegetables into cotyledoneous
 and acotyledoneous preferable         to that    monocotyledoneous and

  also is the dichotomous disposition, which             the highest value

those which are accidental.
        Hence     it that accidental characters,

former is called Nutrition, the latter Generation. Hence there
is a twofold system of organs; namely, of nutrition and of
multiplication.          But the organs of nutrition are either pre
pared by the mother (Germination), or developed by the plant
itself (Vegetation); so also the organs of multiplication are
either confined to the plant (Flowering) or continued in a new
individual (Fructification).
        There are therefore four primary functions of vegetables: ger
   mination, vegetation, flowering, and fructification.          This is the
   basis    of my    system.

  upon flowering, and almost accidental modes upon the fruit (at

fluence according to the latitude of the experiment.       In this
latter research, therefore, it is requisite to have a number of

     In the latter part of the table the results of some other com
                                             .
binations of the experiments are set down. In particular
 Sierra Leone, Trinidad, Bahia, and Jamaica, are each com
bined with Greenland and Spitzbergen, the most northerly
stations, these being the cases in which the total variation of
the pendulum is greatest and most                      to cover the irregu
 larities of observation.        We may conclude, that in no good
 combination of the experiments, will the ellipticity come out
greater than .00349.          We may safely adopt, as the true mean
ellipticity, the quantity -00333 obtained from the first six com
 binations in the table.
     Captain Kater has determined the length of the seconds
pendulum at seven different stations between Dunnose in the
Isle of Wight, and Unst the most remote of the Shetland
islands, extending through 10° of latitude. The total variation
of the pendulum between the extreme stations is only 035 in.,
which is much too small for safely computing the earth's el
lipticity, on account of the great irregularities of observation
to which such operations are liable. But although Captain
 Kater's experiments, when taken by themselves, are insuffi
 cient for determining the ellipticity of the earth, they are not
the less valuable, because they may be combined with the ex
 periments of others made at a proper distance from them.
 The following table contains the ellipticities obtained by com
bining the length of the pendulum determined by Captain
 Sabine at Maranham, with Captain Kater's experiments. The
pendulum at Trinidad combined with the same experiments
will give very nearly the same results.

 of the day. The total variation of the decimal pendulum be
 tween the extreme stations is 1.74 mm., and to this quantity
the unavoidable errors of observation bear too great a propor
 tion to admit of many safe determinations of the ellipticity by
different combinations of the experiments.        In order to com
bine these    experiments  with that of Captain  Sabine at Maran
ham, it is necessary to reduce the sexagesimal pendulum in
English inches, or rather the equatorial pendulum 39.01175

            these equations
 usually employed in this research, it is necessary to explain
 the reason of departing from the common method.         The aim

 length of every pendulum exactly if it can be done, otherwise

 of L and that would satisfy the case of every pendulum, if

 Here the errors are very small. And it appears from both
 methods of calculation that, in this set of experiments, the
 discrepancies   are contained within very narrow limits.               The
 resulting ellipticity is -00329, which is exactly the mean quan
 tity found by the first method.
     As this second method of calculation has been found to
 agree exactly with the first in two sets of experiments, we
 may presume that there will be the same perfect agreement
 in the third set. To save         -    calculation we may, therefore, de

THE
  cupied by a certain quantity         of gas or air are found to
be in an inverse ratio of the degrees of pressure which they

very small degrees of pressure only. Several men of science
of the first class have assumed this law as being applicable to
every degree of pressure, in exact conformity with nature:
others, and among these Jacob Bernoulli and Euler, enter
tained the opinion that the spaces decrease in a smaller pro
gression than that in which the pressure is increased; and                                            if,

extent of the Mariottic law, to serve us for a basis. The ap

    The tube GH was lengthened for high pressures by our
 joining together several tubes seven feet in length or more, by
 means of iron screws.                     was always made in

 the hall near the stairs of the house containing  the cabinet of
 natural philosophy of the university; there being no room
 high enough for the lengthened tube GH.
    Several of the experiments we made, agreed in their results
 with the Mariottic law: but a similar success did not attend
 the whole of them, owing to the difficulty of making        the                           all
 cemented joints and screws resist the great pressure which
 forces the mercury into them.

     It
      is very difficult in these experiments to determine with
accuracy the volume of the inclosed column of air, it being
limited below by a curved plane, the form of which varies ac
cording to the friction between the mercury and the glass.
We endeavoured, however, to divide this curve by the eye,
into two equal portions; nevertheless it is proved by the re
sult that we calculated the inclosed air too low. Without this
 error, the differences would have been smaller, and the num
 bers sometimes higher, sometimes lower.              But still the dif
 ferences are smaller than could have been          expected  in experi
 ments which    preclude   the use of the vernier.
    In the last experiments, for instance, the height of the ob
served column of air amounted to 56.4 millimetres; according
to the Mariottic law, it should have been 56°287; the whole
difference, therefore, is no more then 0°113 millimetres, an
error which in such experiments is quite inevitable. In the
preceding one, the height of the observed column was =63:17
millimetres, which, according to the Mariottic law, should
have been =63.99. This difference, the greatest we have had,
amounts to 0-82 millimetre; but being between two observa
tions which offer but a very small deviation, it will not militate
against the general law.
    In order to investigate the compression of the air by greater
powers, we made use of the air-gun: the King, whose en
lightened generosity has already done so much for the ad
vancement of science, having placed              the requisite appara
                                                     all
tus   at  our disposal.    Every     one knows that        this kind
                                                                  in                   of
weapon,    it   the but-end which
                is                          the reservoir
                                              is               the com of
pressed air.     This part,  therefore,      always
                                               is    made  very   strong.
 We first ascertained the inner        space       one of         by

of   the mercury         of
                      the barometer.         We were also enabled                     to

                 weight the degree         density we obtained

experiments may be, and must be from their very nature, they
contribute to prove that the compressions produced by very
great powers, are regulated by the same laws as those pro
duced by very low powers. But wishing to ascertain whether
the compression of every kind of gas was subject to the same
law, we selected such of the gases as are liable by the pressure
of a few atmospheres to be changed into a dewy liquid, par
ticularly the sulphurous acid gas, which, (according to Fara
day,) becomes such a liquid under the pressure of two atmo
spheres.
   Two glass tubes of equal sizes, the one filled with well dried
        j
sulphurous acid gas, the other with atmospheric air, were
placed in a small basin of mercury and put into an apparatus
by means of which these gases could be exposed to the proper
  ressure. The result was, that both volumes were diminished
in a constantly equal ratio, till the moment when the sulphu
                                                                                                   }

         table shows that the differences are very small, and
        This
that sometimes one, and sometimes the other of the gases, suf
fers a greater degree of condensation, up to a pressure of 2:3
atmospheres, where they become greater, and the sulphurous
acid gas shows continually a superior density.  At a pressure
of  3-2689 the moisture begins to be visible, and the conden
sation shows itselfin a much more violent and decided manner.
Perhaps some small liquefaction takes place before it reaches
this point, where the gases come in contact with the glass and
the mercury, for the contact with a heterogeneous body seems
to favour the transition from one state of aggregation into an
                  I
other, as have shown in a former treatise on some experi
ments        of Winterl’s”.
      some experiments we found that the water had pene
        In
trated between the sides of the tubes and the mercury.      This
inconvenience was   subsequently   obviated by our cementing the
extremity of the tube into a brass ring, which amalgamates with
the mercury, and prevents the water from penetratingt.
   We also compressed cyanogen in the same manner, and
                                                                                  jºint
found that the liquefaction of this gas begins when the air has
been compressed to 1-3.5 of        weight,    23°            its

    PROP. 2.-The quantity of motion impressed on a fluid by
a  body  moving in it must be estimated in a direction perpen
dicular to the resisted surface, whatever may be the direction
of the motion of the body.
    The resistance on a surface is composed of the force which
moves the fluid in the direction of its motion, and the re
sistance to reflection; the resultant of these forces is perpen
dicular to the surface; but the whole action to displace the
fluid being measured by the resultant, the velocity of displace
ment must be estimated in the same direction: hence the quan
tity of motion impressed being in the direction of the resultant
is perpendicular to the surface.
   PRop. 3.-The direct velocity of a body is to the velocity of
any part of that body in a direction perpendicular to         sur                                          its

triangle, numerous as they were, had been so often examined,

of aspect, that little really novel appeared likely to result from
any inquiries, however well directed or vigorously pursued.

            especially on the north-west coast, are yet sufficiently
  istinct to indicate a probable connexion with the geological
structure of the country; since the coincidence of           ranges
of coast with the direction of the   strata, is a fact of very  fre
quent occurrence in other parts of the globe+.        And it is ob
servable that considerable uniformity exists in the specimens,
from the different places in this quarter of New Holland which
have been hitherto examined; sandstone like that of the older
formations of Europe occurring generally on the north and
north-west coasts, and appearing to be extensively diffused on
the north-west of the Gulf of Carpentaria, where it reposes
upon primitive rocksf.
    The horn-like projection of the land, on the east of the
Gulf of Carpentaria, is a very prominent feature in the general
map of Australia, and may possibly have some connexion with
the structure just pointed out. The western shore of this horn,

low; while the land on the east coast rises in proceeding to
wards the south, and after passing Cape Weymouth, latitude

the north-west, at the distance of about 300 miles, is also nearly straight,

mountainous range, of which that island consists, being probably more than
9000 feet high; and                   its

12° 30',       is in general mountainous                and          and Captain
King's specimens from the north-east coast, show that granite
is found in so many places along this line, as to make it pro
bable that primitive rocks may form the general basis of the
country in that quarter; since a lofty chain of mountains is
continued on the south of Cape Tribulation, not far from the
shore, throughout a space of more than five hundred miles.
It would carry this hypothesis too far, to infer that these pri
mitive ranges are connected with the mountains on the west
of the English settlements near Port Jackson, &c., where Mr.
Scott has described the coal-measures as occupying the coast
from Port Stevens, about lat. 33° to Cape Howe, lat. 37°, and
as succeeded, on the eastern ascent of the Blue Mountains, by
sand-stone, and this again by primitive strata”:—But it may
be noticed, that Wilson's Promontory, the most southern point
of New South Wales, and the principal islands in Bass's Straits,
contain granite; and that primitive rocks occur extensively in
Van Diemen's Land.
   The uniformity of the coast lines is remarkable also in some
other quarters of Australia; and their direction, as well as that
of the principal openings, has a general tendency to a course
from the west of south to the east of north. This, for exam
ple, is the general range of the south-east coast, from Cape
Howe, about lat. 37°, to Cape Byron, lat. 29°, or even to
 Sandy Cape, lat. 25°; and of the western coast, from the south
of the islands which enclose Shark's Bay, lat. 26°, to North
west Cape, about lat. 22°.—From Cape Hamelin, lat. 34° 12,
to Cape Naturaliste, lat. 33° 26', the coast runs nearly on the
meridian. The two great fissures of the south coast, Spencer's,
and St.Vincent's Gulfs, as well as the great northern chasm of
the Gulf of Carpentaria, have a corresponding direction; and
 Captain Flinders (Chart 4.) represents a high ridge of rocky
                    º
and barren mountains, on the east of Spencer's Gulf, as con
tinued, nearly from north to south, through a space of more
than one hundred geographical miles, between latitude 32° 7'
and 34°.—Mount Brown, one of the summits of this ridge,
about latitude 32° 30', being visible at the distance of twenty
leagues.

must not be     forgotten, that the distance between these shores

however, future researches should confirm the indications above

(whatever theory be formed to explain it,) to be established by
              observation in so many other parts of the world,—
that the outcrop of the inclined beds, throughout the stratified
portion of the globe, is every where parallel to the longer
ridges of mountains,—towards which, also, the elevation of
the strata is directed. But in the present state of our informa

closing a few small crystals of reddish felspar and of quartz.
This specimen is marked “general character of the rocks at
 Percy Island,” and very much resembles the compact felspar
of the Pentland Hills      near Edinburgh, and of Saxony. Coarse
porphyritic conglomerate, of a reddish hue. Serpentine. A trap
like compound, with somewhat the aspect of serpentine, but
yielding with difficulty to the knife.—This specimen has, at
first sight, the appearance of a conglomerate, made up of por

coloured parts are not otherwise distinguishable in the fracture:
—It very strongly resembles a rock which occurs in the trap

 cimen                  is friable, of a light flesh-red colour, and
apparently composed of the debris of granite.          A  crystalline
rock, consisting of greenish-gray hornblende, with a very small
proportion of felspar (Hornblende rock?).-Fragment, appa
rently from a columnar mass, of a stone intermediate between
clink-stone and compact felspar.
    Such of the English Company's Islands as were examined
by Captain Flinders, are stated by him to consist, in the up
per part, of a grit, or sand-stone, of a close texture; the lower
part being argillaceous, and stratified, and “separating into
pieces of a reddish colour, resembling flat tiles.” The strata
dip to the west, at an angle of about 15°.
    South-west bay of GoulBURN’s souTH ISLAND, two hun
dred and fifty miles west of the Gulf of Carpentaria, (Narra
tive, i. p. 64.)—Coarse-grained reddish quartzose conglomerate
and sand-stone; resembling the older sand-stones of England
and Wales, and especially the “mill-stone grit” beneath the
coal formation. Fine grayish-white pipe-clay; of which about
thirty feet in thickness were visible, apparently above the sand
stone last mentioned.       Coarse-grained ferruginous sand-stone,
containing fragments of quartz, from above the pipe-clay.—The
appearance of the cliff from which these specimens were taken,
is represented in the view of the bay, on the south of Goul
burn Island, (vol. i. p. 66); and a distant head in the view
consists   of the same materials.
    SIMMs's Island, on the west of Goulburn's south Island,
(Narrative, i. p. 70)—is composed of a reddish conglomerate,
nearly identical with some of the specimens above mentioned.
    The western side of LETHBRIDGE BAY, on the north of
MELVILLE ISLAND, consists of a range of cliffs like those at
Goulburn's Island; the upper part being red, the lower white
and composed of pipe-clay. The western extremity of BA
THURST IsIAND, between CAPE HELVETIUS and CAPE Four
 croy, is also formed of cliffs of a very dark red colour.

 sand-stone; from a stratum which dips to the south-east, at an
 angle of about ten or fifteen degrees.       Micaceous and argil
 Jaceous fissile sand-stone, of purplish and greenish hues, in
 patches, or occasionally intermixed;—precisely resembling the
 rock of Brecon, in South Wales, and, generally, the “old red
sand-stone” of the vicinity of Bristol and the confines of Eng
 land and Wales. Fine-grained thin-slaty sand-stone, resembling
 certain beds of the coal formation, or of the millstone grit, is
found in large masses, under an “argillaceous        -   cliff,” on the
 north side of Lacrosse Island.
    The specimens from the interior of Cambridge Gulf are from
ADolphus IsLAND, and consist of reddish and gray sand-stone,
more or less decomposed.

   The cementing lime-stone in the rock of this island, is very
like some of the more compact portions of the stone of Guada
loupe, which contains the human skeletons, the hardness and
fracture being nearly the same in both.    The chief difference
of these rocks seems to arise from the nature of the cemented
substances; which, in the Gaudaloupe stone, being themselves
calcareous, are incorporated, or melted as it were, into the
cement, by insensible gradation +; while the quartzose sand,

 imbedded fragments in the latter consist           of lime-stone, their
 union with the cement is complete.
    RottNest Island,        about four hundred and fifty miles south
 of Dirk Hartog's Island.—Indistinct specimens containing nu
 merous fragments of shells, in a calcareous cement; the sub
 stance of these shells has at first sight the appearance of cal
 cedony, and is harder than ordinary carbonate of lime.
    The characters of the shells in Captain King's specimens
from this place are indistinct; but the specimens at the Jardin
du Roi, which, there is reason to suppose, have come from this
part of the coast, contain shells of several species,           belonging
among others to the genera, corbula, chama, cardium, por
cellanea, turbo, cerithium.          M. Prevost, to whom am      I      in
debted for this account, observes, that notwithstanding the re
cent appearance of the shells, the beds which contain them are
stated to occur at a considerable height above the sea: and he
remarks that the aspect of the rock is very like that of the
shelly deposite of St. Hospice, near Nice.
    KING GEORGE’s Sound, on the south coast, east of south
from Cape Leeuwin.—Beautifully white and fine quartzose sand,
from the sea-beach.        Yellowish gray granite, from Bald-head.
Two varieties of a calcareous rock, of the same nature with that
of Dirk Hartog's Island; consisting of particles of translucent
quartzose sand, united by a cement of yellowish or cream
coloured carbonate of lime, which has a flat conchoidal and
splintery fracture, and is so hard as to yield with difficulty
to the knife. In this compound, there are not any distinct
angular fragments as in the stone of Dirk Hartog's Island;
but the calcareous matter is very unequally diffused.
    A third form in which this recent calcareous matter appears,
                                                        j.
is that of irregular, somewhat tortuous, stem-like bodies, with
a rugged sandy surface, and from half an inch to an inch in
diameter; the cross fracture of which shows that they are com
posed of sand, cemented by carbonate of lime, either uniformly
mixed throughout, or forming a crust around calcareous mat
ter of a spongy texture; in which latter case they have some
resemblance to the trunks or roots of trees.—A mass, which
seems to have been of this description, is stated to have come
from a height of about two hundred and fifty feet above the
sea, at Bald-head, on the South Coast of Australia.                 These
specimens, however, do not really exhibit any traces of organic
structure; and so nearly resemble the irregular
cretions produced by the passage of calcareous or ferruginous

bring up a very fine quartzose-sand, like that cemented in the breccia.

solutions through sand *, that they are probably of the same
origin; indeed the central cavity of the stalactite still remains
open in some of the specimens of this kind from Sweer's Island
in the Gulf of Carpentaria. The specimens from Madeira, pre
sented to the Geological Society by Mr. Bowdich, and de
scribed in his notes on that island+, appear upon examination
to be of the same character.—But there is no reason to suppose
that the trunks of trees, as well as other foreign substances,
may not be thus incrusted, since various foreign bodies, even
of artificial production, have been so found. Professor Buck
land has mentioned a specimen of concreted limestone from
St. Helena, which contains the recent shell of a bird's eggf;
and M. Péron states that, in the concretional limestone rock
of the South Coast of New Holland, the trunks of trees occur,
with the vegetable structure so distinct as to leave no doubt as
to their natures.

is 28° 5'9, with a probable error not exceeding 6'-9.
   M. Struve has detected no trace of a division of the rin
into many parts; but he observes that the outer ring is                                ºft
less brilliant than the inner. The five longest-known satellites
are readily distinguished, through Fraunhofer's telescope, even
in the illuminated field. The 4th appears like a small disc,
diameter 0"-75.     M. Struve saw the 6th several times; but
he has never seen the 7th ; of whose existence indeed Schröe
ter entertains doubts.

   Schröeter and Harding have often imagined that they have

thought the diameter which extended from 61°4 lat. preceding
S.   to61°4 lat. following N., was obviously smaller than the
ellipsis would allow. But the micrometric measurement proved
that that was not the case. That evening the major axis,                                  A,
was 44".75; the minor axis,              B,

the             position of the axes of the ellipse with regard to
the vertical circle which causes this illusion.

         On contemporaneous Meteorological Observations.                                 153
  Sir, In the Edinburgh Journal of Science, published in
June, one of the articles of scientific intelligence is on Me
teorology, originating with the Royal Society of Edinburgh;
with a request that observations might be made in different
parts of England, and on the Continent, on the barometer,
thermometer, raingauge, &c. on the 17th of July at every hour
of the   day.
  Being aware of the importance of such simultaneous obser
vations for determining the relative altitude of the places of
observation, as well as other points connected with the physi
cal constitution of the atmosphere, and not seeing a notice of
such an object in any other periodical work, or in the news
papers, I took the liberty to request the editor of the Courier
to admit a notice to that effect in that paper, which was very
liberally complied with.
   In consequence of this notice I have received several com
munications from different parts of Great Britain; and                                       al
though much praise is due to the gentlemen who took the
trouble to register the hourly state of their instruments, it is
to be regretted that many of them were only entered to two
places of decimals instead of three, which in good barometers
may be done; which, when connected with observations on
the temperature of the air, and the degree of moisture by some
instrument that will enable us to find the dew point, afford data
for determining the relative heights of the stations with tole
rable accuracy, and may serve, if occasionally repeated, to
furnish a table of the real altitude of every place of consequence
in Great Britain, and thereby supply the defect in            our geo       all
graphical books; which,         defining the position

                      MAJOR LAING-AFRICA.                   -
   Dispatches have been received at the Colonial Office, dated
18th June, from Mr. Warrington, British Consul at Tripoli.
These dispatches, we are delighted to state, announce the
arrival of our intrepid countryman, Major Laing, at the great
 centre of African internal commerce, the long-sought city of
Timbuctoo.       The date of his arrival is not stated, but from
the time he left Twat, it was probable that it took place about
the beginning of February.       The next caravan which arrives
at Tripoli from Timbuctoo will bring us further accounts from
our enterprising travelier regarding his future movements.   If
he proceeded down the river Niger as expeditiously as he
could, we may soon expect to hear of his arrival in England.
The reports of the dispersion of the caravan with which he was
travelling after it had left Twat, and which had reached this
country through a respectable channel, are thus, we rejoice to
say, falsified.   Inured to the African climate, and arriving
at Timbuctoo early in the dry season, we consider every
danger to Major Laing as over. The navigable current of
the Niger will rapidly bear him, we think, to the Atlantic,
through countries and powers deeply impressed with the
majesty and fame of Great Britain.        Two British travellers
are at present in the heart of Northern Africa, to which they
have advanced from opposite points.       No later advices have
been received from Clapperton than those which announced

route and progress to Sackatoo. On the 7th of March he

was at Katangah, the capital of Yarba or Yarriba, a country
bordering on Nyffe; from whence he was preparing to set out
 for Kiama, and from thence to Wauwa and Youri (distant
four        journey from Wauwa); thus passing the places where
our unfortunate countryman Park was lost. Katangah is stated
to be 30 miles east of the Niger:-Important information he
must, of course, have obtained there; but still more im
portant information he of course obtained, and has no doubt
generally transmitted to this country, in his advance to   Ka
tangah, and in his further advance northwards;—because in
that route, and in the latter space, he must have crossed the
         and passed Nyffe, at that point where some will have

    Among the natural phaenomena of the present hot and dry .
summer, the numerous instances of the combustion of exten
sive tracts of bog and moor seem worthy of being investigated
and recorded. We should have been glad to have been enabled
to furnish our readers with authentic details; but shall at pre
sent only note the following, which have been mentioned in
the public journals during June and July.
                                                            T    -
    In Yorkshire the moors are stated to have been on fire in
the neighbourhood of Sheffield and other places.
    In Staffordshire, and in the Cambridgeshire Fens the ground .
is also said to be on fire.
    In Scotland the moors have been extensively on fire, and
some tracts of forest.     The Dumfries Courier notices some
disastrous conflagrations of this kind near Lochnagar.
    In Holland the fens and moors have been burning to a con
siderable extent.
    From Sweden there are accounts of extensive conflagrations
of the moors and timber forests.
   The Etoile under the head of “Petersburg, July 14,” states
that the marshes around that city are on fire: the ground
being turf covered with furze.
    We extract two accounts which appear to be the most de
scriptive and interesting.
   “Fires upon the Moors.-The conflagrations upon the Moors
still continue, and without abundant rain they are not likely to
be speedily extinguished.       Large tracts of sheep-walk have
been entirely destroyed, and the hopes of those sportsmen
who proposed to make the West-Riding Moors their field of
fame are annihilated.     The fires have not only spread over a
wide extent of surface, but burn to a great depth, consuming
not only the moss but the peat underneath. In some places,
where they reach a soft substratum, they run to a great length
under ground, and break out at the surface at other spots.
 The flames and smoke together, present a most formidable

of them can be obtained.—As some particular account of the
extent of the devastation must be interesting to our readers,
we have taken pains to ascertain the real state of the confla
grations; and the following is the result: Hawkesworth Moor
is entirely destroyed. On Ilkley Moor 500 acres are burnt.
There is no hope of any part of Bingley Moor being saved.
Burley Moor is on fire, and is partly consumed.            Thornton
 Moor is   entirely  destroyed  and with it      the       all
                                                       young   planta

                                       these must       entirely conbe

the causes of the fire may be discovered in the extraordinary
dryness of the season, and in the lightning which we have

   The occurrence of so many cases of combustion of the
earth's surface at so many points distant from each other,
during the same season, will probably lead to some general          in
quiry into the subject. With this view we have thus briefly called
the attention of our readers to it; and shall further refer them
to some instances probably of similar phaenomena in former
times, recorded in the Saxon Chronicle, to which our atten

    The first part of this month was dry, but during the latter
part we had frequent showers of rain, which were very re
freshing and beneficial to the fruits and vegetation after so
long a drought.     Dry and hot weather has not only been ex
perienced in this country for the last two months, but in several
more northerly parts of Europe, as Denmark, Sweden, &c.,
also in America. . Although we have had several hot sultry
days and nights this month, yet the heat in the sun's rays has
not been so great as at the close of last month: but from the
dryness of the spring and summer so far, we do not recollect
having seen the roads more pulverized than they are at pre
sent.    The 8th was the warmest day, when the maximum
temperature in the shade, with light airs from the South, was
81 degrees.     On the 23rd the marimum temperature in the
shade was    only 60 degrees.    This difference of 21 degrees in
the temperature of these two days, was occasioned by the fall
 ing of three quarters of an inch of rain in the night of the 22nd,
 which had cooled the surface of the earth; also by the then
 condensing state of the atmosphere, and the setting in of a
 strong gale from due North.

                       Esq. M.A. F.R.S.*
I HAVE         already treated of the method of the least squares
     in this Journal for January 1825, and the two following
months.       By altering a little an idea first suggested by Cotes,
we    may   represent  the errors of observation by the parts of a
 rigid line, the positive errors being on one side, and the nega
tive errors on the other side, of a common fulcrum ; and if
we append to the extremities of the errors, weights proportional
to the coefficients of the correction in the equations of condi
tion, the equilibrium of the weights is the rule of the least
 squares, and determines the most advantageous value of the
 correction sought. When there are several elements to be
 corrected simultaneously, the coefficients of the different cor
rections in the equations of condition will form so many se
parate sets of weights, and the levers must be in equilibrio
whichever set is appended; by which means we obtain as
many equations as there are unknown quantities to be found.
This method is at least precise and free from every thing con
jectural or tentative.      It is likewise founded on just princi
ples; for every coefficient in the equations of condition has
                                          of                                        be its
 due influence    in the quantity        the result.   But must        it
 allowed that the introducing       ofthe properties          is of
                                                         the lever and
of   equilibrium  in  ademonstration       of
                                           this kind    not altogether
 unexceptionable. Such considerations would not              necessary be
if  the truth  to    proved    were  entirely  disengaged   from what
is  foreign is it. to It   however extremely desirable that me
                           is                                                   a

 simply deduced from the real principles alone concerned;
ºbecause  it is only when this      is done that the method ean                     be
        understood, and that we can apply             with confidence
                                                        it

 162            Mr. Ivory            on the Method                        of the Least Squares.
      In   the most simple case of only one element the equations
 of     condition are as follows; viz.                -
         -
                                           e      = a º              –     7/2
                                          e'      =        a'a — m/
                                           ell    =        al"w — m!"
                                          &c.
 in    which the coefficients                   of
                                       the correction       viz.         a!", &c.             w,           a,    a!,
  are    allpositive. Now             manifest that the errors
                                          it   is                             &c.                           e,   e,    e",
  depend upon the correction                      much that when any par  so
  ticular value        assigned
                         is
                                                          a, a;   allin
                                               the errors are immediately
                                                to
  determined.           appears
                         It         therefore that there can exist no rea
  son for preferring one value                  another, except the nature
                                                          of  a      to
on of
      the errors,       the general character impressed upon them
                          or
       the supposition that the experiments are skilfully executed.
  When the law                  of
                            the errors       fulfilled, and when, besides
                                                              is
  their   quantity      confined within the least possible limits, the
                          is
 problem        issolved, and we have found that value                 the cor                              of
 rection which must             preferred
                                     be          every other. What then
                                                                      to

                                       or                        more    nearly               to   it
 than had been done before? We may suppose                          least, that                         at
 the experiments are liable only                   irregular and fortuitous

 errors; that every cause tending                make the results     to obser                                   of

 fully investigated and removed; and                   short, that the errors  in
 contain        no
                constant     part  common        them all.     What       tohere                                   is
                       understood exclusively           the case when every

 the errors contain        parts   affected with the same sign although
 unequal         magnitude, provided these parts are necessarily

every other system the errors have a constant part common

 long, having previously ascertained that it was quite free from
 magnetism, by repeated exposure of both ends of it to the
 north and south pole of a very sensible magnetic needle, when
 it was found equally to attract either pole in every instance.
 The magnetic needle employed as a test in this experiment, is
made of a sewing-needle magnetized, and run through a small
piece of cork, into which a conical cap of glass is inserted;
the whole traverses on the point of a needle fixed perpendi
cularly in a stand.
     I had no information at this time of the manner in which
 Professor Morichini had conducted his experiments; but it
occurred to me that it was not likely if the whole of the needle
were equally exposed to the violet rays, the same influence
should, at the same time, produce a south pole at one end
of   it,and    north pole

170       Mrs. Somerville on the magnetizing Power
 shorter time under these circumstances; yet in fact, there
 seemed to be no difference; most of the needles became mag
netic, some in longer, others in shorter periods, varying from
 about half an hour to four hours, but depending on circum
stances which   I have not yet been able to detect, further than
that a number of results induced me to believe, that the ex
periments were more successful from ten to twelve, or one
o'clock, than later in the day.      The portion of the needle ex
posed was almost always a north pole, whether it pointed up
wards or downwards: in a few instances in which the contrary
occurred, it may possibly have arisen from some previous dis
position in the needle to magnetism, too slight to be observed.
    The distance of the needle from the prism was frequently
varied by fixing the needle to the wooden pole of a fire-screen,
but without material variation in the effect. I   found it unneces
sary to darken the room; it was sufficient to place the prism
so as to throw the spectrum on any place out of the sun's rays.
    My next object was to endeavour to ascertain whether any
                                            .
other of the more refrangible rays had the same property as
the violet. A set of needles carefully examined as before, were
therefore subjected to the different rays of the solar spectrum:
the needles exposed to blue and green                sometimes ac
quired the magnetic property, though less frequently, and re
quiring longer exposure than when the violet rays were used;
but the magnetism seemed to be equally strong in these as in
the examples of the violet rays.       The part exposed became a
north pole. The indigo rays succeeded almost as well as the
violet.                        -
    Pieces of clock and watch-spring were next tried, under the
idea that they might, possibly from their blue colour, be more
susceptible of magnetic influence,—and it was the case; their
greater extent of surface, however, or their softness, may have
contributed to this susceptibility. The pieces of spring were
from two to three inches long, and from the eighth to the half
of an inch broad. It was difficult to procure watch and clock
spring free from magnetism; it even happened on one occa
 sion, that although the roll of spring was neutral, the pieces
 into which it was cut became magnetic; in one instance the
pieces were heated so as to deprive them of magnetism and
 colour; they then required longer exposure to the rays, in or—
 der to acquire polarity.     Large bodkins were exposed to the
 violet rays without effect, the mass perhaps being too great.
 When needles already magnetic were tried, their magnetism
 was increased.    Dr. Wollaston was so kind as to lend me a
 very large lens, having   its   centre covered with paper, which
 he  had used in his investigations   respecting the chemical rays.

The lens concentrated the violet rays, and produced a mag
netic effect in a shorter time than the prism; but the rapid
motion of the sun made it difficult to keep the needle in the
focus.        The       effect was produced with equal facility by                         throw
ing the spectrum on the floor of the room; but success could
not always be depended upon even when the weather seemed
                                     -
most favourable.
   I now made the following experiments with blue glass:—
Three needles free from magnetism, having one half covered
with paper, were laid horizontally on the stone outside of a
south window, under a dark blue glass coloured by cobalt,
in a very hot sun; after remaining in this position between
three and four hours, they were found to have become feebly
magnetic; the uncovered part being a north pole. On ex
amining these needles the following day, they had lost their
magnetism, a circumstance which had not before occurred,
though it was observed sometimes to take place afterwards, as
the force of the sun diminished from the advance of the sea
son. There was no iron near, and the magnetic needle when
placed on various parts of the stone, showed no magnetic                                        in
fluence in       Next day the experiment was repeated with
                   it.

under the blue glass, six hours; and then the needles had not                                  it,
only acquired very sensible magnetism, but still retain                                        at
the distance        nearly six months. Pieces

succeeded   in producing magnetism under the circumstances
described;       I
               next tried the effect of exposing neutral pieces of
                º
clock-spring to the sun, enveloped in violet and green silk.
The half      each was covered with paper as before, and the
pieces of spring then wrapped, one in green, and the other in
violet-coloured ribbon, were fixed to the inside of a pane of
glass in a window, where they were left exposed to the sun                                           all
day;   in the evening both had become magnetic, although they
were two        of

polarity more slowly, from having been heated; and         before,                   as

 mission.
     Having repeated the experiment several times, the distances
in   the interruptions being the same, the desired effect was al

ately inflamed. The experiment was repeated, under similar
circumstances, the next morning, and the same effect ensued.
A   small Fahrenheit's tucrmometer denoted the temperature                                              of

   Mr. Sturgeon supposes that the velocity with which the
electric fluid moves, when the discharge passes through the
circuit with explosion,       the cause is   the non-ignition of      the                          of
gunpowder placed          the circuit.

I  considered that if this could be accomplished, more time
would be afforded for the fluid and gunpowder to be in contact,
and the latter, in consequence, more likely to be ignited.” But
this is not the case; the electric fluid does not come at all into
contact with the gunpowder when it is not ignited by the ex
plosive discharge. For this substance is a non-conductor of
electricity, and the scattering and dispersing of it is not caused
by any direct impetus or action of the electric fluid itself on
the gunpowder, but by the rapid expansion and displacement
of the air, which is driven in every direction with considerable
force by the electric fluid from the point whence it explodes.

 The inspection of this table shows that the New Table deviates
less from observation than Dr. Brinkley's table in twenty-two
instances out of twenty-nine; it is more distant from the truth
in six instances; and in the remaining instance neither table has
the superiority over the other. It cannot therefore be consi
dered as a thing proved, although it has been said, that for
 altitudes less than 10°, and at very low altitudes, Dr. Brink
 ley's table is nearer to the truth than the New Table.

     XXVI.      On the Strength             of Bone.           By B. BEVAN, Esq.
 To the Editor of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
    Sir,
INstrength
     the lists published by various authors on the cohesive
            of materials, the strength of bone has been much
underrated. In the Encyclopædia Britannica it is quoted from
 Muschenbroek's experiments to be 5,250 pounds per square
inch; and       Ihave observed this number copied into various
other books.      But from experiments I have made with consi
derable   care,    I find the strength much to exceed that now
stated, if the bone is sound and solid. There will always be
some variation in the results of experiments of this nature,
depending upon the quality of the substance, and also upon
the mode of conducting the experiment.                 have tried the    I
bones of horses, oxen, and sheep, and find the strength of
cohesion per square inch to vary from 33,000 pounds to
42,500. One specimen of fresh mutton bone supported a
load in proportion to 40,000 pounds to the square inch for a
considerable time, without any visible injury to the bone,—or
nearly eight times the strength given by Muschenbroek.             The
modulus of elasticity of beef bone I have found 2,320,000
pounds, and specific gravity of 2:08.         A substance like bone,
so universally abounding, possessing such
considerable    flexibility,  ought to be restored to            #.
                                                        strength, and
                                                          proper place       its

I    have been trying the cohesive force         various species of                            of
wood, and find them generally           exceed the strength given

out any visible alteration at 10 o'clock, but at 6 o'clock the
following morning a cylindrical pin had been drawn from the
large end of the specimen without separating the fibres. We
may therefore safely allow 20,000 pounds for the strength of
this oak.
    In a similar manner a pin was drawn out of a specimen of
Spanish mahogany, with a load in proportion to 22,000 pounds
per square inch, and ash with a load of 16,000 per square inch.
It will be observed that my results considerably exceed those
of Mr. Barlow; the dimensions of my specimens were larger
than those of Mr. Barlow, and conducted with great care, and
with much greater weights to produce fracture.           Mr. Barlow's
mode of      taking   the dimensions of his      specimens  I consider
liable to objection, for the silk thread used to measure the cir
cumference of the cylinders would give the diameter too large
by the diameter of the thread; and this quantity would be of
considerable moment in affecting the area of the cylinders.
I  shall probably take an early opportunity of sending you the
results of my experiments on the cohesion of various species
of wood.                      Remaining yours truly,

    P. S. If you think the following dimensions of a gourd
worth notice, it is at your service. Now growing at Golding

high, supposed to weigh 70 pounds, not at present done
growing, is 8 feet from the root of the vine.
XXVII.        Instructions for collecting Geological Specimens. By
       WILLIAM HENRY FITToN, M.D. F.R.S. V.P.G.S.*
ITbysopersons
          often happens that specimens sent from distant places,
                    unpractised in geology, fail to give the instruc
tion which is intended, from the want of attention to a few ne
cessary precautions, that the following directions may perhaps
be useful to some of those, into whose hands these pages are
likely to fall. It will be sufficient to premise, that two of the
principal objects of geological inquiry, are, to determine,—
1st, the nature of the materials of which the earth is com
posed; and, 2ndly, the relative order in which these materials
are disposed with respect to each other.
    1. Specimens of rocks ought not, in general, to be taken
   • From the Appendix to Captain P. P. King's “Narrative of   a Survey
of the Inter-tropical and Western Coasts of Australia.”-
                                                                  from

                for   collecting Geological Specimens.         183
from loose pieces, but from large masses in their native place,
or which have recently fallen from their natural situation.
   2. The specimens should consist of the stone unchanged by
exposure to the elements, which sometimes alters the charac
ters to a considerable distance from the surface. Petrifactions,
however, are often best distinguishable in masses somewhat
decomposed; and are thus even rendered visible, in many
cases, where no trace of any organized body can be discerned
in the recent fracture.                                          -
   3. The specimens ought not to be too small.—A convenient
size is about three inches square, and about three-quarters of
an inch, or less, in thickness.
   4. It seldom happens that large masses, even of the same
kind of rock, are uniform throughout any considerable space;
so that the general character is collected, by geologists who
examine rocks in their native places, from the average of an
extensive surface:—a collection ought therefore to furnish spe
cimens of the most characteristic varieties;–and the most
                                    .
splendid specimens are, in general, not the most instructive.
Where several specimens are taken from the same place, a
series of numbers should be added to the note of their locality.
   5. One of the most advantageous situations for obtaining
specimens and examining the relations of rocks is in the sec
tions afforded by cliffs on the sea-shore: especially after recent
falls of large masses. It commonly happens that the beds thus
exposed are more or less inclined; and in this case, if any of
them be inaccessible at a particular point, the decline of the
strata will frequently enable the collector to supply himself
with the specimens he wishes for, within a short distance.
Thus, in the subjoined sketch, which may be supposed to re
present a cliff of considerable                observer being si
tuated at a, the beds b, c, d, though inaccessible at that Race,
may be examined with ease and security, where they succes
sively come down to the shore at b, c, and         d'.
  6.   To   examine the interior   of   an   unknown country, more
skill and practice are required: the rocks being generally con
cealed  by the soil, accumulations   sand, gravel, &c., and
                                        of                       by
the  vegetation   ofthe surface.  But the strata are commonly
                                                          disclosed
                  -

184                        Dr. Fitton’s Instructions
 disclosed in the sides of ravines,    in the beds of rivers and
 mountain-streams; and these, especially where they cross the
 direction of the strata, may be made, by careful examination,
 to afford instructive sections.                          -
    7. Among the occasional components of the strata, the re
mains of organized bodies,—shells, corals, and other zoophytes,
—the bones and teeth of animals,        fossil wood, and the im
pressions of vegetable stems, roots, or leaves, &c., are of the
greatest importance; affording generally the most marked
 characters of the beds in which they occur.—These should,
therefore, be particularly sought after, and their relative
 abundance or rarity in different situations noticed.    The pe
trified bodies should, if possible, be kept united with portions
of the rock or matrix in which they are found; and where
they are numerous,        in sand, clay, or any moist or friable
matrix,-it is in general better to retain a large portion of the
whole mass, to be examined afterwards, than to attempt their
separation at the time of collecting.
    8. The loose materials which are found above the solid rocks,
in the form of gravel, silt, rolled pebbles, &c., should be care
fully distinguished from the solid strata upon which they rest.
 And the more ancient of these loose materials, found on the
 sides or summits of hills, &c., should be distinguished from
 the recent mud, sand, and gravel, brought down by land-floods
 or by rivers. The bones and teeth of animals are not unfre
 quently found in the more ancient gravel; and the collection
 of these remains from distant quarters of the globe, is an ob
ject of the greatest interest to geology.
    9. Besides a note of the locality, there ought, if possible, to
accompany every specimen, a short notice of             geological                its
 circumstances; as—
   Whether      it    be

      beds?—[If these cannot          measured,  be   estimate should   an

                                                               veins?                   or
  Is   the whole cliff,    mass  or strata     sight

But, unfortunately, barometers of every construction are very
easily damaged or deranged.—Minute accuracy, however, in
the determination of heights, though very interesting to phy

  188      On the Volcanic Character        a<U+017F> the Island of Hawaii.
      Soon after the arrival of this second missionary family, a
  tour round the island was resolved upon, with particular re
  ference to the great objects of the mission. , Messrs. Ellis",
  Harwood, Thurston, Stewart, Bishop, and Goodrich, were
  charged with the execution of this duty, which they performed
  with zeal and ability. The result of their observations is de
  tailed in a little volume, ably drawn up by Mr. Ellis, and en
  titled “A Journal of a Tour around Hawaii, the largest of the
   Sandwich Islands.”           Besides many interesting statements re
  lative to the paramount objects of the enterprise, it contains a
  #.      number more relating to the natural history of the island.
    From this part of the work, we intend to quote the most im
  portant passages; and we conceive that we cannot better                      in
  troduce them than by the following letter from Mr. Goodrich
  to the Editor, which, although dated a year ago, has been re
   ceived only within a few days.
  Detter from Mr. Joseph Goodrich, one of the American Mission
                         aries in the Sandwich Islands.
            To Professor Silliman, New-Haven, (Connecticut).
         My dear Sir,                      Waiakea (Hawaii), April 20, 1825.
       I confess I have remained silent quite too long, in not an
   swering your kind request on the eve of my embarkation, al
   though I am better able to state facts now than at any former
   period. The station which I am called to occupy, is on the
   N.E. side of Hawaii, (pronounced Harwye,) at the head of a
   safe and commodious harbour, yet but little known to foreign
   ers.     About forty miles in the interior, in a south-westerly             di
   rection, is a burning volcano, that has been in a state of acti
   vity from time immemorial.             The oldest natives can give no
   account of a time when it was not burning: they say it is more
   active now than it was twelve or fifteen years since +.
                                                                               On
   member of Yale College, applied himself with diligence to the study of mi
   neralogy and geology, with particular reference to more extended useful
   ness as a missionary,
                     -     he having already resolved on devoting himself to that
   object.
      º:    Goodrich made very considerable acquirements in this way; and
   being endowed with a vigorous frame, and peculiar hardihood and equani
    mity, he was well qualified for the vicissitudes of a missionary life in a bar
    barous country.
      The letter annexed, contains so many interesting notices, that I have
   given it with little abridgement or alteration.       Mr. Thurston and Mr.
    Whitney were also from Yale College, and possessed, in a high degree, the
    requisite traits of character.

and north, till they had encompassed the island, having occu

made frequent excursions inland, visited the principal villages,

narrative of Mr. Ellis, they remark: “We have been enabled
to collect considerable information on a variety of subjects,

count, are nevertheless interesting and important; such as the
natural scenery, productions, geºlogy and curiosities; the tra

   “Between nine and ten in the forenoon they arrived at a
large extinguished crater, about a mile in circumference, and
apparently 400 feet deep. The sides were regularly sloped,
 and at the bottom was a small mound, with an aperture in its
 top. By the side of this large crater, divided from it by a nar
 row ridge of volcanic rocks, was another, fifty-six feet in cir
 cumference, from which volumes of sulphurous smoke and
 vapour continually ascended.              No bottom could be seen, and

 first flowed over in one vast sheet, but had afterwards fallen
 more slowly, and in detached semi-fluid masses. These, cool

 continued augmentation from above, had ultimately reached
 the top, and united with the liquid lava there. It was evident
 that the lava still continued to flow along the outside of the

 the general surface, fixed in the lava below, which appeared
 to have flowed round their base, and filled up the interstices
occasioned by the separation of the different pieces.    One side
of these rugged slabs generally presented a compact, smooth,
glazed, and gently undulated surface, while the other appeared
rugged and broken, as if torn with violence from the viscid
mass, to which it had tenaciously adhered. . Probably these
slabs were raised by the expansive force of heated air, or of
steam, beneath the sheet of lava.”       “A    number of conical
hills, from 150 to 200 feet high, rose immediately in our rear,
much resembling sand-hills in their appearance.        On exami
nation, however, we found them composed of volcanic ashes
and scoria; but could not discover any mark of their ever
having been craters.” So common were streams and masses
of lava wherever the missionaries travelled, that upon this
harsh substance they almost always walked, sat, and slept. On
the evening of the 26th, they spread their “mats upon the
lava, and lay down to sleep under the canopy of heaven.”        A
pile of blocks, of scoria, and lava; part of which they had
themselves erected, screened their heads from the wind.

   After leaving Keavaiti on the 27th, “Messrs.         Thurston,
Bishop, and Goodrich travelled over the rugged lava, till the
moon becoming obscured by dark heavy clouds, they were
obliged to halt under a high rock of lava, and wait the dawn
of day; for they found it impossible to proceed in the dark,
without being every moment in danger of stumbling over the
sharp projections of the rocks, or falling into some of the deep
and wide fissures that intersected the lava in every direction.
During the whole of the 27th, a most beautiful spouting of
the water attracted the attention of the travellers. It was pro
duced by the rolling of the waves of the sea, which, through
an aperture of about two feet in diameter, every few seconds
threw up a volume of water with considerable noise, and a
pleasing effect, to the height of thirty or forty feet. The lava
at this place was very ancient, and much heavier than that at
Kona. The vesicles were completely filled with olivin.
    Almost every incident connected with this interesting tour
is in some way associated with lava. Villages and funeral piles,
and sanctuaries of refuge were built upon lava.         This sub
stance was often the missionary's pulpit, when he preached,
and the seat of the people while they heard the tidings of sal
vation; and at night, the pilgrims often sought repose upon

nature charms unknown to the climates of the North, the con

he would only give the name of dark colour. A blue lilac he
called a lead colour; nor could he trace a shade of purple in
the sweet-scented violet, or in a plum.    From all the informat

pitch, although clearly a variety of brown, he considered to
be black; and liver-brown he designated in the same manner.
 Chesnut-brown he could not distinguish. An article of dress,
indeed, of the latter colour, he repaired with silk of an olive
green; and, on another occasion, he considered covered but
tons of a bottle-green, as a perfect match for a dress of a
blackish-brown.         Two fragments of cloth, one a duck-green,
and the other a      liver-brown,    were placed before him, and he

latter. This accordingly took place, when the indigo and

a marked distinction in that excellent work.                     . . .          -

in the shop-window.          In the course of the day, his master
called on him to state the prices of the patterns he had ob
tained, at the same time placing before him two pieces of
crimson cloth, and three of the green baize; and he, uncon

   Of   the hypotheses that have been proposed to account for
the phaenomena in question, that which refers it to an insen
sibility of the retina to certain impressions of light, appears at
once the most simple and philosophical.      Some eyes, it is well
known, are capable of performing the general functions of                                         vi
sion, and are yet unable to perceive those minute impressions
of light, which to other eyes are readily perceptible. A retina
may be perfectly adapted to receive the due and proper effect
of a beam of light, and yet, from some peculiarity in              or                       its
ganization, incapable                of

                                   desired that they should “heave     72

 up,” which was done: the water-tight cover was unscrewed,
 and he came out, evidently very much gratified by the success
 of his first experiment.
    He next took his seat in the open bell, and a “bell-man”
 took the place he had just ceased to occupy. I was informed
that Mr. Steele had selected this man for his steadiness, having
been down with him before while he was making some experi
ments with a common diving-bell.            The communication be
tween persons descending in this manner is by writing: they
write upon tablets, and mutually exhibit them at the window
in the partition. They descended: the bell-man described
what he saw to the persons above; and after they had been
under water for some time, when Mr. Steele chose to ascend,
he intimated his desire to him, and he immediately communi
cated the order that the bell should be raised.              After they
came out of the bell, preparations were made for an experi
mental proof of the theory which have alluded  I                 leadingto,   as

one    ofthe  engineer's    workmen went into the       communicating
chamber, and Mr. Steele himself, taking his tablets and pencil,
went into the chamber above water, into which he was imme
diately fastened by         air-tight cover. The bell was lowered
under water, and            ofan
                            course the chamber above was filled
through the pipe with condensed air.

answered      the negative. Theman then made some observations

rect opposition to that of Newton and Laplace, as well as of
every other writer of any authority with whom I am ac
quainted. In fact, it is almost universally admitted that the
velocity increases proportionally to the square root of the ba
rometric pressure. I have formerly shown that the velocity
increases, in a mean state of the atmosphere, at the rate of
about 19 feet per second, for an increase of one inch in the
height of the barometer; and about one foot for an increase
of one degree of temperature by Fahrenheit's thermometer.
Indeed, by applying the formula which I gave in a paper on
Mr. Goldingham's observations, to those of Messrs. Parry and
Foster, as far as they have supplied the necessary data, theor
and observation will agree to within about 20 feet per second,
-a   pretty strong proof that theory is not contradicted by their
experiments. There is reason to believe, had the other ne
cessary data been stated, that a still nearer agreement would
have been obtained. These it is greatly to be desired will be
carefully attended to by future observers.                    -

   A singular new genus, Pachymya, from the chalk with quart
zose grains at Dowlands, the lowest part of the chalk forma
tion in the vicinity of Lyme Regis, is described in this number.
It is thus characterized: Shell bivalved, transversely elon
gated, very thick, sub-bilobate, with the beaks near the ante
rior * extremity. Ligaments partly immersed, attached to pro
minent processes or fulcra:” the species figured is P. gigas.-
To the genus Orbicula, before containing two recent species
only, three fossil species are added, one from the Alum clay,
another probably from the Oxford clay, and a third from the
Ancliffe oolite. Five Trigoniac from the last-mentioned forma
tion and the Green-sand are also figured; with two Paludinae :
from the Weald Clay and the Hastings Sand.

       FLUIDITY of sulphur AT common TEMPERATUREs.
    Having placed a Florence flask containing sulphur upon a
hot sand-bath, it was left to itself.      Next morning, the bath
being cold, it was found that the flask had broken, and in con
sequence of the sulphur running out, nearly the whole of it
had disappeared. The flask being broken open, was examined,
and was found lined with a sulphur dew, consisting of large
and small globules intermixed.         The greater number of these,
perhaps two-thirds, were in the usual opaque solid state; the
remainder were fluid, although the temperature had been, for
some hours, that of the atmosphere.            On touching one of
these    drops,  it immediately     became    solid,  crystalline, and
opaque, assuming the ordinary state of sulphur, and perfectly
resembling the others in appearance.           This took place very
rapidly, so that it was hardly possible to apply a wire or other
body to the drops quick enough to derange the form before
solidity had been acquired; by quick motion, however, it might
be effected, and by passing the finger over them, a sort of
smear could be produced.          Whether touched by metal, glass,
wood, or the skin, the change seemed equally rapid; but it
appeared to require actual contact; no vibration of the glass
on which the globules lay rendered them solid, and many of
them were retained for a week in their fluid state.          This state
of the sulphur appears evidently to be analogous to that of
water cooled in a quiescent state below           freezing point; and
                                                            its

Mawy.        These animals, they said, resided in the deepest part
      .
 of a   forest,  distant from Truman about five or six days'
journey, and appeared very averse to undertake any expedi
 tion in search of them, stating that these beings would as
 suredly attack any small party, especially if a woman should
be         them, whom they would endeavour to carry off. They
 were    unwilling  also to destroy these animals, from a supersti
 tious belief that they are animated by the souls of their ances
 tors, and that they hold dominion over the great forests of
 Sumatra. After some days' debate, however, and hearing
 that a Mawah had been seen in the forest, the young man
 collected a party of twenty persons, armed with muskets,
 spears and bamboos, and having marched in an easterly di
 rection for above thirty miles, fell in with the object of his
 search.     The orang was sitting on the summit of one of the
 highest trees, with a young one in          arms.     its

to   obtain another shot, the poor animal made             attempt            no               to

one escaped.       She measured four feet eleven inches        length,             in
and two feet across the      shoulders,  and was covered with red
hair.     Itis   probable, from the spot where this animal was
found being       sonear     Truman, that she was the mate

      which has afforded to the Asiatic Society the means of judging
      of the literature, antiquities, arts, and natural productions of
      the Himalayan region, has at length settled the question re
      pecting the chiru, or antelope of the Bhoteahs. The skin and
      horns sent by Mr. Hodgson were the spoils of an animal which
      died in the menagerie of the Rajah of Nepaul, to whom it was
      presented by the Lama of Digurchi, whose pet it had been.
      The persons who brought the animal to Nepaul, informed
      Mr. Hodgson that the favourite abode of chiru is the Tingri
      Maidan, a fine plain or valley, through which the Arrun flows,
      and which is situated immediately beyond the snows by the
      Kooti pass; that in this valley beds of salt abound, to which
      the chirus are said to resort in vast herds. They are repre
      sented as in the highest degree wild, and inapproachable by
      man, flying on the least alarm; but if opposed, assuming a
      bold and determined front. The male and female are said to
      present the same general appearance.
         The living subject of Mr. Hodgson's description presented
      none of those formidable attributes with which the tales of the
      Bhoteahs had clothed the chiru.        In form and size he offered

   That the rhinoceros will submit to the domesticating influence
  of man we have seen more than one instance, nor would the
  tractability of this herbivorous animal seem in any way a matter
  of surprise, when we know that the fiercest of the carnivorous
  tribe have become the attached companions of their master,-
  if the rhinoceros had not been held up by writers of every
  age and country as a standard of brutal and untameable fury.
  India exhibits numerous proofs of false conclusions by histo
  rians regarding the habits and temper of animals, and affords
  a field of interesting inquiry respecting their instinct, as con
  tradistinguished to what might be called theireducateable facul
  ties.   This subject has hitherto, we believe, only been treated
  by the naturalists of Europe, who have relied, in many cases,
  upon very vague or insufficient narratives, but never by any
 person residing in the native country of the animals whose hi
  story has been recorded.                                  -          -

 Mimulus luteus, which has flowered for several years past on

XXXVI.     On the Methods proper to be used for deducing a
   general Formula for the Length of the Seconds Pendulum,

  By     J. Ivory,    Esq.    M.A. F.R.S.*
   HE     determination of the figure of the earth by means of
      terrestrial experiments, is a problem of extreme delicacy.
The solution of it requires the measurement of magnitudes
nearly equal, such as a degree of the meridian, or a pendulum
that oscillates in a given time; and as the investigation turns
on the differences of those magnitudes, the greatest precision
is necessary, because errors inconsiderable in respect of the
magnitudes themselves, may nevertheless bear a great propor
yet the   #.
tion to the small differences.

                                  But even granting that the de

                      of the problem are not entirely overcome.
When the data of a mathematical question are exact, the re
sult is rigorously accurate; and there can be no reason for
preferring one mode of solution to another, except easiness in
the calculation, or elegance in the process of deduction.     But
if the data be liable to error, as in most physical researches,
the effect of the probable errors must be scrupulously ex
amined in every proposed solution. Every method of investi
gation must be rejected as uncertain and unsafe, when small
changes in the data would produce great variations in the re
sult. Unless care be taken in this respect, it is evident that a
deficiency of mathematical science might be attended with the
same consequences as the want of accuracy in the experi-                               .

   It is usual to employ the method of the least squares in de
ducing the ellipticity of the earth from a number of pendu
lum experiments made at different latitudes.      Now this prac

242   Mr. Ivory         on the Methods proper to be used for deducing
plication.    But no rule, however general, can be safely ap
plied without attending in some degree to the particular cir
cumstances of the case.       And if we compare the results ob
tained by this method, we shall find that they often vary greatly,
when no adequate reason can be assigned; which must raise
our suspicions of             its
                         fitness for this particular investigation.

man's experiments, that the pendulums are too long near the
equator, and in some instances the excesses are very great;
on the other hand the pendulums are too short at Drontheim,
Hammerfest, and Greenland. Hence it is probable that q is
negative, and 6 positive.   For the sake of illustration,                                              let   us

different observers we have now obtained four results, which
are extremely near one another.        So very inconsiderable in

inference, That the experiments with the pendulum agree bet

been supposed.                  I
                       have further applied the same method of

in the present lengths, and the new experiments should agree
better with the others that have been so successfully executed

great portion of the earth's surface coincides with an elliptical
spheroid so nearly that it must ever elude the utmost efforts

N.N.E. towards the         smoke.      “The path, (they remark,) for

precipice being less steep, a descent to the plain below seemed
practicable. It required, however, the greatest caution, as the
stones and fragments of rocks frequently gave way under our
feet, and rolled down from above; and with all our care we
did not reach the bottom without several falls and slight
bruises. The steep which we had descended, was formed of
volcanic materials, apparently a light red, and gray kind of
lava, vesicular, and lying in horizontal strata, varying in
thickness from one to forty feet. In a small number of places,
the different strata of lava were, also, rent in perpendicular or
oblique directions from the top to the bottom, either by earth
quakes or other violent convulsions of the earth, connected
with the action of the adjacent volcano.      After walking some
distance over the sunken      plain,   which,  in several places,
sounded hollow under our feet, we came suddenly to the edge
of the great crater, where a spectacle, sublime and appalling,
presented itself before us.     Astonishment and awe for some
moments deprived us of speech, and, like statues, we stood
fixed to the spot, with our eyes riveted on the abyss below.
Immediately before us yawned an immense gulf, in the form
of a crescent, upwards of two miles in length, about a mile
across, and apparently eight hundred feet deep.             The bottom
was filled with lava; and the south-west and northern parts
of it were one vast flood of liquid fire, in a state of terrific
ebullition, rolling to and fro             “fiery surge’. and flaming
                                                   its

so  many conical islands, from the surface            the burning lake.

which rolled          blazing

breadth, but extending quite around. Beneath this black ledge,

we could judge, 300                  or

 surrounded, rising probably, in some places, 400 feet in per
 pendicular height, presented an immense volcanic panorama,
 the effect of which was greatly augmented by the constant
 roaring of the vast furnaces below.
    “We then walked along the western side of the crater in
 search of water, which we had been informed was to be found
 in the neighbourhood, and succeeded in finding three pools,
 where the water was perfectly fresh and sweet.         These pools
 appeared great natural curiosities. The surface of the ground
in the vicinity was perceptibly warm, and rent by several deep,
irregular chasms, from which steam and thick vapours con
 tinually arose.    In some places these chasms were two feet
wide.     From thence a dense volume of steam ascended, which
 was immediately condensed into small drops of water, by the
cool mountain air, and driven like drizzling rain into hollows
in the lava, at the leeward side of the chasms. The pools,
which were six or eight feet from the chasms, were surrounded
and covered by flags, rushes, and tall grass.          Nourished by
the moisture of the vapours, these plants flourished luxuriantly,
and, in their turn, sheltered the pools from the heat of the sun,
and prevented evaporation. We expected to find the water
warm; but in this respect we were also agreeably disap
pointed. When we had quenched our thirst with water thus
distilled by nature, we directed the natives to build a hut for us
to pass the night in, in such a situation as to command a view
of the burning lava; and while they were thus employed, we
prepared to examine the many interesting objects around us.”
    Mr.Thurston visited the eastern side of the great crater; and
Messrs. Ellis and Goodrich went to examine some extensive
beds of sulphur at the north-east end.          After walking about
three quarters of a mile over a tract of decomposed lava, covered
with ohelo bushes, they came to a bank about 150 yards long,
and in some places upwards of 30 feet high, formed of vol
canic sulphur, with a small proportion of red clay. The
               j
ground was hot,     its surface rent       by
                                           fissures; and they were
sometimes completely enveloped         the thick vapours that con
                                      in
tinually ascended.    A   number  of apertures were visible along
the whole extent   of .the bank  of sulphur;     smoke and vapours
arose from these   fissures; and the heat around them was more
intense than in  any other part. They climbed about halfway
up the bank,          endeavoured     todetach some parts    of  the
crust, but soon found      too hot
                          it       to      be
                                          handled.     However,       by
means   of  their walking-sticks, they broke off some curious
specimens.     Those procured near the surface were crystal
lized in beautiful circular prisms    ofalight yellow colour, while
those found three   or  four inches deep       the bank, were
                                                in               of   an

orange yellow, generally in single or double tetrahedral pyra
mids, and full an inch in length.
   A singular hissing and cracking noise was heard among the
crystals, whenever the outside crust of sulphur was broken,
and the atmospheric air admitted.     The same noise was pro
duced among the fragments broken off, until they were quite
cold. The adjacent stones and pieces of clay were frequently
incrusted, either with sulphate of ammonia, or volcanic sal
ammoniac. . A considerable quantity was also found in the
crevices of some of the neighbouring rocks, which was much
more pungent than that exposed to the air. Along the bot
tom of the sulphur bank, they found a number of pieces of
tufa, extremely cellular and light. A thick fog now came over,
which being followed by a shower of rain, obliged them to
leave this interesting laboratory of nature, and return to their
companions.
   They saw flocks of wild geese, which came down from the
mountains and settled among the ohelo bushes: they were                          in
formed that they were numerous in the interior, but were
never Seen on the coast.
   At sun-setting, although the thermometer was at 69°, ex
pecting a cold night upon the mountain, they collected fuel,
and removed from a dangerous place, which the natives had
superstitiously chosen for them, upon the very edge of the
crater. The ground sounded hollow in every direction, fre
quently cracked, and in two instances actually gave way as
they were passing over              it,
                             and exposed the persons, whose
limbs sunk through the lava,    great danger and

whose bellowing mouths, amidst rising flames and eddying
streams of fire, shot up at frequent intervals, with loudest de
tonations, spherical masses of fusing lava, of bright ignited
stones.  The dark, bold outline of the perpendicular and
jutting rocks around, formed a striking contrast with the                                      lu

equally interested.     They sat most      the night, talking

 beautiful specimens of lava, generally of a black or red co
 lour, light, cellular, brittle, and shining. They also found a
  quantity of volcanic glass, drawn out into filaments as fine as
 human hair, and called by the natives rouohoo Pele, (hair of
  Pele).    Itwas of a dark olive colour, semi-transparent, and
 brittle, though some of the filaments were several inches long.
  Probably it was produced by the bursting of igneous masses
 of lava, thrown out from the craters, or separated in fine spun
  thread, from the boiling fluid, when in a state of perfect fu
 sion, borne by the smoke above the edges of the crater, and
 thence wa<U+017F>ted by the winds over the adjacent plain, for they
 also found quantities of it at least seven miles distant from the
 crater. They “entered several small craters, that had been
 in vigorous action but a short period before, marks of very
 recent fusion presenting themselves on every side. Their size
 and height were various, and many, which, from the top, had
 appeared insignificant as mole-hills, they now found twelve or
 twenty feet high. The outsides were composed of bright
 shining lava, heaped up in piles of most singular form. The
 lava on the inside was of a light or dark red colour, with a
 glazed surface, and in several places, where the heat had evi
 dently been intense, they saw a deposit of small and beauti
 fully white crystals. They also entered several covered chan
 nels, down which the lava had flowed into the large abyss.
 They were formed by the cooling of the lava, on the sides
 and surface of the stream, while it continued to flow on un
 derneath. As the size of the current diminished, it had left a

 brown stalactitic lava, in every imaginable shape; while the

according to every observation that the travellers could make,
one complete mass of lava, or other volcanic matter, in dif
ferent stages of decomposition, and, perforated with innumer
able apertures (or craters), forms, perhaps, a stupendous arch
over one vast furnace, situated in the heart of a huge subma
rine mountain, of which the island of Hawaii is but the apex.
Or possibly, the fires rage with augmented force, at the un
fathomable depth of the ocean's bed; and reared through the
superincumbent weight of waters, a hollow mountain, formin
the base of Hawaii, and at the same time a pyramidal funnel,
from the furnace to the atmosphere.”
   It seems rather remarkable       #.   strawberries and raspberries,
which   usually  flourish best in moist situations, should be found
in Hawaii around the volcanic summits, and even in some
cases in the vicinity of the crater.           Within a few miles of
Kirauea the travellers passed three or four high and rugged
craters. One of them was said by the natives to have inun
dated the surrounding country about fourteen generations
back. The sides of these craters are generally covered with
verdure, while the broken irregular rocks on their surface
“frowned like the battlements of an ancient castle in ruins.”
They descended from one escarpment to another, over lava
more or less decomposed.            One descent was 400 feet, and
another 500, which brought them to “a tract of lava consi
derably decomposed and about five miles wide, at the end of
which another steep appeared.”             Down this they descended
“by following the course of a rugged current of lava, for
about 800 feet perpendicular depth, when they arrived at the
plain below, which was one extended sheet of lava, without
shrub or bush, stretching to the north and south, as far as the
eye could reach, and from four to six miles across, from the
foot of the mountain to the sea.”          They crossed this flood of
lava in about two hours, and arrived at a village, whose inha
bitants were unwilling to believe that the travellers had not.
only been to Kirauea, but had broken the sulphur banks, eaten
the ohelos, descended to the craters, and broken fragments of
lava from them,-for Pele, they said, was a dreadful being, and
would certainly have avenged the insult. They were however
convinced by the sight of the specimens, but said that the
travellers had escaped because they were foreigners.                 Pele,
they said, had, only five moons ago, issued from a subterranean
cavern—overflowed the low land of Kapapala—carried into
the height of 14,600 feet, it was supposed that this might be the height of
Mouna Roa and Mouna Kea, as the tops of these mountains are covered
with perpetual snow. Their summits are formed of decomposed lava, and
contain numerous craters.
                                                                       the

alluded to, arose from “the body              the lava, which had filled

lake in which the children were swimming, sporting and
diving.
   On the 13th of August, near Waiakea, they observed three
streams of fresh water that empty themselves into the bay of
Waiakea—one rises among the summits of Mouna Kea, and
the two others boil up through the lava, near the shore—fill
several large fish-ponds, and empty into the sea.
   The face of the country near Waiakea is rendered very
beautiful by the frequent rains, and the long repose which
this region has enjoyed from the desolating effects of volcanic
eruptions.                                                             -
   As the travellers occasionally avoided the roughness of the
land by coasting along the shores, they had opportunity to
observe the bold volcanic rocks, springing up sometimes 600
feet perpendicularly from the sea—and displaying various
strata of vesicular lava–from which the water was frequently
seen oozing or gushing in fountains.
   At Laupahoapoe they saw the ruins of a mountain of nearly
600 feet elevation, which, nine months before, had fallen into
the sea in consequence of an earthquake.        The cloven surface
of the mountain, still in                 its
                               original position, was smooth and
vertical, while the fragments lay below           state      frightful

                            dismissed his native companion, and
taking his great coat and blanket, began          ascend the more  to
steep and rugged parts.      The way was difficult, on account                                 of
the volcanic rocks and stunted shrubs that covered the sides
of the mountain.      On his way          found   up    he

   He now directed his steps towards a neighbouring peak,
which appeared one of the highest; but when he had ascended
it,    saw several others still higher.
       he                                    He proceeded towards
one which    appeared  the  highest,  and bore north-east from the

thrown out. The whole of the summit was not covered with
snow. There were only frequent patches, apparently several
miles      extent, over which the snow was about eight inches
            in
or     a   foot     in   thickness.          The ocean              to   the east and west was

 the natural history of the country where he was residing, and
 they certainly do much credit both to his industry and discri
  mination. It is with great pleasure that we add our warm
  commendation of the late effort of the missionaries.     Situated
  in a remote island, in the vast expanse of the Pacific, intensely
  and ardently occupied in their great object, the moral im
  provement and civilization of the natives;–remote from the
  lights of science, and subjected to physical privations both
  frequent and severe, we certainly owe them many thanks for
  the great amount of valuable information which they have,     in
  cidentally, contributed on the subject of the natural history of
  one of the most remarkable volcanic regions in the world.
  They have, in a very pleasing manner, blended scientific      in
  struction with moral; and both the scientific and religious
  world will unite in expressing their acknowledgements to the
  missionaries.    It is a happy illustration of the importance of
  uniting scientific and religious qualifications in the character
  of the missionary: and in our view, every important mission—
  especially in a terra incognita, (and there are many such,)
  should be furnished with good observers and good instru
  ments to illustrate the different branches of natural history
  and of physical science.      It is no offence to the higher and
  more   appropriate   objects,  to add, that dignity is thus shed
  on the mission, both in the view of the natives and in that
  of the civilized communities of Christian countries. We are
 confident that many persons will peruse the late Journal of
  the missionaries, in Hawaii, because it imparts so much inci
 dental information, while no intelligent person, of whatever
 feelings or sentiments, will wish the amount of that informa
                                       -
 tion diminished.
     Mineralogy and geology, botany and zoology, astronomy
  and geography, philology, antiquities and history, may derive
 very important aid from the missionaries, as indeed valuable
 information has often been obtained from them in years that
 are past.
     We are gratified also with the Journal of the tour around *
 Hawaii, on account of the manner in which it is written. It
 is a manly, perspicuous, common-sense book, and (very judi
 ciously in our view) omits the colloquial epithets of personal
 affection, with which missionaries are wont to clothe their nar
 ratives, and which, although perfectly proper in private com
 munications, appear trite and formal in the view of the world.
     The missionaries did not forget to avail themselves of their
superior knowledge, to enlighten, as far as possible, the dark
intelligence of the Hawaiians, as to the origin of volcanoes
from physical causes, operating according to the laws impressed
                                                                Orl

    hundreds    ofpersons.”     This interesting effect        the electric  of
    spark excited considerable attention           this part  to  the inci        of
    pient science    ofelectricity; and several other German philo
    sophers, after repeating the experiment              Dr. Ludolf, pur
                                                                    of

    these substances had been heated nearly            the point   tospon               of
    taneous combustion.       The results thus obtained by the Ger
    mans were only the realization                 of
                                            conjecture

    a  French  philosopher,   who had several    years   before conceived
    that the electric fluid possessed the property        inflaming com of
    bustible substances, though              he
                                       was not able        the time     de

    monstrate the fact.
      Those important experiments appear    have been effected     to
    during the year 1744; and the English philosophers having
    obtained the necessary information concerning them, pro
                                            2L     2                                    ceeded

268         Mr. Howldy on Combustion by                             the   Electric Spark.
ceeded in the spring of the following year to repeat these ex
periments of the Germans, and to pursue the inquiry further.
By the application of an excited glass tube to phosphorus,
Dr. Miles set it on fire. And Dr. Watson fired not only                                         in
flammable air, but gunpowder, by the agency of the electric
spark, when it had been previously ground with a little cam
phor, or a few drops of any essential oil: he also succeeded
in discharging a musket, and inflaming turpentine and balsam
of capivi, by the electric spark.
   While philosophers were prosecuting their inquiries on this
subject, the important discovery of the method of accumulating
electricity upon the surface of glass was made, or at least
first correctly ascertained, at Leyden in Holland.       But the
augmented electrical power which this discovery placed in their
hands, served, at first, to create only surprise, wonder, or
terror, in those who personally experienced the singularity and
violence of its action. After the tumult into which the minds
of philosophers were thrown by the shocks of the Leyden
phial had subsided, they began to try what effects it would
produce on other bodies.     It is remarkable, however, that they
did not resume and prosecute with much care the inquiry in
which they were engaged, at the period when the brilliant dis
covery of the power they now possessed was made.
    It is equally remarkable that the inquiry has not been pro
secuted by later philosophers with much attention, if the ap-                                          .
plication of the electric charge to inflammable gaseous mix
tures and to the combustion or oxidation of metallic wires be
excepted.     But I think the manner in which the electric fluid
has been constantly and universally applied to inflame or ex
plode combustible bodies is the principal cause why the list
of those bodies which have actually undergone the above pro
cesses by          its

                                                                  -
      Sir,
THE        following table exhibits the results of some experi
      ments I have made on the cohesive strength of various-
species   of wood.
    The specimens varied in length from 9 to 13 inches, and
were reduced in a lathe for a small part of the length, near
the middle, to near half an inch in diameter, leaving at each
end something more in general than four inches long and
about 11-10ths diameter, for the purpose of being fastened into
cast-iron boxes, made of sufficient strength to bear a strain of
several tons weight.        The wood thus prepared was secured
at each end in one of these iron boxes, and suspended verti
cally at the end of a lever of suitable strength to bear a force
 offive or six thousand pounds; the operating strain being pro
duced by the gradual and slow motion of weights of 200
pounds each, resting occasionally at intervals, of 5, 10, 15, or
 20 minutes, and sometimes for some hours.           In the course of
my experiments       I  occasionally found part of the larger ends
 drawn out in a cylindrical shape when the lateral adhesion
 was less than the longitudinal cohesion: in these cases the
 number of pounds expressive of the cohesion is short of
 what is due to the specimen, and in the table these are distin
guished by +, on the other bearing. Sometimes the specimen
 broke during the motion of the weight, and therefore would
 have separated under a less force, with more time: these are
 marked —.
                            Yours, &c. &c.

great precision when the curves on each side of the tangent
at the moment of reading are equal: but it would be difficult
to recollect in reading, whether the curve before you was ex
actly similar to one which you had seen in the opposite mi
croscope.       By                 the instrument till the curve is sym
metrical, the observer has only to make the micrometer wire
a tangent to             its

    These experiments will be sufficient to show that in reading
from the instrument no error of any practical importance in
sea affairs is to be apprehended. They show too, that it is
a matter of indifference, in this instrument, with which micro
scope the tops of the fluid are read, provided one be read with
the one and the other with the other.        It will be understood
that, when A in the above experiments is on the left, B is on
the right, and vice versä. Now it will be found that half the
sum of A left and B right, differs in a degree too slight to be
noticed, from half the sum of A right and B left.

                                                               Ject,

ject, he finds in the usual way their horary angles, the sum or
 the difference of which is the difference of their right ascensions,
and the time deduced from the Nautical Almanac, or from
the tables given in this work, when the moon and the other
object have the computed difference of right ascension, is the
 Greenwich time of the observation.        This is the peculiarity
in the   method;   the time at the  place  of observation is found
in the usual way.
   It will readily be perceived that the method is right in
theory, and if the data could be obtained at sea with sufficient
exactness, it would form a very useful addition to the methods
 now in practice for finding the longitude.    But to give results
 of any practical value in the present state of nautical science,
 both the latitude of the ship and the altitudes of the objects
must be known to a degree of precision which I fear is quite
unattainable in practice at sea.
    It will readily be admitted by any gentleman acquainted
 with nautical matters, that a seaman can seldom be assured of
his latitude to nearer than a minute; and from the fluctuations
in the horizontal refraction, and many other circumstances
connected with the taking of altitudes at sea, it may be doubted
whether an altitude taken under the most favourable circum
stances, from the sea horizon, ought to be relied on to less
than the same quantity; and with respect to stars the limits of
uncertainty will generally be much wider.
   For the purpose of showing in a simple manner, what
degree of uncertainty may exist in the longitude as deter
mined by this method at sea, I have computed the two fol
lowing tables: the first of which shows the error in the horary
angle resulting from an error of one mile in the ship's lati
tude; and the second, the error in the horary angle arising
from an error of one minute in the altitude. Both tables are
computed for every 10° of latitude and azimuth as far as 80°.
   Let H = the horary angle, H'               its
                                        increment;          the   =
                                                                  L      la
titude,  L'      increment,
               its               the altitude,
                                 a     =           its increment;
                                                            a'
and A    = the azimuth.
   Then we have the following well known equations:
                     H'=  L'.   sect   L. cot   A.
                     H' = al.   sect   L.   cosect    A.
  The first      of the following tables was computed from the
former   of   these formulae, and the second from the latter.

    In   the lunar method the uncertainty arising from this cause
would have been simply the sum of two of these numbers, one
from each table; namely, 4' 17", or 3' 20", according as the
ship time might be found from the altitude of the sun or the
II10On.
    If  in this example the latitude and altitudes could be sup
posed uncertain only a quarter of a minute, even then would
the longitude be uncertain by nearly a whole degree; an un
certainty so much greater than could possibly exist in the
result as determined by a Lunar Observation, if taken by a per
son of even the most moderate skill in observing, that simple
as the method is in theory, and easy as it would appear in
 practice, it cannot, as I think, be adopted at sea with any pro
 spect    of advantage.
    Mr. Lynn's method being liable to exactly the same prac
 tical objections as Mr. Yarrow’s, any additional remarks upon
 it would be superfluous.

                than eight years since, I undertook an investiga
 MORE     tion of the various amylaceous substances which are ob
jects of commerce, in which they are                        by the names
 of salep, sago, tapioca, and arrow-root. I gave at that period
 an account of my first researches to the Society of Pharmacy,
  and was disinclined to publish them, because several of my
  results did not appear to me to present the general cha
  racters which      I sought.    I  was then not aware of the al
  terations and adulterations which these substances are made
 to undergo in commerce.             Besides,   I  intended to attempt
  some new researches on starch or fecula, whose chemical
  characters, under certain circumstances, did not appear to me
  to be sufficiently well established, and even seemed quite un
  known.
      In 1822 I attempted some new experiments; and found some
  rather interesting facts, which       I entered in my memorandum
  book, without making any other use of them, because always        I
  hoped to be able to complete the train of research which                   I
  had in view.       Circumstances had in some degree made me

284.           M. Caventou's             Chemical Researches on Starch,
forget the results of these first experiments, when very re
cently M. Edwards showed me a memoir on fecula, published.
by M. Raspail, and inserted in a number (for December
1825) of the Annals of Natural Sciences.        must own that              I
the  reading of this memoir interested me strongly, by the cu
rious facts which it contains: but as I have observed some
which the author has not mentioned, and as we morever dif-                                                      .
fer in the manner of explaining the phaenomena, I thought
that perhaps it would not be useless to publish my investiga
tions, incomplete as they are.         -
                    Action of Water on Starch.
     I
     must premise, in detailing my experiments, that I have
always conducted them, and considered the phaenomena, under
the persuasion that fecula is an immediate, pure, and homoge
neous principle. This consideration it seems to me to be im
portant to remark.
   It is well known that cold water has no sensible action on                                               .
starch; but that when this fluid is elevated to a temperature
of from 140° to 160° Fahr., it dissolves this principle, and
forms a transparent gelatinous mass, which is generally
known by the name of empois.           What then is empois? It
 is,     we    long        told,                                                                       of

286                   M. Caventou's           Chemical Researches on Starch,
produce this compound. This is so true, that if starch is boiled
for a long while in water, care being taken to renew the latter
as it evaporates, in the manner Vogel has done, we finish
by obtaining by means of evaporation, instead of empois, a
hard, horny, transparent matter, which dissolves in cold wa
ter, and in which no sensible traces of pure starch are to be
found. It is easy to conclude, from what precedes, that in
this long ebullition the water has had time to react upon the
whole mass of starch, and to modify even the last particles of
it.
    This starch, thus modified, has already been perceived by
chemists, but it has never been made the object of a particular
study; they have always been contented with saying, that
starch, after having been dissolved in boiling water, partly re
 dissolved in cold water.
    It is only of late that M. de Saussure has designated it spe
cifically by the name of amidine, considering it as a product
 of the spontaneous decomposition of the empois.
        I
      do not, however, believe, that the origin of amidine is es
sentially the result of a spontaneous decomposition.                am per                   I
 suaded, on the contrary, that this sort of putridity of empois
 is quite foreign to the production of this substance; and it is
 sufficient to cast a glance on the process by which M. de
 Saussure extracts amidine, in order to be convinced of                                           it.     In
 fact, this philosopher obtains amidine                              by
                                                      boiling the residue

     These results make me think that iodine is really susceptible
of forming a combination with starch; and what in my mind
supports this opinion is the following fact.              the above                  If,   to

                                        the same instant these two
bodies take away the iodine from the substance which causes
the purplish colour, and produce          blue combination, whicha

                        Aqueous maceratum                   of Salep.
   This maceratum, tried by some re-agents, acts in the fol
lowing manner: it precipitates by nitrate of silver and oxalate
of ammonia; corrosive sublimate makes in it a slight cloud;
common acetate of lead produces no precipitate in it except
when the liquor is very concentrated, but the sub-acetate of
lead gives a very abundant precipitate.
   This liquor diminished by evaporation, leaves a viscous
matter which has a very great analogy with gum: it does not
change by iodine, it is precipitated in the form of white flakes
by alcohol; but it presents this small difference, that it does
not easily dissolve again in a pretty large dose of aqua-fortis.
   A portion of this matter calcined in a platina crucible,
leaves a residue from which cold water separates sea salt,
whilst acidulated water totally dissolves some remaining phos
phate of lime.
   The presence of sea salt in salep, if it be not accidental,
is rather remarkable; for in general this salt has only been
                                       I
found in sea-plants, and do not think that salep is similarly
circumstanced with these: as to the phosphate of lime which
is dissolved in a liquid not acid, we should have reason to be
astonished at       it,
                      there did not exist

 say that all the orchis roots are not of the same nature as
 salep; M. Vauquelin told me                              he
                                            had extracted from some indi
 genous orchides          considerable quantity
                              a                          fine starch, whilst      of
  M. Robiquet assured me that                              he
                                             could not extract any trace
 of  the same principle from some               the orchides   of  our coun                       of
                                                                                             º

                                       their medical properties.
     For the    purpose             of
                               throwing     some light upon the question,
I   will here   shortly    relate     process   which was
                                                 a                     out by
  M. Matthieu            of
                        Dombasle (Ann.            Chim.     lxxvii),defor pre          t.
  paring salep with indigenous orchides. The author has made
  his experiments with the orchis mascula, pyramidalis, latifolia,
  and masulata.         He clears these bulbs with care from the little
  roots and the germ, then throws them into fresh water, where

        and the different amylaceous Substances of                  Commerce.    291
he washes them; when they are well cleaned, he threads them
in the form of chaplets, and boils them in plenty of water until
 some bulbs dissolve into mucilage, which requires in general
twenty or thirty minutes.    If the ebullition has not been con
tinued long enough, the salep retains a very strong and
disagreeable taste: when the process is complete, it is either
dried in the sun, or in a stove.
   Not having had an opportunity of examining indigenous
orchides,     I
              could not establish a comparison between these
bulbs and the salep of the East; but I shall remark that
the treatment to which M. Matthieu of Dombasle has sub
jected the indigenous salep, is sufficient to indicate a great
analogy of composition between these two bodies.           It evi
dently proves that the indigenous salep is not richer in starch
than exotic salep, and that this principle is not in these bodies
the base of their nourishing properties. Besides, M. Matthieu
says himself, that the orchides submitted to his experiments
are in great part formed of a mucilaginous matter analogous
to gum tragacanth.
                                      Qf Sago.
     A certain quantity of     sago in well-chosen grains and re
duced to     powder    was   put  into maceration with cold water.
At the end of twenty-four hours, the opaline liquor, a little
mucilaginous, was filtered, and passed very clear. This liquid
acted with alcohol and nitric acid in a manner similar to that
obtained with salep; it was precipitated by the subacetate of
lead; subjected to evaporation, this fluid deposited transparent
scales, which treated by nitric acid did not give any trace of
saccholactic acid.                -
   Thus far these properties of sago have nothing decisive,
and would allow us to consider the matter dissolved by cold
water as of a nearly gummy nature; for many gums give no
mucic acid by the action of nitric acid; but what characterizes
it in a very remarkable manner,                is,
                                           that being put     contact     in
with iodine     takes
               it      a magnificent blue colour, and forms       so            a
luble iodide       cold water, but which
                  in                             other respects acts

                               starch.
    Can the presence        of
                            starch        be
                                        admitted    the liquor where
                                                               in
this matter has been dissolved, the only substance known till
now     tobecome blue       by
                           iodine? This not probable; for starch
                                                     is
is quite insoluble      cold water, unless

292          M. Caventou's                      Chemical Researches on Starch, &c.
been  made with a paper twice doubled.            Should we like
better to suppose that a gummy matter has facilitated the so
lution of a little starch, as it did with the phosphate of lime in
the salep?                 I
                shall then ask why this phaenomenon was not
manifested by the salep itself.       Besides, artificial mixtures
of great quantities of gum, either tragacanth or arabic, and of
a very little starch, put to steep in water and filtered at the
end of twenty-four hours, give a liquor purely gummy, and
in which iodine does not indicate the smallest trace of starch.
We must then necessarily conclude that sago is formed of a
variety of starch quite peculiar, which may be characterized
by      its
       solubility     cold water, and distinguished from gum
                                    in                                                                       by
the action of iodine.

           macerating for four-and-twenty hours, swelled con
siderably and remained          the bottom     the liquid; treated
                                                    at                  of

as    the first time.
        at            Submitted    last to the action of boil   at

                  have since employed the Blisterer upon many
 patients, both women and men, selecting those who had lately
 been blistered with the cantharides plaster; and they affirm,
 that the momentary endurance of the instrument is preferable
 to the former method; and where a repetition of blistering has
 since been required, those patients ask for the quick process.”
    This method of blistering consists in applying the metallic
 instrument, heated to the temperature of 212° by immersing
 the head of it in boiling water for five minutes, to the part                                   in
 tended to be blistered, previously covering the part with a
 piece of silk moistened with warm water; the instrument re
 quires to be gently pressed against the part, and if the blis
 terer has not been longer than five minutes out of the boiling
 water, the pressure need not be continued more than three or
 four seconds. The first effect is a corrugation and paleness
 of the skin;  the red blood soon returning, an inflamed red
 ness appears,   which gradually proceeds to discharge a fluid
 (the serum) and to detach the cuticle. After wiping the part
 dry it is to be covered with soft dry linen, and when the pro
 cess is completed, it must be dressed with Kirkland's Neutral
 Cerate, this being preferable to soft greasy ointments.

MEETING AT DRESDEN, of THE PROFESSORs of MEDICINE AND

   The following article occupies a considerably larger space
than we usually devote to our notices of the proceedings of
scientific societies; but it announces the formation of a union,
and describes the detail of transactions which are stamped with
a character altogether novel to this country—a consideration
which gives it more than the ordinary interest of such narra
tives, and excuses us for transgressing our usual limits.             Yet
we ought to add, that as here presented, it is only an abridge
ment of three articles from the Allgemeine &eitung, a journal
which ranks high in               department throughout Germany.

298         Meeting at Dresden, of the Professors                         of
manner. On the following year the friends assembled at Halle,
in the hall of the University; at that meeting the fertile Doe
bereiner of Jena announced his remarkable investigations re
specting platina. The third meeting was held in the lovely
vine-clad town of Wurzburg, where the worthy Outrepont
gave such active assistance; and the fourth was held, in 1825,
at Frankfort-on-the-Maine,            where the “Collections” of the
Sinkenberg Institute, magnificently enriched by the patriotic
 Ruppel, afforded a rich treat to the very numerous assem
bly, and were luminously and eloquently explained by Pro
fessor Eretschmer, who also filled the office of Secretary.
    At this meeting it was determined that the next should be
at Dresden.        The director of the Medico-chirurgical Aca
demy in that city, Seiler, was chosen to be the President, and
Professor Carus, the Secretary. The picturesque environs of
Dresden, the fine harvest-season, the museums and works of
art,  all   contributed       heighten the pleasures
                               to                                        of

Otto concerning several new facts in comparative anatomy,
Counsellor Seiler described his recent anatomical investiga
tions; Professor Munz of Landshut described the splanch
nology composed by himself and illustrated with his own
lithographic drawings.     Professor Husche of Jena, and in
particular the great master of comparative anatomy, Carus,
delivered an account of his grand discovery of the circulation
of the blood in insects: and many other anatomical and obste
trical practitioners made communications which even the un
initiated might listen to with profit and delight.
    Above all, the modern queen of sciences, chemistry, had
her fullest rights; not only in the twofold essay delivered by
 Professor Lampadius of Freiberg on the medicinal application
of carburet of sulphur; in the interesting information given by
Dr. Struve, on the composition of his mineral waters; in
Dr. Geitner's paper on the application of niccoliferous silver,
which is of such great importance to the manufacture of
pottery; but also in important communications from Profes
sors Munke, Purkinge, Scheigger, and Runge, on the manner
in which quicksilver with brine and sulphate of copper stir
 red with a small iron rod, forms rotatory crystals and hastens
 solution; and in the interchange of ideas which was freely
indulged in by many other able men in their separate depart
ments.
     A learned controversy arose respecting a dissertation by
 Professor Wilbrand, of the first importance in regard to prac
tical medicine, in which Professor Reich of Berlin with many
others expressed their doubts.           Professor Rheum's lively
essay on the abuse and use of animal magnetism would have
called forth similar discussions if time had permitted,             Dr.
 Froxiess of Weimar made some           important     communications
respecting the situation of the foetus. Many new productions
also, which yet were scarcely to be had at the booksellers', were
announced and distributed. Professor Weber's essay on the
production of the turf leech (blutegel uber torfboden;–hiru
 do stagnalis    P),
                   which now fetches       great price, had also
                                            so    a                    its

from the pressure      oftime.    It  impossible here

rise which the thermometer experienced, rendering the at
mosphere so sultry that we were reminded of the late great
heats, and which was not diminished by the peals of distant
thunder that continued to grumble during the afternoon.          At
quarter to nine o'clock in the evening, one of the grandest
celestial phaenomena that has occurred in the memory of the
oldest person was exhibited. The air was quite calm; but
there was a heaviness which indicated a surcharge of electric
matter.    A vivid glare of light, tingeing every object with a
pale blue colour, suddenly blazed forth in the heavens, ren
dering the minutest object visible as at noon-day. The eyes
of every person in the street were instantly directed to the
east, where a most sublime sight met their gaze. A large body
of fire, in shape like a jargonelle pear, and apparently of the
size of a bee-hive, was moving in a direction from S.W. to NE.
with a rushing noise, something similar to that of a rocket.
It left behind it a very long train, not of sparks, but fluid-like,
and of the most resplendent prismatic colours. It continued
visible for nearly fifteen seconds, having gone over a space of
about forty-five degrees, and descended apparently so low that
it actually seemed to approach within a hundred feet of the
earth. . Having assumed a deep crimson tint, it was extin
guished without any explosion, several pieces of red matter,
like cinders, falling perpendicularly downwards, which were
evidently the burnt remains of the nucleus.         St. Andrew's.—
On Sunday evening last, at about a quarter before nine, there
was seen in this city (St. Andrew's), a highly luminous meteor
to the south-east of the city. When it was first observed, it
had the appearance of a comet of transcendent brightness,
having a nucleus of about half a degree in diameter. It ap
peared to shoot forth in a direction from SW. to NE. over a
circular path of about 35°, and gradually diminishing in mag
nitude, until it finally disappeared.      What was perhaps most
 remarkable in this meteor     was,  that in  its
                                                orbit   did not pre

                                 MINES OF PLATINUM.
   At a meeting of the Academy of Sciences of Paris, held on
the 18th July last, Baron Humboldt communicated verbally
to the Academy the following interesting information.          -
   M. Boussingault, a celebrated French chemist, has just dis
covered a mine of platinum at Antioquia in the department of
Cundinamarca.     Hitherto this precious metal, so valuable in
the arts, had only been found in the Urals in Russia, in Bra
zil, and in the provinces of Choco and Barbacoas, on the
coasts of the South Sea, but always in alluvial lands. As this
circumstance renders the discovery of M. Boussingault much
more interesting, M. Humboldt has been anxious to establish
it.   He observes, that        all lands where platinum has been
                                      in
discovered, there are found              very great depth the trunks
                                                   at

                                              It              supposed,                   be
that,  in this  case,  transplanted     earth has been mistaken for
real rocks decomposed          situ.    With regard the platinum
                                      of in
                                                                                     to

           in                 Antioquia                          by
                                               M. Boussingault, there
can be no doubt that this metal exists there               real veins in            in
the   valley         de
                 Osos,   and       sufficient

                                               in                 to
washing, the gold and the platinum which they contain.                                                     :
   M. Humboldt had not himself visited the country where
M. Boussingault has discovered the platinum and gold; but
experience has proved           him that almost all the auriferous
                                       to
soils  of America belong                 to

 which       composed             of

 At first sight, might pass for new mineral; but Professor

 the compact fractured surface.          Measurement proved, that
 the hyalosiderite          variety
                            is
                            a          chrysolite, but    of        state

the difference       chemical composition from chrysolite.

that the open cleavages remained but little affected. This
is  most striking with the felspar family,             orthoklase, which,as   in

     HYPOTHESIS    REGARDING              MAGNETISM.             BY DR.   Büchner.
    “There are still,” says Dr. Büchner, “so many obscure
things in the phaenomena of magnetism, that it would be rash
to present any explanation of these phaenomena, otherwise than
as a mere hypothesis.         We may admit as demonstrated, that
the magnetic influences are as extensive in their operation as
light, caloric, and electricity, but that they are in a state of
reciprocal neutralization, which prevents their being made
sensible.      There is but a small number of bodies which have
the property of breaking this state of equilibrium, and mani
 festing north and south polarities.           Among these we distin
guish the loadstone, iron, steel, nickel, cobalt, &c. To what
is this remarkable property owing?              Is it to a peculiar cry
stallization of these     bodies,  or rather to some defect of equili
brium in their chemical constitution? Of this we are ignorant.
It seems to me, that it may be admitted, that, as light ema
nates from the sun toward the earth, magnetism in return
emanates from the earth toward the sun, in a state of neutra
lization in the equatorial zone, which receives the greatest
 quantity of light, and in a state of polarization toward the poles
of the globe, which receive the least of                      it.
                                                          cannot    It                  be   re
fused   to  admit, that light, caloric, electricity and magnetism,
are   in   acertain mutual relation                of
                                             causality: the question                         is
merely, what      is this relation? The following hypothesis ap
pears       me the most simple and most natural.
           to
   “The planets receive from the sun light and electricity                                   in
the neutral state; they decompose these principles, and repro
duce,      intheir turn, caloric, and the two polarized electric
principles.      But caloric dilates bodies, and breaks              them          in
the   equilibrium       their cohesion, and
                       of                          their chemical con

stitution. Then caloric itself undergoes            modification, which
                                                              a
is still enigmatical        us,

                                                                     is
into magnetism.         All ponderable bodies are conductors                                 of
magnetism, for which they appear              have little affinity.
                                                       to                                Or
ganized and living bodies, such               our own, are sensible
                                                   as                                        to
light and heat; but we want             sense for the magnetism with
                                              a
which we are       constantly   surrounded and penetrated: hence
the   difficulty  ofunderstanding      this agent aright.            inha If       we
bited the sun, perhaps,          place
                                  in         sense for perceiving light,

we should possess       a sense for perceiving magnetism.
    “In the     present  hypothesis,    magnetism would not emanate
from the earth      only,   but also from        bodies all          in

earth itself, considered in this point of view, is nothing else
than a great thermo-magnetic apparatus; and, 2dly, the cir
cumstance that, in the most elevated regions of the earth's at
mosphere which man has hitherto been able to attain, the
magnetic needle remains as strongly polarized as at the very

surface of the globe.
    “Further, if we reason according to the ordinary laws of
mature, we cannot regard it as probable that the planets, placed
as they are right opposite to the sun, act an entirely passive
part. We see every where in the universe mutual changes
taking place; why should the sun, on            part,            its

                                  supersaturated   with light and heat.
Now, this       what we
                  is          not see dohappening.        appears      me        It                  to

and fore-scuttle were taken off, when a suffocating smell of
fire and clouds of smoke began to issue from both places.
On going into the fore-hold, and clearing away the goods near
the hatchway, found that a large cask of lamp-black in the star
board wing had taken fire, and was giving out dense columns
of smoke; the cask, although not in a blaze, was too hot to be
handled. All the ship's company and passengers were instantly
employed in handing down water and wet blankets, the latter
being found of the greatest use in stifling the smoke: these
enabled the officers and people in the hold, who were indefa
tigable in their exertions, to remove the surrounding articles,
chiefly large jars of linseed and neats'-foot oil, which were
immediately hoisted on deck by the prompt assistance of the
passengers, and at the same time a constant supply of water
passed down the hatchway; and although the people in the
hold were frequently driven back by the strong suffocating
 smell, they at last succeeded in getting the cask, which was
on fire and muffled by wet blankets, brought to the hatchway;
this was instantly hoisted on deck and thrown overboard, be
fore it had completely ignited or burst into a flame; had it
done so in the hold, instant destruction must have inevitably
followed, it being surrounded by 200 barrels of tar, and up
wards of eighty large jars of oil. As no apparent cause could
be assigned for this catastrophe-as no leak either from the
deck or from any of the jars could be perceived, and as no light
had ever been suffered in the hold since leaving England,-
it was reasonable to conclude that spontaneous combustion
must have taken place in the cask.      And as there were many
more casks of the same material on board, it was considered
absolutely necessary for the safety of the ship and cargo, as
well as the lives of the crew and passengers, to throw the
whole overboard.                                                -

            ON OIL IN HUMAN      BLOOD, BY DR. ADAM. .
   The following brief notice may prove interesting, as it re
lates to a peculiarity in the human subject, which I have not."
hitherto met with ; nor do I remember to have read of a similar
occurrence in medical writings. The body of Serjeant Mac
donald was sent from the garrison to the general hospital, for
inspection; as certain circumstances had created a suspicion

in the morning lying dead on his couch. He had had a quar

comrades, and, it was currently surmised, had met with his
death by violence through their means.             Under this impres

and a report made of the appearances on dissection.                                                                        ...

head and neck. On removing the scull-cap, some blood, which

 the  splendid  collection of shells, formed by the late Earl of
 Tankerville, is about to be offered to the public. This match
less Collection, together with a large addition from several
other collections, consisting in the whole of about four thou
 sand species, and more than forty thousand specimens, will
 soon, we understand, be brought forward for sale, by public
 auction, by Mr. G. B. Sowerby. Mr. S. has circulated a plan
 for the disposal of this collection, affording peculiar advan
 tages to scientific collectors, copies of which may be obtain
ed at 156 Regent Street, where the collections are exhibiting.
                     NAVIGATION       OF THE RHINE.
    From a paper in the Allgemeine Zeitung and other sources,
 we have collected a few facts respecting the navigation of this
 celebrated river—a subject on which our common geographical
 books gives us no information. The Rhine rises in Switzer
 land, and after a course of 700 miles falls into the sea in        Hol
 land, passing through, or touching, the territories of Baden,
 Bavaria, Darmstadt, Nassau, and Prussia. The basin of the
                                                                   river,

 and at the peace they found means to keep possession of what
 they had stolen.      In the small district between Mentz and
  Coblentz, which, with the windings of the river, hardly makes
 27 (German) miles, you don’t pay less than nine tolls.       Be
 tween Holland and Coblentz, there are at least sixteen. Every
 one of these seldom produces less than 25,000 or 30,000 guilders
 a year.” The tolls were not levied for supporting beacons and
 removing shoals, or for any other purpose useful to commerce;
 but were, in general, a sort of black-mail, or premium paid
 by the merchant to escape being plundered. What was rob
 bery at first,-time, which consecrates so many abuses, has
 improved into vested rights; and of course, if the trade of
 the river is to be released from these burdens, the fee-simple
 must be bought up by the State, or compounded for in some
 other way. So much is trade shackled by these vexatious im
 posts, that the exports of fourteen millions of people by the
 river, amounts only, according to the German editor, to six
 millions of guilders (600,000l.), and the imports to forty mil
 lions (4,000,000l.). This is marvellously little, when we recol
lect that the inhabitants of Rhenish Germany are among the
 most industrious and civilised in continental Europe, even
though we allow (what is not probable) that half of the forei
trade of the country is carried on through other channels. The
exports and imports of Pennsylvania alone, with one million of
inhabitants, exceed this sum. As for the internal trade, which
is equally burdened with the foreign, the German editor gives
no estimate of its amount; but from the scattered notices to
be found in travellers, we know that it has long been in a
languid and depressed state. The Hudson, flowing through a
country inhabited by less than two millions of people, was na
vigated by 2,000 sloops some years ago.        We question if the
Rhine has nearly as many at this day. And no less than 78
steam-boats plied on the Mississippi, at a time (1823) when a
single vessel of the kind had never been seen on the Rhine.—

Results  of a Meteorological Journal for September 1826, kept at

   General Observations.—From a review of the weather this
month, we find that it has been alternately wet and dry, it
having rained on 15 days, on some of which heavy showers
fell here; and the depth at the ground is half an inch more
than fell in the three preceding months.            The rain was often
accompanied with early equinoctial gales, but in general it was
so warm as to be very beneficial to vegetation, and to the
rapid growth of grass; insomuch that the grass-lands in this
neighbourhood are now clad with verdure equal in appearance
.#    quantity to that in the middle of a warm spring.             Early
in the  mornings    of the  11th,  12th,  and   13th, there were slight
hoar frosts; the temperature of the external air, however,                       É.
 been pretty uniform throughout the period, and the mean is 1%
 degree higher than the mean of September for the last 10 years.
      he temperature of spring water is nearly at             its
                                                               marimum
 height, and,        as
                   usual     this time
                                at         the year, almost

 but warmer than         has been since the autumnal equinox
                           it                                                     in
 1822; consequently the ground            is warmer than       has been
                                                              it
 since that  year.
    The last dry and hot summer has produced greater crops
of  grapes throughout the country, than has been seen for many
 years past: the best white and black grapes have been sold                       in
 our market       two-pence per pound; and good apples
                    at                                                six   at
 pence per gallon.
    The swallows have congregated here since the middle                           of
 the month, and the last bevy migrated              on
                                                   the 27th instant, for

XLVII.      On the Grounds for adopting the Ellipticity of the
    Earth deduced by Captain SABINE from his Experiments
    with the Pendulum in his Work lately published.  By JAMEs
    Ivory,      Esq.   M.A. F.R.S.*
         HE
          experiments with the pendulum are now very nu
      merous; and as different ellipticities may be deduced from
different combinations of them, it becomes a question, How
we are to distinguish the true ellipticity, from others that may
be occasioned merely by accidental irregularities.              We do
not here allude to small changes in the ellipticity, of the same
order as the unavoidable errors of observation, which must
occur in different combinations of the most accurate experi
ments; but to such considerable variations as may lead to dif
ferent opinions about the figure of the earth.
   Suppose we have 25 independent experiments, that being
the number we owe to the labours of M. Biot, Captain Kater,
and Captain Sabine.        By applying the method of the least
squares, an ellipticity is obtained which, we will allow, repre-.
sents     all
          the 25 experiments better than any other.             But the
experiments employed          the calculation are much more nu
                                      in
merous than        necessary for determining the figure
                   is                                               the               of
earth.        If

an it,

    advantage       combining
                       in             great number, provided they
                                               a

322                 Mr. Ivory       on the       Ellipticity of the Earth
upon applying the general formula for the length of the pen
dulum which has been deduced from the whole of the experi
ments, to every individual case, the discrepancies of calcula
tion will show the consistency of the experiments, and will en
able us to judge of the degree of accuracy with which they
are represented by one figure. But on the other hand, it may
be alleged that the mean figure deduced from a great num
ber of experiments may be considerably different from the
true figure belonging to the consistent observations alone;
and that the discrepancies of calculation are therefore not
an unexceptionable means of forming a just notion of the dis
tribution of gravity on the earth's surface, and of the anoma
lies to which it is subject.         In one case only there is no doubt
that the mean       figure  coincides with the true one; and that                                is,
when all the errors                of
                              calculation are small, and            the same          of

without admitting great errors. This discordance is not to be
accounted for by the particular magnitude assigned to the ellip
ticity. It is a real inconsistency that cannot be removed by any
probable change in that element. To prove this we need onl
compare the lengths of the pendulums at the six stations,
the lengths determined on the neighbouring parallels of latitude.
   Having now laid down some principles by which our re
searches are to be guided, we proceed to consider the grounds
for adopting the ellipticity assigned to the earth by Captain
Sabine in his late work.                        It
                                must be observed that we do not
here discuss the merits of the observer, or the accuracy of his
operations. Our reasoning is founded upon the experiments
as they have been laid before the public.        While the facts
remain the same, we do not conceive       that our arguments can
                                     -

   The conclusions of Captain Sabine will be found to rest
ultimately upon his experiments near the equator.        Seven of
his stations are within less than 20° of the equatorial circle,

   The extreme irregularity of these experiments is imme
diately apparent. The pendulum at Trinidad, 10% from the
equator, is very considerably less than the equatorial pendu
lum at St. Thomas.    But in order to judge more distinctly of
the discrepancies, it will be proper to deduce the equatorial
pendulum belonging to every individual experiment. We

   Now the numbers in this Table should be nearly equal, if the
seven experiments were consistent, and belonged to the same
elliptical figure. This, however, is so far from being the case,
that we may discern three different systems in the lengths it
contains. One derived from the experiments at Ascension
and St. Thomas, having an equatorial pendulum about 39°02;
another with an equatorial pendulum about 39.015, compre
hending Bahia, Sierra Leone, and Jamaica; and a third com
prehending Maranham and Trinidad, with an equatorial nearly
         .
equal to 39.0117.                   If
                              we adopt the last determination and
combine it with the experiments at the stations of the Trigo
nometrical Survey in Great Britain, we shall obtain an ellipti
city        little different from that generally received; if we
prefer the second and combine it in the same manner, the re
sulting ellipticity will be very nearly the same with what Cap
tain Sabine has deduced from his calculations; and lastly, if
we combine the first equatorial pendulum, namely 39-02, with
the same experiments, we shall get an ellipticity still greater
than that assigned by Captain Sabine. But it may be said
that we ought to adopt the mean equatorial pendulum, re
sulting from             all
                     the seven experiments,        preference      any
                                                                   in              to        of
the three particular systems above-mentioned.              Now this will
 be found      make the pendulum

which       hardly
              is      different from the second           the foregoing of
lengths, and almost coincides with the result which Captain
Sabine has uniformly deduced from                                all
                                                  the combinations                           of
his experiments.
   The observations that have been made unvail the whole
mystery       Captain Sabine's investigations. They disclose the
               of
real reason        that uniformity and consistency
                        of                                  result which of

posed ellipticity.           must It  observed, bethat  Captain   Sabine
has employed                 no
                        tropical experiments except his own, and
that these are constituent part

                                                      in

obtains can             be
                   very little different from what they would be,                            if
the mean            of
                 the equatorial pendulums was immediately com
bined with the northern experiments.                happens that,  It we                if

                                                the northern stations
are tolerably consistent; and hence            follows that nearly the
same   ellipticity     brought

is   amultiplicity             of

 objections. But we have his own authority at p. 359, founded
 upon a more extensive comparison of facts, that the equatorial
 pendulum is 39:01, and not 39.0156; and this new length
 being combined with the northern experiments, will bring out
 an ellipticity about 0.0326, the same with that generally re
 ceived. As the mean quantity 39-01 is fixed and determinate,
 the natural conclusion seems to be, that "00326, which depends

INtioned
      my letter to Sir Gilbert Blane upon blistering, &c., men
           in your last Magazine,                         I
                                     have endeavoured to unite
clearness with brevity; and it was my wish to distinguish a
scald from a burn, to prevent practical mistakes in employing
the heated metallic instrument.
   The important difference between a scald and a burn is
this. A simple scald arising from the momentary application
of boiling water ought to be limited to that inflammatory ex
citement of the skin which produces a discharge of serum un
der the scarf skin, and this effect closely resembles a blister
occasioned by cantharides;–but in the case of a burn, the
higher degree or longer continuance of the heat corrugates
the true skin, and thus                   its
                           vascular structure   spoiled, and                      is                         an

LI.   An Account of a new Catalogue of Stars, recently published
              by the Astronomical Society    of London.
            catalogue contains the mean places (reduced to Ja
THIS  nuary 1, 1830) of nearly three thousand principal stars:
together with the logarithms of certain constants for deter
mining their precession, aberration and nutation; and by the
help of which, those quantities may be computed with much
greater ease and expedition than by any other method hitherto
made known.          An introduction is prefixed to the tables, by
 Mr.  Baily,  President of the Society, explanatory of their con
struction and use: and from which we select the following
passages:
    “Special tables, for computing the aberration and nutation
of particular stars, have for a long time been used by astro
nomers. The first distinct publication of this kind was by
M. Mezger; who published at Manheim in 1778, his Tabulae
Aberrationis et Nutationis for 352 stars.         There had, how
ever, previously to that period, appeared in the volumes of
the Connaissance des tems from 1760 to 1774, several tables of
a similar kind, and containing many of the same stars: which
tables,  M. Jeaurat     subsequently  collected together, and pub
lished in   the Con. des tems for 1781.        They were afterwards
revised by M. Delambre, and published (252 in number) in
the Con. des tems for 1789–1791. An addition of 116 stars
was made in the Con. des tems for 1802; and a further addi
tion of 142 stars, in the same work for 1806: thus making the
total number 510.        In the Ephemerides de Vienne for the years
1784 and     1785,    M. Pilgram published special tables for 500
stars: but they are said to contain so many errors that it is
unsafe to use them.        In the year 1807, two other sets of spe
cial tables  appeared,    comprising  nearly the same stars as those
already alluded to: one by M. Cagnoli, containing 501 stars:
the other by Baron Zach, containing 494 stars. The former
is entitled Catalogue de 501 etoiles, suivi des tables relatives

 Tabulae Speciales Aberrationis et Nutationis, &c. Gotha, 1807:
2 vols, octavo.     In this last-mentioned work, the second vo
lume only is devoted to the tables of aberration and nutation;
 and each star occupies a whole page. The first volume con
 tains much useful information connected with the same sub
ject, and many other valuable tables.              -
    “Hitherto the attention of astronomers had been confined
 to about five hundred of the principal stars: and in this state
 the subject remained till the year 1812, when some new tables,
differently constructed and of a more general kind, were pub
lished by Baron Zach. These are the most comprehensive
as well as the most convenient set of tables, which have                               hi
 therto been formed for such computations.        They are entitled
 Nouvelles tables d’Aberration et de Nutation    pour   1440 etoiles;
 and were published at Marseilles in 1812, in one volume oc
 tavo.    But, in these tables, the solar nutation, as well as some
 other minute quantities, are wholly omitted: and although
 that celebrated author has given a rule (in page 26) whereby
we may approximate to the value of the solar nutation, yet
that rule is not strictly correct, and ought not to be resorted
 to in the present state of the science.                    *
   “I   would  observe,  that when we wish to    compute      the aber
ration and nutation by the tables of Baron Zach, here alluded

    “The mode by which this great saving of time and labour
is  obtained, has been, in some measure, already explained by
me in the    Philosophical  Magazine for October 1822; and the
plan, which was first published by Professor Bessel, has been
partially acted on by Professor Schumacher in his Astrono
mische Hilfstafeln for the same year. The tables of M. Schu
macher, however, comprehend little more than two-thirds of
the first class, only, of the stars to which I
lude; and do not exceed five hundred in number.

    “The stars, which form the subject of the present tables,
consist of the three following classes:

tuated within 30° of the equator.
    “3°. All the stars, to the seventh magnitude inclusive,    si
tuated within 10° of the ecliptic.
    “This selection, it is presumed, will form one of the most
useful catalogues for practical astronomy that can well be sug
gested.    It contains all the stars of the above description,
which have been observed (with sufficient accuracy for deter
mining their present positions) by Flamsteed, Bradley, La
Caille, Mayer, Piazzi, and Zach.”                                -
    Mr. Baily then proceeds to explain the mode by which the
stars have been brought up by precession; and likwise the
method of forming the general tables of precession, aberration,
and mutation: illustrating the same by suitable examples.
    When the catalogue was finished, it became desirable to
ascertain how far the mean places of the stars (which had
been brought up from the observations of Bradley and Piazzi
by means of the proposed formula) could be depended upon.
With this view a comparison was made with the places of the
 36 Greenwich stars that have been observed and reduced at
different times by Messrs. Bessel, Brinkley, and Pond; and
 which is inserted at the end of the work.

tract into the lower half of the receiver, until, by the approxi
mation of their particles, the vapour there existing should
have an elasticity equal to the force of gravity to which it was
subject.    This is a necessary consequence of Dr. Wollaston's
argument.
   There is yet another method of diminishing the elasticity
of vapour, namely, by diminution of temperature.                  With re
spect to the most elastic substances, as air, and many gases,
the comparatively small range which we can command be
neath common temperatures, does nothing more at the earth's
surface than diminish in a slight degree their elasticity, though
two or three of them, as                         acid and chlorine, have
been in    part  condensed into      liquids.   . But with respect to                   in
numerable bodies, their tendency to form vapour is so small,
that at common temperatures the vapour produced approxi
mates in rarity to the air upon the limits of our atmosphere;
and with these, the power we possess of lessening tension by
diminution of temperature, may be quite sufficient to render

converted into vapour: lower the temperature, and before the
metal falls beneath          white heat, the tension

                                  existence becomes      inappreciable    by
the most delicate tests.        Suppose,    however,     that  portions  are
formed, and that vapour                of

 at least of the general gravity of the earth, which appears to
 me sufficient to overcome a certain degree of vaporous elas

    The preceding experiments may be made with iodine, and
many other substances; and indeed there is no case of distinct
 crystallization by sublimation” which does not equally afford
evidence of the power of the solid matter, to overcome a posi

are formed. The same power, or the force of aggregation, is
also illustrated in crystallizing solutions; where the solution
has a tendency to deposit upon a crystal, when it has not the
same tendency to deposit elsewhere.
   It may be imagined that crystallization would scarcely go
on from these attenuated vapours, as it does in the denser
states of the vapours experimented upón.; There              however,             is,

 significant, the same numbers, about 003 less than according
 to M. de Freycinet, should express the length of the pendu

 tion of the  pendulum      at this station by the Spanish navigators,
 whose experiments are calculated by M. Mathieu in the Con.
 des Tems, 1816*; from which the frºm comes out equal to
  39.07682, or 00364, less than M. de Freycinet's experiment.
 We must therefore be allowed to demur a little with respect
  to the accuracy of the pendulum at Port Jackson; for accord

 apply the usual remedy of local,attraction.
. At the Isle of France and at Guam and Mowi, the errors
 appear enormous.        But it ought to be observed, that these
 errors are not the creations of my formula, which, in reality,
 represents the actual experiments with the same correctness
 as if the errors had been very small. If the pendulum beating
 seconds at the Isle of France be transported to Rio Janeiro,
 in the same hemisphere and nearly on the same parallel, it

in the charge of a military party, to an island, Gaunsau Lout,
off the coast of Sumatra, in lat. 0° 1' 49" north. During the
whole time of the experiment the weather seems to have been
very unfavourable to great accuracy in such delicate opera
tions. Dropping useless figures, the length of the pendulum,
as finally computed by Captain Goldingham, is 39-02126 at,
70° Fahr., at which temperature the pendulum at London is
39-14243; wherefore at 62°Fahr., when the London pendu
lum is 39°13929, the pendulum at the equator must be
39.01812 or '00598 longer than at Maranham 24° south of
the equator and about 14.1° of longitude westward; and '00332
longer than at Rawak, on the equator, and 35° eastward.
Captain Goldingham makes a small correction of his former.
determination of the pendulum at Madras, of no great mo
ment; he then deduces the ellipticity by combining the cor
rected length with the pendulum at London; and, of this cal
culation, he remarks in a note, that the pendulum at the equa.
tor by computation is different from the measured one,
-00497740, which long number  -       we may safely shorten to 005
of an inch.
    What, then, is the conclusion we are to draw from the
whole of this discussion ? The number of stations at which
experiments have been made is now 39; and, of these, 28 con
cur in giving the same figure to the earth with very small dis
crepancies; but if we take the whole indiscriminately, and
make certain combinations of them, we may obtain any ellip
ticity we choose.       By what rule or principle are we to group,
the  experiments    so as to obtain some consistent knowledge of
the figure of the earth and of the distribution of gravity on                                    its
surface?        Is    it   to   be

   Thus I received some sago which had only a very slight
degree  of solubility in cold water, and some which had none
at all. M. Boutron gave me also at the same time three sam
ples of tapioca; one came from the islands, and he supposed
the other two to be factitious; that is to say, to have been
fabricated in France.    The tapioca of the islands was acted
on   by cold water like that which had been the subject of my
experiments: as to the factitious specimens, they appeared to
be composed of two distinct substances; the one was in round,
transparent, and pretty regular grains; the other, in very irre
gular, larger, opaque grains, presented     the counterfeit ap             all
pearance     the tapioca
                 of         the isles.    of
   These two substances have been isolated and put         con                                        in

   This experiment proves, in my opinion, that the grains of
fecula are not endowed with a porosity great enough to permit
the absorption of iodine into the interior of their substance:
and that as the chemical action is very feeble between these two
bodies, there is no disaggregation of the amylaceous molecule,
which then preserves          primitive form; but
                                            its                   reason                         is    no

manner, and he always obtained the same result. Such n fact
gave too rude a blow to the principal idea of the author for
him not to verify it in every way: he had also recourse to his
microscope, which enabled him to perceive in the gummy                                                     li
quid a great number of integuments; and as these are the cause
of the colouration, the fact, contradictory in appearance, was
found quite natural; and it even offered to the author an ad
ditional motive to persist in his view.              We then find M.
Raspail convinced that the integumentary part alone becomes
blue by iodine, and that if the gummy part partakes of this
property, it is by means of this last drawn through the pores of
the filter.
                                       I
    With regard to this, shall observe, that if things took place
                                                                                                           li

thus, the blue colouring by iodine ought to decrease in the
quor with the number of the integuments.
    And yet M. Raspail says: that since the microscope only
indicated to him at the most the presence of one integument in
a square inch, he had only to pour some iodine in his liquid,
and it became quite as blue as with the fecula itself: it is neces
sary then to conclude from             appears  it,   as

                             do not doubt but that these globules
contain, like salts, a water of crystallization.

         had to examine the fine flour of wheat in order to com
pare the molecules of it with those of the potatoe; they are
smaller, and are rendered more irregular, by globules and by
shapeless molecules in the wheat.              I cut some transversal
slices   very  thin of a   grain of  wheat;   round and very uniform
globules then appeared, but three times smaller than the
globules of the potatoe; for they were only from gºt to rag of
a line in diameter.       Neither hair-powder, nor starch in empois,

gradually diminish in height, until in the former direction they
unite with the sandstone and clay slate mountains of the Go
davery near Palánshah.         Their union is certainly not very
distinct, but is sufficiently so to entitle them to be considered
geologically as the same range.       In a southern and S.W.                              di
rection, they probably extend considerably beyond the Pagoda
of Tripati. The most southern point that has fallen under
my observation is Naggery Nose, a well known sea-mark on
the coast of Coromandel. Travellers to Hyderabad make a
considerable detour for the purpose of crossing these moun
tains in their most accessible parts. Among the western passes
on the Cuddapah road are those of Bakrapet and Moorcondah
on the bank of the Kistna, and those of Nakrikul and Warripalli
on the Ongole road are among the eastern. The breadth of
the range varies, but never exceeds 50 miles.
   The geological structure of these mountains it is difficult
to understand, and it cannot be easily explained by either the
Huttonian or Wernerian theories.          The different rocks of
which    they  are composed,    being  so mixed together without
regard to order of position, each in        turn being uppermost,

and grains of sand.                         It
                              is very likely that this stratum would
be found productive in diamonds; and             have no doubt, that       I
those found at      present   in the bed of the Kistna, have been
washed down from these their native beds, during the rainy
season*.       In the alluvial soil of the plains at the base of this
range of mountains, and particularly on or near the banks of
the rivers Kistna and Pennar, are situated the imines which
have produced the largest diamonds in the world.                 Amon
them are the famous mines of Golcondah, so called from their
being situated in the dominions of the sovereigns of Golcondah,
although they are far distant from the hill fort of that name,
from which the province and Cooteb Shahi dynasty took their
title. They were once very numerous (at least twenty in num
ber), and Gani Parteala, situated about three miles from the
left bank of the Kistna, was the most famous.           They are now,
with the exception of two or three, quite deserted, and the
names of several of those mentioned by Tavernier are forgot
ten. In none have fresh excavations been dug for many years;
although much ground remains unopened, and many spots
might be pointed out for new and productive mines.
    Even at Gani Parteala the search is confined to the rubbish
of the old mines: at Atcár, Chintapalli, Barthenypard and at
 Oustapalli,               all
                   situated within two      three miles

376     Mr. Voysey   on the Diamond Mines   of Southern India.
upper stratum, it is mixed with masses and rounded pebbles
of sandstone, quartz rock, jasper, flinty slate, granite and large
amorphous masses of a calcareous conglomerate, bearing no
mark of attrition from the action of running water. In this
stratum the diamond and other precious stones are found.
The excavations are of various size, but from 15 to 20 feet
deep.
   †e labourers     are a little more under controul than at Ban
ganpali, and they pay a trifling duty to the Nizam's agent
stationed in the village.     The mode of search is precisely the
same as that above described.
   The mines of Ovatampalli and of Canparti on the right and
left banks of the Pennar near Cuddapet, are in an alluvial soil
of nearly the same nature; it is not quite so black, from the
greater admixture of debris of sandstone and clayslate.
   In many parts of the plain of Nandiala, diamonds were
formerly sought for, but the mines have for a long time ceased
to be productive.
   The failure of the mines of the Dekhin may perhaps be
principally attributed to the cheapness and plenty of Brazil
diamonds.     Otherwise, from the vast extent of the rock in
which   they are found in India, there are scarcely any limits to
the search for them.      It may be assumed then :
   1st. That the matrix of the diamonds produced in southern
India, is the sandstone breccia of the “clay slate formation.”
   2d. That those found in alluvial soil are produced from the
debris of the above rock, and have been brought thither by
some torrent or deluge, which could alone have transported
such large masses and pebbles from the parent rock, and that
no modern or traditional inundation has reached to such an
extent.                             -
   3d. That the diamonds found at present in the beds of the
rivers are washed down by the annual rains.
   It will be an interesting point to ascertain if the diamonds
of Hindustan can be traced to a similar rock. It may also be
in the power of others more favourably situated than the writer,
to ascertain, if there be any foundation for the vulgar opinion
of the continual growth of the diamond. Dr. Brewster's opi
nion is rather in favour of it than otherwise. It is certain
that in these hot climates crystallization goes on with wonder
ful rapidity, and    hope at    some future periodto produce un
deniable   proofs of Ithe                   of
                           re-crystallization    amethyst, zeolite
and felspar, in  alluvial soil.

   Nov. 21.—Part of a paper was read, intitled Remarks on
the comparative anatomy of certain birds of Cuba, with a view
to their respective places in the System of Nature, or to their
relations with other animals. By W. S. MacLeay, F.L.S. &c.
  In the introductory part of this paper the author (who is at
present resident in the islandof Cuba) insists on the great
importance of studying comparative anatomy and natural ar
rangement in connection with each other, so that in the ex
amination of particular organs the place held in nature by
the animal to which they belong may be also investigated.
The principles of arrangement laid down in Aristotle's                Hi
storia Animalium are then examined with reference to the
principle, introduced by Mr. MacLeay, of studying the varia
tion of structure in different animals in preference to classing
them according to an arbitrary division of organs.                         S

   A paper was read entitled, “Additional remarks on the
nature and character of the limestone and slate composing
principally the rocks and hills round Plymouth,” by the Rev.
Richard Hennah, F.G.S.
   The author refers to his former paper on this subject, in
which he confined his field of observation to the narrow tract
between the     Plym and the Tamar;--he now extends            its
                                                          limits

                                                in   a
tion.     Inthis tract which forms the east side          of
                                                      Plymouth
 Sound,    aswell  as the western side from Mount   Edgcombe
to Pudding Point, animal remains are imbedded         the slate.
                                                          in
 On the eastern side the superior beds are occasionally               of
an   ochreous clay-slate containing thin veins            of
                                                     iron with
trochites and stems of encrinites: these are associated with
some peculiar fossil remains, which the author can assign             to
           they resemble the head     some plant
                                       of                 or

used for pavements,   and fragments of the same animal relics
are discoverable in                    it:

   From the above facts the author infers, that the slate which
   prolonged beyond the Plymouth limestone, even

              Royal Geological Society of Cornwall.            383
council's attention, has been enlarged by the addition of an
other cabinet extending the whole length of one of the galle
ries: this has afforded sufficient space for the exhibition of
several series of foreign specimens, which have been arranged
by the curator with his usual neatness and judgement. The
attainment of this object will afford but little interest to the
scientific stranger; but to our native students it is of great im
portance, as displaying examples of the various and dissimilar
mineral productions of our globe. To our constant and libe
ral correspondent, Wm. Maclure, Esq. of Philadelphia, we
are indebted for another donation of minerals from the United
States of America; consisting of various modifications of ser
pentine, of augite, maclurite, franklinite, red oxide of zinc, and
other interesting specimens.       Doctor Jer. Van Rensselaer, of
New    York,  has presented to the Society several earthy and me
tallic minerals,  which are peculiarly specified in the report of
donations.
   Capt. Wallis, of Bodmin, has also presented a series of
specimens illustrative of the geology of the country between
Hydrabad and Madras, accompanied by a descriptive account
of the same, together with a map of this part of the peninsula
of India.
   To the kind contributions of     several members, in compli
ance with the request     made at the last annual meeting, the
geological department has been recently indebted for many
specimens of granite: but the varieties of this interesting for
mation are so numerous, that many - more would be equally
acceptable.
    The department of simple minerals has also been enriched
by the purchase in Cumberland of a series of splendid fossils,
consisting of variously crystallized
                                       #.      blende, fluor spar,
sulphate of barytes, arragonite, and other minerals.
   Before concluding, the council take this opportunity of so
liciting further donations from those members who have pri
vate collections: many may have refrained from presenting
their spare duplicates, on the ground that our museum already
possesses better specimens of the same kind: these however
would be very acceptable, and would enable the Society to
comply with the repeated applications that have been made
by institutions, both at home and abroad, for an exchange of
minerals.
    Lastly, The council propose for the consideration of the ge
neral meeting the propriety of expending a portion of their
income in the collection of geological specimens; thereby
promoting the objects of the Society by enlarging the know
ledge of our rock formations, and collecting several pieces of
                                 -                              the

the same rocks for the purpose of exchanges.           Simple cry
stalline minerals cannot be obtained to any great extent, but
at prices very far exceeding, our funds, and indeed such
Cornish minerals may be found in the collections of         exten                         all

divided into two species, the scaly and compact; their names
depending on the relative size of the grains disclosed on their
fracture, or, according to Mohs, “the former comprehending
those which are still discernible, while in the latter they are
withdrawn from observation.”       According to this definition,
the  Himalayan   mineral  belongs to the       of compact gra
phites.
  The Himalayan graphite is found on the surface of a hill
composed of highly carburetted mica slate, a locality which
corresponds with that of Aberdeenshire and other countries,
according to Mohs, Jameson, and other mineralogists.
  Graphite varies so much in specific gravity, that it is im

     Although the specific gravity is not of itself a sufficient cri
 terion, it is found to bear a general relation to the purity of
 the mineral; and the Borrowdale and Spanish varieties, which
 contain the largest proportion of carbon, have the lowest spe
 cific gravity.    In the same manner, of the Himalayan speci
 mens, Nos. 1 and 2, which are the lightest, present the finest
grain, and are freest from earthy admixture; and the speci
 mens from Ava and Ceylon approximate to Borrowdale gra
phite, both in weight and external character. None of the
 specimens of the Himalayan graphite have a metallic lustre
unless scraped, and it is then of inferior brilliancy to the other
varieties.    The smallest nodules have the finest grain, and make
the blackest streak: by boiling in oil, the streak is deepened
in colour and rendered softer. These nodules are hollow in
the centre; the larger pieces have a slaty fracture, and exhibit
a considerable proportion of siliceous admixture. The smaller
specimens, deflagrated with nitre, afforded indications of earthy
matter, as did the larger in more considerable proportion.
The best specimens left a residuum of oxide of iron of 52 per
cent; and about a similar proportion, or 5 per cent, was left
after roasting for five hours.     There had not been time for a
regular analysis, but Dr. A. considers the following as the
mineralogical characters of the graphite of the Himalaya, taking
the smaller specimens as a standard. Its colour is charcoal
black; it occurs in rounded and angular fragments; internally
it is barely glistening, externally dull and earthy;        fracture         its

    very fine grained. The fragments are angular;             streak

   This stone when placed in the dark exhibits a very re

the temperature is raised. Its lustre, catteris paribus, becomes
greater if it is immersed in water. M. Becquerel, having put
it into boiling water, found that it became so bright that he

 Leay, “has been able to give so connected and symmetrical
an outline of what he considers to be the natural distribution
of Fungi, as, at least in my opinion, to merit the careful atten

of the Linnaean Transactions, Mr. MacLeay has successfully
proved the same laws to be applicable to the natural distribu

Results  of a Meteorological Journal for October 1826, kept at
     the Observatory of the Royal Academy, Gosport, Hants.
  General Observations.—With             the exception of two or three
days, the weather this month has been generally calm and
      for the season: the state of the atmosphere, however,
has been often humid and suddenly condensed by crossing
currents of wind, which induced frequent, but not heavy
showers       of rain.
     Between the maximum temperature of the air of the 6th                          in
stant, which was the coldest day, and that of the 11th, there
was a difference of 16 degrees: and the difference in the mi
nimum temperature of the nights of the 5th and 19th was 22
degrees: the former night was very cold to the feelings at this
season, and the latter sultry.
     The 22nd was a stormy day, and damage was done in se
veral northern counties by the discharges of electric fluid :
the lightning, which was also seen in this neighbourhood and
at Christchurch early in the morning, was generated by the                          in
osculation of two winds of unequal temperatures, crossing at
right angles from N.E. and S.E. Much lightning emanated
from the passing clouds on this and the subsequent evening.
     At 9 A.M. on the 24th two parhelia and a solar halo pre
 sented themselves in the South-east quarter; and two rain
bows appeared in the afternoon, one of which, independently
 of the exterior bow that accompanied                  it,
                                                     showed seven bows
of   colours, two        of
                        them were formed          by
                                                   astrong reflection               of
 the colours, being similar, but not quite             vivid: they rose
                                                             so

     The mean temperature          ofthe external air this month               is    3}
 degrees higher than the mean           October for the last ten years;

  THE PHILOSOPHICAL                        MAGAZINE.
   THE EDITor of the PHILosophic AL MAGAZINE has
to announce to his friends and the         public, that on the
1st   of January next, he will commence, in conjunction
with Mr. Rich ARD PHILLIPs, F.R.S. &c. a New and
Combined Series of the PHILosophica L. MAGAZINE
AND ANNALs           of PHILosophy; in        conformity     with
an arrangement entered into with the Proprietors of
the Annals.
    The circumstances which have rendered this              junc
tion expedient, will be found detailed in the Prospectus
 of the new Journal annexed to the present Number,
 The EDITOR of the PHILosophical               MAGAZINE has
 gratefully to acknowledge the Contributions by which
 he has been enabled so materially to raise the character
 of the work since it has been conducted by him; and
 in announcing the future co-operation of a gentleman
 of acknowledged talent and reputation in science, he
 feels confident not only that he may rely upon a con
 tinuance of the same favours, but that the consequent
 improvement of the Journal will give it additional
  claims to support.
