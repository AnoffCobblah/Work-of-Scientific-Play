       I. A    Statistical Account of Upper Canada.             By
                          J. B. GALT, Esq.*
 \Jp    a country so little known as America, it is almost im^
possible to receive a description of any part without being
sensible of an increase of knowledge.                 Our small stock of
facts relative to its aboriginal inhabitants, and the frame of
its permanent features, is still insufficient for correct theo
retical purposes.         We are still unable to conceive how it
could have happened that a continent so extensive, equal in
 the variety of its productions and climates to the old world,
should     have   been    found, in the sixteenth century of the
Christian aera, more savage and illiterate than those king
doms of Asia and Africa which many ages before had re
lapsed into barbarism : and still less are we qualified to form
a just hypothesis of those convulsions and events of nature
which have given to the American scenery its peculiar mag
nificence.     The French traveller Volney endeavours to prove
that the southern interior of North America has only re
cently become dry, and that in time the lakes of Canada
must also be exhausted, and lay open the bosom of the coun
try  f-    But  as the   object of this paper is chiefly to give an
arranged view of        a few statistical recollections which were
lately obtained from          Mr. Giikison, of Amherstburgh,          in
Upper Canada, it is perhaps superfluous to introduce re
flections which more properly belong to the general ques
tions of natural philosophy.

 than that of England.         After winter    has set  in, which hap
 pens about Christmas,        an intense frost usually prevails three
 months,     during which the rigour of the season is unremit-i
 ted.    Towards the end of March the cold has relented, but
 vegetation does not effectually commence till the end of
 April; it    proceeds    then, however, with great power. Pease,
in the course of six weeks after planting, are generally fit
 for table. Mr. Gilkison describes the summer as hotter than
 he ever felt it either in the south          of England or     the north
 of France    ; and during the dog days more oppressive than
 the heat of Jamaica.
    Winds. — From        the beginning of June to the end of Au
gust the wind        on the lakes continues westerly during the
day, and in the evening it becomes southerly.                 From what
 cause
 t
         this   resemblance    to  the alternate  sea  and   land breezes
of  the  West Indies originates Mr. Gilkison          has not attempt
ed to ascertain ; but he has observed that on the lakes            Huron
and Superior, which are less oblong than Erie and Ontarion,
the wind is more variable, and when westerly is accompa
nied with thick fogs.         As the season advances, the regular
clay and    night    breezes   of the lakes subside,       and when the
cold weather begins the course of the wind becomes                 as pre
carious as in other high latitudes.
    Diseases. — The province         of Upper Canada is not subject
to any particular disease.         Although the western district has
in part   been    settled  more   than  a century, the small-pox has
never reached it.         Vaccination has lately been introduced,
and all ages have received it. • Since the establishment of
distilleries the people have became much addicted to drink
ing, which they pretend to say has reduced the frequency
of the ague, with which they were formerly often afflicted.
The clearing of the country, however, will probably more
rationally account for the change.
    Curiosities. — Petrifactions are very common ; indeed the
-whole flat rock in the neighbourhood               of Fort Erie ap
pears to be one petrified mass,          for at every   step something
is seen which ai one time has been either animal or vege
table substance.         Mr. Gilkison saw in a gentleman's pos
session, some years ago, a petrified hand entire, except the
                                                                   second

  second   joint of  the fore finger,     which  seemed to have been,
 accidentally broken off.       The   traders on the river St. Peter's,
 Mississippi, report     that some     of them have seen in the pos
 session of the Indians a petrified childj which they have
 often wished to purchase ; but the savages regard it as a
 deity, and no inducement could bribe them to part with it.
 Besides the natural curiosities there are others of a descrip
 tion more calculated to excite interest and reflection.        These
 are the ruins   of antient fortresses, which appear to have been.
 the work of a race different from the present Indians, who
 possess no tradition concerning their origin^ nor seem to
 entertain any opinion respecting their use, or of those by
 whom they were constructed.            They are regularly formed,
 and generally built where a ravine or high bank naturally
 strengthens the one side. The walls are of earth, and at
 present may be about four or five feet in height.             At one
 time they must have been much higher, for trees of the
very largest size are now growing on the mounds.               A con
 tinued barrier of these works extends from the northern side
of Lake Ontario towards         the river district, and across to the
vast   plains  which   reach   to  the Mississippi.    It may also be
mentioned in this place as rather a curious fact, that al
though     Lower Canada is greatly infested with rats, none
have ever been seen above the falls of Niagara.
    Lakes. — The great lakes have been long gradually de
creasing; and in the course of nine years, the period of
Mr. Gilkison's residence at Amherstburgh, the waters have
fallen nearly two feet perpendicularly.          As the discharge at
Niagara must in consequence be reduced, the allegations of
those travellers respecting the time requisite for wearing the
passage of the river there, cannot be correctly founded.            It
is highly probable that the discharge of the cataract was for
merly much greater than it is at present, and the force of
the water in mouldering the rock of course more effectual
The long period which in         the -opinion of those travellers the
Waters    must have taken to form the chasm at the falls, is
therefore at least doubtful.         The issue from Lake Superior
and the upper lakes         into    Ontario, independent of local
streams and springs, is much greater than the discharge at
                                  A   3                      Niagara

and naturalists have heard with surprise that the plant cassia,
which grows only on                  the     banks of Lake Ontario, is fre
quently found floating along the coasts of Norway *.
   Hemp. — The cultivation of hemp in the Canada? has
lately become a popular concern ; and government, as well
as public societies, have endeavoured to promote     both as                      it,
a    resource to the navy and              as an        object      of beneficial indus
try. In Upper Canada the sowing begins on the 10th of
June, and in favourable season ten hundred weight
                      a                              ge                                  is
nerally produced per acre. About the middle of September
It  pulled, the stalks are tied up

                                       bundles, and steeped                                   a
few days in the river   they  are
                                j then  dried and stacked, till
the farmers have leisure to break.          has been observed    It
that steeping hemp in stagnated                    in run
                                                        water    is   better than
ning, besides being exposed to less hazard the farmers, in             ;
consequence, intend to form steeping-pits in their hemp-
grounds.    At one time tbey used to rot the stalks upon the
snow dur.mg winter      but   was soon ascertained to be de
                                ;        it
structive of the fibre,  and has been universally renounced.
The common hand-break           used in breaking the stalks,

which are afterwards  scotched  with    kind of wooden sword.

to remark how laborious this method  of cleaning      About                      is!
the value of       a   dollar   is   allowed for every sixty pounds, or per
day, to the labourer            ;   a charge that will prevent the Cana

price of labour      comparatively nothing. The establish

therefore, the only effectual mode of accomplishing the
wishes of government, and of those patriotic associations
who have patronized the cultivation of hemp in the Cana-
das. Government has offered fifty pounds sterling per ton
for clean marketable hemp, delivered to agents in the county
towns; but this plan, as well as the offer of bounties for
merly adopted, has been                      almost entirely abortive,                  chiefly

owmg to the price and hard labour of breaking.                  Indeed,
the culture of hemp would have been probably disused en
tirely, but for a ropework established at Amherstburgh by
Mr. Gilkison in conjunction with a Mr. Mills, where the
farmers, on allowing a certain deduction of price for the
additional labour requisite to fit their hemp for use* havei
lately found a steady and regular market.               To obviate the
laborious   process of the hand-break and               scotching, Mr;
Gilkison   has procured the model of a flax-mill, from which
he intends to erect, on a large scale, a mill for breaking and
cleaning hemp at Amherstburgh.              The price of cordage at
the ropework, which can only yet be regarded as ah expc-*
riment, is still high, about five guineas per cwt. ; but this
Is as much     owing to the price of tar as to the hemp or la
bour, for tar from the United States costs about three pounds
sterling per barrel.      In time, however* if the experiment
succeed,   tar   will be  made   from the pines of the country*
and the necessity     of importation obviated.
   Miscellaneous Considerations. —There are no historical fact*
tnore valuable than those which relate to the formation               of
communities,      and the origin of nations; nor, perhaps, are
the narratives of conquerors more interesting than the plant
tales of those who, by the virtue of their designs alone, havd
improved the condition of mankind. The merits of William
Penn have long been justly venerated ; and the high moral
character of the Pennsylvanians even at this day, in the United
States, is the fairest monument          that wisdom and enterprise
can hope to obtain.        The earl of Selkirk's exertions to pro
vide for " a gallant and hardy race of men*," whom a coJ
ercive change of manners and the abolition of antient cus
toms had deprived of their homes and hereditary importance,
will also be commemorated with respect, when the derisiort
 with which they have been treated is forgotten, and the op
 position which distorted his original design is remembered

  that within a limited       period they should be settled      with
  inhabitants   ; a principle calculated to excite that very spirit
  of emigration in others for which his lordship         has been so
  inconsiderately blamed, and which he only endeavoured to
  regulate for ultimate benefit to the empire.        He has built a
  village for the Highlanders,      and  they are now very com
  fortably established.     Soon after their arrival a disorder si
  milar to the jail fever broke out among them, and carried
  off a considerable number ; they have since, however, par
  ticipated in the general healthiness of the climate.            His
 lordship, by importing Spanish and English rams, has im
  proved the breed of his sheep; and he has already obtained
 wool equal to the best English, in some instances perhaps a
 superior quality.      At no very distant period we may there
 fore presume that Canadian wool, as well        as  hemp, will be
 come a staple article of commerce.
     The   use   of tobacco   has  considerably abated in Europe,
 and perhaps universally ; but as in many situations it is
 found a salutary and preventive medicine, it is likely to con
 tinue still a respectable   branch   of American commerce.        It
 grows luxuriantly in the western district, and may therefore
 be regarded as one of those productions which in time will
 constitute the principal exportable commodities of the pro
 vince. It is also probable that Canadian wines will be added
 to the variety of European luxuries ; for the vine throughout
 the whole country is surprisingly fruitful, and the grapes
 uncommonly delicious.         The mineral riches of Upper Ca
 nada are little known, nor has it ever been supposed that
 the precious metals were to be found there. Accident, how
ever,    has  led  Mr. Gilkison   to believe, that, if judicious in
vestigations were instituted, gold might be discovered in the
country beyond the Lakes-.          One day an Indian brought to
him a quantity of a very heavy substance resembling the
filings of a metal, and which he, as well as those to whom
it was- shown, conceived to be gold. Mr. Gilkison brought
this specimen with him for the purpose of ascertaining ita
value; but it was lost along with luggage in the shipwreck
of the vessel by which he came to Britain. The Indian as
                                                               sured

    A society has been formed for the encouragement of the
commerce and agriculture of the province ; and the legisla
ture, last year, voted 400 /. to procure a philosophical appa
ratus, to be placed in the most populous and central district ;
a grant of \200l. was also made for the improvement and
making of roads.          When it  is considered that the popula
tion does not exceed        40,000 souls, so liberal a disposition
in the provincial legislature is certainly calculated to im
prove the character of the people, who may be described,
at present, as a composition of all nations, kindred, and
tongues.     The Dutch farmers are eminently distinguished
for their industrious inclinations, but the settlers from the
United    States   are the refuse of their own country     ; they are
nevertheless, however, excellent axe-men,          and wonderfully
active in clearing the forests. The French of Upper Canada
are an indolent and thoughtless race; their attention is only
exerted towards objects of amusement, and they appear but
slightly affected by that kind of ambition which incites the
rest  of mankind       to improve   their condition.     The Scotch
Highlanders can hardly yet be regarded in any respect             dif
ferent from their well known character in Britain.
    Religion. —The established religious       discipline   of Upper
Canada is that of the English church.           The clergy are go
verned by the bishop of Quebec.           Their salaries, however,
are paid by the state, as the lands allotted for ecclesiastical
 purposes are still inadequate to support them. By this mode
 of paying the clergy, those parochial feuds, which so often
disgrace the priesthood elsewhere, are prevented. Exclusive
of the allowance from government, the Missionary Society
 gives a small stipend, which makes the amount of the sa
 lary to each minister about 200 /. per annum.           It would be
 improper to dismiss this artiqle without noticing a very ex
 traordinary innovation on thetything system, which has been,
 made by the British government.          Instead of the tenth of
 the produce,    a tenth part of the land in every allotment is
                                                             reserved

 reserved   for the future maintenance of the clergy. But no
 provision is made for a capital to stock or cultivate th«
 tything. The innovation seems only calculated to perplex
 the future pastors as well as their flocks, unless the legisla
ture previously examine the validity of tythes in general.
    Schools. — Several attempts have been made to establish
 township schools ; the want, however, of funds has hitherto
proved an       insuperable objection.          Lands," upon the same
principle as    the ecclesiastical, have been reserved for this pur
pose ; but while the population of the country continues so
thin, such local provision for the master will not be suffi
cient.     There     is  reason   to   hope, however, that district
schools will soon be instituted, when, besides fees from the
scholars,    it  is supposed that salaries         will  be granted  from
the revenues of the province.
    Missionaries.    —   The Missionary Society of the United
States have sent their agents amongst the Indians ; but,
with the exception of         the Quakers,        few have succeeded     in
producing      even    a disposition    to moral or intellectual im
provement.         In only one village, Mr. Gilkison said,             had
their labours     been   attended with any visible success.           It i»
situated on the river Thames in the western district,                  and
the Indians are      of the Delaware nation.            Several of the in
habitants read, and also write           a little ; they attend church
regularly,    where    sermons   in  their  own and the English lan
guage    are delivered      on Sundays.          The women sing the
psalms and hymns with a respectable degree of skill, and
drinking is almost universally abandoned; which is the grand
previous step to furnishing the Indians with the means or
the matter of knowledge.

     Bodies when reduced into thin Pellicles ; to which is added
     an Explanation                of    the Colours            of   tempered     Steel, and   of
      those      of   Peacocks'         Feathers.          Extracted from a Work on
      Colours;         by    C. A. PEIEUR.
                                     [Concluded      from p. 339.]
1 SHALT, conclude with some observations upon two kinds
of curious phenomena analogous to my" subject, and of
which I think myself warranted in giving an explanation
different from that generally admitted.
   The first subject I allude to chiefly concerns the colours
of    tempered            steel.
      Newton          has     ranked them among those dependent upon
coloured rings,               not from  any special examination, but by
a simple consequence of the system he founded, and sup
posing that the metallic particles must change in their size
from the action of the fire*.   Beyond this he did not look>
in order to ascertain                   if   there      were other causes to take into
the account.
      Some more recent inquirers, on the contrary, have, with
out hesitation,  attributed these colours to a varied degree of
oxidation f> because they thought they saw a great simili
tude between the appearances in question and those of se
veral metals placed in circumstances in which they were in
fact oxidated.   This subject at least merits a closer exa
mination,             and     I    adopted        the    following simple method to

      I   placed      a   steel    watch-spring in               the flame   of   a candle, and
heated           it for a few minutes                    in a fixed position.           Having
afterwards taken it out,                      I   found,        upon    cooling and     wiping
it,       that    there      was to the right and left                  of the central point,
where the flame had acted,                         a     series      of coloured gradations
with periodical returns, such                           as would have           been   exhibited

 by a small ribbon    cut precisely in the midst of a circle
 Formed of a series of concentric coloured rings. The nature*
 of the phaenomen0n, therefore, was here manifested very
distinctly; for the exterior ring was nearly three centimetres
in diameter, and the others decreased interiorly, with inter
vals of some millimetres.      Nothing was Wanting to com-*
plete the figures but to operate          upon a large plate of steel*
suspended  horizontally           above the point of the flame; in this
case, I should certainly have obtained entire circles of rings.
   I did not happen to have such a large plate of steel at
hand, but     I   made use      of a   sheet of tinned iron, which, with
appearances    analogous          to the preceding, gave very    brilliant
colours,    on account of the           natural white of the substance.
When looked at in a proper direction the colours appear still
more lively, viz. chiefly yellow, red and blue, which form
together a spot in which the blue occupies the centre, sur
rounded with red, and beyond that again yellow, with in
termediate gradations of shades.
   Nothing in the faculty possessed by tin of oxidating and
forming salts, indicates any thing like colours corresponding
to the above   in addition to this, the periodical streaks upon
                  ;
the steel watch-spring evidently belong to a series of rings ;
we must therefore conclude that this phaenomenon belongs
simply to the class of coloured rings.
   Another experiment made upon a gold ring also produced
repeated traces of rings ; and in this case, the idea of oxida
tion is almost out of the question.
  A   copper wire gave me similar appearances, although
more feebly ; but I have remarked them very distinctly upon
this same metal when made into the flues of stoves.    Lead,
when we melt          it,   also exhibits these sorts       of colours when
cooled, even upon its inferior                 surface, not exposed to the
contact of the air.
  With     respect to the action          exercised    by caloric upon the
metal in these various examples,           I      shall not assert that  it
has altered the size of the particles'; for how can we con
ceive that    asubstance can, without becoming of another
nature, vary in the disposition of the constituent elements
of its molecules   But?     can more easily comprehend that
                                I
                                                                      there

 there has been        a  progressive separation of molecules, in
  creasing, as in the case of my steel watch-spring, from the
 spot scarcely reached by the heat to that which immediately
 touched the name.           This movement, according               to the prin
  ciples I   have   laid down,       must have been sufficient for the
  production of the rings.
.    We daily see many other examples pf these kinds of co
 lours, the arrangement of the particles of which seems to
 be the sole determining cause.               Such      are the   stains formed
.upon steel knives by the acid           of fruits; the black colour          as
  sumed by silver plate from sulphurous emanations, or from
  the prolonged contact of certain substances; and in che
  mical laboratories, the rainbow-coloured                  pellicles formed at
  the surface    of liquors containing              some    matter    which has
  been first dissolved, and afterwards separated                by the progres
  sive  evaporation of     a volatile principle.          The water of dung
  hills is also covered     sometimes with similar               coloured pelli
  cles.
      Now all   these effects, whatever be the nature              of the matter
  primitively    or secondarily formed, arise wholly from the ar
  rangement of the parts. Nothing is so easy to be ascer
  tained.     Scrape the surfaces, rub the pellicles, and all these
  colours are annihilated,       and there           remains nothing in the
  fragments of each substance, except particles uniformly pos
  sessing properties essential to their species.
      The following, among others,                is a very convenient       way
  of observing      these   effects.     I    take    A  small   quantity of the
  green   of Scheele     and  dissolve    it   in   an  acid ;  after having di
  luted this liquid in a considerable quantity of water, I pre
   cipitate by an alkali, and add ammonia, merely for the pur
   pose of redissolving the precipitate : leaving the whole after
   wards in an uncovered vessel,            I   find, after a few days, the
   surface  of  the   liquor   covered     with an iris-coloured pellicle,
   very apparent, and in       which     we even distinguish           a succes
   sion of rings, if the liquid has not been disturbed.                    I then
   remove this pellicle, by slipping            a   sheet  of  paper or a piece
   of glass under it. The colours of the pellicle continue to
   be visible after its removal      ; and upon allowing the substance
   Jo dry slowly,       we   may   thus      preserve them an indefinite
                                                                             time

   1 *            Upon the variegated Colours           of Bodies
  time in all their brightness.                But when we come to pass
  the finger slightly over this pellicle, nothing but a green
  powder is obtained ; the red, yellow, blue, and purple co
 lours, which        were so    brilliant, disappear in     an instant.
      My     second    phenomenon           is  relative to the changeable
 colours      of the plumage       of  the peacock and some other birds,
 such      as  the cock,      the   pigeon, the duck, and the turkey.
 Here, after the most attentive comparative examination and
the most circumspect reflections, I ended by renouncing the
 idea that these kinds of colours could be referred to rings.
My conviction is founded on                the  following grounds    :
      I first considered that these colours were not the neces
sary result of a certain tenuity of the parts ; for, on the
one hand, several animals certainly present in their hair,
their feathers, or in the down which covers them, exam
ples of tenuities varied to the most imperceptible degree,
and yet without there being any production of colours.                      IK
not the white peacock itself a striking example of this ?
      On   the other hand,        have not several birds and insects co
lours immoveable in their position, and in their reflections,
when viewed under every inclination whatever ? The wings
of some butterflies have very fixed colours, although de
pending        upon a down so very minute that it is hardly per
ceptible.        It is also proper to remark, that all these colours
indicate opacity, like those of the peacock's feathers; with
this difference, that in those of the wings of flies we perceive
the shades relative to the coloured rings; but these mem
branes have        a sensible transparency,         like scales of mica or
blown glass.
      I afterwards observed the changes of colours in several
feathers of the birds mentioned.                   In those of a peacock's
tail, we see upon the lateral beards of the stalk, when we
change their position, the red changing very suddenly to the
green.        The    red   takes    place  in consequence of the almost
perpendicular         reflection of the light ; the green, in conse
quence of a very obliqne reflection ; and there is no alter
native of reflection and of transmission ; the opacity of which
I have spoken above does not admit o fir.
     Near     the  eye   of the feather        an exterior corona exhibits
                                                                       yellow

                 u>hen   reduced into thin   Pellicles.            15
yellow shades by a perpendicular reflection, and greenish by
an oblique reflection ; while, more interiorly, by the same
change of obliquity,        a  space  of the most lively    green as
sumes the new shade         of the violet.     Such are the principal
mutations    of   these   colours,   consisting of two shades only
for  each spot.
    Upon a feather from the neck of a pigeon the disposi
tion is quite contrary to that of the lateral beards of the pea*-
cock's taif ; i. e. in the same circumstances one of these
feathers   gives    red, while    the other gives green,     and vice
versa.
    It is very difficult to reconcile this alternation of colours,
confined to two principal species, with the variety of shades
which the coloured rings would seem to give by means of a
substance of a density so feeble as that which constitutes
feathers.     Should we attempt to draw an inference from the
more sensible changes which the feather of a pigeon pre
sents in its shades, this would still afford but a deceitful
analogy : these changes proceed only from the generally
bent state of the feather, since they cease when we lay it
against a flat surface.
    But what forms a total disparity is the appearance of the
 feathers of the wing of a duck.           Here the transition takes
 place from green to blackish ; and again, this green colour
 is not sensible, except in peculiar positions, where the in
 cidence and reflection of the light take place under very un
 equal angles, as, for example, when we view the feather
 under a certain obliquity, having our back turned to the
 light. Do we never see any thing similar in the succession
 of coloured rings     ?
    I thought, lastly, of carefully moistening several places of
 the region of the eye of my peacock's feather.           I then saw,
 not a weakening of the first shades, but new colours emerg
 ing with a good deal of strength.            I was anxious to know
 if I  could not produce permanent alterations by some sol
 vent : I consequently tried to moisten it successively with
 saliva, with vinegar, weak and strong muriatic acid, with
 ammonia,     ether, alcohol, and with a solution of muriate of
 JimG ; and    I ascertained that these agents had no other in
                                                               fluence

in an equal         degree,     the concentrated acid however excepted,
which gave          some difference ; but all these effects               ceased al
most in the same manner upon drying.
   When the exterior orbit of the eye was moistened, its yel
lowish colour became of a lively blood red colour, and the
reflection, primitively green in consequence of its obliquity,
was almost extinct. If we moistened the green space within,
the circle, it was the violet reflection which this time disap
peared.    Lastly, by the smoking muriatic acid, this same
green space gave               perpendicularly a yellow colour strongly
inclining         to the     red, and the oblique reflection at first a
green          and afterwards a violet colour        :    at no time did any        of
these alterations continue.
     Upon also moistening the extremity of the tail                           feathers
of   a turkey,       I    obtained some        new and very lively colours,
which we could not previously see in the                           same   direction,
but the existence of which was indicated     to me by certain
reflections against the light, analogous to what I have men
tioned when speaking of the feathers of the duck.
     It     impossible for me, after all these particularities,
           was
to persist in ranging, under one and the same system, the
changeable colours of the feather and those of the coloured
rings of pellicles.  An examination of the latter, several
times repeated, induced me to think that they might proceed
from the super-position of several coloured matters, some
times      of two only, or of            three or any greater number, nearly
as   if,   wishing               body of several colours, we should
                          to paint   a
cover      it   successively with  coat of each of the proposed
                                         a                                         in
gredients.
   This supposition, properly adapted to each part of the fea
thers, accounts very feasibly for all the appearances we ob
serve in them.
     In short,      if,
               for example, upon      coat of painting, formed
                                                 a
upon    green
           a  substance,   we  spread in     thin coat    violet
                                                          a                   a
colour not very abundant,      will be evident that upon look
                                          it
ing perpendicularly at the  painted surface     will appear   it                   al
most uniformly green, while upon lowering the eye to ren
der the visual rays more and more strong, the colour will
                                                                              become

become progressively predominant, until it be, in its turn,
the 'only colour perceived.             The intermediate hues will be
different degrees of green, to which will succeed various de
grees of blue before arriving at the violet shades : all this
may be easily conceived.
    If, moreover, the green substance is itself placed above a
red matter, the latter will not be visible in the intervals of
the coloured matters of the upper layers ; but if these coats
come to acquire transparency by the imbibition of a liquid,
in this    case the influence     of the undermost layer       will be sen
sible,    and   will necessarily manifest itself in this case by a
yellow     or  even   a reddish colour, when viewed perpendicu
larly, while the oblique reflections will give greenish and
violet-coloured hues. The drying of the substances will af
terwards restore things to the first state of which we have
Spoken.
    Such in reality       are the    variations    of  shades    of certain
places    of  the feathers   of a peacock. Such, in my opinion,
is the    probable cause      of their formation; applicable also to
those of the cock, the.-pigeon, and several other birds and
insects ; and in particular to that magnificent butterfly with
large wings,       which through their whole surface present a
brilliant green, converted gradually, by means of obliquity,
into a still more beautiful violet colour         *i

                       without doubt, extremely sensible as to the

    means one part of the acid diluted in 108,333 parts of water.
    But this re-agent        still far surpassed

    almost absolute insolubility of the mild muriate of mercury,
1     was     induced to make some experiments                              concerning this
re-agent.

                              a
solution of nitrate of mercury at the minimum of oxidation.
   Lime water, or water of barytes, are generally regarded as
the most sensible re-agents for carbonic acid.     discovered,              I
however, that the solution of acetate of lead still surpasses
them.    was accidentally led to this remark — some distilled

the other re-agents with respect to this acid.
   The mild nitrate of mercury is also a re-agent almost
equally sensible for the phosphoric acid as it is for the mu
riatic ;  with this difference, that the precipitate by the former
is dissolved in an excess        of phosphoric acid or nitric acid,
while    the precipitate by the latter is absolutely insoluble by
Sm excess    of any acid whatever.

mation of     the muriatic acid in water by the influence                of the
positive pole of the pile of Volta.             I made     use   of glass tubes
bf different diameters from a line to an inch                ; the tubes    were
closed below, except a small hole in which the metallic con
ductor wires were fixed with sealing-wax.                     The communi
cation between the two tubes, into one                  of which      was con
ducted the influence of the positive pole, while the influence
6f the negative pole was communicated to the other, was
effected   at the top, sometimes by moistened paper, some
times by linen threads, sometimes by nerves, and sometimes
by animal fibres.        I even varied the metallic wires.                I em
ployed successively wires of platina, gold, silver, copper,
and iron. I never obtained a trace of muriatic acid, al-

though my most sensible re-agent for that acid (being the
solution of mild nitrate of mercury) would have announced
even ToV.Tnnsd'h of a grain of that acid. But I obtained by
turnsole    papersome traces of an acid which certainly was
neither muriatic, sulphuric, carbonic, nor phosphoric acid,
since the most sensible re-agents for these acids, which far
surpass turnsole paper, did not announce them : it was-
therefore, in all probability, nitric acid; I always obtained
traces of an alkali, which, after all my experiments, was
ammonia.     I therefore still adhere to my opinion, that the
acid and     the alkali are formed at the expense of the azote
inherent    to the water, on the one side by oxygen and on
the other by hydrogen.

by a quadrigae, the horses of which have always been re
garded as identically the same horses of copper gilt, which
our victories have obtained to us, and which now deco
rate the palace of the Thuilleries. The manner in which
they lift their feet and carry their heads, and indeed their
whole attitudes, have greatly contributed to give weight to
this conjecture, which has been adopted by Maflci and all
the Italian authors *. They have gone still further in sup-

port of this opinion, upon the authority of historians, who
inform us that Constantine the Great stripped Rome and
the cities of Greece of their finest ornaments in order to de
corate his new capital *. We may conclude that these four
horses were comprised in the above, if we give credit at the
same    time to an antient tradition,                    which, however, never
existed except in the imaginations of some learned men.
Zanetti, who has added an engraving of them to his collec
tion of the statues at Venice, even thinks he has discovered
some defects in their workmanship ; and for this reason he
concludes them to be of Roman origin. It      however, very      is,
certain, and we may refer to the authority of Codinus as                               a
confirmation, that these horses were never at Rome.   They

stantinople.       among the antiquities of this last city,
                            is
therefore, that we must seek their origin, and not among
the monuments of Rome.       Codinus, who enters into                                  a
Jong detail upon the subject of the antiquities of Byzantium,
    • The exorbitant sums of money expended by Constantine in order to
transform Byzantium into an agreeable residence for the Romans must excite
cur astonishment. Theatres, circuses, public baths, porticoes, temples, pa
laces, gymnasia, triumphal arches, aqueducts, columns surmounted by sta
tues, obelisks, cloacae,     were all constructed with as much magnificence and
with more regularity than in antient Rome.        In order to induce twelve of his
friends to reside in his new capital, he first sent them with an army against
Sapor, king of the Persians.   In the mean time architects were dispatched to
take all the dimensions of their houses at Rome; and in order at the same
time to induce their families to come to Byzantium, the houses at Constan
tinople were built exactly upon the same plan, and with all the accessaries of
luxury they   possessed      at   Rome; and when,      at the end of 1G months, the par
tricians returned from their expedition,           the emperor asked them jocularly    if
they intended to return soon to Italy. —
                                         "          In two months," was their answer;
"                                                    "
  at the beginning of winter we intend to set out." — In the mean time (said
the emperor) have prepared lodgings
              I                         for you."  When they were conducted
to them, how great was their astonishment upon seeing transported, as    by       if
enchantment, their palaces           from Rome to the shores of the Propontis; and
they were much delighted when upon entering them they fouad assembled
their wives and children, with their slaves and every thing that was dearest to
them.   Codi>ius, who relates this story, enumerates 2'2 cities from which Con
stantine brought away statues. The church of St. Sophia, which was as yet no
better than   apagan temple, received 427 of these works of art. Justinian,
who consecrated this magnificent temple to the Christian worship, took the
statues out of    it,
               and distributed them in the different quarters of the city.

 •peaks of a car with four horses, which was antiently in the
 place called Milium. These four horses were gilt : they
 seemed to he at full gallop, and as if drawing the statue of
 the Sun. Constantine caused this chariot, accompanied by
 its guards, to be transported into the hippodrome, or grand
 circus*, in order to celebrate the festival of the Fortune of
 Constantinople,                  which  by the statue of the
                                               he represented
 Sun.  After this solemnity the chariot was carried back with
 the same escort to its antient station.    This chariot with
four horses has nothing in it similar to the four gilt horses
which the same author speaks off when he specifies all the
monuments in the hippodrome or circus ; the latter were
placed upon the barriers, and not yoked to any chariot ; and
Theodosius the younger had them brought from Chio to
Constantinople.  They were the only horses that were in

same horses arc mentioned* deserves to be mentioned here he informs us              :
that one Agaremis proposed to fly from one end of the hippodrome to the
other   " Sua sponte hippodromi ittrrim conscendit* sub qua carceres sunt undt

 mistaken. — Note        ly
                   the Author.
  On the contrary, in my opinion, the very attitudes furnish the best reasons
lordoubting that the four horses now in the Thuilleries were really those of
Chio. Their step appears composed, and not at full gallop they do not throw     ;
up their heads like fiery steeds from all which circumstances, although the

passages of Codinus, Nicetas, and other authors of the lower empire have been
extremely well known, no person can take upon him to assert in        positive            a
manner,         as the author         has   done, that these horses          are the same as those
of Chio.    In no view whatever can we suppose that they were yoked to
ii chariot, and we knpw from the report of Nicetas, that there were several
figures of horses in the hippodrome. This   the reason why M. Hcyne, — in

  fore, with eood reason, that these were the same gilt horses
  which     the Venetians      found in that place 800 years after
  Theodosius II., and saved from destruction by taking them
  to Venice.       It is probable that Codinus has drawn this no
  tion from their inscription ; for he says that each statue of
  the Circus had its inscription,        which mentioned from what
  city it had been carried off.
     The resemblance of these horses with those upon the
 medal of Nero, can be no objection against the authority of
  Codinus. The antient world was so filled with similar works,
  and   the chefs d'ceuvres      of  the   great  masters     were so often
 imitated,     that one quadrigae     might often      resemble    another,
     The Isle of Chio,        at present called Scio,        is situated be
 tween Samos and Lesbos.              It   produced the best wine in
 Greece ; it had a city of the same name, which was bounded
 by Mount Pellenus on the land side, and on the sea shore
'there    was   a harbour      which contained eighty          vessels.   All
 these    natural advantages       induced     the   inhabitants to apply
early to navigation and commerce;                  they traded with the
Egyptians in the reign of king Amasis, who permitted Greelt
merchants to settle in Egypt, where they made establish

  bouring islands of Chio, Delos, and Lesbos, were full of
  their works ; and in Chio was to be seen a Diana by Bu-
  palus.       All these sculptors made use of the beautiful marble
  of Chio ; but we do not see that they wrought in bronze.
  It  would be pushing the mania for antiquities too far to pre
 tend to name the artist who made the horses of Chio ; but
 if the examination of a monument which time has spared,
 added to the descriptions           of    those   which antiently existed,
 can still suffice for distinguishing the different schools, such
 an inquiry      will not, perhaps, be without interest in the his
 tory    of the arts.                                                              \
      We must not imagine we see in these horses a chef
 d'ceuvre of antient art. So early as the time of Cicero all
 that was valuable in the island of Chio had been brought
 to Rome in order to decorate               the houses of the rich *.        The
 emissaries sent by Nero into Greece, in order to carry off all
 the works in bronze they thought worthy of decorating his
 edifices, although they did not neglect to visit the islands
 of Rhodes, Samos,           and Chio, yet they did not meddle with
 these horses      ; nor were they comprised in the general requi
 sition made by Constantino of all the objects of art, which
 mishit adorn his new residence ; it was only under Theo-
 dosius     II.,  when the world           was   already  stripped    of all the
 chefs d'ceuvres, that they were thought worthy of being
 transported to Constantinople.                 Would they have remained
 so long in their places; would they have escaped the rapacity
of the Roman governors,              the depredations      of Nero,      and the
requisitions of Constantine,              if  their workmanship had been
fine enough to charm the eyes of connoisseurs, or to entitle
them to be compared to a work of Calamis, Lysippus, or
an artist of the school of this grand master?
was very plain in his peuon, these two sculptors amused themselves at his
expense, by exposing to public view a ridiculous caricature of him.        Hippo-
nax, indignant at seeing himself the object of the insolence of the public, made
a poem, and satirized    them so unmercifully that they repented their temerky
in ridiculing the son of Apollo.      It must be observed that this Bupalus is not
the sau.e with him who flourished in the 107th Olympiad, and wrought at the
monument erected by Artemisia 10 Maueolus, and whose works, brought to
Rome by order of Augustus, were thought worthy of being cooipared to those
 yt t-iaxiieles. The great distance in point of time is a proof of ibis,

    Lysippus lived in the time of Alexander, a period when
the inhabitants of this island had neither enough of riches
nor tranquillity to decorate their city with works of art.
Besides, the style of the design and of the sculpture by no
means answers to that of Lysippus ; his horses were lighter,
their manes        floated  in long tresses, in order to indicate the
swiftness of a race.          It was here he displayed his talents for
working tresses'of hair, which              he expressed so naturally and
so gracefully as to charm              every   eye.    The     horses    of Chio
are in a heavy style ; their design represents strength rather
than agility ; their manes appear as if cut, which proves that
the artist did not know how to design horses ; at least, we
may see from the ringlets of their tails that he was not very
expert at this kind of work. Their heads, however, deserve our
admiration      ; their nostrils extended and their foaming mouths
seem to breathe the fury and impetuosity of the horses of the
Sun   ;  and, without leaning too much to conjecture, we may
»ay    that  we find more in them of the style of Polycletes and
Miro* than that of Lysippus. The works of these two artists
were vigorously designed ; we perceive in them starting mus
cles, and in general more strength than gracefulness. Neither
the one nor the other knew how to work tressts of hair,
and both      of them lived at a period when the inhabitants of
Chio were in a state of profound peace, and enjoyed a kind
 of naval superiority.            They were enriched by commerce,
and had consequently            leisure   and the means of thinking of
the embellishments of their capital. This period lasted from
the 75th to the 92d Olympiad : it comprehended a space of
 70 years, and was the happiest time this city ever enjoyed.
 Jf   we fix upon this aera as that in which these horses must
 have been founded, they would now be 2248 years old f.
 They would          thus be more antient than any other bronze

 was worth          120,000 sestertii, which is more than 12,000
 francs in French money, what price shall we put upon this
 unique piece of antiquity, which, among the whole of si
milar works, with which the antient world was filled, alone
 escaped universal destruction              ?
      The horses of Chio were cast in copper and gilded. We
 know that copper is better adapted than bronze for receiving
 gilding, and it seems they were originally intended to be
 gilt f. It is wrong, therefore, to reproach the Romans with
their decided taste for gilding, since the Greeks also gilded
their quadrigae.            It is, however, certain that the fine bronzes
 were not gilt. Their colour was fine enough to make this
 ornament to be dispensed with, as we have seen.                         Lysippus
would have been vexed to have seen that by gilding his works,
the exquisite finishing, which formed his chief merit, was con
 cealed.      We see in Pliny % how much Nero was blamed for
having caused this artist's statue of Alexander to be gilt,
and how much the connoisseurs regretted to see a Venus by
Alcamenus covered with gold. When we read in Pausanias§
that there was at Delphos a gilt statue of Phryiie, executed
by Praxiteles,        and that the Athenians             had dedicated     at Del
phos      a gilt Minerva on          the occasion      of  a   victory they had
gained, we must be of opinion that this practice of gilding
proceeded from motives of emulation, and in order to ap
proach, as much as possible, the magnificence of the other

temples with statues of copper gilt in the Tuscan fashion, as we see in the
temple of Ceres and Hercules near the Grand Circus ; this passion of the Ro
mans for gilding was therefore of Etruscan origin.          According to Buonaroti,
Osservazioni ytpra altrmi Medagtioni, p. 370, the gold employed by the an-
tients in fire-gilding was, in the proportion of gold employed in modern gild
ing, as 6 to 1 ; and for common gilding their gold leaves were as 22 to 1. All
the antient gilding found below-ground has still its natural lustre, and we
might have been able to say the same of the gilding upon the horses of Chio,
if it had not been almost entirely scraped uft".

the quadrigse, it seems they were always gilded when yoked

might imitate the splendour of that orb. The four horses

merly yoked to the car and statue of the Sun.

ACTION of Caloric.-*- M. Deyeux having examined, in *
particular manner, all the products of distillation of gall-
nuts in the open fire, I only considered the acid liquor ob
tained from this substance.
    This operation     was conducted in the manner pointed out
by this chemist     : the liquor of the receiver was aromatic, a
little milky*   very acid ; did not precipitate glue, and gave
Tfrith the sulphate    of iron a violet blue passing            to the  dirty
green. Lime and barytes yielded a colour                of   pea blossoms.-
The nitrate of mercury formed a blackish                  precipitate in it ;
it was white with the acetate of lead and the muriate of tin.
    I saturated  the    acid  Jiquor with potash ; I obtained by
 evaporation a brown empyrenmatic matter, which by the
 addition of the sulphuric acid exhaled a pungent smell ana-

  30             Facts  for   a   History of   (ke  Gallic Acid.
     The produce from            the distillation    was   a limpid   liquor,
 colourless,      and slightly acid, neither precipitating glue nor
  sulphate of iron.
    The liquor       saturated    by the alkaline base was evaporated
 to dryness : being afterwards dissolved in distilled water,
 sulphuric acid was added until it was slightly in excess, and
 it was distilled in a     retort; the produce was successively ex
 amined   :   a   liquid, without taste or smell, first came over ;
 soon afterwards the liquor was acid, and contained neither
 sulphuric nor gallic acid.
    I made a similar experiment with boiling instead of cold
water: the liquor remained always turbid, although filtered;
when submitted           to distillation     and combined with soda,        I
 obtained the same results.
    These experiments suggested to me the existence of an
acid ready formed in galls, and the possibility of obtaining
it by distillation.
    Accordingly       I heated     to ebullition in   a  common     alembic
a kilogramme          (2 lb. 3oz. 6 dr. avoird.) of galls, coarsely
powdered, with double the weight of water. The distilled
liquor^ as M. Deyeux observed, was a little milky, aroma
tic, and on standing deposited a little flocculent sediment;
I changed      the receiver, when about          two-thirds of the liquor
had come over, and           I  continued the distillation till it be
came coloured.
    The first product        was    acid;  reddened    tincture of litmus;
and had no action on lime or barytes water, nitrate of mer
cury, acetate of lead, sulphate of iron, or glue.
    The  second      product was turbid, coloured, a little empy-
reumatic    ;   its acidity was more marked ; and it precipitated
the metallic solutions above mentioned, but did not act on
glue*
    Each of these acid liquors was saturated with potash. The
first yielded a foliated salt, which, on the addition of sul-
phuricacid,        gave out a smell       of  acetic  acid.    Part of this
salt was dissolved in distilled water : the excess of its base
was accurately saturated by nitric acid, and nitrate of mer
cury at a minimum was added to the solution ; when a pre
cipitate was formed which had all the characters of acetate
                                                                          of

of mercury. To convince myself still further of the pre
sence of acetic acid, I treated the neutral acetate of potash
in   the same manner,           and it afforded    me the same results.
     The   second      product was saturated with potash in the same
manner.          The    liquor became very brown ; a slight pellicle
formed on the surface, which increased during the evapo
ration : the saline matter was highly coloured and empyreu-
matic.   Being subjected to the same trials as the preceding,
similar appearances were observed.
   These experiments leave no doubt of the presence of acetie
acid in galls : they prove that it may be obtained by distilla
tion with water, and that caloric, when it acts more directly
on this acid, facilitates its combination with a small quan
tity of empyreumatic oil, and perhaps with a little tannin,
the presence of which is not demonstrable by glue : but as
this liquor acta on sulphate of iron in the same manner as
the sublimed acid, we must presume that there is a kind of
analogy in their composition; admitting, however, this dif
ference, that          the sublimed     acid contains no empyreumatic
oil, but     a   particular aromatic volatile oil.
.    This oil may             by dissolving the acid in very
                         be detected
pure sulphuric ether, and adding a little water, when a few
drops of oil will be seen floating on the surface, which dis
appear on shaking the mixture.
     If   a concentrated solution          of caustic potash   be employed
instead of water, a white milky substance is separated, which
requires a large proportion of water to dissolve       but the  it,
liquor still remains turbid.
   This ethereal tincture yields             a   fine blue colour with sul
phate of iron.

proofs in confirmation of its presence ; and to demonstrate
that this acid, combined with other substances, constitute*
the gallic acid.
    With this view  I formed gallates of lime, barytes, potash,
and soda.     These neutral combinations afforded a violet red
colour with a solution of sulphate of iron, and scarcelv pre
cipitated glue, while the acid employed had the property of
forming with it   acopious precipitate. On these salts, dried,
I poured some very weak sulphuric acid ; I distilled them
with a gentle heat, and I always obtained acetic acid.
    The retorts contained   a very deep brown    matter.     I cry
stallized the salts   that were perceptible of   it,   and obtained
sulphates.
   The supernatant mother-water had the property of slightly
browning the solution of sulphate of iron but this appear
                                            ;
ance does not prove the presence of gallic acid, for the black
colour of the mother-water was sufficient to give      this hue.

   If one of the gallates, that of soda for instance, be treated

longer act on sulphate of iron.
   The liquor being afterward evaporated to dryness, and         di
stilled with very weak sulphuric acid, we still obtain acetic
acid.
I   shall not insist any further on the possibility of obtain
ing acetic acid   by decomposing gallic acid.    I might men
tion the experiments which would tend to support the pre
ceding, but entering too minutely into these particulars
would add nothing to the facts Ihave already adduced.
I   shall conclude with an experiment which appears to me
important.     The object was, to establish the nature of the
elastic fluids resulting from the complete decomposition of
the gallic acid   by   heat. M. Deyeux has announced that
he obtained only oxygen gas and carbon.          M. Berthollet,
who  repeated the experiment, says that he had no oxygen
gas, but constantly carbonic acid.
  These results, of which no other vegetable acid furnishes
an example, could not avoid exciting the attention of che
                                                             mists.

              Facts   for a History of the Gallic Acid.              33
 mists.     In fact, it is difficult not to admit hydrogen in the
composition of gallic acid ; and M. Fourcroy has expressed
his doubts on this subject in his System of Chemical Know
ledge, but the question is not yet decided by experiment.
    In consequence, I heated gallic acid in a retort. The fire
was gradually raised till the retort was red-hot.               During
this action    of the   fire I obtained   several   jars full of elastic
fluid. The first contained only atmospheric air, the others
carbonic acid gas : at least, the gas had all the characters of
this acid ; but the phaenomena that occurred during the de
composition of the gallic acid led me to suspect, that, if
any hydrogen gas had been evolved, it could exist only in a
very small quantity.         I was not satisfied, therefore, with the
trial by lime water, and the- extinction of a taper in the gas.
Having perceived that hydrogen gas mixed with a great deal
of carbonic acid      gas cannot be burnt,      because this acid acts
too promptly on the flame of the taper, I passed a little
caustic potash into the last jar of gas ; agitated it, in order
%o   absorb the carbonic acid gas j and then immersed a taper
in  the residual gas, which burnt with flame, and thus afforded
ipe a proof of thfi presence of carbonated hydrogen gas.
    The gallic acid, then, like other vegetable acids, is com
posed     of oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon.               If but a small
quantity of hydrogen can be obtained, it is hecause water
is formed during the decomposition of the acid, so that the
 hydrogen passes over only when very little oxygen remains
to act on the carbon.
    I have attempted to show that the gallic acid is a com               g
pound.       Its formation      by Scheele's process appears to me
 to favour this opinion.         In fact, if the quantity of acid ex
 tracted from the aqueous infusion, exposed to the air, be com
 pared with that afforded by sublimation, I conceive it is not
 difficult to account for the increase.        There can be no doubt
 that .acetic acid is formed      in the  liquor, which, acting on a
portion of tannin and extractive matter, constitutes the gallic
 acid of Scheele    :  but this combination       is rendered  more in
 timate, and $oroewhat different, by the action of caloric j
of wbicjh w<e have a proof when the acid is obtained by sub

acid remains combined                    with   a volatile     oil which      is formed.
Perhaps this acid contains a small portion of tannin in very
intimate combmation, whence, no doubt, arises its property
of giving a momentary blue with sulphate of iron, though
its presence cannot be demonstrated.    This acid, then, must
have different properties from that of Schcele j and if it were
possible to assimilate it to other vegetable acids, the ben
zoic is that to which it would have the greatest analogy.
May it therefore be considered as a modification of the
gallic acid ? I think not.    It is the same with other vegeta
ble acids ; and it is probable that there exists no modifica
tion of them.    The acetous appears to be the sole vegetable
acid   it dissolves and retains in various proportions a num
       ;

its combination          in    a   more intimate manner,                  and frequently
even augment             the       quantity of this acid.                Already several
chemisis have admitted                    the   possibility of the acetic acid's
dissolving        and
                remaining                     combined with fixed and empy-
reumatic oils, and animal matters                       :    they have even gone so
far   as   to imitate acids of this sort.                   The formic, pyrolignie,
tartarous,       and mucous,             have been classed by Messrs.                 Four-
croy and Vauquelin among the compound acids ; it is the,
same with the lactic acid, the composition of which wai
pointed out at the same time by those chemists, M. The-
nard, and myself: lastly, we have proof too, according to
M.     Thenard,         of   the       existence of this acid in              urine and
sweat,      as   well   as   in    the sebacic and           zoonic acids.        I   might
further add to these observations                      (if
                                              not persuaded  we were

                                          ;
proportions being once established,    gives rise to compounds

hitherto unalterable, and the affinity of which cannot be de
stroyed but         by
                 reducing them to their primary elements--^
oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen.
  From the facts announced in this memoir                            it   follows     :
  1st, That the gallic acids of Scheele and                          of Richter differ
essentially from that obtained                    by   sublimation; and that the
                                                                             crvstaHized,

              Fads   for  a  History of    the GalKc Acid.            35
 crystallized is preferable as a re-agent, on account of the
.constant uniformity of the colour it gives with iron.
    2dly, That this acid appears to be composed of acetic acid,
 tannin,   and extractive matter; and that it cannot be com
 pletely freed from tannin by crystallization.
    3dly, That the acid obtained by sublimation             contains no
 tannin,   at least    none that can be ascertained        by acting on
glue;    and that it cannot, on any occasion,         supply the place
 of  the crystallized   acid.
    4thly, That the sublimed acid        appears likewise to be com
posed    of acetic acid united with       a  peculiar aromatic volatile
oil.
    5thly, That by means of water poured into the etherized
tincture of galls, or ether containing the sublimed acid, an,
 oily matter is separated.
    6thly, That there is no           process   known for purifying
 Scheele's acid completely ; that is to say, we cannot take
 from it the whole of its tannin, without reducing it to the
 state of acetic acid ; which proves that the portion of tannia
 it retains is necessary to constitute gallic acid, and that to
this are owing its excellent properties in the art of dyeing.
    7thly, That the red oxide of mercury, and oxide of tin,
 as well as carbon, decompose this acid.
    Sthly, That by distilling galls with water acetic acid may
 he obtained ; and that it is by the assistance of caloric acting
 more immediately on galls, that a more intimate              union be
 tween the acid and the tannin is effected.
    9thly, That    the earthy and alkaline gallates likewise afford
 acetic acid by their decomposition.
     lOthly,  and finally,    That gallic acid, like    the other vege
 table acids, is composed       of oxygen, hydrogen,      and carbon.
     If these results be accurate, we may conceive it possible
 to accomplish      its  synthesis.     Some trials that I have al
 ready made give me the hope of succeeding in it.                 I shaH
 <lo myself the honour of imparting the further results of my
 inquiry   to the class,   if they  should be worthy its notice.

VIT. Note upon a fulminating Comlinatkm of Silver, of a
  white Colour and a crystalline appearance. By M. Des-
  COST1LS *.
J. here       is sold at Paris, object of amusement, a de
                                      as an
tonating powder inclosed in slips of cards cut lengthways.
This powder is placed at one end of this envelope, and the
other end is made smaller in order to be more easily distin
guished.   If this last extremity is held with one hand, and
the other end is put over the flame of a candle, a detona ion
speedily takes place with a sharp noise and a violet-coloured
flame ; the card is torn to pieces and scorched, and the part
which   the composition touched is covered with a slight me
tallic coating of a grayish white.
   Having been consulted upon the nature of this substance,
which is sent ready prepared to Paris, I was convinced,
after var'ous experiments, which it is needless to detail, that
it is a combination of oxide of silver, ammonia, and a ve
getable substance; a combination analogous, as we find, to
that which constitutes the fulminating mercury of Mr.
Howard.
  We may obtain this combination,      which I shall call de
tonating silver to distinguish it from  the fulminating silver
of M. Berthollet, by dissolving silver in pure nitric acid, and
by pouring into the solution, while it is effecting, a suffi
cient quantity of rectified alcohol ; or by pouring the alpohol
into a nitric solution of silver, with a considerable excess of
acid.
   In the first      case we must slightly warm the           nitric acid              in*
which       the silver has been put,          until the solution begins               to,
take place; e. until the first bubbles begin to be perceived.
                i.
We must then remove from the fire and immediately add
                                 it
a sufficiency of alcohol, so that no nitrous vapours may be
liberated. The mixture of the two liquors takes place with                            a
disengagement of heat the effervescence immediatelv recom
                             ;
mences without disengagement of nitrous gas;       gradually             it
increases, and there          is   liberated    at the   same time            a   strong

 Bmell     of nitrous      ether.    The liquor soon becomes turbid,
 and we see deposited a white, crystalline, and opaque pow
 der, which must he separated, when it cea=cs to fall down,
 and washed several times wi.h small quantities of water.
     When we employ the solution of silver ready made and
 Strongly acid, we must he it it slightly and afterwards add
the alcohol ; the heat produced by the mixture, which is
performed gradually, soon produces a considerable ebulli
tion, and the powder is suddenly deposited *.
    This powder has the following properties :
    It is white and crystalline, but this last appearance is va
riable with respect to the volume and the lustre of the cry
 stals.
    It  changes     a little in the light.
    It inflames with        a sharp detonation by heat, agitation,        or
long continued           friction. Simple pressure, provided it be
not very strong, produces no change.
    It detonates upon being struck by the electrical spark.
    It   is sl'ghtly soluble     in water.     It has an extremely strong
metallic taste.
    Concentrated sulphuric acid determines its inflammation,
and the acid itself is driven to a great distance ; dilute sul
phuric acid seems to decompose it slowly.
    Weak or concentrated muriatic acid decomposes it in
stantly bv forming muriate of siher.                 The quantity of mu
riate obtained indicates about 71 per             cent.  of metallic silver
in   the detonating       silver;   at first there is liberated a very de
cided smell of prussic acid, but             I could not collect sensible
traces of it.
    The nitric acid decomposes it with the assistance of ebul
lition, and we obtain nothing but nitrate of silver and ni
trate of ammonia, if it be long enough continued.
    It  is decomposed by means           of sulphurized    hydrogen; the
ammonia and the vegetable matter remain in the liquor.
    Caustic potash decomposes it ; black oxide of silver is
separated, and ammonia is disengaged.
   *  It is almost needless to observe lhat the mixture of alcohol and warm
citric acid is subject to many accidents, and we must comequemly operate
upon very small quantities.

      It   is dissolved in ammonia ; but by a slow evaporation                             It
 is   separated from it              with   its proper colour and other proper-
 tics, and particularly that of detonating                      by means of heat,
 and not by simple contact.

            VIII.         Memoirs      of    Erasmus Darwin, M. D.
Oeldom do we find so great and diversified talents as were
united in the late Dr, Darwin. He shines forth as  meteor,                  a
even in an age conspicuous for extraordinary talents usefully
employed for the benefit and instruction of mankind.     We
shall pass over his education at Chesterfield school, where
the master,               the   Rev.   Mr. Burrow, noticed strong signs,
even then, of   rising genius; and his being afterwards sent
                          a
by his father Robert  Darwin, Esq. of Elston, near Newark,
to King's College, Cambridge, where he distinguished him
self    by   his attention to his studies.            It
                                            melancholy fact,
                                                           is   a
that our English universities are incompetent to form the
physician  but they lay the foundation of general knowledge,
                 ;
which in the end may conduce to the formation of the per
fect physician.                 With
                                of classical and mathematical
                                       a    store
knowledge, young Darwin went from Cambridge to Edin
burgh, then in its zenith of splendour, and, at the proper
age to feel the force of instruction,  imbibed all the know
ledge that proceeded from that clear fountain of vast medical
erudition.   Desirous of still deeper knowledge, from Edin
burgh he went to London to perfect himself in anatomy
under the celebrated Dr. Hunter, which science,       must be            it
confessed, from the easy acquisition of subjects for dissec
tion,      is   eyen      better taught in that metropolis than in the
                                                                Scotch

 Scatch university.     Thus every thing combined to render
him an adept in his profession, and it might have been ex
pected that nothing could have retarded his establishment
in any part of England: but .unfortunately for professions
of every kind, it requires time before superiority is acknow
ledged, and he struggled irl vain to obtain any practice in
Nottingham, which obliged him to attempt to settle at
Lichfield in    the  year 1756, where he believed he had lets
formidable    obstacles to encounter.        Dr. Wilkes possessed
at that time the entire confidence and all the practice of that
quarter, and little expectation could be formed of Dr. Dar
win's superior talents having opportunity of getting into
play, when a fortunate trial of his skill and knowledge oc
curred, which could not fail of settling him in the estimation
of  the whole country.      A  young gentleman of family and
considerable fortune, Mr. Inge, was seized with a putrid
fever.   Dr. Wilkes very unguardedly, or from the candour
inherent in cultivated minds, which scorns falsehood or eva
sion, pronounced the     case as lost.    In  the distraction of de
spair the mother requested      a consultation,    but the old phy
sician declined    the meeting ;   and the mother, a woman of
superior   sense, had rather trust a young         physician, who
might have a knowledge according to the advancement of
science, than an old man who positively pronounced the ex
tinction, in his mind, of every ray of hope. Whether Dr.
Darwin had a superior practice to Dr. Wilkes or not, the
public judged of the event, and from that occurrence he
might be said to be partly settled at Lichfield.
   As unmarried physicians have still much to cope with,
nothing seemed now wanting but the changing his condition
of life. The young physician had very general invitations
to families,   nor would any father have refused his daughter,
but he would only yield his heart to one worthy indeed of
such a man.      A young lady of very slender fortune, of in
fmite modesty and worth,       of delicate sentiment,    and replete
with   grace  and accomplishments,        caught the admiring eve
of  one who could discern retired excellency ; and, to the
surprise   of  many^   he yielded up to    Miss Howard his heart

 and hand.       The dving     and recorded     conversation* of Mrs.
 Darwin      exhibits   an affecting account of his first thirteen
 years   residence at Lichfield, and his character as a hus
 band.     "   Do not    weep for my impending           fate,"   said  this
 amiable creature in the last stage of a decline, and with a
 smile of unaffected resignation.          "  In the short term of my
 life a great deal of happiness has been comprised.              The ma
 ladies of my frame were peculiar ; the pains in my head and
 stomach,      which iroi medicine could eradicate, were spas
modic and violent, and required stronger measures to render
 them supportable while they lasted, than my constitution
 could   sustain without injury. The periods of exemption
from    those pains were frequently of several days duration,
 and in my intermissions           I  fett no indication      of malady.
Pain taught me the value           of  ease,  and    I  enjoyed it with    a
glow of spirit seldom, perhaps, felt by the habitually healthy.
While Dr. Darwin combated and assuaged my disease from
time to time, his indulgence to all my wishes, his active
desire to sec me amused and happy, proved incessant.                    His-
house,    as   you  know,    has  ever  been   the   resort  of  people of
science and merit.         If, from my husband's great and exten
sive practice,     I  had much     Ics3 of his society than I wished,,
yet the conversation of his friends-, and of my own, Was ever
ready to enliven the hours of his absence.                 As occasional-
inalady made me doubly enjoy health, so did those frequent
absences give a 2est, even to delight, when I could be in
dulged with his company.             My three boyy have ever been
docile and affectionate.         Children as they are, I could trust
them with important secrets, so sacred do they hold every
promise they make. They scorn deceit, and falsehood of
every sort, and have less selfishness than generally belongs
to childhood.        Married to any other man, I do not suppose
T could have lived a third part of those years which                 I have
passed with      Dr. Darwin     ; he has   prolonged      my days, and
he has blessed      them."
    The fruits of this marriage were           three sons ; and one of-
thesc inheriting from their father an impediment                of speech,

fhe learned doctor attempted the following'expedient as the
 cure.   He reasoned thus : that he had acquired this defect
 probably from that strong propensity which all children have
to imitate those with whom they associate. With that wis
dom which    marked the doctor's observations on the habits
of life, and with that decision of conduct which always in
stantly followed the conviction of his mind, he sent his
eldest boy, Charles, to France, in the belief that in the pro
nunciation of a foreign language hesitation would be less
likelyto recur than in speaking his native language ; nor
was he disappointed in the event : the habit was thus broken*
ind two years afterwards, on his return, he was able to speak
his mother tongue with ease and fluency.
    Lichfield seemed admirably suited to snch a genius as was
for. Darwin's.    It appeared to be the favourite spot of the
Muses, and of men of science; and wc would recommend
Our readers who would wish for information respecting the
literati* settled at Lichfield, to consult Miss Seward's
"   Memoirs of Dr. Darwin."
   During his residence at Lichfield Dr. Darwin met with
an accident which had nearly cost him his life. Being obli
gated to travel much,         he wished,     if      possible, to obviate the
inconvenience      of quartering,      so distressing         to horses ; and
for this purpose, having           a mind        above        ridicule,   he con
structed a very singular carriage.   It was a platform, with
a seat fixed upon a very high pair of wheels, and supported
In the front, upon the back of the horse, by means of a
kind of proboscis, which, forming an arch, reached over the
hind quarters of the horse, and passed through a ring placed
on an upright piece of iron, which worked in a socket fixed
in the saddle. The horse could thus move from one side
of the road to the other, quartering, as it is called, at the
will of the driver, whose constant attention was necessarily
employed to regulate a piece of machinery contrived, but
not quite adapted, for that purpose.  From this whimsical
taTriage the doctor was several times thrown, and the last
time he used      it,   had the misfortune,          from    a   similar accident,

  always must cause, an incurable weakness in the fractured
 part, and a lameness, not very discernible, indeed, when
 walking on    even ground.
     One may here mention, that he was also conspicuous by
 having a horse always to follow his carriage like a dog, pro
 perly saddled, and, where the roads were very bad, he would
 mount on horseback,      without    boots or spurs, often in co
 loured stockings, and thus visit his patient, and return back
 to his carriage which was waiting for him*
    Having destined two of his sons for physic,      he took him
 self uncommon pains with their education ;         and his eldest
 and darling son, Charles,     was   sent to Edinburgh    as a  pro
digy of knowledge.       He soon acquired great literary fame
from his discovery of the distinction of pus and matter, and
 the retrograde motion of the absorbents, explanatory of se

 rapid dissolution, though but     a few days before in the bloom
of health  and life, from the scratch of the dissecting-knife
in the too eager dissection of a dead and putrid body.
    His  hopes   were now concentred ou Rohert,         whom      he
likewise sent to Edinburgh, and who early signalized himself
by a paper in the Philosophical          Transactions   "   On the
Spectra of Colours," and whom he settled at Shrewsbury
m the bloom of scarcely ripened youth, and who even then
acquired the confidence of all, and continues still to possess
a very extensive practice and universal esteem.
    His third son, .Erasmus, he bred to the law,        who, ima
gining that his affairs     were perplexed (but which actually
was not the ease when his debts were collected), became
gloomy, and, in a fit of melancholy and despair, plunged
into that " bourne whence no traveller returns."
    Dr. Darwin is    severely  reprobated by some as not havingi,
publicly exhibited    those outward marks of sorrow for the
loss of his two sons which might have         been expected   : but
the reader will remember that his mind        was of no ordinary
stamp,   and  he  probably   concealed  from   the world the real
sufferings of a father j for that he was a man of keen sen

   Partly with a view for the instruction of his sons, and of
the world at large, he commenced at Lichfield his Zoono-
mia, or Laws of Organic Life.
  He        was much attached          to botany,     and the    wild scenery of
nature.        Living in     a romantic country,           and viewing it  with
a poet's eye, and regretting that there were but few votaries
to    it,
       probably owing to the science being concealed in                            a
learned garb, he began, with Sir Brook Boothby and Dr.
Jackson,       a   Translation    of   the Genera and Species Plautarum
of Linnaeus, which            goes     by the appellation         of being done

only of those three persons, no others being found willing to
enter into that body.   That Dr. Darwin was still proud of
this establishment     provedis    his ordering of Rivington,

including the Temple of Flora*," in the name and for the
Lichfield Botanical Society, although the doctor was now
settled at Derby.
   If there was any thing yet wanting to establish Dr. Dar
win's medical reputation at Lichfield,     was accomplished

been under several eminent physicians of London and Bath,
and, finding their endeavours ineffectual, the countess was
advised to try her native air, and had arrived as far as Lich-
licld .on her journey home.

  had performed, and she resolved to consult him. The doctor
  heard the case with patient attention, and with honest in
  tegrity told her ladyship, " that if she would confide in
  his judgment he had full hopes of her recovery."             One in
 junction he made, that the countess would remain at Lich
 field.   He condemned      the system her ladyship had      followed,
 of nutritious food, rich jellies, and wine, and        a quantity of
 medicine every      three or  four hours, with forcible exertions
 of body and mind, and substituted exactly a reverse system;
 and in three weeks the countess was completely restored, and
 able to resume her journey, not for health, but to enjoy the
 society of her elegant circle of friends, who admired greatly
the sagacity of that physician who had saved her life.
     One may here remark that Dr. Darwin was ever unfriendly
to the system of too much excitement, and so decidedly ini
 mical to the use of wine and strong spirits, that he insti
 tuted   a Spirit of sobriety in the inhabitants of Lichfield
which was almost incredible.          His cautions he sometimes
gave even    in  a poetic dress.

concealed in his bosom the fire he had stolen, and afterwards
Jiad   vulture perpetually gnawing his side, tffords so apt an
        a
allegorv for the effects of drinking spirituous liquors, that
one is induced to think the art of distillation had heen known
in   times   of great antiquity
                              : for the swallowing drams can
not                        in hieroglyphic language than by
        be bet'er represented
taking fire into one.s bosom; and certain it is, that the ge
neral effect of drinking spirituous or fermented liquors is an
inflamed scirrhous,           or paralytic liver, with its various cri
tical or consequential diseases, as leprous eruptions on the
face, gout, dropsy, epilepsy, insanity.   It is remarkable that
all the diseases from drinking spirituous or fermented liquors
»re liable to become hereditary even to the third generation,
gradually increasing, if the cause be continued, titl the fa
mily becomes extinct. — Such are Dr. Darwin's sentiments.
   He now was souglit after even from a distance, and co
lonel and Mrs. Pole, of Radburn, Derbyshire, in 17*8, came
purposelv to Lichfield for the recovery of their children, who
Vere     suspected     of being in    a   decline after the hooping-cough.
     Mrs. Pole        was    then in the full bloom         of   her youth and
beauty.   Agreeable features ; the glow of health; a fasci
nating smile ; a fine form, tall and graceful ; playful spright-
liness of manners ; a benevolent heart and maternal affec
tion, in     all    its unwearied         cares   and   touching   tenderness,
contributed         to mspire   Dr. Darwin's admiration, and to            se
cure his esteem.            Soon after she left Lichfield with her         re
novated little ones, their restorer sent to his friend                    Mr.
Eolton, of Birmingham,              the    following directions for making

that their admiration was mutual, and their love platonic.

   These lines were composed and never sent, but locked
up, with others, in a bureau, and afterwards, as will be seen,
presented    to the fair lady.
   Near Lichficld Dr. Darwin purchased a beautiful sylvan
spot, which he cultivated as his garden, and which was soon
celebrated    by  Miss Anna Seward, of Lichfield, a sweet poet,
and   the lines     presented to Dr. Darwin.          He said " that
these should be the exordium of a poem which should be
palled The Botanic Garden, «-- Loves of the Plants;" and
advised this lady to undertake such a poem. This she de
clined,   but pressed it on the doctor, who had never yet
composed a whole poem, but only fugitive pieces, such as
we have given a specimen of; and he immediately from that
instant commenced the execution of The Botanic Garden,
which astonished an admiring world, and procured for the
 doctor the appellation of the English Lucretius.
    Whilst busied on this poem, the antiquated colonel Pole
 died. The widow, then in the zenith of her beauty, and
 Miil alive to the world, had scarce laid aside her weeds when
 piany suitors came to solicit her hand and fortune.              The

immediately remove to Derby.

IX.    Description of a circular Mother-qf-Pearl Micrometer           '¦
                 By David Brewster, A- M.
                        To   Mr. Tilhch.
Xn the Philosophical      Transactions       for 1791, Mr. Tiberius
Cavallo   has given an account    of an ingenious and simple mi
crometer, invented by   himself,   and excellently fitted for mea-
surino- small angles with accuracy and expedition.             It con
sists of a slip of mother-of-pearl       minutely     subdivided,  and
stretched across the diaphragm that is placed in the anterior
focus of the fourth eye-glass of an achromatic telescope.
The angle subtended by any number of its divisions is then
ascertained by experiment, and therefore the value of any
 other number can either be found by simple proportion, or
 from a table computed for the purpose.              The method of
forming this table,    and   the various purposes to which this
micrometer is applicable, have been given at great length
by Mr. Cavallo in his paper in the Philosophical Transac
 tions, and in a separate pamphlet descriptive of the instru
 ment¦
                                                                   .In

                   Mother-of-pearl Micrometer.                     49
    In  the   winter of 1805, when       I was employed in deline
 ating the surface of the moon, I wished to measure the dia
meter of the lunar spots by applying Mr. Cavallo's micro
meter to    a thirty-inch achromatic telescope      made by Berge.
But   as the   eye-piece was moved by a rack and        pinion, and
consequently could not turn round its axis, the micrometer
must have remained stationary, and could only measure an
gles in one direction.        This difficulty, indeed, might have
been surmounted       by a mechanical      contrivance  for turning
the diaphragm about its centre, or more simply by giving
a motion of rotation to the tube which contains the third
and fourth eye-glasses.        Such a change in the eye-piece,
however, was both inconvenient and difficult to be made.
Mr. Cavallo's micrometer, therefore,         has  this great  disad
vantage, that it cannot be used in reflecting telescopes, or
in any achromatic telescope where the adjustment of the                .
eye-piece is effected by rack-work, unless the structure of
these instruments is altered for the purpose.          Another dis
advantage of this micrometer arises from the slip of mother-
of-pearl passing through the centre of the field. The pic
ture in the focus of the eye-glass is broken into two parts,
and the view is rendered still more unpleasant by the in
equality of the segments into which the field is divided.         In
addition to these disadvantages, the different divisions of the
micrometer are at unequal distances from the eye-glass
which views them, and therefore can neither appear equally
distinct nor subtend equal angles at the eye.
    Finding that Mr. Cavallo's instrument laboured tinder
these imperfections,    I thought of a circular mother-of-pearl
micrometer      which is free from them all, and has likewise
the advantage of a kind of diagonal scale, increasing in ac
curacy with the angle to be measured. This micrometer,
which I got executed by Miller and Adie, optical instru
ment makers in Edinburgh, and which I have often used,
both in determining small angles in the heavens and such as
are subtended     by terrestrial objects, is represented in fig. l ,
which    exhibits its appearances in the focus of the fourth
eye-glass.      The black ring, which forms part of      the figure,

50                     Description  of   a circular
is the diaphragm, and the remaining part is a ring of mo
ther-of-pearl, having its interior circumference divided into
360 equal parts.        The mother-of-pearl ring, which appears
connected with the diaphragm, is completely separate from
it,   and  is fixed at the    end  of  a  brass    tube which is made
to move between the third eye-glass and the diaphragm, so,
that the divided circumference may be placed exactly in the
focus of the glass next the eye.            When the micrometer is
thus fitted    into the telescope, the angle subtended by the
whole field of view, or by the diameter of the innermost
circle of the micrometer, must be determined either by mea
suring a base or by the passage of an equatorial star, and
the angles subtended          by any number of divisions or de
grees   will be found by a table      constructed in the following
manner.
    Let AmpnB, fig. 9. be the interior circumference of the
micrometer scale, and let mn be the object to be measured.
Bisect the arch mn in p, and draw Cm, Cp, Cn.                  The line
C/i will  be at right    angles to mn, and        therefore mn will be
twice the sine of half the arch mn.           Consequently,     AB : mn
 = rad. sine of ±mpn; therefore mn xR= sin. ±mpn x AB,

     In order   to find the      angle subtended by any number of
  degrees,  we have     only    to multiply the constant part of the
  formula corresponding        to that number        in   the table by AB,
  or the angle subtended        by  the whole      field.    Thus if AB is
  30 minutes,    as  it happens to be in the micrometer which              I
 have constructed, the angle subtended by 1 degree of the
 scale will be 30' x -009 = 16* seconds, and the angle sub
 tended by 40 degrees will be 30' x -342 = 107 15*6" ; and
 by making the calculation it will be found that as the angle
 to he measured      increases, the accuracy of the scale also in
 creases ; for when the arch is only 1 or 2 degrees, a variation
 of 1 degree produces a variation of about 16 seconds in the
 angle ; whereas when the arch is between 1 70 and 1 80, the
 variation of a degree does not produce a change much more
 than one second in the angle.             This is a most important
 advantage    in   the  circular scale, as in Cavallo's micrometer
 a limit is necessarily put to the size of the divisions.
    It is obvious,   from an inspection of fig. 1, that there is no
occasion for turning the circular micrometer round its axis,
because the divided circumference lies in every possible di
rection.     In fig. 2*, for example, if the object has the direc
tion ah it will be measured by the arch aob, and if it lies
in the line cd it will be measured by the arch crd.
    In the circular micrometer which I have been in the habit
of using, AB, or the diameter of the field of view, is exactly
half an inch, the diameter of the brass tube in which it is
fixed is one. inch, the length of the tube half an inch, and
the degrees of the divided circumference f^-t-th. bf an inch,

was an old idea maintained by Pausanias *, refuted by Phi-
lostratus, and wjaich no person adopted any longer.
   On the contrary, the greatest part of the anatomists who
think   that    teeth     grow like common bones, by a kind of in-
                                                                                    '
tus-susception,         take their proofs from ivory, its diseases and
its accidents.
  Nevertheless, ivory is formed, like the other teeth, from
successive layers being transuded by the pulpy nucleus.
  I opened the alveolus and the base of a tusk in a recent
carcase of an elephant ; and here I saw evidently a pulpy
nucleus of enormous size, and entirely deprived of all or-
ganical union with the tusk-, which it had nevertheless se
creted. Although the carcase was perfectly fresh, I could
not   see the   least     adherence between the tusk and the nu
cleus ; not the least fibre, nor the smallest vessel ; no cellu-
losity tied them together. The nucleus was in the cavity of
the tusk, like a sword in its scabbard, and only adhered by
itself to the bottom of its alveolus.
   The tusk is therefore in its alveolus like a nail driven into
a plank.    Nothing retains it there except the elasticity of
the parts which enclose it ; we may therefore change its di
rection by gentle pressure.   This is an experiment which
succeeded      with our second elephant             :    its tusks were brought
so close together as to constrain the motion                    of its proboscis;
we separated them by means of a bar of iron, the middle of
which was in the form of a vice, and we could thus lengthen
it at pleasure. Every one knows that dentists do the same
thing, upon a small scale, with wires, with such teeth as
have only one root.
  The     successive       layers   of \vhich
                                        the ivory is composed
leave but few traces   upon the section of a fresh tusk ; but
here the fossil teeth assist us in better ascertaining the struc
ture of the parts. Those tusks which have been decomposed
and altered by their being under-ground, are split into coni
cal and thin laminae, all enveloped within each other, and
thereby show what has been their origin.

   No bone whatever, properly                          so called,      ever   splits in this
manner.             Sloane,         as   I think,     was the first who         made this
remark.
   Scratches,  or any scars whatever, made on the surface of
a tusk, are never filled up ; they disappear only in propor
tion as the tusk is worn down by friction.
   It   is true, we sometimes find balls in the heart                           of (he ivory
without seeing the hole through which they entered.
   Our museum possesses an example of this, and we find
several others scattered through various works *.
   Some have concluded that                           the track pursued
                                                  by the balls

   We cannot, therefore,                        deduce from this fact           any conse

pulpy nucleus at the period when it secreted the altered por
tion ; and what has been called exostosis is always insidey
and never outside.   It is the effect of a secretion for the
moment, too abundant at            a   certain point.
 . Specimens of diseased ivory have been often given by ex
hibiting the canine teeth of the morse {trichecus rosmarus)^
the texture of which is naturally grained.  Daubenton him
self has fallen into this error.
   The diseases of the teeth are nearly in the same case as
those of the ivory.
     What    has been called caries, an almost necessary         conse
quence of the removal of the enamel, is the decomposition
\vihich the internal substance would undergo, when it would
even be no longer adherent to the body if it remained ex
posed to the heat of the mouth, and the action of the saliva
and various food ; but it has no reference whatever to the
caries of the bones.
   The tendency to caries which the teeth of several people
evince^ pioceeds from their substance not being
                                                of a good
composition, and may be ascribed to the bad state of the
pulpy nucleus when it transuded them.
   It is the same with the spots and the more tender layers
we observe in the thickness of some teeth. All are the ef
fects of momentary indispositions of the pulpy nucleus.
     Pains and inflammationsexist in the pulpy nucleus, and
not in the hard part of the tooth.    It is the pulpy nucleus
which is sensible to the shocks and the temperature of bo
dies passing through the envelop which the hard part forms
around it.
     It               surprising to some that so thick and
          may be perhaps
hard an envelop does not blunt all sensation; but the pulp
of the nucleus of the teeth              is,
                                 next to the retina and the
pulp of the labyrinth         of   the ear,    the most sensible part   of
the animal frame.    Fishes, which have their labyrinth in
closed in the cranium, without any box or tympanum, and
without small bones in word, without any communica-

Yion opening externally, hear sounds in consequence of                  vi
brations communicated          to the      cranium.     The teeth, how
                                                                   ever,

             Memoir upon living and fossil Elephants.                  8$
ever,    evince something        much stronger in point        of  sensi
bility*
    The   exostoses   of the  teeth (their fungosities)    do not grow
upon the surface      of the enamel of a sound tooth, but in the
bottom of the      hollows of the carious ones. These are pro
ductions of the pulpy nucleus, which have pierced the hard
matter in the thin bottom of these hollows.
    The continual lengthening of          those teeth which have none
opposite to them to retain them, agrees with all these facts ;
the portion once sent out of the tusk of the elephant length
ens always, but does not become thicker, and does not har
den    : this is because it is always pushed back by new layers,
while in itself it cannot undergo any change. We know
how far this lengthening proceeds in rabbits which have lost
a tooth, and whose opposite tooth is no longer worn by mas
tication.      Continuing     to lengthen backward,       it finally hin
ders the animal from eating.          It   was from this that Aristotle
 asserted    that the teeth grow all our lives, while the other
 bones have determinate limits.
     It must   be added, however,        that the ordinary teeth have
a determined      limit  : this is when the entrance of their ca
vity is obliterated, and when their pulpy nucleus receives no
more nourishment ; but nature has taken care to leave the
 paths always open in those animals which, from wearing
 their teeth much,       require that they should be often repaired
 behind    : such are the rabbits with respect to their incisors,
 and the elephants      with   respect to their tusks   : the root never
 being obliterated, its channel can never be closed.

     For want of information on the subject of the formation
 and the manner in which teeth grow in general, describer*
 of fossils have committed a multitude of errors; but as the
 circumstances relative to the teeth         of  the  elephant are still
 more complicated and more difficult than those which con
 cern the other animals, these have led people into much
  greater mistakes.

       Formerly       a great  number      of authors    were  in possession
    of entire    and well formed teeth of fossil elephants without
    knowing     it.
       Aldrovandus, Leibnitz, Kuudman, and Beuth, were in
   this situation.
       The inverse of this ease has often taken place also, and
   teeth  of a very different description have been exhibited for
   those of elephants.
      Aldrovandus (De Metall.) describes three teeth of the hip
   popotamus as those of an elephant.
      M. de la Metherie (Theory of the Earth, vol. v. p. 200,)
   says that the tooth found near Vienne, in Dauphine, and
  engraved in the Journal de Physique for February 1773*
  p.   135,   seems to have       belonged to the elephant of Africa^
  We have shown that it must have belonged to a species of
  the grand tapir. The same author (at p. 201) asserts,              " that
  it is now proved that the teeth from the Ohio, and those
  brought from Peru by Dombey, are those of an elephant
  which     is of the same species as that of Africa."
      Notwithstanding all this, the teeth from Vienne, those
  of Ohio, and those from Peru, do not resemble each other
 at all, and neither of them resemble               those of the African
 elephant.
      Other authors have thought of establishing specific dif
 ferences from the number of teeth existing at one and the
 same time in the jaw.            Thus Merck (Seconde Letlre sur les
 Os Fossiles de Rhinoceros,             Darmst. 1784, p. 12, et seij.)
 thinks     he has     established     the difference between living and
 fossil elephants from the circumstance of the jaws he ob
served having only two teeth, while that of the elephant
described by Daubenton had four.                 He fills eight pages with
reasoning on         this  subject, and finishes by proposing an ex
planation       of  this  variety  in the number of teeth, similar to
that of Pallas, by referring it to the difference of ages.
M. Morozzo           {Mem. de la Societe Ital. torn. x. p. 162) even
informs us that the elephant has only one tooth on each-
fide.
     Some persons having been ignorant how these teeth di
                                                                   minish

minish in every respect before falling, and equally ignorant
of the great difference between the teeth of young and old
individuals, have imagined that the small teeth which are
found     isolated  proceed from an elephant     of a much smaller
species.
    But by far the most' serious errors     are those    which have
been occasioned by the partial laminoe        of  the  germs of ele
phants' teeth which have been found detached and not at all
worn.
    The antient naturalists,    who generally considered fossils
as figured stones, found      in these lamirrae some resemblance
to a foot or a     hand, and gave them the name of chirites.
    Kircher represents some of them under this name in his
Mundus subterraneus, ii. 64. There are also similar ones
in his museum, and in the Museum metallicum Vaticanum
of Mercati.
    Aldrovandus describes them by the same name, De Me-
 tall. lib. iv, 481.
    But nothing of this kind approaches what we find in the
 Rariora Naturce et Arils of Kundman, PI. III. fig. 2. This
author describes the object represented by his figure as the
petrified skull of some great baboon ; he asserts that the
 skin, the flesh, the nails, and the veins, were to be seen in
it entirely petrified   ; that M. Fischer, professor at Konigs-
berg,    who    had  seen the greatest part of the cabinets in Eu
 rope, regarded this petrifaction as one of the most singular
in the world : and, lastly, that the king of Poland, when
elector of Saxony, had offered him a considerable sum in
order to place it in the cabinet of Dresden.          Walch, in his
 commentary upon the work of Knorr, torn. ii. § 2. p. 150,
 quotes this rarity among the osteolithes of the ape, &c. A
 single glance, however, thrown upon the -figure will show
 that it is merely a lamina of an elephant's tooth not yet
 worn    at its extremity, nor soldered  to the rest  of the tooth.

Comparison between       tlie Grinders 'of the Indian and the
      ^African Elephant, and first distinctive Character of these
      two Species.   Examination of various fossil Elephant
      Teeth.
  For     long period teeth belonging to the elephants of
          a
India  and those of Africa have been indiscriminately de
scribed, without comparing them, and without perceiving
that they did not resemble each other in every particular.
Thus the Royal Society of London, in 1715, caused to be
represented, in order to serve as an object of comparison,
some grinders from Africa, which considerably resemble, as
we well know, those from India; and no person insisted,
upon any difference which might have escaped the eye.
   The accurate and judicious Daubenton was equally far
from remarking the difference, and Buffon and Linnaeus
never supposed there was any more than one species of ele
phants.    We do not even perceive any traces of this discri
mination in Gmelin's edition of the Systema Natures ; and,
in fact, all that is found in the antient authors and in tra
vellers is vague, and can only be referred to simple varieties.
  Such, for instance, are the assertions of the antients re
specting the different degrees of the aptitude of these ani
mals for war.
  Diodorus Siculus, lib. ii. asserts that " the elephants of
India far surpass in courage and strength those of Libya."
   Appian confirms this, (De Bellis Syriac. ed. Amsterdam.
1670, 8vo. vol. i. p. 173.)    According to him, " Domi-
jius, who commanded the Romans against Antiochus, judg
ing the elephants he got from Africa would be of no use to
him, because they were smaller and because they were afraid
of the large elephants, he ranged them behind the others,"
(i. e. behind the Indian elephants).
   Pliny and Solinus remark generally that the African ele
phants were smaller than the Indian, and were afraid of
them.     It  extremely probable, however, that the elephants
               is
in the service of Hannibal and Jugurtha were of the former
spepieg   only.

           Memoir upon living and fossil Elephants.                            <5S
   There is something more accurate, and equally true, in what
is mentioned by a scholiast upon Pindar, cited by Gessner,
Quadr., p. 378, that the males only of the Indian elephants
had tusks, but that both sexes had them among the elephants
of Libya        and   Ethiopia.   As   to the distinction             established
               between the elephants
by Philostratus*                                      of mountains, plains,
and marshes, and as to the differences                of their nature and of
their ivory, it is also probable that if they were real they
constituted simple varieties only.
   The merit of the first legitimate specific distinction of
elephants from the internal structure of their teeth is there
fore entirely owing to P. Camper: although he has written
nothing on the subject, the plates in which he has repre
sented them, and the testimony of his son and of M. Faujas,
tecure this merit to him.
   M. Blumenbach has also made                  the observation         :   he has
characterized the two species according to this sole diffe
rence in his Manuel, sixth edition, p. 121, and has exhi
bited drawings         of the two kinds of     teeth        in his Ablildungen,
pi. 19.
   This difference consists in         the form        of     the laminae   and in
their number  j it is observable even in the germ.
   The germs of the elephant from India are laminae, each
of which is formed of two surfaces nearly parallel, and sim
ply furrowed in their length.       (See Elephants, Plate III.
fig. 5.) In the .elephant from Africa, one of the surfaces,
and often both, produces in its middle and upon nearly all
its length an angular jet ; its furrows are also much less nu
merous. (Fig. 6.)
   It results from this structure of the germs, that the section
of the laminae, when the tooth has been worn, presents in
 the elephant of India narrow transverse stripes of an equal
 breadth, and the edges of which, formed by the enamel, are
 yery much festooned j and in the elephant of Africa lozenges
 or        broader in the middle than at the two ends, and
      stripes
 Jhe edges of which are rarely frittered into very perceptible
 festoons,
                         * Vita ApolL Tyaa.   lib.   ii.   cap. 13.

  64         Memoir upon living and fossil Elephants.
     To this difference in form, may be added another in point
  of  the number : the laminae of the African elephant being
  broader, it requires less of them to form a similar length of
  tooth ; nine or ten of these lamince form a tooth as large as
  13 or 14 of the Indian species would do.
     It seems that these     two species preserve the same propor
 tion in teeth of the same age as in those of the same length.
 Thus, by comparing our skulls from Asia with those from
 Africa at nearly the same age, we find in the back teeth of
 the former     14  or 15 laminae,     and in those of the latter     9 or
  10  only.
     Besides, we never saw      a tooth  of the   African species  which
 had more than 10 laminae,         while those of the Indian species
 have, according to Mr.        Coxe, 23, and we have seen fossil
 teeth of this species having 24 and 25.
     These characters, taken from the grinders, being once
 ascertained with respect to living elephants, it was natural
 to examine with this view the fossil elephants, since, with
 the exception of the tusks, the teeth are most frequently
 found and preserved.
    The questions which occurred were the following :
    Which of the two living species of elephants do the fossil
 teeth resemble most      ?
    Do they resemble one of them entirely            ?
    Are all fossil teeth similar to each      other?
    There is no doubt as to the first        question.     The greatest
number of fossil teeth resemble at             first sight those of the
 Indian elephant, and are composed,           like the latter, of stripes
nearly equal     in  breadth  and   festooned.
    We may be certain of this by consulting PI. VI. (marked
Elephants) in which we have represented fossil teeth, both
upper and lower, of different ages, and one half of their na
tural size.
    Fig.  1, is a lower tooth     of  an old elephant,     much worn,
found last year in the forest of Bondy, with its next tooth.
    Fig.  2. belongs to a very young elephant;            a real young
tooth from Fouvent.
                                                                     r,6.

    Fig. 4. is one of the second teeth of the young elephant.
 It comes from the vicinity of Toulouse.
    Fig. 5. a lower tooth of an old elephant, only half worn.
    This general resemblance has induced Pallas, and almost
 all subsequent writers, to think that the fossil elephant is
 the same with that of Asia.
    Bnt is this resemblance complete? I denied it on an
other occasion (Mem. de I'Instit. Classe de Math, et Phys.
torn. ii. p. 19).    Since then, however, I have hesitated a
little in maintaining an assertion which might appear con
jectural, and as to which the observations of my learned
friend    M. Adrian Camper            had inspired       me with     some
doubts*.       Let us again examine the matter impartially.
    In  the first place,   it  is certain that the number      of  the la
minae, considered by itself, cannot, as I thought, yield any
good characters, since it is subject to vary according to the
age of the individual and the place in which his tooth is
 situated, from four up to four-and-twenty.
    But is the number always the same in teeth of equal
length ? This is what I have examined in a great number
of   teeth both of Indian and fossil elephants, and I have al
most always found the laminae of the latter thinner, and
consequently more numerous, in the same space.

  XI.    On the Phenomena           of the Horizontal Moon.           By

                            To   Mr. Tilloch.
OSIR^ N looking   over Young's Lectures on Natural Philosophy,
lately published, I found in the second volume, p. 313, that
the doctor has taken notice of my paper on the phenomenon
of the horizontal      moon,      published in the ninth volume of
the Philosophical      Journal,     and has marked it as         "  either

 66       On the Vhamomena       of the Horizontal Moon.
 erroneous or unimportant:" in consequence of which I
 turned to the first volume, hoping to find some new hypo
 thesis advanced by the doctor in his lecture upon this sub
ject ; but I was disappointed.
    The doctor says, vol. i. p. 454, that " the sun, moon,
 and stars,  are much    less luminous       when they are near the
 horizon than when they are more            elevated,  on account of
 the greater quantity of their light       that is intercepted in its
 longer passage through       the atmosphere;      we also observe a
 much greater variety of nearer objects almost in the same
direction : we cannot, therefore, help imagining them to be
more distant when they rise or set than at any other times ;
and, since they    subtend the same angle, they appear to be
actually larger.    For similar reasons, the apparent figure of
the starry heavens, even when free from clouds, is that of
a  flattened vault, its summit      appearing to be much nearer
to us than its horizontal parts, and any of the constellations
seems to be considerably larger when it is near the horizon
than when in the zenith."
    This explanation seems to be derived from the hypotheses
of Des Cartes   and Berkeley;      but the reader shall judge for
himself.
    " Des Cartes*, and from him        Dr. Wallis and most other
authors, account for the appearance of a different distance
under the same angle, from the long series of objects inter
posed between the eye and the extremity of the sensible ho
rizon; which makes       us imagine it more remote than when
in the meridian, where the eye sees nothing in the way be
tween the object and itself. This idea of a greater distance
makes us imagine the luminary the larger; for an object
being seen under any certain angle, and believed at the same
time very remote, we naturally judge it must be very large to
appear under such an angle at such a distance." — Hutton's
Mathematical    Diet. vol. ii. p. 74.
   Mr. Molvneux says (Philos. Trans. Abr. vol. i. p. 221),
" that if the hypothesis of Des Cartes be true, we may at
any time increase the apparent magnitude of the moon even
                    * Des Cartet was born in 1596.
                                                                  in

in the meridian; for, in order to divide the space between
it and the eye, we need only to look at it behind a cluster
of chimneys, the ridge of a hill, or the top of a house," &c.
He further                           "
                         that when the height of all the in
                   observes,
termediate objects is cut off, by looking through a tube the
imagination is not helped, and yet the moon seems still as
large as before."
   Dr. Smith says in his Optics, vol. ii. p. 55, of the Re
marks, that in Berkeley's Essay towards a New Theory                                of
Vision* there is the following solution :
     "   Between the eye and the moon,                         when situated in the
horizon,                                    of atmosphere than
               there lies a far greater quantity
there does when the moon is in the meridian.        Whence it
•comes to pass that the appearance    of the horizontal moon
is fainter ; and therefore, by sect. 56, it should be thought
bigger in that situation than in the meridian, or in any other
elevation above the horizon."
   " But," says Dr. Smith, " to avoid entering into a par
ticular consideration               of his arguments, I choose              to show,
from experience only, that these various degrees of the
moon's faintness make no sensible variation of her apparent
magnitude ; which,                 I think, will       be evident by the   following
observations :
     "   First,    that the moon appears much                    fainter in the day
time than in the night, and therefore, according to our au
thor's principle, should appear larger ; which I could never
perceive, though              I   have often viewed the moon            for this pur
pose.
     "
     Secondly, I observe that the moon when totally eclipsed
appears much fainter than she does at the same elevation
when not eclipsed, but does not appear larger than usual,
as   I   am    fully     satisfied       by the total eclipse of the moon on
Nov. 20, 1732.
     "   Lastly,    I         this hypothesis of faintness can
                         observe         that
scarce be thought sufficient, by any means, to account for
the like variety of the apparent magnitudes of the constella
tions; that        is,   of   the intervals       of   the    same   lixt stars at va-

and consequently to depend upon the same cause."
    No attempt, I believe, has yet been made to prove the
truth of either of these old theories experimentally ; but, on
the contrary, the experiments and observations of Molyneu*
and Smith show that they are both fallacious.
    From some experiments which I have lately made, it ap
pears that the apparent magnitudes of all objects vary, as
well     as those   of the sun and moon.

        My Lord,
      When  Mysore I was honoured by the receipt of Mr.
              at
Secretary Keble's letter, dated the 2Sth of June last, and,
finding my general health much improved, I resolved to
proceed to the Malabar coast in search of the information
required by your lordship in council, regarding the Chris
tians inhabiting that part of the peninsula; an investigation
which     I   have        interesting as it is important, whe
                      found    as
ther it  regards humanity at large, or as it is connected, in a
political view, with the British interests in this country.
  To view the extensive field pointed out for my inquiries
minutely, would require much more of my time than could
be well spared from my other public avocations; and as I
learned that the reverend Dr. Buchanan was nominated by
the government  of Bengal to travel over the same ground
for purposes somewhat similar, 1 did not think it incum
bent on me to take up more than a general view of the sub
ject, and      I    directed my attention accordingly, not so much
to details    as to     matters of comprehensive import.
  The first object        to which      the     orders   of government refer
is,   to an account        of the introduction           of Christianity into
this country.
   There can be no doubt           whatever that the St. Thomfi
Christians         settled on the Malabar coast at very early pe
                                                               a
riod of the Christian church            from whence they, at one
                                         ;
time, spread         in various directions as far even as Mileapoor
and St. Thomas's Mount        but to derive ttiitlientic informa
                                    :
tion as to the time of their arrival    at present no easy task.

  From        the    confusion      arising     from     the   imperfection   of

70           On the State    of the Christians inhabiting
Hindoo chronology,        from the desire which these Christians
have to derive their origin from the earliest possible times,
(which may      perhaps have introduced false traditions amongst
them,)    and as all their authentic records are reported to have
been    destroyed    during   the   persecutions of the church of
Rome; from all these circumstances, whether we refer to
the Hindoo accounts,        to the    St. Thome Christians       them
selves,   or to their persecutors the Roman catholics, we are
not likely to arrive at any certain conclusion as to the exact
time of their establishment in Malabar.                 Some circum
stances,    however, may      be. collected from undoubted autho
rity, by which it may        be inferred that they have been for
nearly   fifteen  centuries   established in India ; for we find in
Ecclesiastical History, that at the first council at Nice, in
the year 325,      a bishop from India was amongst the number
composing that memorable synod ; and, in the creeds and
doctrines of the Christians of Malabar, internal evidence
exists  of their being    a primitive church ; for the supremacy
of the pope is denied, and the doctrine of transubstantiation
never has been held by them; and they regarded, and still
regard, the worship of images as idolatrous, and the doc*
trine of purgatory to be fabulous : moreover, they never ad
mitted as sacraments extreme unction, marriage, or con
firmation : all which facts may be substantiated on reference
to the acts    of  the  synod established by don Alexis de Me-
neses, archbishop of Goa, at Udiarnper, in the year 1599.
   The history of this council will be found most ably de
tailed in a work printed in French, and entitled           " The Hisr
tory of Christianity in     India," published      at the Hague in the
year 1724 by      La Croze3     the celebrated   librarian to the king
of Prussia.
   The object of this work          was to deduce, from authentic
materials, the rise, progress, and establishment of Chris-r
tianity in the East ; and to hold up to disgrace and to me
rited indignation the bigoted and upworthy conduct of the
Roman catholic church in the persecution set on foot by
her emissaries, under her avowed sanction, against the pri
mitive Christians      who were found        settled   on the coast of
                                                             Malabar^

            the Kingdoms    of Cochin and Travancore.            J\
Malabar j and     La Croze   seems   to have discharged his duty
to the public in a most faithful, interesting, and able manner.
    When the Portuguese first arrived in this country, in the
beginning of the    1 6th century, they found a Christian church
using the   Syrio-Chaldaic language established in the neigh
bourhood of Cranganore ; and, though it was published to
the   world   many centuries before that period that such a
church    existed, yet we find their ignorance expressed in
the wonder which it excited.
    These Christians    met the Portuguese as natural friends
and allies, and rejoiced at their coming; but the Portuguese
were much disappointed at finding the St. Thome Chris
tians firmly fixed in the tenets of a primitive church, and
soon adopted plans for drawing away from their pure faith
this innocent, ingenuous, and respectable people : however,
after using, for nearly a century, all the customary arts and
abominable persecutions of the church of Rome to no pur
pose, don Alexis de Meneses, the archbishop of Goa, ap
peared amongst them ; and, by his commanding            influence,
his zeal,   and his learning, and on the authority of what he
called the council of Udiamper, forced the Syrian metropo
litan, his priests and people, into the Roman pale.            The
archbishop,    however,   had  not long quitted  the scene  of this
triumph of bigotry, ere the people sighed for their old reli
gion, and cherished it in private       ; but on the 22d   of May
 1C53 they held a congress at Alingatte,      and great numbers,
headed by their metropolitan, revolted publicly from the
Romish communion ; nor has all the influence of the Roman
pontiff, and the kings of Portugal, been able to draw them
away again from their old faith.
    Leaving the history of this intcresiing      people, which is
affectingly   delineated in   La Croze's book, I shall, in this
report, confine myself more particularly to the existing state
of Christianity in Malabar; and, in order that your lordship
may have the subject clearly before you, I shall consider
each sect of Christians by itself, under the head of, 1st, St.
Thom6, or Jacobite Christians; edly, The Syrian Catho
 lics, who have been forced from the Jacobite church into.
 the Romish palej and, 3dly, The Latin church.

 73          On the State  of  the Christians inliabiting
                St. Thome", or Jacobite Christians.
    These people, who still retain their antient creed and
usages, consider themselves as the descendants of the flock
established by St. Thomas, who is generally esteemed the
apostle of the East.      Their ancestors emigrated from Syria,
and the Syrio-Chaldaic is the language in which their church
service is still performed.       They admit no images within
their churches, but a figure of the Virgin Mary with the
child Jesus in her arms, which is considered merely as an
ornament, and not a subject for idolatrous worship.           They
are generally denominated by the country people Nazaranee
Mapilles.      Nazaranee is obviously derived from Nazareth,
but the origin of the word mapillah is variously accounted
for: by some it is ingeniously supposed to refer to the Virgin
and    Child,  the only image admitted     within their churches;
as ma implies mother in various languages, derived from
the Sungscrit ; and pillak, child.      Others again, construe the
term to indicate the rank originally conferred on these Chris-
tians by the sovereign of Malabar.         Poolah signifies a classf
in a state synonymous with our secretaries.            Ma or maha
signifies great    or  superior.   The  term  Mapillah is indiscri
minately applied to Jews and Musselmen as to these Chris
tians, distinguishing each by the prefix of the Jew, Syrian,
or Nazaranee, or Musselman.
   It is certain that grants of honour and emolument were
formerly     possessed  by these Christians,    given to them by
a  king of Malabar       named Peremaul,      engraven on copper,
five of which engravings are still in existence; & facsimile
of which I have seen in the possession of the resident of
Travancore.
    It  has  been   long believed that these Christians held the
tenets   of  the Nestorian   heresy, and that they were obliged
to leave their own country in consequence of persecution :
however, it appears that the creed which they now follow
denies    that heresy, and seems to coincide in several points
with the creed of St. Athanasius, but without its damnatory
clauses.
   Baron Von Wrede has written           a memoir on the subject
                                                                 of

                  the Kingdoms        of Cochin and Travancore.                  73
of    these       Christians, which appeared in the seventh volume
of the Asiatic Researches, and which has the merit of call-
ing our attention to these people ; though it is no better than
a lame transcript of information,                    which may be fully and
satisfactorily obtained in La Croze's book, from whence
every material part of that memoir is obviously taken : in
 deed,       wherever the baron departs from his author he be
comes less interesting, or misleads his reader.                          That the
 Christians in Malabar were early taught the tenets of Nes-
 torius,       is proved by La Croze on the direct authority of
Cosrhas, an Egyptian                    merchant (himself a Nestorian),
who published bis voyage to India in the year 547.                                 It
seems, however,               not    improbable that Christians          had   been
 planted in these shores long before the time of Nestorius;
 and I am inclined to regard the tradiiion of its having spread
 hither in the age of the apostles, as.very far from fabulous*.
     With respect to their religious tenets, writers may, and
 will, disagree ; upon such subjects human reason avails no
 thing.          The disputes which on         these points have agitated the
 world,       are in general       no better than the perverse offspring of
 verbal differences.
     The following             is a version   of  the   present creed of these
 people, being a written communication from the metropo
 litan to the resident at Travancore :
      " In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, we,
  the Christians, believers in the religion of Jesus Christ, sub
 ject     to the        jurisdiction of Mar Ignatius, patriarch of An-
  tioch, being loyal Jacobians f, hold the following creed :
      " We believe in the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, Three
                                                                           Persons
     • ':'..': 1.in - informs us that there were Christians in India as
                                                                         early as the
  year 189, who had the Gospel of St. Matthew in Hebrew, which they de
  clared was received from St. Bartholomew.
     f  Eastern Christians, who renounce the communion of the Greek church,
  and differ from it both in doetrine and worship, may be comprehended under
  two distinct      classes. To   the former belong the Munophysites or Jacobites,
  so called from Jacob       Albardai, who declare it   as their opinion, that in the
  gaviour of the world there is only one nature; while the latter comprehends
  the followers of Nestorius.frequently called Chaldeans.from I he country whero
  they principally reside, and who suppose that there are two distinct persons or
  natures in the Son of God.         The Monophytites   are subdivided into two secti

                     before
might, and power ; co-equal, unity in trinity, and trinity in
unity.
      "   We    do not believe,     with Arius    and   Eunonimus, that
there are three different and separate substances.
      "   We   do not believe, as Sabellius believes, by confusion
of substance.
  " We do not believe,            as Macedonius      said, that the     Holy
Ghost is       less than the Father and Son.
      "   We   do not believe, as     Mawney and Marcianus * said,
that the body       of Christ   was sent down from heaven.
    "     We   do not believe, as    Julianusf said, that Christ was
only man.
    "     We   do not hold, as Nestorius,       the doctrine     of two   na
tures and two substances in the Messiah.
    "We do not believe, as the Chalcedonians                      said, that
there are two natures in the Messiah.
   " But we believe, by the doctrine of the Trinity, that the
Son is coequal with the Father, without beginning or end ;
that in the appointed time, through the disposition of the
Father and Holy Ghost, without disjoining from the right
or parties ; the one African, and the other Asiatic. At the head of the Asi
atics is the patriarch of Antioch, who resides, for the most part, in the mo
nastery of St. Ananias, which is situated near the city of Merdin, and some-
times at Merdin, his episcopal seat; aa also at Amida, Aleppo, and other
Syrian cities. The government of this prelate is too extensive, and the
churches over which he presides too numerous, to admit of his performing
himself all the duties of his high office ; and therefore a part of the admini-
itration of the pontificate is given to a kind of colleague, who is called the
Maphrian, or Primate of the East, and whose doctrines and discipline are said
to be adopted by the eastern church beyond the Tigris. This primate used
formerly to reside at Tauris, a city on the frontiers of Armenia ; but his
present habitation is the monastery of St. Matthew, which is in the neigh
bourhood of Mousul, a city of Mesopotamia.     It is further observable, that
all the patriarchs of the Jacobites assume the denomination of Ignatius. —

mankind       :  that he was born of the Virgin Mary, through
the means of the Holy Ghost ; and was incarnate, God and
man.        So that in the union of the divine and human nature
there was one nature and one substance. — -So we believe."
     The   service   in their church is performed very nearly after
the manner of the church of England ; and when the metro
politan      was told that it was hoped that one day an union
might take place between the two churches, he seemed
pleased at the suggestion.
     The present metropolitan, Mar Dionysius, is now old
and infirm, but a very respectable character, and of the
 most venerable and prepossessing appearance.                        A person
 has been sent from Mousul, a city in Mesopotamia, to suc
 ceed    to   his station in the event          of his decease ; but this
 stranger, ignorant of the language of the country, with the
 character of being violent in his temper, and not averse, as
 it is supposed, to the views of the Romish church, it is to
 be hoped will be prevented from ever taking charge of this
 precious remnant of a pure and valuable people.
      The metropolitan has several archdeacons and deacons
 under him, who act as vicar-generals.                 They have fifty-five
 churches ;       and   the  number      of  their people, as given in to
  the resident, is estimated at 23,000.
      The    residence     of their metropolitan is at Candenatte,
  twelve or fourteen miles inland from Cochin,                      In some of
  their churches divine service is performed in the Syrian and
  Latin ritual alternately, by the priests of the Christians
  of St. Thome", who have adhered to their antient rites, and
  those who have been united to the church              of Rome*.         When
  the latter have celebrated         mass, they carry away the images
  from the church before the others enter.
      The character of       these people is marked by a striking su
   periority    over   the  heathens     in every moral excellence ; and
   they are remarkable for their veracity and plain dealing.
   They are extremely attentive to their religious duties ; and
   abide by the decision         of their priests      and    metropolitan in
      * This shows a spirit of toleration and Christian
                                                         liberality  very different
   from the bigotry of the Romish church.

        all cases, whether in spiritual, or, as I heard, in temporal
        affairs. They are respected very highly by the Nairs, who
        do not consider themselves defiled by associating with them,
     though it is well known that the Nairs are the most parti
     cular of all the Hindoos in this respect ; and the rajahs of
     Travancore and Cochin admit them to rank next to Nairs.
    Their numbers, it  is conjectured, are under-rated in the
    statement given to the resident, as it is generally supposed
    that they may be estimated at 70 or 60,000.    They are not
     persecuted, but they are not permitted to make converts by
     the governments under which they reside ; and it is sup
     posed that many respectable Hindoos would be happy to
,   join their sect, were it not for this circumstance: but at pre
    sent they suffer, as far as I can learn, no other hardship.
       If good men from Syria could be obtained, not as parish
    priests, but to superintend and regulate their concerns, I

    conceive it would be a great blessing to these good people.
         The direct protection of             the    British government         has been
    already extended         to them ; but, as they do not reside                within
    the British territories,         I   am somewhat         doubtful       how far      it'
    may be       of   use to them.
      To unite them to the church of England would, in my
    opinion, be   most nnble work

    Roman         might be recalled to their antient church

    second any efforts to that purpose.
         Their occupations       are various as those                of other Chris
    tians but they are chiefly cultivators
             j                                                  and artisans;       and

      These people, as stated above,, were constrained to join

lowed to chant and perform all the services of the church of
Rome in the Syrio-Chaldaic language by a dispensation from
the pope. They live under the authority of the metropolitan,
of Cranganore       and   the bishop     of Vtrapoli, and dress dif
ferently from other priests.          They wear a white surplice,
while the priests of the Latin communion             wear black gowns
like  the Capuchin     friars   of Madras.      The Roman       catholic
Syrians, it is thought, are much more numerous than the
members of the original church.              Their clergy are spread
through the antient churches, and, by retaining their lan
guage, and acting under the direction of the church of Rome,
they leave no means unessayed to draw over their primitive
brethren to the Latin communion.              It   appears  to me that
they are allowed to use their original           language, and to fre
quent the original church, entirely with this view ; and, as
far as I can learn, their numbers are gaining ground. There
are said to be eighty-six       parishes  of Roman catholic Syrians
 subject to the dioceses      of Cranganore and Verapoli.           Their
 priests, to the   number of 400, are styled Catanars, which ii
 a Syrian     appellation ; their congregations         are  reported at
 90,000 (old and young included), agreeably to the last re
 turns transmitted to Rome.           There is an inferior order of
 priests, who are called Chiamas, in number about 120. The
 Hindoos     have,  as far as   I can learn,   a  much greater respect
 for the Christians    of the original      church than for the con
 verts of the Latin communion ; which may be accounted
 for by their not associating with the lower orders of people.
 Attached to each church is a convent, where the Catanars
 reside in community,        there being three,    four, or five, to each
 church. The service is performed weekly, in rotation. There
 is a seminary at the college of Verapoli for the education of
 the Syrio-Roman catholics, and also one for the Latin church.
 The Syrio-Roman catholics are chiefly engaged, as already
 mentioned, in drawing their antient brethren within the
  Romish pale ; but it appears that some of them have been
  employed formerly in extending the general object of con
  version over the peninsula.          I saw one of their churches,
  at  a village   near  Pillimbaddy,      about thirty miles on the
  Madras aide of Trichinopoly ; and I heard of several others.

    The priests    attached   to the college  of Verapoli  are all Car
melites, united to the apostolic mission at Bombay, but not
 subject to it. The jurisdiction of each is not marked by di
 stinct bounds    ;  the parishes and churches being so intermin
 gled, that it is difficult    to form a right notion of their ex
 tent.   The bishop of Cochin, however, may be said to have
 a control over all the Romish          churches situated on the sea-
 coast immediately (with few exceptions) from Cochin to
 Ramnad, and thence round the whole island of Ceylon : the
 churches are numerous        ;  but  as they are in general poor, and
 arc obliged to be supplied        with priests from Goa, it would
 appear   that one vicar holds,          upon an average, five or six
 churches.       The number         of Christians composing these
 churches must be great, as          all and every of the fishermen
 are Roman catholics.          The bishop of Cochin usually resides
 at.Quilon.      There    are  very few European clergy (not above
 seven or eight)      under the three jurisdictions, and none of
 them men of education          ; and it cannot be expected that the
 native priests, who have been educated at Goa, or at the
  seminary at Verapoli, should know much beyond their mis
 sals and rituals.      The Latin communicants in the diocese
  of Verapoli are estimated at 35,000. The catechumen suf
  fers no persecution on account of his religion when once
  converted   ; but the country governments are excessively jea
  lous upon this point, and do their utmost to discountenance
  any conversion.
     The converts are from various cast?, viz. Chegas orTeers,
  Muckwas and Pullers ; and there can be no doubt but that
                                                                   many

  80          On the State   of the Christians inhabiting
  many of higher casts would be baptized              if  they did not
  dread the displeasure of their governments.
     It is well known that the Roman religion           was introduced
 by the Portuguese at the commencement of the sixteenth
 century ; the number converted in each year, upon an ave
 rage, reach to nearly 300 : the number, of course, naturally
 diminishes.      The morality of    the converts \s very loose   ;  and
 they are generally inferior,       in this respect,   to the heathens
 of  the country.
                        General Observations.
    Reflecting on the whole subject, several suggestions pre
 sent themselves to my mind ; and I think I shall not be
 considered as deviating from the line of my profession, or
 the intention    of your lordship in calling for my report, by
 offering some opinions to government, which, in a moral
and political view, seem of the highest importance.              It ap
pears from      the foregoing statement, that pure Christianity
 is far, very far, from being a religion for which the highest
cast of Hindoos have any disrespect ; and that it is the abuse
of the Christian name, under           the form  of the Romish      reli
gion,     to which   they are averse.      We have, my lord, been
sadly defective in what we owed to God and man since we
have had a footing in this country, as well by departing
most shamefully from our Christian profession ourselves, as
in withholding those sources of moral perfection from the
natives which true Christianity alone can establish ; and at
the same time we have allowed the Romanists to steal into
our territories,   to occupy the ground        we have neglected to
cultivate,    and to bring   an odium     on our pure and honoura
ble name     as Christians.    The evil would     be less were it not
well known that many of the Romish                 priests, and their
people,    who  have  thus  been allowed    to grow numerous under
our authority, are supposed to be far from well affected to
the government under which they reside : indeed, iu many
instances the Roman clergy are the natural subjects of na
tions at enmity with ourselves, at the same time that they
are eminently qualified,       by their influence in their profes
sion, to do us the greatest mischief, by spreading disaffection
                                                           throughout

                the Kingdoms        of Cochin     arid Tr'avancbre.               81
   throughout every part of the extended country. The Roman
   catholic religion, my lord, I believe I may say, without of
   fence to truth ot charity, has almost always been made a po
   litical engine in     the hands     of  its governments ; and we must
  be blinded indeed        by our own confidence, if we do not cal
   culate on its being so used in this great and rich country,
   where it has established a footing amongst an ignorant peo
  ple   ; especially when it is so well understood that our eastern
  possessions have been a subject of the greatest jealousy to
  all the rival nations of Europe.              In my humble opinion, my
  lord, the error has been in not having long ago established
  free-schools* throughout every part of this country, by
  which the children of the natives might have learned our
  language, and got acquainted with our morality.                         Such an
  establishment would, ere this, have made the people at large
  fully acquainted with the divine spring, from whence alone
 British virtue must be acknowledged to flow. This would
  have    made     them better       acquainted with the principles by
 which we        are governed ; they would have learned                 to respect
 our laws, to honour our feelings, and to follow our maxims;
 whereas they appear to me, generally speaking, at this mo
 ment, as ignorant of their masters as on their first landing
 on these shores.          I  speak    not of interfering with their re
 ligious prejudices, or endeavouring to convert the natives by
 an extraordinary effort on the part of the British govern
 ment.        Conversiouj in my opinion, must be the conse
 quence which would naturally flow from our attention to

make them read English books.         Translations have hitherto been very defec

to learn English.     This they consider as the key to fortune ; and, on the coast,
the most strict of the bramins will have little hesitation, as far as I cau learn,
in permitting their children to attend a free-school for the purpose of learning
it ; for they despise us too much to Suppose there is any danger of overturn
ing the principles of braminism.       But their ill-founded, ridiculous principles
must be shaken to the very foundation bv the communication of such liberal
knowledge as a Christian can instil into the minds of youth, and fix there by
means of English books ; and all this without making any. alarming attack

     I do not mention this as an experiment, the result of
  which might        be considered as problematical : the experi
  ment has been already made, and the consequences have
. proved commensurate with the highest expectation which
  reasonable men could entertain. The Danish mission, united
  with    the Society   for propagating the Gospel, have sent some
  good met*     into this country with the laudable view of spread
  ing   true   Christianity throughout our eastern possessions ;•
  and the names of Swartz, Gerricke, and others, will ever be
  remembered by numbers of our Asiatic subjects, of every
  east and description, with veneration and affection ; and
  there are happily stiH living some amongst us          of the same
  character.
     It  is true, tfiat the object    they had more particularly in-
  view has, in some measure, failed ; and few good converts^
  h is generally imagined, have been made : but let it be re
  membered also that they have laboured under every possible
  disadvantage ; they have scarcely enjoyed a mere toleration
  under our government, and received no kind of assistance
  whatsoever ', that they were few in number, and perhaps I may
  say, without injustice, that they erred (as the best might err) in
  the means which- they adopted; but that they have done much
  good by the purity of their lives, and by their zeal in spread
  ing instruction.       This will admit of no denial  ;  and I doubt
  not that I may say, without the danger of contradiction, that
  few and poor as these men have been, without authority or
  power to support them, a greater and more extended portion
  of heartfelt    respect  for the European character has been dif
  fused by their means throughout this country than by all the
  other Europeans put together. We have, m my bumble opi
  nion, mv lord, kept ourselves too far from the natives; we
  have despised their ignorance, without attempting to remove
  it; and we have considered their timidity (the natural result
  of their being trampled upon by one        race of conquerors after
  another) also as an object for our contempt; at the same time
  that wc have viewed the cunning of their character (which
                                                                   is-

    In the Philosophical Magazine for December 1806, a case
of aneurism is noticed, with the intention of being reported
on.
    J. J.,  aet.  55, was admitted       a  patient of the Finsbury Dis
pensary on the 13th of November last.                 From his own ac
count his health had been declining for about the space of
three years, and about the beginning of July 1806 he ob-
ttrved a swelling on the left side of his neck, immediately
                                      F  2                          above

   above the sternum      ;  which now (Nov.         13th) extended fromf
   the upper part of    that bone to the superior part of the larynx,
   with extremely strong pulsations, corresponding with the
   motions of the heart, which were irregular.                The tumour
  readily disappeared on continued pressure, but on that being
   removed it immediately resumed it3 former size and appear*
  ance.      He died on the 26th of the same month.
      On raising the sternum the aneurismal sac               was  in close
  contact with the internal and superior part of. that bone, but
  did not contain        "  one particle" of coagulated blood : the
  origin of    the sac was from the superior part         of the curve of
  the aorta, immediately on the right           side   of the left carotid
  artery: the opening by which it communicated with the
  aorta Was about a quarter of an inch in diameter: the ascend
  ing   aorta   was enlarged and      ossified   in   several points:   the
  muscular substance         of the  left ventricle of the heart was
  much thickened.
      The lungs      were   healthy,  as  well   as   the abdominal vis.-
  cera.
     Tlvc dissection    of this, together with similar cases in my
 possession       (the  preparations of which are preserved), in
 which this      disease has proceeded     till it terminated   the exist
 ence     of the individual   sufferers, without any coagulum being
formed       in  the  aneurismal   sac, are strongly opposed to an
 opinion advanced in Mr. John Bell's Surgery.                  " It is not
 less    imaginary,"     says that   author,    "  that the blood can be
 pushed back- from die aneurismal bag into the artery ; there
 is no such thing, it is a mere delusion ; as the blood coagu
 lates very soon, and does not contain one particle fluid
 enough to be returned into the vessel."
     It is also considered by many, that' in the operation for
 aneurism and wounded arteries, where it is necessary to take
 up the vessel, the passing of two ligatures round the vessel
 and dividing it between the ligatures, is of modern inven
 tion ; but it appears that this mode of operating was known
 to Paree, Fabricius,       and others.
     "   Sometimes, also, the surgeon needs to cut the vessel
 entirely across, by which its ends shrinking both ways
                                                                    among

   M.   de la Billardiere    has  arrived at the 23d number of his
Flora of New Holland. Five new genera are there described,
One   of which, in particular, which M. de la Billardiere calls
atherosperma, and which seemed to him to belong to the
family of the ranunculi, is a tree which is likely to become
useful to France, because its almonds have the taste and fkr
your of nutmeg, and it is likely to be capable of supporting
the temperature of our climate.               i•
   One of our most celebrated          correspondents, M. de Hum
boldt, continues      to publish,   along with his fellow-traveller
M.    Bonpland, the plants they have discovered in Equinoxial
America. Two numbers of this have been already published.
The family of the melastoma alone will be indebted to these
Jearned travellers for so great a number of new species, that
they might form a volume by themselves,
    Messrs. Humboldt and Bonpland have not been less in
dustrious in the natural history of animals.
   The condor,       the bird so famous       in the Cordilleras,    has
never been      described before their time in an uniform man
ner, and the size of it has been much exaggerated.
    It  is scarcely above one metre in height, nor mora
than three or four metres in thickness.              Its colour is gene
rally  of a  blackish   brown   ? the   lower  part of the neck is fur
nished with     a  kind of collar of white      feathers.   The male is
distinguished      by a fleshy crest upon the crown        of the head,
$nd by a white spot upon the wing; distinctions               which the
females have not.

    M. Tenon has given an important continuation of his
Memoirs upon the Dentition of the Horse.
    After briefly recapitulating        the results he had presented
in former     years,   he dwells    at considerable length upon the
back teeth, or the three teeth        of each jaw.
   The lower      teeth  have two roots ; those above have three.

The fusts of the former are thinner, and crooked from front
to rear ; those. of the rest are crooked towards the palate :
this    curvature distinguishes them from the front grinders,
whether      they are the tnilk teeth
                                           * or those which succeed
 to them, which are straight.
    The former of these back grinders arc visible in the al
veolus at the time of birth ; they come out at nine months,
and last all the lire «f the animal : they have also more
length for wearing down by mastication than a31 the rest,
The first and      second have behind a small longitudinal         ridge,
which      assists   them -in cutting the alveolus, but which is
speedily followed by a plane surface destined to support
the tooth which comes from behind. The third back tooth,
on the contrary,          not being to be followed by any other
tooth,     preserves    its rklge throughout    its whole length ; but
it has a small swelling which hinders it from opening the
alveolus so rapklly as the others.          All these teeth, in deve
loping themselves, cause upon tl>e jaw the effect of an ex
pansive instrument, which dilates it unequally, and varies the
form     of it according to the age of the animal and conform*-
ably to the wants of every period of life,
    It is only by thus studying nature, in the minutest details
of her works, that we are competent to admire them as we
ought ; but how difficult is the study ! The description of
the horse alone, has occupied the attention of           M. Tenon for
 these many years.
    The     same    respectable    anatomist   has  ako recently pub
lished the fixst volume of his          " Recherche*    d'Anatotnie     -et
de   Chirurgie."       He principally treats of the eyes, their dis
eases,    the  exfoliation    of the bones, and fee has inserted se
 veral of the memoirs which we have noticed in our former
reports.      This work, destined for men of science, cannot
be sufficiently analysed        in a report of this nature.

      M.   de Bcauvois has published the third part of his Insectes
   recueillis en Afrique et en Amerique.
      The history of animals, although placed at the limits of
    the physical and moral sciences, does not employ alone, in
   its discussions,    the theory of the action of bodies 5 that of
   the operation of mind also is not foreign to it.
      We know, for example, that the nature and the limits of
   the intelligence of the brute creation have for a long time
   occupied metaphysicians, although these are points that can
   be determined by naturalists only.
      In this  last respect such subjects become proper objects      of
   inquiry   to our class   ;  and it is for this reason we heard with
  much interest      a memoir upon instinct, or rather against in
   stinct,  which    was read to us by M. Dupont de Nemours,
   member of the historical class.
      Considerations foreign to the subject formerly rendered
    his description of subjects complicated, and Descartes fell
  into an opposite extremity by making the brutes to be pure
  machines.
      If we did not know, by so many experiments, how far
  the spirit of system has sometimes led the greatest of mem,
  we might be tempted to think that they were not serious.
      Since philosophers, however, have found it more advan
  tageous to observe simple nature herself, than to create an
•imaginary one, they have returned to a train, of thinking on
  the subject,. similar to that of the vulgar.
      No one of common understanding doubts that animals are
  conscious of their sensations, and are determined in their
  actions by the pleasure or pain of the moment : but further,
  every person admits that they have a strong memory ; that
•
  they form, by repeated experiments,               general judgments
  founded upon the sentiment of analogy ; and that they after
 wards conduct themselves according to the pleasure or pain
 these decisions make         them feel, and often in spite of the
 actual attraction of      a present   pleasure or pain : lastly, that
  these methods, well directed,         can  be employed by mankind
  in their education, and may lead them sometimes to assume
 ^he
        habit of performing with admirable precision^ actions

not only extremely difficult in themselves, but to which
even this conformation does not seem adapted.
    None of these philosophers doubt that animals have various
ways of expressing their wants and their passions, and that
those of a superior order, i. e. those which approach our
selves   in their organization, are capable of learning the sig
nification of several of our words, which they obey without
committing any mistakes.
    But, independently of these faculties which resemble ours
in some respects, and which also vary in a considerable de
gree in the different classes of animals, naturalists think they
have discovered in certain species, other faculties which
seem to be essentially different, and to which they have given
the name     of instinct.
    There are certain actions necessary to the preservation of the
species,but often entirely foreign to the apparent wants of the
individuals,     often also very complicated, which, were we to
attribute them to intelligence, would presuppose a foresight
and knowledge, which none have yet ventured to ascribe to
 these species ; actions which cannot be attributed          to imita
tion,    because   the  individuals who perform them often ap
pear to be incapable      of having been taught them, and yet
 those of the same species exercise them always nearly in the
•same manner : lastly, what is not less remarkable, actions
 which    have no reference whatever to the degree         of ordinary
 intelligence,   and which become more singular,          more acute,
 and more disinterested,       in proportion as the animals which
 perform    them   belong  to  classes  less elevated and more stupid.
 It is among the insects, the mollusques, and the worms, that
 we observe the most surprising instincts : it seems that in
 stinct and intelligence are two faculties given in order to
 compensate the want of each other, as, in other respects, fe
 cundity supplies the place of strength or longevity : it is
 ever by the   just proportion of intelligence, instinct, and phy
 sical qualities, such as the delicacy of the senses or the
  Strength of the body, that the species are preserved.

                          NEW COMET.
 J. he appearance of a comet, visible to the naked eye, has
for about a month past excited much attention.
   It was seen by Mr. Walker on the 26th of Sept. (vide
subjoined letter).
   Sept. 28 it was observed by a gentleman at Bath about
eight in the evening.     It was then near the star in Libra,
with about   5° S. declination,  and 218 right ascension.    On
the 30th it was again seen at Bath about the same hour 2^°
north of the equator, and 216^- R. A.: the tail about 5'
                                                               0
long, and the nucleus distinct and bright. These obser
vations are not given as correct.
   On the 30th Sept. it was seen at London, but we have
got no observation.
   Oct. 2, it was seen in the neighbourhood of the metro
polis, as bright nearly as a star of the first magnitude, with
a short bushy tail.
   A gentleman at Hampstead, who observed it with care,
informs us that its place was about 20° from Arcturus, in a
line towards Beta Libra.—In Jones's new globe the place
was in the centre    of Mons Menelaus.    It was seen distinctly
from 20' before    seven in the evening till low down among
the vapours in the western horizon towards nine o'clock.
   From Mr. Firminger, late assistant to the royal observa
tory, we received the following observation made on Tuesday
evening, Oct. 6: — at 6h 17' 22" mean time, right ascension
15" 16" 4", declination 7° 23' 28", observed by an excellent
small equatorial made by the late celebrated Mr. Bird. —
The length of the tail, as found by the time of its passage
over the meridian wire, extended 50' of a degree, and its
mean breadth measured about 7'.
   Oct. 1 1, at 7h P. M. the comet was one degree to the east
of the star marked Y on Hercules's right shoulder, its de
clination being nearly 20° north, and right ascension 243°,
being lCh 12'.     Sets about half past nine, at 33° to the
north of the west; having increased its declination 14°, and
                                                             its

                               New Comet.                              $i
its right ascension 23° degrees, in fifteen days; the sun
having passed over 1 5° of right ascension in the same time,
 and made 5° of southern declination.
    Oct. 12, it was seen, notwithstanding the strong moon
light, in the neck of the Serpent, making nearly an equi
lateral triangle with Alpha of the Northern Crown and
Beta Herculis.          The nucleus appeared still pretty bright ;
 but the short tail was much weakened by the force of so
much moon-light.            In this last interval, it seems to have
moved about         10 or 12° more northerly,          and towards the
 east.
     Observations made on the Comet in the Neighbourhood of
 Qosport, Hants :— From different observations and calcula
tions, it appears evident that the comet passed the equator
on the 27th of September, about one o'clock P.M., with
 218° right ascension j since which the following observa
tions have been        made    to determine its place and daily mo
 tion  :

          14th, at 7   P.M.        - - -       237      Dec. 15° 00' N.
     In four days it passed over 5° 40', and in the last eight
 days 10° 30" in the arc of a great circle.             The weather has
 in general been cloudy, with fogs, since its first appearance.

     I send  you  a  few observations on the present comet, which
 may be inserted        in your valuable Magazine, if you think
 them worthy a place.
     I first saw it on Saturday evening, the 26th of September,
 when it nearly equalled          Arcturus in brightness. This led
 me to hope     I might    see  it in the day-time with my equatorial
 instrument ; and, after some attention, I readily discerned it
 at eleven in the morning, but it was by no means so distinct
  as  Arcturus.      The nucleus having gradually diminished, I
  cannot now see it till the sun is set.          It had passed its peri
                                                                   helion

    9*                          Netv Comet.
    helion before it was seen in this country ; but, had we been
    on the look-out a few months ago, in the morning, before
    the sun rose, we might probably have seen it in its passage
    towards him.       It is now receding almost perpendicularly
   from the ecliptic, but may probably be visible for near a
   month longer.        By a good observation to-night, comparing
   it with Beta Herculis (which was in the field of a night glass),
   it follows that   star 5' 4l"  in time, and has 3' greater north
   declination.
       I have viewed    it with a 7-feet Newtonian reflector of 6f
  inches aperture, with magnifying powers from 90 to 50O
  times ; with a Cassegrain telescope of larger size ; with an
  excellent achromatic of Mr. Dollond : but its effect is best
  by a good night glass magnifying about six or eight times;
  with this the tail is ascertained to be 1° 40' long. To-night
  it passes over a beautiful cluster of small stars, which are
  not at all affected by the transmission.           The tail forms an
 angle of about 35 or 40° wide, but in the night glass and to
 the naked eye appears to issue immediately behind the nu
 cleus ; but in the above powerful instruments the nucleus
 appears of a hazy ill-defined roundness, nearly as large as
 Jupiter;    and the vapour appears to surround            the head, and
 then be forced behind.
      I  herewith    send    the   sketches     I  made    this   evening
 (Plate II.) : the first from the night glass, the second from
 the Newtonian reflector magnifying ninety times.

     The following notice respecting the comet appears in the
Montieur of the 8th of October: — " M. Pons, belonging to
the observatory at Marseilles, was the first astronomer who
discovered the comet in France, on the 20th of last month ;
and M. de Thuis, of the same establishment, noticed it on
the 21st and 22d.         From the observations which they com
municated to the astronomers at Paris,             M.   Burckhardt de
termined the     following orbit, which       he presented   to the class
                                                                       of

Institute on the 5th of this month : Passage to the perihe
lion, 25th September, 3 A.M., distance of the perihelion
0-6158 j perihelion 291° 4'; nucleus 267° 47'; inclination
48° 4'   : movement direct. These hints, says M. Burckhardt,
will  be sufficient to calculate the route       of the cornel ; but it
may be discovered without any trouble, being distinguisha
ble by the naked eye, as soon as night has closed.               It is now
 (September 25th) to the left of Arcturus, between the stars
of the Boreal Crown and those of Libra to the west. Its
motion is one      degree per day towards the          north, and rather
more than     a degree   towards the east.        This comet was also
seen on the 28th at      Vezhoul, and M. Flaugergues perceived
it on the 26th at Viviers. It seemed to him like a white
nebulous spot, very brilliant, and similar to a star of the
second magnitude.         It was surrounded by a nebulosity of
about six minutes in diameter, and had a tail about a degree
and   a half in length.      It is the opinion of the Institute that
this comet is different from any with which we are ac
quainted."

all useless expenditure of water. M. A. Pictet, the tribune,
who mentioned it in the report made to the legislative body
respecting the proposed law for imposing taxes for repairing
roads and bridges, Sec, gives the following idea of the above
                    "
improvement : — Each lock is furnished with an adjoining
reservoir,communicatingwith        it at bottom: the lock is destined
to raise and lower the vessels as usual, but the vertical move
ment    of the liquid which floats them is produced by       the sim
ple immersion or emersion of a box in the contiguous reser
voir ; the volume of this box is equal to that of the water to
be displaced, and it is so happily and ingeniously balancedj
that one man is sufficient for raising or lowering the largest
Vessel.    Thus, in future, the more or less considerable sup
ply of water, which formed ont of the chief difficulties in
the construction of canals, will be redueed to the quantity
necessary    for supplying  the waste by filtration and evapora
tion."

  The Russian company for promoting discoveries in the
north-west of America has taken possession of the island
of Sachin, in the sea of Ochosck. This island, which
extends from 45° to 52°                   of north latitude,                has been de
scribed by La Peyrouse.     M. de Krusenstiern examined
it, and determined astronomically different points of                                     it,
•upon his return from Japan, so that    now perfectly well it   is
laid down.             M.   de   Krusenstiern          has      made    a    very minute
chart       of it.     He    has      also verified what was                 advanced      by
La Peyrouse, namely, that                    there was no            passage for ship
ping between this island and                  the      eastern       coast    of Tartary.
The northern part of               the island     is   inhabited       by    Tartars,    and
the south-east part              by   Japanese.

   XVI.      Proposal for a new System of Building Houses,
                  Streets, &c.      By G. FIELD, Esq.
                             To   Mr. Tilloch.
TS1R,HE analogy       between the following essay and an inge
nious paper which I have lately seen " On the Figure in
which Trees should be disposed in Plantations," (quoted in
No. 7 of the Retrospect, from the Farmer's Magazine,
No. 28,) and their dependance on the same principles, have
induced me to resume my essay, which is connected with a
more extensive design, and has lain-by several years, and
to publish it through your Magazine, with which I consider
it more compatible than with either of the above.
    The author of the paper I have mentioned has demon
strated that the most advantageous            distribution  of trees in a
plantation is hexangular, because he has observed in nature
<f
    tltat mature strong trees, which have arisen from the seed
of any      one tree,    will lie found nearly in       the angle? of   an
equilateral and equiangular hexagon, with               the original  tree
 in the centre;"      and  because   "  the closest    order in which it
is possible to place a number of points upon a plane surface,
not nearer than a given distance from each other, is the an
gles offiexagons,        with a point in the centre of       each hexa
gon."        (See  Euclid, book iv. prop. 15.)
    In nature it may      be observed    also   that the general    form
of    trees is circular,    their brandies diverging in radii       from
 their trunks as centres, and that nature distributes their off
spring in circles around the parent trees.               It may be also
 rationally or mathematically proved that the closest arrange'
 ment of circles on a plane is in hexagons ; and these are the
 points of union and coincidence by which an easy transition
 is made from the subject of the above paper to that of the
 present essay ; coincidences arrived at, probably, by very
 different routes, and strongly presumptive of the same foun
  dation in nature and truth.
  Vol.   29.  No.   114.  Nov. 1807.         G                          On

 98                   Proposal    for   a new System
     On the general Application            of tlie circular Form w
                                Architecture.
                       " Order is Heav'n's first law."
                                                         Pope's Eway on Man.
    It  is notorious that the rough proportion of the diameter
 to the circumference        of a circle is as 7 to 22, rather exceed
ing i   to 3.    If, therefore,   we draw a line       AB (fig, 5. PI. III.)
 three times the         length   of   the     diameter of a circle C,
 allowing -fe diameter for deficiency, and divide this line
into four equal parts, we have the measure of the four
 sides of a square D, equal to the circumference of the cir
cle   C.
    It is evident, therefore, that            the circle circumscribes       a
much greater area than the square, at tlie same time thaf its
extremities lie nearer together; that therefore the circle is of
the two the most eligible form, for a building in general ;
and that, whatever be the malerials used for erecting the
walls, less of them wilj be required for a circular than for a,
square edifice of equal dimensions ; consequently, a consi-.
derable saving of materials.
    To   these   may be added the following considerations and
advantages      depending on the general properties of the circle:
    That of all forms of building,               (he circular    is the most
simple,      the most durable, and the strongest.
    That for beauty        and sublimity       it is far superior to other
forms,      presenting one endless front (whatever is bounded
being     little to the imagination,             the power of which is
infinite) ; and it is susceptible of all the variety of ar
chitectural decorations in arcades,             colonnades, domes, por
ticos, &c.
    That    the view from a circular edifice           is much more ex
tensive than from         a square building,        no angles intercepting
the sight from        the windows, &c., while the light entering
laterally at the windows, enlivens the dark pJers between
 them.
    That structures of this form may              be raised upon the    prin
                                                                        ciple

                 of Building Houses, Streets, &c.                    99
ciple  of the    cask,   and the materials formed into girders or
 hoops resting     on   each   other, so as to render it impossible
either to force its walls in or out; and hence the greatest
strength with the least consumption of materials.
    That as hoops may be formed of the materials to connect
 the parts  of  a  building with firmness, so,       to apply the idea
of the   cask further,     staves may be framed     of wood or other
materials (fig. 2.), to be connected by hoops or bolts, and
the openings, except such as may be required for doors and
windows, may be pannclled, plastered, or bricked up.
   Thus, large structures of great strength, durability, and
lightness    (and portable buildings),       may be framed at the
least expense, for barns, manufactories,          &c, while the face
of the country would be rendered extremely picturesque and
beautiful thereby, covered, as it were, with temples.
   That the natural form of covering or roof for a circular
building   is the dome,      which may also be constructed on the
principle   of the cask to any extent, or of hoops or rings di
minishing upwards and resting on each other, extremely
light, durable, and strong.
   That the dome is the best form of roof for resisting all
kinds of weather, requiring no other support than it has
intrinsically ; and hence it is a hollow structure affording
space for rooms which in other roofs is occupied by timbers,
and therefore requires less materials, while the dome is ac
knowledged to be both externally and internally extremely
beautiful ; the only form of roof, perhaps, that is so; whence
other roofs have been purposely hidden by the walls, giving
to edifices the appearance of mere inclosures.
   That   the distribution    of the timbers of the floors according
to fig. 3. would      save timber and give great stiffness and so
lidity to the floors,     as  the  shorter timbers would      require a
proportionably      less diameter,    and the divisions   of the house
into apartments may rest upon and support the timbers.
Or, if required, the floors may be more strongly and flatly
vaulted with masonry than in other forms of building, owing
to the power of supporting lateral pressure in jtfalls built upon
the principle     I  hare suggested    ; and  the  ceilings might    be

   formed        into shells, fans, &c., providing at once safeness
   from fire, durability, strength, and beauty.'
       That the stairs may be disposed with great advantage in
   th. "t-ntre of the building (fig. 1. F), affording the readiest
-  co'iirjunication        to all parts of the house, lighted from the
   top    ol  ilic dome by a lantern of the most simple or beautiful
   form ; while the well, spiral, or circular staircase is con
   fessedly      the most beautiful and the strongest.        In these latter
   particulars, however, there is the greatest latitude for varia
   tion to which fancy, convemence, Or even prejudice, may
   prompt : nor is it necessary in a mere sketch to show how
   the apartments may be laid out, the stairs and passages dis
   posed, the fireplaces and chimneys arranged, ventilation
   carried on, or water conducted,             &.c.  throughout this form
   of building; suffice it that it is susceptible of all the varia
  tion of other buildings in these respects, and with some
  peculiar advantages, as might be shown were I intent upon
  entering minutely into the subject.
      Such are the advantages of this form in individual build*
  in»s; such as are unequalled in general by other forms for
  strength, beauty, and convenience.
      Nor     are the advantages       of this form confined    to the Indi
  vidual structure, but extend            to general   and  even   universal
  use   ;  analogous to other cases physical, moral, and political,
  in which that which            benefits  the individual  is also good for
  the many.
      First, then,       as to its general      use, a circle of circular
-houses       (fig,  4,)  has the  following advantages:
      That this arrangement of buildings, in common with the
 individual, is stronger than any other.
      That, as there are certain proportions             of height to the
 diameter in individual           structures whiqh best satisfy the de
 mands of taste, and are called harmonic, and as in towns
 and cities the value of horizontal space is such as to occasion
houses to be built much higher than those which stand de
 tached in the country, so the diameter of these circles would
enable us to carry the individual houses to a great height with
             solidity,   agreeably   to these  demands of taste,     in on.e
                                                                   uniform

                 of Buildmg      Houses,   Streets, Isfc.          101
 Uniform    design susceptible of great variety, beauty, and
grandeur; the interior forming one magnificent amphithe
atre.
    That  each   house   of the circle, touching only in a point,
would    require   no   party walls (Euclid, book iii. prop. IS),
yet would be more secure from fire, as engines, &c. could
reach a much greater surface of each edifice than in lines or
streets  of square-formed houses.
   That each house would be better lighted and ventilated
than in any other arrangement, and would have a better and
more extensive view and front, advantageous to the trading
part  of the community,       and agreeable    to all.
    That as the purpose for which men assemble in towns and
cities is social mtercourse in business and pleasure, so of all
forms in which      dwellings     can be arranged for the purposes
of society, that    here pointed out is not only the strongest,
most commodious,         ceconomical, and beautiful, but also the
least solitary ;  each house being within sight and commu
nication with every other       of the circle,  at the same time that
privacy and distinctness are sufficiently provided for.
   That a building or buildings around a circular court or
mews in the centre, may become the offices, stabling, &c.
of each house, and one common receptacle and sewer may
receive and carry off the filth           from the drains .of each
house, and these at      a  point the furthest distance from each,
the sewer running under the passage by which the court or
mews communicates with the exterior of the rot undo, so
to call this circular arrangement of houses ; while, on the
other hand, water may be supplied very oeconomically either
this way or externally to each house.
   Without entering minutely into the arrangement of cir
cular houses in other forms, I shall merely mention, that,
with many of the foregoing advantages, thev may be distribu
ted  in rows,  streets, or squares, the angles     of which would   be
all rounded off, and the same          of gateways, &c,       and the
beauty of which may        be easily imagined.
    Finally, this form     is capable    of universal application in
the distribution     of cities, with     the  individual  and  general
                                  G3                       advantages

J 02                  Proposal   for   a new System
advantages already pointed out, togethi    with utilities of a
more extensive nature, as follows, demonstrable by fig. 5,
in which these circles of circular houses are arrangeable in
circles of   a  higher order to infinity.
   It    is evident, then, by inspecting        the diagram,           without
resorting to abstract principles, that from every circle thereof
there is a straight road to every other circle of this city :
hence the quickest possible intercourse and uninterrupted
communication with its most extreme parts ; hence public
drains and water- courses", lighting and watching, &c. may
be conducted   upon the most efficacious and ceconomicai
plan possible, advantageous to the individual and commu
nity ; and hence the freest circulation of air, health, and
order, there being no place close or obstructed — no lanes,
courts, and alleys, scenes of filth, disease, and immora
lity.
  As to public buildings, such           as palaces and offices         of go
vernment,    colleges, churches, and almshouses, theatres,
prisons, forts, &c, the first might occupy a grand circle
in the centre of the city, of a proportion and magnificence
worthy of the whole ; the rest might be distributed in other
parts of the city, according to their nature and convenience;
and it might be shown,    and may be easily conceived from
what     precedes,   in what manner the circular              form is best
of all    adapted    to their respective    purposes    :   in fine,. it were
an offence to common          sense    to extend this description           to
the further uses and variations         of this plan.
  On     the other hand,     I   am aware   of the opposition which
may be urged against it by long established prejudice to the
square form ; the adaption of habits, tools, materials, and
instruments, to this latter form, by which circular work is
attended  with difficulty and expense in nowise natural to it;
the outcry for picturesque beauty and variety where mecha
nical beauty, viz. simplicity and uniformity, only should
be demanded by true taste; yet the charge of sameness is
more applicable to the lineal form of streets and squares,
while this plan is susceptihle, without disturbing    of va      it,
riations    the dimensions
            in                and ornaments of its buildings
                                                                        suited

                 of Building Houses, Streets,  £«fc.          103
 suited to the various classes  and   ranks of society ; and the
 beauty, variety, change,    and  infinite extent of view, cither
standing or moving, in such a city, may easily be imagined:
 but as this plan is general, and all objections that mav he
 brought against it are likely to be particular, they ca:mot
 legitimately oppose it.
    To end, then, at the point of coincidence from which I
 departed, the distribution of this city is into hexagons, ac
 cording with the natural arrangement of the forest pointed
 out by the author of the ingenious paper 1 have quoted ; to
which may be added, that the circle is the form indicated
by nature, ami instinctively followed by inferior animals in
the construction of their habitations, and in the huis of in
fant societies, as those of the Caffres, who observe this form
not only in their individual habitations, but also in their
kralls or villages.
   Thus I have described the individual, species, and sjenus
of my plan, advancing from the lowest to the highest ; and
lest some    readers should  conclude that   I am, like certain
modern    politicians,  so giddied  by turning in a circle and
disposed to whirl all things together in my vortex, or, in
other terms, so blinded by a system as to recommend seri
ously the universal adoption of a perfectly uniform plan, to
the exclusion of long established customs adapted to the dis
united and imperfect state of man, I must deelare, ere          I
take my leave, that the purpose of this essay is merely to
sketch  a speculative model for the excitement of thought,
and from which the artist is at liberty to select, to reject al
together, to recompose, or vary to bis purposes.

I n the prosecution
          MY DEAR SIR,
                            of   those experiments on trees,                             accounts
of which you          have so often done me the honour to present
to the Royal Society,            my residence                has necessarily been al
most wholly confined             to the same spot,                    and     I    have thence
been induced to pay considerable attention to the oeconomy
ofbees amongst other objects; and as some interesting cir
cumstances in the habit of these singular insects appear to
have come under my observation, and to have escaped the
notice of former writers, I take the liberty to communicate
my observations to you.
     It    is,
          believe, generally supposed that each hive, or
             I
swarm, of these insects remains at all times wholly uncon
nected      with other colonies in the vicinity;                        and that the bee
never distinguishes    stranger from an enemy. The circum
                           a
stances which     shall proceed to state,i will, however, tend
                    I
to prove that these opinions are not well founded, and that
a friendly intercourse not unfrcquently takes place between
different colonies,        and   is      productive          of very important con
sequences  in their political oeconomy.
  Passi.ig through one of my orchards rather late in the
evening in the month of August, in the year 1801, lob-
servedthat several bees passed me in   direct line from the      a
hives  my own garden to those in the garden of cottager,
           in                                                                        a
which was about     hundred yards distant from it. As
                          a                                                                        it
was considerably later           in
                          the evening than the time when
bees  usually cease to labour,     concluded that something
                                                1
more than ordinary was going forward.        Going first to my
own garden,   and then to that of the cottager,  found     very         I                  a
considerable degree of bustle and agitation to prevail      one                               in
hive in each      :   every bee, as       it   arrived, seemed to be stopt and
questioned at the mouth of each hive; but could not dis                I
cover any thing like actual resistance, or hostility, to take
           * From the Transactions
                                     of the Bsyai         Society*   part   ii.   for 1807.
                                                                                              place   ;

                       On the (Economy      of Bees.                    lQ5
place; though I was much inclined to believe the inter
course between the hives to be hostile and predatory. The
same      kind of intercourse continued,         in a greater   or less de
gree, during eight succeeding days           ;   and, though I watched
them very closely, nothing occurred to induce me to sup
pose that their intercourse was not of an amicable kind. On
the tenth morning, however, their friendship ended, as sud
den and violent friendships often do, in a quarrel ; and they
fought most furiously ; and after this there was no more vi
 siting.
     Two years subsequent to this period I             observed   the same
 kind of intercourse to take place between                two hives   of my
 own bees, which were situated about two hundred yards di
 stant from each other : they passed from each hive to the
 other just as they did in the preceding instance, and a si-                   .
 milar degree of agitation was observable.                In this instance,
 however, their friendship appeared to be of much shorter
 duration, for they fought most desperately on the fifth day,
 and then,      as in the last mentioned case,         all further visiting
                 '
  ceased.
      I  have some reason to believe that the          kind of intercourse
  I  have described,      which   I  have often seen,      and which is by
  no means uncommon, not unfrequently ends in a junction
  of the two swarms ; for one instance came under my ob
  servation, many years ago, in which the labouring bees,
  under circumstances perfectly similar to those I have de
  scribed, wholly disappeared, leaving the drones in peaceable
   possession of the hive, but withouttany thing to live upon.
   I have also reasons for believing, that whenever a junction
  of two swarms, with their property,                is agreed upon,     that
   which     proposes  to remove, immediately,         or soon afterwards,
   unites with the other swarm, and returns to the deserted hive
   during the day only to carry off the honey ; for, having exa
   mined at night      a  hive from which      I suspected    the bees to be
    migrating,     I  found    it   without    a   single inhabitant.        I
   was led to make the examination by information I had re
    ceived, from a very accurate observer, that all the bees would
    then be absent.       A very considerable quantity of honey was
    in  this instance   left in the hive, without any guards to defend
                                                                           it;

it   ;   but    I   conclude that the bees would                 have returned for          ir^
had    remained till the next day. Whenever the bees quit
          it
their habitation in this way,   have always observed some

lighting to take place but conceived ;    to be between the
                                             I                   it
bees of the adjoining hives and those which were removing,
the former being attracted by the scent of the honey which
the latter were carrying off.
   On the farm which       occupy there were formerly many
                                         I
old decayed trees, the cavities of which were frequently oc
cupied by swarms of bees      and when these were destroyed,
                                         ;
aboard was generally fitted to the aperture which had been
made to extract the honey and the cavity was thus prepared
                                             ;
for the reception of another swarm in the 'succeeding season.
Whenever swarm came, a        constantly observed that about
                                             I
fourteen days previous to their arrival     small number of       a
bees, varying from twenty to fifty, were every day employed
in examining, and apparently keeping possession of, the ca
vity   for,
         ;    molested, they showed evident signs of displea
                     if
sure, though they never employed their stings in defending
their proposed habitation.  Their examination was not con
fined to the cavity, but extended to the external parts of the
tree above  and every dead knot particularly arrested their at
                    ;
tention;            as   if   they had been apprehensive of being injured
 by      moisture which this might admit into           the cavity below                    ;
and they apparently did not leave any part                              of   the bark near
the cavity unexamined.                       A   part of   the colony         which pur
posed to emigrate, appeared in this case to have been dele
gated to search for   proper habitation
                                     a   and the individual     ;
who              must have apparently had some means of
             succeeded
conveying information of his success to others for         can               ;    it
not  be supposed  that fifty bees should each accidentally meet
at, and fix upon, the same cavity, at    mile distant from their
                                                           a
hive     ;    which      I    have   frequently      observed       them to do, in          a
wood where several trees were adapted for their reception                                   ;
and indeed observed that they almost uniformly selected
                     1
that cavity which   thought best adapted to their use.

direct line between the one point and the other ; which
seems to indicate that those bees which had formerly acted
as purveyors, now became guides.
  Two instances               came under my own observation,                  in which
a swarm was received  into a cavity of which another swarm
had previous possession.   In the first instance I arrived with
the swarm, and I could not discover that the least opposi
tion was made            to     their entrance       :    in the second       instance,
observing         the direction that the swarm took,                    I   used all the
expedition        I   could to arrive first at the tree to which                   I sup
posed they were going, whilst a servant followed them ; and
a descent       of ground being in my favour,       and the wind against
them,       I   succeeded      in arriving at the tree some seconds be
fore them        ; and    1   am perfectly confident that not the least
resistance was opposed to their entrance.
   Now it does not appear probable that animals so much
attached to their property as bees are, so jealous of all ap
proach towards            it,
                     and so ready to sacrifice their lives in
defence of        it,
              should suffer colony of strangers, with whose
                                         a
intentions they were unacquainted, to take possession, with
out making some effort to defend      nor docs   seem much
                                                    it   :          it
more probable that the same, animals, which spent so much
time in examining their future habitation, in the cases have                   I
mentioned, should have attempted in this case to enter with
out knowing whether there was space sufficient to contain
them, and without any examination at all.       must there          I
fore infer that some previous intercourse had taken place
between the two swarms, and that those in the possession
of the cavities         were not unacquainted          with the intentions of
their guests   though the
                   ;                         formation of any thing like an
agreement  between  the different parties be scarcely consistent
with the limitations generally supposed to be fixed      nature               by
to the instinctive powers of the brute creation.
   Brutes have evidently language but              language of
                                                              it

passion only,   and not of ideas. They express   to  each other
sentiments of love,             of   fear,    and   of anger   ;  but they appear
to be       wholly incapable of transmitting                   to each other any
ideas they have received              from the impression of external ob
                                                                                   jects.

  108                 On the (Economy      of Bees.
  jects. They convey to       other animals of their     species, on
 the approach of an enemy, a sentiment of danger ; but they
  appear wholly incapable of communicating what the enemy
 is, or the kind of danger apprehended.         A language of more
 extensive use seems, from the preceding circumstances, to
 have been given to bees; and it it be not, in some degree,
 a language of ideas, it appears to be something very similar.
    When a swarm of bees issue from the parent hive, they
 generally soon settle on some neighbouring bush or tree ;
 and as in this situation they are generally not at all defended
 from rain or cold, it is often inferred that they are less amply
 gifted with those instinctive powers that direct to self-pre
 servation than many other animals. But their object in set
 tling soon after    they leave the    hive, is apparently nothing
 more than to collect their numbers ; and they have gene
 rally, I believe always, another place to which they intend
 subsequently to go    ; and   if the situation   they select be not
 perfectly adapted to secure them from injuries, it is probably,
 in almost all instances, the best they can discover. For           I
 have very often observed that when one of my hives was
nearly ready to swarm, one of the hollow trees I have men
tioned (and generally that best adapted for the accommoda
tion   of a swarm)    was every day occupied by a small number
of   bees,  but that after the swarm had issued from that hive,
and had taken possession of another, the tree was wholly
deserted ; whence I inferred that the swarm, which would
have taken possession of the cavity of that tree, had relin
quished their intended migration when a hive was offered
them at home.       And I am much disposed to doubt whether
it be not rather habit, produced by domestication, during
many successive generations, than any thing inherent -in. the.
nature of bees, which induces them to accept a hive, when
offered them, in preference to the situation they have pre
viously chosen : for I have noticed the disposition to mi
grate to exist in a much greater degree in some families of
bees than    in others ; and the   offspring of domesticated ani
mals inherit, in a very remarkable manner, the acquired ha
bits of their parents. In all ammals this is observable ; but
in  the dog it exists to a wonderful      extent, and the offspring
                                                            appears

                      On the (Economy             of Bees.                  109
appears    to inherit  not only the passions and propensities,
but even       the resentments, of the family from which it
springs.     I ascertained, by repeated experiment, that a ter
rier, whose parents had been in the habit of fighting with
polecats, will instantly show every mark of anger when he
first perceives the scent of that animal, though the animal
itself   be wholly concealed from his sight.    young spanielA
brought up with the terriers showed no marks whatever of
emotion at the scent of the polecat ; but it pursued a wood
cock, the first time it saw one, with clamour and exultation :
and a young pointer, which I am certain had never seen a
partridge, stood trembling with anxiety, its eyes fixed and its
muscles rigid, when conducted into the midst of a covey of
those birds.       Yet    each   of    these dogs are mere         varieties   of
the same species      ;   and to that species         none   of   these   habits
are given by nature.         The peculiarities of character can           there
fore be traced to no other source than the acquired habits of
the parents, which are inherited by the offspring, and be
come what I shall call instinctive hereditary propensities.
These propensities, or modifications of the natural instinc
tive powers of animals, are capable of endless variation and
change ; and hence their habits soon become adapted to dif
ferent countries and different states of domestication, the
acquired habits of the parents being transferred hereditarily
to the offspring.  Bees, like other animals, are probably
susceptible of these changes of habit ; and thence, when ac
customed through many generations to the hive, in a coun
try which does not afford hollow trees, or other habitations
adapted to their purpose,they may become more dependent
on man, and rely on his care wholly for an habitation ; but
in situations where the cavities of trees present to them
the means of providing for themselves, I have found that
they will discover such trees    the closest recesses of the
                                           ir|
woods, and at an extraordinary distance from their hives;
and that they will keep possession of such cavities      the              in
manner     I   have stated   :   and am confident that, under such
                                       I
circumstances,       a    swarm never issues from the parent hive
without having previously              selected    some such place to re
tire to.

      It   has been remarked by            Mr. John Hunter, that        the matter
 which      bees carry on their thighs is the farina              of plants with
 .which they feed their young, and not the                       substance with
 .which they make their combs ; and his statement                        is,  I   be
 lieve, perfectlv correct: but     have observed that they will
                                           I
 also carry other things on their thighs.        frequently co
                                                             I
 vered the decorticated parts of trees, on which    was makingI
 experiments,         with   a   cement composed of bees-wax and tur
 pentine;         and in the      autumn   have frequently observed a
                                            I
 great number of bees employed in carrying off this sub
 stance. They detached  from the tree with their forceps,
                                   it
 and the little portion thus obtained was then transferred                         by
 the first to the second leg,     which    by
                                          was deposited on the
                                                   it

                                                    is
ferred in the same manner.                  This mixture of wax         and    tur
pentine did not, however, appear to have been employed in
the formation of combs    but only to attach the hive to the
                                  ;
board on which     was placed, and probably to exclude other
                        it
insects, and air during winter.    Whilst the bees were em
ployed   in the collection of this substance,  had many op   I
portunities of observing the peaceful and patient disposition
of them      as    individuals, which Mr. Hunter has also, in some
measure, noticed.            When one bee had collected its load, and
was just prepared to take flight, another often came behind
it,
  and despoiled    of all
                        it    had collected.
                                      it      A second, and
even   third load was collected, and lost in the same man
       a
ner, and still the patient insect pursued its labour without
betraying any symptoms                     of impatience     or resentment.
When, however, the hive           approached, the bee appears
                                           is
dften to be the most irritable of  all animals; but   circum        a
stance   I             amongst another species of insects,
             have observed
whose habits are in many respects similar to those of bees,
induces me to believe that the readiness of the bees to attack
those who approach their hives, does not in any degree
spring either from the sense of injury or apprehensions of
(he individual who makes the attack.  If nest of wasps bea
approached without alarming its inhabitants, and all com

appears          commissioned         public wrongs, and pre
                                         to avenge
pared to sacrifice its life in the execution of its orders.                                      I
discovered the circumstance, that wasps thus excluded from
their nest, would neither defend                       it,   nor themselves, at          a   very
early period              of my life; and! profited                    so often by the dis
covery,     schoolboy, that
                 as   a        am quite certain of the fact
                                                  I

                 and   I                             speak                             I
from experiments less accurately made, that the actions of
bees,       under similar circumstances,would be the same*.
     Mr.     Hunter conceived bees wax to be an animal substance,
which exuded               between   the scales         of      the belly        of the insect;
 but    I   am strongly disposed to believe that                       it   is   collected from
 plants, and merely deposited  between the scales of the belly
of the bee, for the joint purposes of being carried with con
venience, and giving the temperature necessary for being
moulded into combs   and am led to this conclusion, not
                                 :           I
only   the  by
           circumstance of wax being found in the vege
 table world,             but also       by
                           having often observed bees em
ployed in detaching something from the bases of the leaves
of plants with their forceps, which they did not deposit on
    *A curious circumstance relative to wasps attracted the notice of some of
my friends last year, and has not, believe, been satisfactorily accounted for.

which     are circumstances       very favourable to the conclusion
that the wax is a vegetable         substance, for it would probably
be less abundant during autumn than in summer ; and that
portion     which      had remained on the plants till late in the
season would hence become more colourless by exposure to
light, as well as more dry and brittle, than when at first ex
uded ; but were it an animal           substance, there does not ap
pear    any reason      why it should      be more dry and brittle, or
less abundant,        in the autumn      than in the spring and sum
mer.      The conclusions of Mr.         Hunter are, however, always
drawn with so much caution,             and he united so much skill
and science with the greatest degree of industry, that it is
not without much hesitation and diffidence that I venture
 to put my opinion in opposition to his authority.

XVIII.      Note upon a fulminating Combination               of Silver, of a
    white Colour and a crystalline Appearance.                  By M. DES-
    COSTILS *.
 J. HERE is sold at Paris,        as an  object   of amusement,         a de
tonating powder inclosed in slips of cards cut lengthways.
The powder is placed at one end of this carcase, and the
other end is made smaller in order to be more easily distin
guished.       If this last extremity is seized with one hand, and
the other end is held over the flame of a candle, a detona
tion speedily takes place, with a sharp noise and a violet-
coloured flame ; the card is torn to pieces and scorched, and
the part which the composition touched is covered with a
slight metallic coating of a grayish white.
    Having been consulted upon the nature                of this substance,
which    is sent ready prepared       to Paris,   I  was convinced, after
                  *  From Annalft dt Chimie, tom. liii. p. 199.
                                                                      various

          of awhile Colour and          a ci-ystalline Appearance.          113
yarious experiments, which it is needless to detail, that it is
 a combmation of oxide of silver, ammonia, and a vegetable
substance; a combination analogous, as we find, to that
-which constitutes the fulminating mercury of Mr. Howard.
    We may obtain this combination, which I shall call de
tonating silver, to distinguish it from the fulminating silver
of M. Berthollet, by dissolving silver in pure nitric acid, and
by pouring into the solution, while it is effecting, a sufficient
quantity of rectified alcohol, or by pouring the alcohol into
a nitric solution        of silver, with    a considerable excess of acid.
•
    In the first case we         must    slightly warm the nitric acid in*
which the silver has been put, until the solution begins to
take place, i. e. until the first bubbles begin to be perceived.
We must then remove it from the fire and immediately add
a sufficiency of alcohol, so that no nitrous vapours may be
liberated.        The mixture of       the two liquors takes place         with
a disengagement           of heat  ;  the effervescence     immediately re
 commences, without disengagement of nitrous                     gas ; it gra
dually increases, and there is liberated at the same time a
strong smell of nitrous ether. The liquor soon becomes
 turbid,    and we see deposited            a white    crystalline and very
dull powder, which must be separated, when it ceases to
fall down, and washed several times with small quantities
of water.
    When we employ the solution of silver                    ready made and
strongly acid, we must heat it slightly and afterwards add
the alcohol ; the heat produced by the mixture, which gra
dually takes place, soon determines a considerable ebulli
 tion, and the powder is suddenly deposited *.
    This powder has the following properties :
     It is white and crystalline        ; but this   last appearance     is va

  Simple pressure, provided it be not very strong, produced
 no change.
     It detonates upon being struck by the electrical spark.
     It is slightly soluble in water. It has an extremely strong
 metallic taste.
     Concentrated sulphuric acid determines its inflammation,
 and the acid itself is driven to a great distance : dilute sul
 phuric acid seems to decompose it slowly.
     Weak or concentrated muriatic acid decomposes it in
 stantly, by forming muriate of silver.        The quantity of mu
 riate obtained indicates about 71 per cent. of metallic silver
 in the detonating silver; at first there is liberated a very
 decided smell of prussic acid, but I could not Collect any
 sensible traces of it.
    The nitric acid decomposes it with      the assistance   of ebul
lition;    and we obtain nothing      but nitrate of silver, and ni
trate of ammonia,      if it be long enough continued.
    It is decomposed by means of sulphuretted hydrogen ; the
 ammonia and the vegetable matter remain in the liquor.
    Caustic potash decomposes it ; black oxide of silver is        se
parated, and ammonia is disengaged.
    It is dissolved in ammonia; but by a slow evaporation it
is separated from it with its proper colour and other proper
ties, and particularly that of detonating by means of heat,
and not by simple contact.
    Finally, its property of most importance to consider, is
the action it has upon the animal ceconomy.            M. Pajot-la-
Foret, who has made a great number of experiments upon
this subject, is convinced that very small doses are sufficient
to kill the strongest animals : when tried upon some cats,
all of them expired in the mo3t horrible convulsions.            It is
in short, without exception, one of the most violent poisons
with which the metallic combinations present us.

  from the German *.
XXT our       very first observations             powers of
                                                  with magnifying
150 and 300, applied to the excellent new 15-feet reflector,
we found the planet Vesta without, any appearance of a disc,
merely as      a   point like star, with an intense, radiating
                                a fixed
light, and exactly of the same appearance as that of any
fixed star of the sixth magnitude.   In the same manner we
both afterwards saw this planet several times with our naked
eyes, when the sky was clear, and when it was surrounded
by smaller invisible stars,     which precluded all possibility of
mistaking it for another.       This proves how very like the in
tense   light of this planet is to that of a fixed star.
  As the observations and measurements of Ceres, Pallas,
and Juno, were made with the same eye-glasses, but with
the 13-feet reflector, we soon after   compared the planet'
Vesta with the same glasses of 130 and 2S8 times magnify
ing power in the 13-feet reflector. In both these telescopes
its image was, without            the least difference, that of a fixed
star   of   the sixth magnitude,            with an intense radiating light;
so that this new planet may                  with the greatest propriety be
called an asteroid.

succeeded in effecting the measurement of Vesta, with the
eame power of 288, by means of the 13-feet reflector, with
which that of Ceres, Pallas, and Juno, had been made ; and
when viewed by this reflector it also appeared exactly in the
same manner.    Of several illuminated discs, of 2'0 to 0-5
decimal lines, which I had before made use of for measuring
the satellites      of Saturn   and     Jupiter,        the smallest disc           only of
0'5 lines could be used for this purpose ; by it the rounded

it follows, by calculation, that           the apparent diameter of the
planet Vesta is only 0-488 seconds, and consequently only
half of what I have found to be the apparent diameter of the
fourth satellite of Saturn.
    This extraordinary smallness, with such an intense,                       ra
diant,     and unsteady light of a fixed star, is ihe more                    re
 markable,       as,   according     to the preliminary          calculations   of
Dr. Gauss,        there    can   be no doubt that this planet is found
in the      same region between Mars and Jupiter, in which
Ceres, Pallas, and Juno, perform their revolutions round the
sun ; that, in close union with them, it has the same cos-
moloecical      origin   ; and   that, as   a  planet   of such smallness,
and     of so   wry intense liglit, it is comparatively near to the
earth.      This remarkable circumstance will no doubl be pro
ductive of important cosmological observations, is soon as
the elements        of  the new planet have been sufficiently deter

XX. A         new Eudiometer,          accompanied       with Experiments
    elucidating      its Application.        By WILLIAM HASLEDINE

 J--HE important part which atmospheric air performs in
maintaining        the principle     of life in animals, in combustion
of   every     description, the       acidification and oxidation of a
great variety of substances, and in numerous other processes
both of nature and art, gives a high degree of interest to
every thing calculated to extend our knowledge of its na
ture and properties.
    The evidence furnished by modern chemistry of the ex*
istencc of many other aeriform substances increases this in
terest, especially when it is considered that, owing to their
possessing some, of the most obvious properties of atmo-

expansion on being exposed to an increase                     or' temperature,
they were, with very few exceptions,                  till lately, confounded
either with common air, or not even suspected to exist.
   When to these considerations we add the facility with
which some products, especially the gaseous, are evolved, in
circumstance* under which, in the present state of our know
ledge, we should hardly look for them ; the power they pos
sess of decomposing each other, and by an interchange and
new arrangement of principles, of producing compounds pos
sessing properties altogether different from those of the in
gredients supposed to be present ; and the facilities which
every new detection       of          principles affords towards
                               unsuspected
the discovery of     others, and consequently the composition
or analysis of bodies before held to be simple, it will not
appear a matter of surprise that the subject of eudiometry
should have obtained a considerable degree of attention from
modern philosophers.
  This would be an improper place to enumerate all that
has been done or proposed by different men of eminence
towards the production of something like a perfect system
on this important subject ; yet some allusion to their labours
appears to be indispensable,            and     will be the means of        pre
venting some circumlocution                 in our further progress.
   Hales* appears to be the first who observed absorption to
take place in common air, on mixing it with air obtained
from a mixture of Walton pyrites and spirits of nitre; and
that in this process from being clear they became " a reddish
turbid fume."
  Dr. Priestley,      as he    informs us in his          "   Observations on
different Kinds     of Airf,"        was much struck           with this expe
riment, but never expected                         of seeing
                                      to have the satisfaction
this remarkable appearance, supposing it to be peculiar to
the Walton pyrites ; till encouraged by a suggestion of Mr.
Cavendish, that probably the red appearance of the mixture
depended   upon the spirits of nitre only, he tried solutions
•f the different metals in that acid, and, catching the air

 which    was  generated,   obtained what he wished.             To  the
 air thus produced he gave the name of nitrous air, and,
 from its possessing the properties of absorbing that portion
 of atmospheric air which he calls depklogisticated, first pro
 posed its being used as a test for      ascertaining the purity      of
 air.   His method of    proceeding was       ingenious and simple;
 known quantities of the air to be tried, and of nitrous gas,
 being mixed, were admitted, after the diminution of volume
 occasioned by their union, into       a graduated      tube, which he
 denominated a eudiometer.
    It was with the test   of nitrous    gas that     Mr. Cavendish*
made his masterly analysis of the air at Kensingto'n and
London     ; and by m;y;y laborious processes and comparative
trials, obtained results, the accuracy of which has been more
distinctly perceived the more the science of chemistry has
advanced.
    The slow combustion of phosphorus, which unites with
the oxygen to fbrin an acid, and the decomposition of the
fluid sulphuret^of potash, are certain methods of separating
combinations consisting of oxygen and azote; but the de
composition is effected so slowly by the action of these sub
stances, that it became a desirable object to discover some
means for accelerating the process. This was supposed to
have   been   effected  by Guyton, who proposed heating the
sulphuret of potash ; in doing this, sulphurated hydrogen
gas, however, is frequently evolved, which, mixing with
the residual gas, increases       its quantity,  and renders    the re
sult fallacious..
    The  green sulphate   of iron impregnated with nitrous gas,
first discovered    by Dr. Priestley, and recently used by Mr.
Davy for eudiometrical purposes, from             its   possessing the
property of absorbing oxygen gas from            the atmosphere, is
much to be preferred to the method with nitrous gas, as the
green sulphate of iron does not combine with the other gases
with which      the nitrous   gas is commonly       found to be con
taminated, and more certain results are obtained.

 of others, and    to make some        new ones,     I soon found what
 every one who has been           engaged on the same subject must
                     —
 have experienced that art apparatus more commodious than
 has yet been proposed, and at the same time capable            of giving
 correct results, with the greatest minuteness, was still a de
 sideratum in eudiometny. To detail the various ideas that
 presented   themselves on the subject, would be an unneces
 sary encroachment        on the time of this society ; but as 1 at
last succeeded in contriving an instrument possessing the
above    properties in a very eminent degree, I flatter myself
I  shall not be thought intrusive in offering a description of it.
    This apparatus, (Plate IV.) which is of easy construction,
 and extremely portable, consists        of a glass measure   M,   fig. 1,
graduated into hundred parts ; a small gum-elastic bottle, B,
fig. 2, capable of containing about twice the quantity of the
measure, and furnished with a perforated glass stopper, S,
which    is well secured      in the neck of it by means of waxed
thread wound tight round it ; and a glass tube, T, fig. 3,
also graduated, but into tenths of the formed divisions, or
into thousand parts of the measure.
    The   glass  stopper, made fast in the neck of the gum-
elastic bottle, as above mentioned, has its exterior end ground
with emery, exactly to fit the month of the measure; to the
lower end of the graduated tube T, is cemented a small steel
cock, which is secured into the neck of a very small gum-
elastic bottle by means of waxed              thread,   SB, fig. 4  :  the
other end of the tube is conical, so         as to present a  very small
orifice.
    Besides this,    the apparatus      is furnished    with  a  kind of
moveable cistern      C, in which      the tube can be slid easily up
and down, and yet        in such    a manner that the water or other
liquid in   the cistern     may not pass.        This is easily accom
plished by means      of   a cork fitted into its mouth with a per
foration through its axis to receive the tube.             The cistern,
when in use, is to be filled with water or mercury, as the
experiment may require, and becomes a secondary cistern
for the measure,       as   ,will be more clearly understood by the
following description of die method of performing experi
ments with this instrument.
                                    H4                                The

  120                 Account  of a  new Eudiotneter.
      The      measure is filled with the air or gas, over mercury,
  in   the usual manner, and the elastic bottle is charged with
  the solution intended to be employed as the re-agent ; the
  orifice of the stopper is then inserted into the mouth of the
  measure in the mercury, and pressed home to its place.
      The bottle and measure being thus united, arc to be firmly
  held at the joint.         Upon pressing the former, a portion of
  the fluid is injected into the latter, and the gas suffers a de
  gree of compression, by which the action of the affinity be
  tween it and the fluid is accelerated.      On taking off  the pres
  sure,, the bottle, by its elasticity, endeavours to obtain its
  original form, and receives back the fluid.            This process
  should be continued as long as any absorption is observed
   to take place.       When absorption ceases, the bottle is to be
   separated from the measure under mercury, and the quick-
, silver which remains in the measure being brought to the
   level of that     in the cistern' the quantity of absorption      is
   then to be determined, which is done as follows :
       Suppose atmospheric air has been the subject of the ex
  periment, and consequently a large residuum left ; first note
   the hundred parts, and then to obtain a knowledge of the
   fractional parts, remove the measure into the small cistern
   in which the graduated tube filled with mercury is placed:
   slide the tube above the surface      of the fluid in the measure,
  and, opening the stop-cock, suffer the mercury to descend
   till it has drawn the fluid in the measure to a regular divi-
   siou    ; then stop the cock, and register the hundred parts on
   the measure, and the thousand parts on the graduated tube ;
  the united quantities give the sum of the residual gas.         Ob-
   Serve well in registering      the thousand parts, that the fluids
   are exactly on a     level on the outside and inside of the mea
   sure;      this may be easily effected by pouring out a portion
   of the liquid of the small cistern, or adding thereto.
       If inetead of atmospheric air, a gas is tried, which, so far
   as   it  is uncontaminated,   can be nearly wholly absorbed by
    the re-agents employed, the process becomes exceedingly
   simple ; for if the residuum is under a hundred part of the
   measure, it may be transferred completely into the graduated
   tube, and its quantity at once ascertained.
                                                                  The

    The stopper S would         have    injected the fluid with greater
velocity had it been straight ; but it would not then have
been so convenient in the analysis of compound gases, where
both mercury and hot solutions are occasionally employed,
as the mercury would have so compressed the fluid in the
bottle, in introducing it under that metal, as to have thrown
out    a portion or its contents, and also have robbed the hot
solutions of the temperature which was necessary for their
perfect action.
     As  to the size      of the   measure    M, I    have generally pre
ferred the cubic inch divided into hundred parts.                  This is
easily    effected   by   taking   a  stout   glass  tube  about   half an
inch calibre, sealing one end, then weighing 3422 grains
 of mercury, equal to 252 grains of distilled water, at tem
 perature 50° Fahrenheit.            This is introduced into the tube;
 the   extra   length  is  cut off with   a sharp-edged file, care being
 taken to leave a sufficient portion            to grind   the perforated
 stopper S into its mouth.
     The divisions     are obtained by a small measure, made from
 a glass tube sealed at the end, and cut off- exactly to the hun
 dred parts of a cubic inch, equal to 34*2 grains of mercury,
 which being ground flat, is stopped by a piece of plate glass,
 and the divisions          marked by the diamond upon the intro
 duction of        each hundred part of mercury into the mea
  sure   M.
      The tube T is divided into tenths of the measure M, or
  thousand parts of a cubic inch.            This is done by measuring
  one hundred part of a cubic inch into the tube, and dividing
  it into   ten parts, marking        the  divisions with fluoric acid or
  black enamel.
  •   To prove the accuracy of the instrument,             I shall proceed
   to rdate a few experiments made with it.
      The    elastic bottle being filled with the solution     of sulphate
   of iron impregnated with nitrous           gas,  and the measure    with
   atmospheric air, they were united, and by gentle injection
   •tVcfa were absorbed.
      If  the experiment is made hastily, the impregnated solu
   tion loses a portion      of its nitrous gas, which must be again
   absorbed by a solution of green sulphate of iron.
                                                                        For

 128                     Account      of   a new Eudiometer      .
       For ascertaining          the purity  of nitrous gas, the bottle may
 be charged          with the      solution of green sulphate or muriate of
 iron.
    For carbonic acid gas, with lime or barytic water.
    For oxygen gas, with the solution of green sulphate of
 iron impregnated with nitrous gas.
    For sulphurated hydrogen gas, a solution of nitrate of
 silver was put in the elastic bottle, and sulphurated hydro
 gen gas f into the graduated measure.       Upon the first in
jection, the   solution took  a  black  flocculent appearance,
and a considerable portion of the gas was absorbed.       After
 repeating the process              as before    mentioned, the residuum wa»

       I
       have been able completely to separate the carbonic acid
 gas  from   the sulphurated hydrogen by a solution of the ni
 trate of silver or of mercury, employed hot.    The carbonic
 acid gas is expanded in this process, but on standing over
-mercury it returns to its original volume.   The sulphurated
 hydrogen, in this  instance,  is taken up by the metallic ni
 trate.          It should        that the acetite of lead
                             be here     observed
must not be used, as the carbonic acid gas, even at a high
temperature, decomposes    forming carbonate of lead.
                                        it,
      The propriety of using               the   solutions    hot, will be seen,
when we recollect that the carbonic acid gas     soluble in          is
the water of solution at the common temperature of all these
compounds.
  Nitrous gas and carbonic acid gas may be separated by

lamp, until ebullition.  Having filled the measure with the
compound gas, charge    the elastic bottle with the hot solu

tion, while the carbonic acid gas will be            a little rarefied,, but
no absorption of it will take place.
    Previous to these experiments on the compound gases,                     I
had tried several on the carbonic acid, sulphurated hydrogen,
and nitrous gases in their unmixed states. 100 parts of pure
alcohol at the common         temperature will absorb 70 parts in
volume    of carbonic acid,    and    the same quantity         of sulphu
rated hydrogen.        Alcohol impregnated with the latter, pre
cipitate* the solutions of the nitrates of lead, silver, and mer
cury, of a dark brown colour.              Nitric acid of the specific
gravity T4, and also of 1'25, absorbs carbonic acid gas,
without any apparent change in the nitric acid.                     Sulphu
rated hydrogen gas is also absorbed by nitric acid, which
occasions a slight milky cloud Or precipitate therein.
    The solutions of nitrates of barytes, strontian, and lime,
absorb carbonic acid gas equal to half their volume, without
any apparent alteration.
    Solutions of nitrates    of barytes, strontian,          and lime, also
absorb sulphurated hydrogen gas, equal to six-tenths of their
volume, with a slight change of colour ; the solutions thus
impregnated precipitate solutions of nitrates of mercury and
of silver, and acetite of lead of a dark brown colour, and
would be useful as chemical re-agents.
    Carbonic acid gas, as I have before stated, decomposes
 solutions of the acetite of lead, hot or cold, forming a pre
 cipitate of carbonate of lead.
    Carbonic acid gas is absorbed        by the solution of the green
 sulphate of iron under the temperature of 100° Fahrenheit ;
but this is only the action of the water of solution.                  If the
temperature be near boiling, or above 180° Fahrenheit, the
 Solution increases the volume of the gas without the slightest
 absorption; after carbonic acid gas has in this way been
 treated  with   the  hot solutions,     it  is still soluble in water at
 the common       temperature,     or in aqueous         solutions of lime
 or alkali.
    Nitrous    gas is absorbed   by solution of sulphuret of pot
 ash, with    a separation or formation of sulphur.               Upon in
jecting    the  solution   the  sides  of   the   measure     take  a milky
                                                               appearance,

                         Account                                                           'I

    appearance, which on the second injection is washed down
    insoluble in the liquor. About 80 parts from 100 of gas
    are absorbed.
       Nitrous gaS is also absorbed by nitrate of copper in solu
    tion, without  any peculiar alteration.
       In these experiments great care must be taken not to in
    crease the temperature         of    the gas by the hand.                  To    prevent
    this, I use a pair       of small circular-mouthed                       forceps, lined
    with cloth, which firmly grasp the measure, fie;. 5 ; and if
•   the experiments should in any way be delayed, a corre
    sponding manometer will always be sufficient to correct the
    error occasioned by change of atmospheric temperature and
    pressure.
       To ascertain       the quantity    of carbonic acid                gas contained
    in oxygen gas (of a knowr);;purity) after combustion or de
    composition of carbonaceous substances, lime water will b«
    found sufficient.                                      *Q\    .    .-.
      If it   is required to know the purity               of   the oxygen gas after
    the carbonic acid gas has been absorbed, .the best method
    and the least liable to error, is to withdraw the residual oxy
    gen gas by means of the small graduated        tube before de
    scribed.
      To     do this, remove the measure                 into the small cistern           of
    mercury     ;   press the quicksilver          out   of     the   small bottle by
    the     fingers and    thumb,       and    let   the      tube    risea sufficient
    height within the measure, that the bottle, extending itself,
    shall withdraw the whole of the gas from the measure,
    taking care that the cock be stopped as soon as it has com
    pleted    and also to prevent the solution from entering the
              it,
    V>bc.
      If the opening of the tube     small,   may then be drawn
                                              is           it
    down  into the mercury,  without   the  possibility of any por
    tion of the gas escaping, while the measure            dried or           is
    cleaned, or     a   fresh one filled with mercury supplied to re
    ceive it.
      This way of transferring will be found very advantageous,
    particularly in the separation of gases, liable to be absorbed
    under certain temperatures, and also where                        a   new series      of
                                                                                   re-agent?

                    Account   of   a new Eudiometer.                 125
re-agents arc to be employed, as from the depositions of
former solutions on the glass measure a source of considera
ble error would arise.
  The         oxygen gas being thus transferred into a clean
         residual
dry measure, the process'-s before described for examining
oxygen gas may be thj?n used ; or the quantity of carbonic
acid gas (for examination) being found by lime water, an
other measure of the gas may be tried, first with the green
sulphate of iron impregnated with nitrous gas, and then with
the grem sulphate in solution only : these will take up both
the carbonic acid gas and the oxygen gas, leaving only such
residual gas    as the     oxygen might have originally contained.
  Transferring          is not here necessary, as the two solutions
may be used one after the other,           taking care to use the so
lution of green sulphate last.
   Where it is not requisite to transfer the gas into a dried
or clean measure previous to the use of another solution, as
in the instance I have just mentioned, a quantity of the first
solution  may be withdrawn, by simply filling the elastic
bottle with mercury, then joining it to the measure, and by
inclining the measure, the mercury by its gravity will dis
place the former solution.
   If at any time the gas should get drawn into the elastic
bottle, it may be very easily returned into the measure, by
inclining sometimes the bottle, and sometimes the measure.
The only error that could arise from this            is,
                                             an increase of
temperature in the gas, which may be rectified   plunging      by
the whole apparatus into mercury or water of the standard
temperature.
   The             of this construction of the eudiometer will
           advantages
be readily perceived      all those who are in the habit of
                              by
making   chemical   experiments.    The portion of gas to be
examined is completely under command            ;   it   may be agitated,
without the least fear of the intrusion          of any atmospheric
air,   and the process thereby very materially shortened.            The
gum-elastic
                 is
                 a        substance so little acted upon

                            To  Mr. Tllloch.
         SIB,
 A   s you have, in some former Magazines, paid an atten
 tion to the establishment of public subscription libraries ;
 that is, such libraries    as  are supported by the     subscription
 of its members, the property whereof remains with them,
 in contradistinction to the common circulating libraries, I
 beg   leave    to forward   you a small communication on that
 subject.      I shall give you a plain relation of facts, which
took place       about four years ago, at North Shields, in the
 county     of Northumberland,     by which the laudable object in
tiew was completely attained. And I shall subjoin a plan
pursued by the members of the same library, by which they
have now built a very excellent house, and are not only
rent free, with most comfortable accommodations, but                 I
believe their receipts, in part, pay also their worthy librarian.
About      the   time mentioned above, three or four gentlemen
living in North Shields, and who subscribed to an extensive
library of that kind about seven miles off them, met, and
were conversing about the expense of threepence per volume
to them for carriage in addition to their annual subscription
of 21   s.   One of the gentlemen proposed to print off as many
hand-bills as would circulate very freely through the town,
recommending         to  the inhabitants   the  establishment   of   a
public library,     and at the same time proposing a meeting        of
          3                                                       the

                                  On Public Libraries.                                   127
the friends to such an institution, on the morning of a cer
tain day, at a very respectable inn, there to consult on the
practicability of such a scheme.   In a few minutes after the
time appointed for the meeting, the number became so great
that they were obliged to adjourn to a larger room in another
house. A library was carried unanimously, and a subscrip
tion from each member t»f a guinea per year was determined
on.   About forty or fiftv gentlemen immediately subscribed
their guineas in advance ; a room was obtained ; and " The
North ShSelds Subscription Library" established at once on
a permanent and respectable                      basis.
  The    second      part         of   the object     I   have     in view in this com
munication        is,   to show how to accomplish .such purposes at
the cheapest rate, and at the same time to obtain pleasant
and convenient accommodations      and this shall do from :             I
the same respectable and active association.
   About twelve months ago they received notice to quit the
rooms they occupied    upon this, the plan of library being
                                   :                                    a
endeared      to them, as they advanced in the experience                             of its
benefits,     the       committee           proposed          to   purchase    a   pieceof
ground in   very, advantageous
              a                                     situation in the          high part of
North Shields, and to build                   a    house for their accommoda
tion;    and that       a    subscription          paper should be laid upon the
table.  The sum for the purchase and building was esti
mated at 800/., and the members at that period amounted
to about 250; and the shares were not to be less than 5/.
No member could                    take    more than one for the first four
weeks    ;   after that,      if       the lint was not filled,          as   many might
be taken as the case allowed.                       Within six weeks 1200/., or
near that sum, was subscribed   The ground was purchased.
                                                  !
The house    now finished, consisting of three stories the
               is                                                                    :

 whole is to be finished by an elegant town clock, by which
 means this liberal institution will be in some degree assimilated
 to the immediate convenience         of North Shields.      To obtain
 this, the committee divided themselves into            parties of two
 or three, and went round         the town soliciting subscriptions
 from the inhabitants,      whether members of that association
 or not.
     I had forgot, in its proper place, to observe, that the four
 gentlemen who first began this institution agreed, that               if
the distribution    of  the  hand-bills    had no permanent      effect,
 the expense was to be divided amongst them, which they
 calculated at two or three shillings a-piece, or, in their
 words, •' about the expense of half a bottle of wine :" — and
 what was that sacrifice for the probability of so respectable
 an advantage? If it did succeed, the expense was to be
 charged to the general funds.            Thus, from the efforts of
four gentlemen, at a very distant probability of the risk of
two, three, or even four shillings each, has an establishment
been formed, which is an ornament to the town of Shields :
a lasting monument of the activity of these four friends of
science   :  an mstitution     from which       peculiar benefits are
already obtained by that town : a        perpetual memorial of their
alacrity in the cause of literature, and whose advantages must
extend to generations yet unborn.           The advantages obtained
by the present inhabitants must be more rapidly enjoyed than
in almost any other literary association ; for, to their lasting
honour, it must be observed, that from the beginning, ladies
Were admitted on equal terms, and          with equal   advantages    as
gentlemen ; and 1 believe, were the subscription list for the
new building examined, it would be found that nearly half of
the sum had been subscribed by the first. To crown th" climax
of advantages,    the rents  of  the offices on the ground-floor,     as
I before observed,    do much more than pay the interest of the
money     advanced, and thus the library-room, &c. is rent
free.    Would not this consideration         alone induce even the
aelfish man and the miser to countenance such plans of im
mediate advantage     ?

 WE       have to behold    Dr. Darwin, for        the sake  of domestic
happiness, quitting his old established connections, and a
circle of the most sincere and attached friends, to settle at
Derby, where he could be only known by reputation. A mind
less elevated than his might have trembled at such a change,
unless     he had    aspired   to  place his    residence    in London,
where he was invited by several noble families, and which
would have been a fit sphere for such extraordinary mental
endowments.          Confidence soon followed him at Derby ;
and it is certain,     wherever he had chosen to settle himself,
there any opposition         would    have been       vain, and his esta
blishment certain.         His bride had a good jointure of her
own    ;  and added to     Dr. Darwin's acquisitions in the prac
 tice of physic, his fortune was princely, and men of the first
 talents were ever at his table         :  yet   he    never  relaxed  the
least in his medical exertions, and a letter was whimsically
 once addressed       " To Doctor Darwin, on the road." He
 had    such powers of mind, that the carriage became his
 study, and his travelling companions were books for study ;
 he also contrived a writing-desk in his chaise; and it is said
 that most part of his performances were composed when
  travelling.    His medical work, which occupied his chief at
 tention, and which he calls Zoonomia, or The Laws of Or
  ganic Life, he laboured incessantly at for twenty years, and
  then, not as the poet recommends,

as a science,      is chiefly  indebted to botanical       physicians.
 Only    peruse the labours prior to the exertions        of botanical
 physicians, and the whole is a chaos ; and to such the world
 owes that clearness, order, and precision, which appear in
 many medical writings of the present day.
     " The   purport of the following pages," says Dr. Darwin
 in his preface, " is an endeavour to reduce the facts belong
 ing to animal life into classes, orders, genera, and species ;
 and, by comparing them with each other, to unravel the the
 ory of diseases.     It happened, perhaps unfortunately for the
 inquirers into the knowledge of diseases, that other sciences
  had received improvement previous to their own ; whence,
  instead of comparing the properties belonging to animated
  nature with each other, they, idly ingenious, busied them
  selves in attempting     to explain the laws     of life by  those  of
  mechanism and chemistry ; they considered the body as an
  hydraulic machine, and the fluids as passing through a series
  of chemical changes, forgetting that animation was its es
  sential characteristic.
      "The great Creator of all     things has infinitely diversified
  the works of    his hands,  but has  at the same time stamped a
  certain similitude on the features of nature, that demon
  strates to us, that the whole is one family    of one Parent.      On
  this similitude is founded all rational analogy ; which, so
  lone as it is concerned in comparing the essential properties
   of bodies, leads us to many and important discoveries ; but
                                                                   when

when with licentious activity it links together objects, other
wise discordant, by some fanciful similitude, it may indeed
collect ornaments for wit and poetry, but philosophy and
truth recoil from its combinations.
    "The want of     a theory, deduced from such strict analogy,
to conduct the practice     of medicine, is lamented by its pro
fessors ; for, as a great number of unconnected facts are dif
ficult to be acquired, aud to be reasoned from, the art of
medicine is in many instances less efficacious under the di
rection of its wisest practitioners ; and by that busy crowd,
who either Tioldly wade in darkness, or are led into endless
error by the glare of false theory, it is daily practised to the
destruction of thousands : add to this the unceasing injury
which    accrues   to the public by the perpetual advertisements
of   pretended    nostrums   :  the minds   of the indolent   be
come superstitiously fearful of diseases which they do not
labour under, and thus become tli£ daily prey of some
crafty empiric.
    " A theory founded upon nature, that should bind together
 the scattered facts of medical knowledge, and converge into
one point of view the laws of organic life, would thus on
many accounts contribute to the interest tof society.           It
would capacitate men of moderate abilities to practise the
an of healing with real advantage to the public ; it would
enable every one of literary acquirements to distinguish the
 genuine    disciples of medicine from those of boastful ef
 frontery, or of wily address ; and would teach mankind in
 some important situations the knowledge of themselves."
    To estimate truly the great superiority of this work, it
 mav be necessary to say something of the several medical
 Nosologies that have been published.         Linnaeus, who had
 established order in the three kingdoms of nature, at
 tempted a Nosology, or distinction of diseases into classes,
 orders, genera, and species.      His plan is founded upon the
 same principles introduced into botany, and his arrangement
 is founded upon artificial distinctions. As no natural orders
 will, like Ariadne's clue, lead the naturalist through the la
 byrinth   of nature,   so diseases were  by him classed  accord
  ing to symptoms, not the frequently obscure causes     of them.

     The illustrious Sauvage,           the  contemporary of
  both inventors of new systems* of botanical arrangement,
  carried the ideas of Linnaeus to a still higher degree of per
  fection, and published in 1762 a very learned Nosology,
  where not only diseases are arranged into their respective
  classes,   orders, genera,      and species,     and  accurately defined,
  but also the causes of each disease is attempted             to be pointed
  out, with the method of cure.
      Various attempts were after that made to improve this
  important part of medical knowledge, and hence we possess
  the systems of Vogel, Sagar, Macbride, &c. and lastly the
  more finished labours of the celebrated Dr. Cullen, who for
  a great number of years, with great honour to himself, held
  the academic chair in the university of Edinburgh.                     In his
  "  Synopsis Nosologiac          Methodicae,"       the  learned    professor
  has added to his work the republication of the systems pre
  ceding, of which he speaks rather in too contemptuous
  terms:      "  Auctores     hi aliquid laudis sine dubio merentur ;
  quanquam        enim   eorum      opera, rem ex toto confecisse mi-
  nime videantur, nee unultum utilitatis tyronibus inexpertis
  afferre qucant ; in arte tamen versatis, et in dignoscendis
  morbis     aliquatenus      exercitatis,    nonnihil commodi          exiiuie
  oriri possit."
      He goes on       to say,     greatly    complimenting       LINN^US,

    Unfortunately for the perfectioning of this branch of sci
ence, Cullen was no botanist, and hence his definitions will
not stand the test of careful examination.
   Not     to take up too much        of  the valuable time  of the phi
losophic reader,       we shall only point out        a few instances of
such deficiency.        Cullen    defines    ENTERITIS (Inflammation
of  the loivcls) i
    "  Pyrexia typhodes ; dolor abdominis pungens, tendens,
circa umbilicutn torquens ; vomitus ; alvus pert'maciter ad-

all the species, and what should be the discriminating charac
ter   is,   by
           Cullen, here brought into the generic character.
    After this specimen, and never corrected, though his
Nosology           went
                through five editions, the     philosophic
world may form   tolerable opinion of Dr. Cullen's want of
                             a
judgement, or rather knowledge,        this department of      in
 science.
    ID his definition of NEPHRITIS,                            he introduces   " testiculi
ejusdem lateris retractio                    aut dolor;" which symptom, aa
only applicable              to one         sex, should not have come into the
generic character, but only been made as remark.                     a

ache,) defined as arising from   caries in the tooth, though

     As his definition of the small-pox
                                      is too precise*, so that
of                  is too vague ; and that the last never
       the chicken-pox
leaves an escar behind, is contradicted by daily experience.
   Amongst the order EXANTHEMATA, which is thus defined,

  That these are not contagious is known to all                                      ;       and to

 136              Memoirs      of Erasmus Darwin, M. D.
not only defective in the distribution of their genera, but
that in many genera the species have also no analogy to each
ether, either in respect to their proximate cause, or to
their proximate effect, though they may be somewhat simi
lar in less essential properties: thus the thin and saline dis
charge from         the nostrils     on going    into the   cold air of a
frosty morning, which is owing to the deficient action of the
absorbent vessels in the nostrils, is one species ; whereas
the viscid mucus discharged from the secerning vessels of
the same membrane, when inflamed, is another species of
the same genus, viz. catarrhus, which bears no analogy in
respect to the cause, or the mode of treatment."
  Dr. Darwin wished his Nosology to point out at the
same time the mode of treatment, a plan first happily
suggested by the unfortunate Dr. Brown, which reflects
on that illustrious genius the highest and eternal honour : — .
 Unfortunate, have I said ? Yes : — because his merits did not
lead to respect and honour, but persecution : and his wife
is now lodged in London, in a lane, in great distress : —
and Dr. Darwin, aware of this coincidence, Dr. Brown
h&v'mg     first published*,      was obliged to appeal to his friends,
tf who,"     he declares,        "
                                saw his Zoonomia twenty years
before it appeared in the world."
    "The uses of the method here offered," says Dr. Darwin,
*c to the public, of classing diseases according to their proximate
causes, are, first, more distinctlyto understand their nature
by comparing    their essential properties.  Secondly, to fa
cilitate the knowledge of the methods of cure; since, in
natural classification of diseases, the species of each genus,
and indeed the genera of each order, a few perhaps ex
cepted, require the same general medical treatment.       And
lastly,    to discover the nature and           the name of any disease
previously        unknown      to the physician ;     which I am per
suaded     will   be more readily and more certainly done by this
natural system, than by the artificial            classifications already
published.
  * Dr. Darwin, speaking of Dr. Brown's Elements of Physic, says " that it
                                                                        is,

    " The    common names of diseases are not well adapted to
any kind of classification,      and least of all to this from tlveir
proximate causes.          Some of their names in common lan
guage    are  taken  from   the remote cause, as worms, stone of
the bladder     ;  others from     the   remote effect,  as diarrhoea,
salivation,     hydrocephalus ; others from some accidental
symptom of the disease, as tooth-ache, head-ache, heart
burn ; in which the pain is only a concomitant circum
stance of the excess or deficiency of fibrous actions, and
not the cause of them.          Others again are taken from the
deformity       occasioned   in   consequence of the unnatural
 fibrous motions, which constitute diseases, as tumours,
eruptions, extenuations:            all these therefore improperly
give names to diseases ; and some difficulty is thus occa
sioned to the reader in endeavouring to discover to what
class such disorders belong.
    " Another -difficulty attending the names of diseases is,
that one name frequently includes more than one disease,
either     existing at the -same time or in succession.
Thus   the pain    of the bowels from worms is caused by the
increased action of the membrane from the stimulus of
those animals : but the convulsions which sometimes suc
ceed these pains in children, are caused by the consequent
volition, and belong to another class.
    " To    discover under what class any disease should be ar
ranged, we must first investigate the proximate cause           : thus
the pain of the tooth-ache is not the cause of any diseased
motions, but the effect ; the tooth-ache therefore does not
belong to the class of Sensation.           As the pain is caused by
increased or decreased action of the membranes of the tooth,
and these actions are owing to the increase or decrease of
irritation, the disease is to be placed .in the class of Irrita
tion.
    " To   discover the order, it must be inquired, whether the
pain    be   owing to increased or defective motion of the
pamed membrane;            which is known by the concomitant
heat or coldness      of the part.     In tooth-ache without inflame
mation there is generally a coldness attends the check in its

The genus              and    species       must be found                by inspecting the

Class       I.   2. 4. 12.
      " This
           may be further elucidated by considering the na
tural operation of parturition ; the pain is occasioned by the
increased action or distention of the vessels of the uterus,
in consequence of                  the stimulus           of the    fcetus ; and is there
fore caused by increased irritation ; but the actions of the
abdominal muscles in its exclusion are caused by the pain,
and belong to the class of Increased Sensation.    See Class
II.    1.    1. Hence the difficulty of determining, under
                   12.
what class of diseases parturition should be arranged, con

proximate cause.

have endeavoured to give names to four links of animal
causation, which conveniently apply to the classification of
diseases : thus in common nictitation, or winking with the
eyes without our attention to                           it,   the increased irritation          is
the proximate cause    the stimulus of the air on the dry
                                   ;
cornea    the remote cause
             is               the closing of the eyelid
                                                ;        the                              is
proximate effect    and the diffusion of tears over the eye
                              ;
ball   is   the remote effect.                  In some         cases two more        links of
causation may be introduced     one of them may be termed
                                                    ;
the pre-remote cause    as the warmth or motion of the at
                                       ;
mosphere, which causes greater exhalation from the cornea.
And the other the post-remote effect       as the renewed            ;
pellucidity of the cornea  and thus six links of causation
                                           ;
may be expressed      words.      in
   " But amid these remote links of animal causation any of

causes.           From this criterion               it   may always be determined,

whether more diseases           than one are comprehended under
 one name    ;    a  circumstance     which has much impeded the
investigation of the causes and cures of diseases.
     " Thus the term fever U generally given to a collection of
morbid symptoms ; which are indeed so many distinct
diseases,   that sometimes         appear   together, aud sometimes
separately : hence it has no determinate meaning, except it
signifies simply a quick pulse, which continues for some
hours ; in which sense it is here used."

     His motto       is extremely modest :
    " Hzc,   ut potero, explicabo; nee tamen, quasi Prthius Apollo, certa ut
*int et fixa, quae dixero ; Bed ut Homunculus unus e multis probabiliora con-
jectura scquens.                                       Cic. Tosc. Disp. I. 1. 9."
     But having finished his work, he devotes an entire page to
exultation, which he makes thus :
   ** Lines,    to he placed at the end o/Zoonomia.             By a Friend.
                        "JAMQUI      OPUS  EXEGI.      Hor.

              Time shall admire, his mellowing touch employ,
              And mend      the immortal     tablet, not destroy."
    Taking      the word Disease         in  the usual acceptation       of the
word, nothing can astonish so much as our finding among the
catalogue of Diseases, "Class I. Genus 3, Species 13, Cica

    However these may excite               a  smile, this is more owing to
deficiency of language, and a              want of acquaintance with the
sublime notions of the author, than arising from the things
themselves : for the ingenious fabricator of this new system
of Nosology has before acquainted the reader that his work
treats    of  " motion    ;  for that the whole of nature is composed
of two parts, one of which might                  be termed spirit, and the
other matter.          These motions have formed the objects of
natural philosophy and chemistry ; and the motions depen
dent upon life, medicine,"

    Had Dr. Darwin used the word action instead of diseases,
he would not have so greatly surprised the world by his
wonderful catalogue, as he terms his diseases ; nor would the
splitting all the symptoms, and constituting out of these so
many diseases, now appearing all novelties, have so greatly
offended at the onset, the medical reader brought up in the
old school.         BROWN, DARWIN, and THORNTON, have
each formed a new system of nosology.                   Upon the whole,
we cannot approve of the old plan of artificial arrangement,
not quite that invented by Linnaeus, Vogel, Sauvage, Cullen,
&c., nor even that of Dr. BROWN, who divides his diseases
into Sthenic and Asthenic, for the facility of comprehension
and cure, nor even that of Dr. DARWIN, but that invented
by Dr. THORNTON", who begins with diseases of the head,
and so descends to other parts, dividing these into sthenic
 and asthenic, and reserving a separate class for contagious
diseases, and fevers, or general          affections.

 XXIII.       Some Account       of a Journey     to the Frozen     Sea, and

 I   SHOULD have reason to reproach myself were               I to delay any
 longer the publication of a discovery in Zoology, which is
 so much the more interesting to be detailed, as it once more
 presents to our view a species of animal, the existence of
 which      has been a subject       of dispute among      the most     cele
 brated nAluralisfs.
      I  was informed at Jakoutsk by M. Popoff, who is at the
 head of the company of merchants of that town, that they
  had discovered upon the shores of the Frozen Sea, near the
  mouth of the river Lena, an animal of an extraordinary size :
  the flesh, skin and hair were in good preservation, and it was

                                                                    supposed

 14i             Journey to the Frozen       Sea, and
supposed that the fossile production,           known by the name
of mammoth horns, must have belonged to some animal
of this kind.
   Mr. Popoff had, at the same time, the goodness to com
municate      the drawing     and   description of this animal ;   I
thought proper to send both to the President of the Peters-
burgh Academy. The intelligence of this interesting disco
very determined me to hasten my intended journey to the
banks of the Lena     as far as the  Frozen Sea, and  1 was anxious
t > save  these precious remains,      which might perhaps other
wise be lost.      My   stay at Jakoutsk, therefore, only lasted a
few days. I set out on the Jth of June 1806, provided with
some indispensable letters of recommendation,              some of
which were addressed to the servants of the government,
and others to merchants,          from   whom    I hoped  to  derive
some advantages.         On the 16th of June I arrived in the
small town of Schigarsk, and towards the end of the same
month    I  reached   Kumak-Surka      : from this place I made an
excursion, the express object of which was to discover the
mammoth'.        And 1 shall now give a sketch of my journey.
   The contrary winds, which lasted during the whole sum
mer, retarded my departure from Kumak-Surka ; this place
was then inhabited by 40 or 50 Toungouse families of the
Batouline race.       Fishing was their ordinary occupation, and
the extreme activity of these people filled me with admira
tion  : the women,        old men,    and even children,   laboured
with indefatigable assiduity in laying up provisions for win
ter. The strongest went a-fishing, the less robust were oc
cupied in cleaning and drying the fish. The whole shores
were covered with scaffolding, and the cabins so filled with
fish that we could scarcely enter them.          An innocent gaiety
reigned in every countenance, and all exhibited the utmost
activity.     The fishermen sang while casting their nets, and
others were dancing the Charya, which is a dance peculiar
to the country.       I cannot sufficiently express the emotions
of joy which     I felt at the sight of these pleasing scenes.
   I was   convinced, while upon the spot, that the inhabitants
of   the North enjoy happiness even in the midst of the
frozen regions.
                                                                But

           Discovery     of the Remains of a Mammoth.                 143
    But what astonished me still more, was the picturesque
view of the opposite side of the Lena.             This river, which is
one of the largest in Siberia, majestically rolls its waters
through the mountainous chain of Verschejansk                : it is here,
near its mouth, entirely devoid of islands, and              much nar
rower, deeper and more rapid than in any place of its course.
The mountains here appear in a great variety of forms ; they
are of a brilliant whiteness, and of a savage and horrid
aspect ; sometimes they represent           immense columns which
rise into the clouds,         sometimes they resemble the ruins         of
antient forts,     and   as  if they were    parts   detached   from the
 mutilated remains       of grotesque and gigantic figures.
    Further off the horizon is terminated by a chain of high
 mountains, where eternal snow and ice dart back the rays of
 the sun.
    These     landscapes are of exquisite beauty; an expert
 draughtsman would look in vain for similar views in any
 other place of Siberia ; and I am not astonished that the
 picturesque situation of Kumak-Surka should become the ob
ject of a national song, known solely on the shores of the
 Frozen   Sea.      I reserve   the communication        of this curious
 article until   I publish the detailed     account of my journey.
     The course of     the winds having at last changed, I thought
 of pursuing my route, and I had my rein-deer brought
 across the river.       Next day at day-break, I set out accom
 panied by a Toungouse chief, Ossip Shoumachoff, and by
 Bellkoff,     a  merchant      of Schigansk,      and attended     by my
 huntsman,       three Cossacs,     and ten Toungouses.
     The Toungouse chief         was the first person     who discovered
  the   mammoth,         and he was      proprietor     of  the territory
  through which        our   route lay. Bellkoff the merchant had
  spent nearly his whole life on the shores of the Frozen Sea.
  His zeal,    and the details he procured me, have the strongest
  claims to my gratitude:         I am even indebted to him for the
  preservation of my life at      a moment of imminent danger.
     At first I found       great difficulty in sitting upon a rein
  deer; for, the saddle being attached by a girth of leather only,
  it was very insecure, and often occasioned me very disagree
  able falls.    Besides, my position was very inconvenient for
                                                                      want

 gouses.
     On our route \vc traversed          high and rugged mountains,
 valleys    which   followed     the    course   of small rivulets, and
 parched and savage plains, where not a shrub was to be
 seen.     After two days travelling, we at last approached the
shores of the Frozen Sea. This place is called by the Toun-
 gouses Angardam,           or terra firma.        In order to attain the-
mammoth, it was necessary to traverse another isthmus,
called Bykoffskoy-Mys or Tumut. This isthmus, which
projects into a spacious gulf, is to the right of the mouth of
the Lena, and extends, as I was informed, from South-east
to North-east for about 30 or 35 wersts*.                 Its name is pro
bably derived from two points in the form of horns, which
are at the North extremity of this promontory.                    The point
upon the left hand, which the Russians call by way of emi
nence Bykoffskoy-Mys, on account of its greater extent,
forms three vast gulfs, where we find some settlements of
Jakouts : the opposite point, called Maustach on account of
the great quantity of floating wood found upon its shores, is
one half smaller; its shore is lower, and this district is com
pletely inhabited.        The distance from the one point to the
other is estimated at four leagues and a half, or 45 wersts.
Small hills form the higher part of the peninsula of Tumut j
the remainder is occupied by lakes, and all the low grounds
are marshy.
    The principal lakes are : 1st, Chastirkool, which means
the lake of geese; 2d, Kourilakool; 3d, Beulgeuniachtach-
kool, the lake of hillocks; 4th, Omoulachkool; 5th, Mou-
gourdachkool, where a particular kind of salmon is found,
called tchir; and 6th, Bachofkool.                The lake No. 4 is the
largest, and No. 5 is the deepest of all. The lake No. 6
derives its name from two famous adventurers, Bachoff and
Schalauroun,      who spent a whole winter on its banks.               We
still  see  the ruins of a cabin in which they resided.                The
history of their unfortunate end is told by M. Saner in his
Journal of Billings's expedition.

     The isthmus      we have     mentioned    is so narrow    at some
  places that the sea may be seen on both sides.              The rein
  deer perform a periodical transmigration         every year,    during
  which they abandon these places, in order to proceed by the
  Frozen Sea towards Borschaya and Uitjansk, and for this
  purpose they collect in large troops about autumn.            In order
  to hunt these animals with greater prospect of success, the
  Toungouses have divided the peninsula into cantons, scpa-
•
  rated by    palings.    They frighten the deer by loud cries,
  which they utter all at once, by letting dogs loose at, them,
  and by fans which they attach         to the palings, and which are
  agitated by the wind. The terrified rein-deer throw them
  selves into tfot water in order to reach some neighbouring
  island, where they are pursued and killed by the hunters. •
     On the third day of our journey we pitched our tents a
  few hundred paces from the mammoth, upon a hillock called
  Kembisagashaeta,       which signifies    the stone   with the broad
  side.
     Schoumachcff      related   to me the history     of the discovery

     "  The Toungouses, who are a wandering people, seldom
  remain long in one place. Those who live in the, forests
  often spend ten years and more in Iraversing the vast regions
  among the mountains : during this penod they never visit
  their homes.       Each family lives in an isolated s-tntc from
  the rest; the chief takes care of them, and knows no other
  society. If, after several years absence, two friends meet by
  chance,    they   then  mutually communicate their adventures,
  the   various   success   of their hunting, and the quantitv of
  peltry they have acquired.           After having spent some days
  together, and consumed the little provisions they have, they
  separate cheerfully,     charge each other with compliments for
  their respective friends, and leave it to chance to bring
  them together again.          Such is the way of life of these
  innocent children of Nature. The Touugouses who inr
  habit the coast differ from        the rest, in having more rcc-u-
  larly  built  houses,   and  in  assembling at certain seasons for
  fishing and hunting.        In white they inhabit cabins, built
  close to each other, so as to form small villages.

 146                    Journey   to the Frozen Sea, and
     " It is to    one   of these annual excursions of
                                           the Toungouses
that we are indebted for the discovery of the mammoth.
Towards the end of August, when the fishing in the Lena
is over, Schoumachoff is in the habit of going along with
his brothers to the peninsula of Tumut, where they employ
themselves in hunting, and where the fresh fish of the sea
furnish them with wholesome and agreeable nourishment.
   " In 1799, he had caused to be built for his women, some
cabins upon the shores of the lake Onroul ; and he himself
coasted along the sea shore for the purpose of searching for
some mammoth horns.      One day he perceived in the midst
of    a rock      of           block, which did not at all
                        ice an unformed
resemble the floating pieces of wood usually found there.
In order to examine it more closely, he clambered up the
rock and examined this new object all around ; but he could
not ascertain what it was. The year following he discovered
in the    same spot,       the carcase    of(Triclwcus Ros-
                                               a sea-cow
marus) . He perceived at the same time that the mass he
had formerly seen was freer from the ice, and by the side of
it   he remarked two similar pieces,           which   he afterwards found
were the feet of the mammoth.   About the close of the next
summer, the entire flank of the animal and one of the tusks
had distinctly come out from under the ice. Upon his re
turn to the shores of the lake Onroul, he communicated this
extraordinary discovery to his wife and some of his friends ;
but their manner of regarding the subject overwhelmed him
with grief. The old men related on this occasion, that they
had heard  their forefathers say that a similar monster had
formerly shown itself in the same peninsula, and that the
whole family of the person who discovered it had become
extinct      in   a very    short time.        The mammoth,       in conse
quence of this, was unanimously regarded                   as auguring afu
ture calamity, and theTouugouse chief felt so much inquie
tude from      that he fell dangerouly ill; but becoming well
                  it,
again, his first ideas suggested to him the profit he might
gain     selling the tusks of this animal, which were of an
        by
extraordinary size and beauty.     He therefore gave orders to
conceal carefully the place where the mammoth was, and to
remove all strangers from    under various pretexts, charging
                                   it
                                                                           at

at the same time some trusty dependents                     not to suffer any
part of this    treasure     to be carried away.
  " But    the summer being colder aud more windy than usual,
kept the mammoth sunk              in the ice, which scarcely melted
at all that season.         At last, about  the end of the filth year
afterwards, the ardent desires of Schoumachoffwere happily
accomplished : the ice which inclosed the mammoth having
partly melted, the level became sloped, and this enormous
mass, pushed forward by its own weight, fell over upon its
side on a sand-bank. Of this two Toungouses were wit
nesses who accompanied me in my journey.                         In the month
of March 1804, Schoumachoff                   came to his mammoth,          and
having got his horns cut off, he changed them with lialtou-
noff  the merchant for merchandise of the value of 50 rou
bles.   On this occasion a drawing of the animal was made,
but it was very incorrect ; they described it with pointed
ears, very small eyes, horses' hoofs, and a bristly mane
along the whole of his back ; so that the drawing repre
sented something between a pig and an elephant."
  Two       years afterwards,      being the seventh from the disco
very of the mammoth, a             fortunate circumstance occasioned
my visit to these distant and desert regions, and I congra
tulate myself upon having it in my power to ascertain and
verify     a fact,      which would otherwise          he 'thought     so    im
probable.
   I found the mammoth still upon the same spot, but com
pletely mutilated. The prejudices against it having been
dissipated, because the Toungouse chief had recovered his
health, the carcase of the mammoth might be approached
without any obstacle : the proprietor was content with the
profit he had already derived from    aud the Jakouts of the
                                                 it,
neighbourhood tore off the flesh, with which they fed their
dogs.    Ferocious animals — white bears of the north pole,
gluttons, wolves, and foxes — preyed upon    also, and theirit
burrows were seen in the neighbourhood.       The skeleton,
almost completely unfleshed, was entire, with the exception
of one of the fore feet. The spoiulyle, from the head to the
os coccygis,        a   shoulder-blade,       the pelvis,    and the   remains
of   the    three    extremities, were still tightly attached           by   the

148              Journey to the Frozen Sea, and
nerves  of  the   joints,    and by strips       of skin on the exterior
side of the carcase.      The head was covered with a dry skin ;
one of the cars, well preserved, was furnished with a tuft of
bristles. All these parts must necessarily have suffered by a
carriage of 1 1,000 wersts. The eyes, however, are preserved,
and we can still distinguish the ball of the left eye.              The tip
of the under lip has been eaten away, and the upper part,
being destroyed, exhibited the teeth.                The brain was still
within the cranium, but it appeared dry.
   The   parts  least damaged        are a fore foot and a hind one ;
they are covered      with skin,     and   have still the sole attached.
According to        the  assertion     of the Toungouse          chief, the
animal had been so large and well fed, that its belly hung
down below the knee joints. This mammoth is a male,
with a long mane at his neck, but it has no tail and no trunk.
The skin, three-fourths of which are in my possession, is of
a deep gray, and covered with a reddish hair and black bristles.
The humidity of       the soil where the animal has lain so long,
has made the bristles lose some part             of their elasticity. The
entire carcase,    the bones     of which     I  collected upon the spot,
is 4 archines and      a half high by       7  long, from the tip of the
nose to the coccyx*       ;   without     however comprehending the
two horns,     each   of which      is  a  toise   and   a half long, and
both together weigh 10 poudsf.                  The   head   alone weighs
eleven  pouds and a half.
   The principal object of my care was to separate the bones,
to arrange them and place them in safely: this was done with
the most scrupulous nicety, and I had the satisfaction of
finding the other shoulder-blade, which lay in a hole. I
afterwards caused the skin to be stripped from the side upon
which the animal had lain ; it was very well preserved. This
skin was of such an extraordinary weight, that ten persons
who were employed to carry it to the sea side, in order to
stretch it on floating wood, moved it with great difficulty.
After this operation I caused the ground to be dug in various
places in order to see if there were any bones around, but

chiefly for the purpose of collecting all the bristles which
the white bears might have trodden into the wet ground on
devouring the flesh.            This operation was attended with diffi
culty, as    we wanted the necessary instruments for digging the
ground:       I  succeeded       however in procuring in this manner
more     than     one poud weight of bristles.                   In a few days
our labour was ended, and                 I  found myself in possession of
a treasure, which          amply recompensed me for the fatigues
and dangers of the journey, and even for the expenses I had
incurred.
   The    place where      I   found the mammoth              is about 60 paces
distant     from the shore          ; and     from the fracture of the ice
from which it slid it is about 100 paces distant.                     This frac
ture occupies the middle precisely between the two points of
the isthmus, and is three wersts long, and even in the place
where the mammoth was, this rock has a perpendicular ele
vation of 30 or 40 toises.               Its substance is a clear ice, but
of  a nauseous       taste  ;   it inclines towards the sea; its summit
is covered      with  a bed      of moss and triable eartb half an ar-
chine in thickness.             During the heat of the month of July
a part   of this crust melts, but the other remains frozen.
   Curiosity prompted me to ascend two other hillocks
equally distant from the sea; they were of the same compo
sition, and also a littk: covered with moss.                      At intervals  I
saw pieces of wood of an enormous size, and of all the spe
cies produced in        Siberia;      and also mammoth            horns in great
quantities frozen between               the    fissures  of  the rocks.-   They
appeared      to be   of an astonishing freshness.
   It is as curious as it is difficult to explain how all these things
are to be found collected here.                 The»inhubitants     of the coast
call this kind      of wood Adamsohina,                and distinguish   it from
 the floating wood, which descending the great rivers of Si
beria falls into the ocean, and is afterwards heaped upon the
 shores of the Frozen Sea.                This last kind they call Noahso-
hina.      I  have seen in great thaws, large pieces                of earth de
tach themselves        from the hillocks,           mix with the water, and
form thick and muddy torrents which roll slowly towards
 the sea.       This earth forms in different places lumps, which

 1 50             Journey    to the Frozen Sea, and
moth was found, was from 35 to 40 toises high; and, accord
ing to the account of the Toungouses, the animal when
 first discovered was       seven    toises    from   the surface of the
ice.
     The whole   shore was as      it  were covered       with   the most
variegated    and beautiful plains produced on the shores            of the
Frozen    Sea  ; but they were only two inches high.              Around
the carcase    we saw a multitude         of other plants, such as the
 Cineraria aqualica and some species of Pedicularis,               not yet
 known in natural history.
     While waiting for     the boats     from Terra Firma, for which
I   had sent some Cossacs,       we exerted all our endeavours to
erect   a monument      to   perpetuate      the memory     of this disco
very and     of my visit.       We raised, according to           the cus
 tom of these countries, two crosses with analogous inscrip
tions. The one was upon the rock of ice, 40 paces from the
shelf from which this mammoth had slid, and the other was
upon the very spot where we found it. Each of these crosses
is 6 French toises high, and constructed in a manner solid
enough to brave the severity of many ages. The Toungouses
have given to the one the name of the cross of the Am
bassador, and to the other that of the cross of the Mammoth.
The eminence itself         received      the   name of Selichaeta       or
Mammoth mountain.              This last will       perhaps  some day or
other afford     some    traveller the means of calculating with
sufficient precision how much the mountains of ice lose
annually of their primitive height.
     I made two additional excursions for the purpose of
acquiring some more precise notions upon the nature of this
peninsula, and my discoveries in zoology and botany per
fectly answered my expectations.               I found a great quantity
of amber upon       the shores   ;    but   in  no piece whatever could
I   discover the least trace of any marine production.                    I
should, perhaps, attribute this to the proximity of the river,
and perhaps also to the depth of the sea, or abruptness of the
shore.     I had occasion to examine more closely the effects of
the flux and reflux : this has escaped M. Sauer, who saw no
thing of it at the mouth of the Colima.
    Our Cossacs not having arrived in time with               the boat,   I

              Description        of the Remains of a Mammoth.              151
was obliged          to return      to the    continent with my rein-deer,
without waiting             tor them.        The  vessel, in the mean time,
had cast anchor in the bay org Borchaya, three hundred
wersts from the isthmus where I was. We arrived without
any accident, after a journey of eight days. A week after
wards I had the satisfaction to see the mammoth arrive. Our
first care was to separate, by boiling, the nerves and flesh
from the bones ; the skeleton was then packed, and placed
at the bottom           of   the hold.       When    we arrived at   Jakoutsk,
I   had   the good fortune to purchase the tusks of the mam
moth ; and thence I dispatched the whole for St. Peters-
burgh.
     A   question of some magnitude remains to be resolved :—
Are      the mammoth and elephant                     animals of the same
species,        as     asserted      by     BufTon,    Pallas,  Isbrand   Ides,
 Gmelin,         and,      above     all,   Dajibenton   ?   or should we, in
 preference, rely upon the opinion of M. Cuvier, who asserts
 that the mammoth occupies the second place among the
 extinct species of animals r As I do not intend, in this
 place,    to    make an exact            comparison of the skeletons of a
 mammoth           and     an elephant, I shall content myself with
 relating here some characteristic marks which distinguish
 the two species :              I reserve for a particular memoir some
 more detailed observations upon this subject.                     I shall here
 recapitulate         the    motives       which   induced     me to  adopt the
  opinion of M . Cuvier.
     1.   If  the     writers      whom     I  have mentioned have actually
  made,      as    I   suppose, zootomical comparisons, they have
  been able to do so very incompletely, and upon detached
  pieces ; for neither the head, nor the whole vertebrae, nor
  the feet of the mammoth covered with flesh and hair, and
  furnished       with the sole, have ever yet been examined, when
  collected together, by any writer.
     The presence of              the coccyx,     which finishes   the vertebral
  column, convinces              me that the animal has had a very short
  and thick tail, like its feet           : hesides, its being every where co
  vered     with bristles induces me to think that they cannot be
   those   of   an ordinary elephant.
      2.  The     teeth    of   the   mammoth       are harder, heavier^    and
                                                 K  4                      more

 152               Journey to the Frozen Sea, and
 more twisted in       a  different direction      than the teeth of an
 elephant. Ivory-turners, who have wrought upon these two
 substances, say that the mammoth's horn, by its colour and
inferior density, differs considerably from ivory.                   I have
seen   some     of them which formed in their curvature three
fourths of a circle;        and at Jakoutsk, another of the length
of two toises and a half, and which were an archine thick
near the root, and        weighed seven pouds.            It is to be re
marked, that the point of the tusks on the exterior side
is alwavs more or less worn down : this enables the inhabi
tants of the Frozen Sea to distinguish the right from the left
tusk.
    The mammoth is covered with a very thick hair through
the whole bodv, and has a long mane upon its neck.                    Even
admitting that I doubted the stories of my travelling com
panions, it is nevertheless         evident that the bristles of the
length of an archine, which were also found upon the head,
the ears, and the neck of the animal, must necessarily have
belonged either to the mane or to the tail.                 Schoumachoff
maintains that he never          saw   any trunk belonging to the ani
mal, but it        is   probable that it was carried off by wild
beasts;     for it would be inconceivable that the mammoth
could eat with so small           a  snout, and     with such enormous
tusks,   if  we do not allow          it to have    had    a  trunk.   The
mammoth,        according      to- these   indications,      would   conse
quently belong to the elephant species, and M.. Blumenbach,
in his system, actually calls it Elephas primcevus.
    To conclude : —The mammoth in my possession is quite
different from that found near New             York, which, from the
description given in the Journal called the Museum des
 Wundervollen, had carnivorous teeth*.                   M. Cuvier has
proved    in  a most    satisfactory    manner,   that  the   mammoth is
a particular species      of antediluvian animals.
    Another question still remains to be decided.                 Has   the
mammoth originally           inhabited the countries      of the pole, or
those of the tropics      ?     The thick hair with which this ani
mal is covered        seems    to indicate, that it belonged to the
       * See  Phibsophical Magazine, vol. liv. p. 162. 228. 332.

northern regions             ;   — to   this it does not seem         reasonable        to
atari objections, although several writers have done so:                               but
what remains inexplicable                      is,
                             to ascertain, How came the
mammoth to be buried in the ice    Perhaps the peninsula
                                                       ?
of Tumut has been slowly formed. In course of time                                       a
general       inundation must have covered                   all the north part of
the globe, and caused the death of                      this animal  ;which, after
having floated for some time among the masses of ice, was
finally driven by                a   gust    of wind upon         the sand-bank not
far from the shore.       sea, upon afterwards retiring with
                                     The
in its limits, must have buried the body of the mammoth.
But of what         use are all these hypotheses, even           they had a
                                                                         if
high     degree     of probability            ? — How can we reconcile facts

 Multiplied Dangers                 to which the Horses           of Chio     were    ex
      posed at Constantinople,                and (heir subsequent Removal by
      the Venetians.
  W HEN            they arrived at Constantinople, by order of Theo-
 dosius the younger, that city contained all the wonders of
 antient art : there were then to be seen the Olympian Jupi
ter    of Phidias, the Venus of Cnidus and of Praxiteles, the
 figure in honour of Lysippus, and the Juno of Samos, a
colossus of an enormous size.                          If   the greater part of the
monuments of Rome perished by                              the  ravages which the
Goths committed on that city under their generals Alaric,
Genseric, andTotila*; the chefs d'oeuvre contained in Con
stantinople were gradually destroyed by fires ;— a scourge to
which, by a singular fatality, this city was always exposed.
      Under the emperor Zeno, who reigned about the year 4?O
 of the vulgar          aera,    a fire consumed the library and a great
number of other buildings : the fire penetrated to the public
square, where it destroyed the Juno of Samos, the Minerva
 of Lindus, and the celebrated Venus of Cnidus f.
      In   the fifth year       of Justinian's reign,          the people, inflamed;
by the extortions practised by this prince, revolted. The
emperor introduced into the city the Hellurians, a barbarous,
people, in order to quell the insurgents.                         This was the very
worst        measure      he could        take,    as   the   war instantly became
general ; the Barbarians massacred                        the people, while those

city, and endeavoured to conciliate their good will; but it was not until             the.

     Under      the emperor   Alexius Comnenus,
                                           different quarters
of the city were devastated by tire and by earthquakes; the
colossal statue of Constantine, which was placed upon the
grand column of porphyry 110 feet high, was thrown down
by a whirlwind, and killed ten persons in its fall                      -f.
  The four horses of Chio had fortunately escaped all these
     but in the great one of 203, which was the most

            had ever broke out in that city, they were
dreadful that
much exposed, because the flames on that occasion attacked
the Hippodrome.
  When, in the year 1202, the French, under count
Baldwin of Flanders, joined with the Venetians in order to
undertake the third crusade, and stop the progress of the
sultan Saladtn, who threatened to take Jerusalem, the son
of     the emperor Isaac, whom               his brother Alexis had impri
soned on usurping the crown, implored the assistance                            of
             in order to save his father from the hands
the crusaders,                                                                  of
this usurper, and to re-establish him in his lawful rights.
The crusaders Warmly espoused his interests, and laid siege
to Constantinople.    The Venetians had already mounted to
the assault on the side towards the sea, and had taken pos
session of five-and-twenty towers, when Alexis marched out
of the city to give battle to the French; but although
he had an army infinitely more numerous,         panic seized      a
him, and he fled with the greatest part of his treasures. The
inhabitants of Constantinople,  astonished at his precipitate
flight,     proceeded   to the prison,                    where the emperor Isaac
was detained, and, clothing him                       in   the imperial robes, made
obeisance to him.    They then opened the gates of the city,
and received their young prince with every demonstration of

and the allies, the latter were lodged beyond the gate in a
place called Stenon.           The French, however, freely fre
quented     the   city, and    the  two nations lived in peace and
good understanding.            The emperor even invited the allies
to prolong their stay at Constantinople, as there was a pow
erful party among the Greeks against him.
    During this period, a quarrel arose between the Greeks
and the crusaders. The French had forced and pillaged
the mosque of the Saracens ; the Greeks took part with the
latter, and assisted them in revenging themselves upon their
adversaries, who, b^ing enraged upon finding they were the
weakest, set fire to the city.         The flames, increased by the
wind, gained ground so rapidly that nothing could stop
them.     The fire lasted eight days, and occupied the space of
a league     in circumference.           A    great   number     of houses,
churches,     and convents, fell a prey to the devouring ele
ment ; among others, the loss of a grand double portico was
much deplored, being that of the square of Constantinc and
the Hippodrome.          After this disaster, the good understand
ing which had subsisted between the Greeks and the French
entirely ceased : all foreigners established at Constantinople
were obliged to quit the city, to the number of 15,OOO ; the
young emperor Alexius became cool towards them, and was
extremely slow in executing the treaties, so that war soon
recommenced with more fury than before. During the war,
the young Alexius was imprisoned, and strangled by order of
Marzuflus, one of his ministers, and old Isaac died of
grief.   The crusaders, when informed of this new cata
strophe, assembled in council, declared Marzuflus unworthy
to reign, and formed the resolution of redoubling their ac
tivity to take the city, and proceed to the election of a new
emperor.      After several attacks, the city was at last taken
a second     time on an Easter Monday, 1204.                       Marzuflu*
withdrew to the palace Bucoleon, and afterwards fled. The
city was given up to plunder, while a new fire burst out,
which, according        to  Villehardoin*j         destroyed more houses

booty, which according to the various conventions was to
be divided equally, was so great that it filled three churches;
 and although a great part was embezzled, it was shared to the
value of 400,000 marks silver.                    After having plundered the
 living,     and profaned the altars, the ashes                of  the dead were
even molested.            All   the tombs      of  the emperors were opened,
 in order      to rob them of whatever was precious.                        At last,
 when the avarice of the crusaders found no more encourage*
 ment, their fury was directed against the statues, which they
 demolished, either in order to send them to the mint, or to
 sell them to the founders, who paid the value                       of  the metal
  only*.
      Among      these works are enumerated the                following :

  be moved by eight oxen.
      A   Paris presenting the apple to Venus.
      A    large square monument of bronze,                     surmounted by a
  pyramid.         In this were represented            the labours of the field ;
  lambs frisking to the sound of the shepherd's pipe, the
  catching of birds, and fishing ; Cupids throwing apples, &c.

were reserved for the republic when the booty was shared, al
though their removal to Venice did not take place until after
the death of this enlightened doge. The first vessels which
set out, only carried the precious vases and ornaments of
which       the church      of Saint Sophia had been stripped, with a
great quantity        of   relics,   among which there was a flask filled
with the blood of Jesus Christ.
      After the death of Dandolo, which happened in 1205,
 Peter Ziani was elected doge of Venice ; and the Venetians
who were at Constantinople elected as their chief Martin
 Zeno, by the title of Protesta.              He had the charge of the ad-
Jninistration of all the provinces, which by the new par
 tition had fallen to the republic, and the diplomatic affairs
 were expedited in the joint names of the emperor Henry,
successor to Baldwin, and Zeno the Protesta.                          It was the
 latter who sent the four horses of Chio to Venice, with
 several      precious works in porphyry and marble.
      Peter Ziani, the successor to Dandolo in his dignity of
  doge, adorned the portal of the church of Saint Mark with
  them,      where they remained until 1798, when the emperor
  Napoleon brought them to Paris as an ornament of his
  capital, and the trophy           of his victories.

  had a palace there. The inhabitants of Pisa and the Venetians engrossed the
  commerce of the Levant, which gave them the superiority over all the Eu
   ropean nations, as well in riches as in mental acquirements.      Henry Dando
   lo joined to the talents of a good general and a sage politician a most exten
   sive knowledge of the world. When Innocent III. excommunicated the crusa
   ders on account of the taking of Zara, the French leaders, who were all spirit
   ed and brave knights, but who could neither read nor write, feared the effects
   of the anathema, and consented to all the conditions which the bishop of
    Soiisons, as authorised by the pope, prescribed to them before he gave them
    absolution ; while Dandolo, with his Venetians, constantly refused to acknow
    ledge the authority of the pope in temporal affairs, and braved the anathema.

   of the manner in which the antients proceeded to cast their
  metals.       All    the bronze statues         from Herculaneum             exhibit
  similar repairs. Pliny saysf, that the first statues erected to
  the conquerors in the Olympic games, were modelled upon
  their own persons, and that these statues were called Iconic,
  but they were cast solid.                Afterwards the art was improved
  upon, in order to produce the same effect with less metal,
  and they were cast hollow.                  Thus, by degrees, succeeded
  the sure but slow and expensive method at present adopted.
       M. Boufferand| says, that the antients did not take the
  trouble of making the first model of plaster, and then cast
  the mould ; but that, after having made their model of the
  full size with prepared potters' clay, they reduced it piece-meal
  to a smaller size, and then dipped it into the melted bronze,
  so that their model thus became a kind of nucleus§.

     § According to Philo Byzantius, De Septem Orlis Miraculis, cap. v. p. 1 S, the
 antients never made any large statue at a single jet, but they melted the
 parts separately, and joined them afterwards, according to the model they had
 previously made. Simulacra artifices primum Jingurl, dcinde membra dtvisacon-
Jlant, tandem omnia Iene composita etigunL But this assertion seems to be denied
 by Pausanias, who, speaking of Rhajcus and Theodorus, says, xyaf.ftiTx i,*
 rmirts t-nrrairt tfyarzefai Httfanti irtzrot i^xiiotrt; : they knew how to
 work entire statues like a dress wrought without a seam : a singular expres
 sion, but which has been mistaken by translators for statues cast at a single
jet. According to the same Philo, the famous Colossus of Rhodes was also
cast in parts, but in another way: — they began by casting the legs, then
 placed them on the ground, melted the thighs above them, and proceeded
upwards in such a manner that the hot metal united itself with the cold. This
method of proceeding perhaps explains what Pausanias means by ififtmin;.
The antients were afraid, that by melting large masses at a single cast* the flux
might cool in flowing along. Recent experiments have taught us, however,
that it will run forty feet before becoming fixed. It is therefore probable, that
if we had the same taste for Colossi that the antients had, we should be able to
cast them    with still more  perfection;.
                                                                                  jU6t

just    and general;      but when he continues          to say that they
covered       the uucleus with         wax,  and    made    upon this wax
putty moulds, and then finished the work like ourselves,
we can stale in opposition to this, that wax never has been
employed in casting the horses of Venice, nor in any other
antique bronzes, where we see piects hammered into them
iu order to till the holes which remained after founding.
This defect proeeeds from the total absence of wax, which is
 now      made to occupy          the  space  which should he filled by
 the bronze, and forms the thickness wished to be given to it
between the nucleus and the hollow mould, a space which
remains' void when the wax is melted, and which is
 filled by the casting, the contininty            of which      is not inter
rupted by any obstacle.
     If  the modem process           of founding     is more perfect, that
 of   the anttents was more expeditious and much                  less expen
sive *.       After having finished their model,               they formed
 the hollow mould upon it ; and in making                    the mould the
 different piects were so joined*' that each side of the figure
 was covered with its proper parts, so as to make two half
 moulds, adapted throughout their whole length, and the two
 edges of which joined upon the horses' hacks through their
 whole length, and under the belly in the same manner.                      At
 least this observation applies with respect to the horses of
 Vemce,       and the moulds of their feet seem               to have     bec.i
  made separately.            After having finished this part of the
 process, they diminished the model until they brought it to
  suit the thickness they wished to give to the metal, and by
 this operation they formed the nucleus.                 But this diminu
  tion could     not   be made     throughout the whole surface; some
  plugs   nrms-t have been       left interposed, to hinder the moulds
  from falling upon the nucleus, and in order to remove them
     * AH the French founders assembled together, says Winckelman, would not
  be able  in ten years to finish the three hundred and sixty statues made at
  Athens for Demetrius Plialereus in 300 days.    Eat, according to their man
  ner of operating, the Athenian.* had no occasion to break the mould in order
  to draw out the statue, and the same moulds perhaps served several times-
  How could Lysippus have cxecu;ed 61O works, according to 1'liny, if he did
  not know how to abridSe the labours of the foundry ?

Many of these plugs would be necessary as supports, in order
to keep       the mould             steady,      and          hinder           the       nucleus from
leaving its place.   This being done, they added the moulds
of the feet; when  the whole was fired, and the founding pro
ceeded in. The founding being finished, these plugs formed
so many holes in the metal ; but they were made use                                                 of in
digging out the nucleus or core in pieces, by means of sharp-

holes with             plates     of copper, hammered                          and        fitted   to the
openings       ;   and       riveted        by nails as         we see in the horses                   of

     It would      be rash, however, to mamtam that this custom was

cent periods, the observation -of                         M.     Boufferand may apply.
The    art   of founding flourished in                 the empire       of the East. We
find in Zonarus that they erected to almost all the emperors
of the East bronze statues at Constantinople : and an epi
gram
     * of the poet Juvenal, who was contemporary with
Theodosius, proves that wax was employed in the statues of
                                                                      .

   Winckelman                f
                   complains much of the manner in which
the horses of Venice raise their feet. He says, " Some peo
ple assert that horses             of one side at one and the
                                    lift    the two feet
                              of the four horses of Venice."
same time, and such is the gait
It is evident, however, that Winckelman is mistaken ; all
the art of Franconi   the equestrian would be incapable of
making a horse move in this manner.
  A horse, when at the gallop, raises his two fore feet at
once, and follows   the two hind feet, lifting them one af
                                  t^v
ter another, which produces three distinct motions.
  A  horse, when at     walking pace, moves at four different
                                   a
times,   in diagonal line, or

   A horse, when trotting, lifts at the same time the right fore
foot and the left hind foot, which makes a double beating.
    We       see these three                kinds of movements upon medals and
bas-reliefs          ;    but statues which require a support                     of three     feet
are susceptible only                    of the second.
    After        the restoration           of letters the      art    of founding           re- ap
peared in          Italv in          the time    of the Medici.           The painter An
dre Verrochio                     was the first who imagined                 that the antients
made a hollow mould upon a statue,    or even upon a dead or
living subject, in order to form an exact resemblance. This
invention naturally inspired him with the idea of using
a similar   mould for melting a bronze statue : he suc
ceeded, and               exercised         the art   of founding         in the manner          of
the antients, i. e. by casting the parts separately and joining
them afterwards by soldering,     lie undertook an equestrian
statue of a Venetian general to be executed in this way. But
he finished      horse only, having died of a malady con
                         the
tracted from Ins zeal to execute the work with fidelity. Af
ter this, John of Boulogne made use of the same method
"for casting              the       equestrian statue      of Cosmo             de    Medicis    at

 Since this period we have seen similar monuments erected
 at Pisa, Placentia, Leghorn, Ferrara, Milan, Venice, and in
 the Papal states.          Several cities of Germany and Holland
 perpetuated in this manner the memory of their benefactors;

keys   and interior  mechanism,   were   known  in the time of Augustus : it is true
that water was employed for keeping up a continual wind . but it would seem
this method was soon relinquished,       and the same effect produced by means of
tcveral pairs of bellows :— an epigram of the emperor Julian upon organs and
organists of his time mentions it.
   The system of Copernicus is the system of Pythagoras, or rather that of
the anticut Chaldces, who, without any other assistance than their eyes, had
already seen the rotation of the earth around its axis ; and all the discoverict
to which the telescope aud the perfection of mathematical instruments have
given rise, are so many proofs of the truth of the antient system.          Lastly,
the decomposition of light by the prism, upon which the great Newton form
ed his theory of colours, is to be found in Seneca.— Questions, book i. ch. 7.
   If we have gunpowder, the antients had their Greek fire, the effects of
which were terrible, in the reign of Louis XV., an inhabitant of Daupliiuy,
of the name of Duprc, who had spent his life in chemical experiments, re*
covered the. secret.    This fire was so rapid and so powerful that no art could
extinguish it ; water only gave it additional activity. Experiments were made
with it on the canal at Versailles in presence of the king, in the arsenal at
 Paris, and at some sea-ports : every where the most intrepid military men
trembled at its effects. The king, who wished to avert this new scourge from
 humanity, forbid the author to communicate his secret to any one, and re
warded him liberally.      Duprii is no more, and it is thought his dreadful secret
died with him.
    Nothing proves the superiority of the antient inventions more powerfully
than the live orders of architecture.        Modern architects hardly venture to
make the least change in the system : it is well known that the finest buildings
arc those in which these orders reign in their greatest purity.       When will a
secund Calliimichus appear to invent a new order ? These men of genius, who
 have really extended the circle of human knowledge, are separated by the in -
terval of ages, and there is nothing more humiliating to the human mind than
 the slow progress of its attainments. It is true, we speak at present of new in»
ventions as of new fashions : there is not a single mechanic in Paris who does
not pretend that he has enriched his trade with some invention : but all these
inventors resemble the modern grammarian, who announced discoveries in
the Latin language.
    It must be confessed,    however, that these joint efforts may produce some
good effects    and  that they are worthy of recompenses and encouragements

  The first monument of this kind erected in France was
the statue of Henry IV. ; the horse was cast at Florence by
John of Boulogne: Cosmo II., the grand duke of Tuscany,
presented it to Mary of Mediais, queen of France, and at
that time regent; she destined it to consecrate the memory
of the king her husband, whose statue was executed by Du-
pre the sculptor by her orders.   It was erected in 1635.
  A   short time afterwards cardinal                  Richelieu     erected   the
equestrian statue of Louis XIII. in the Place Royale. The
horse was executed in Tuscany by Ricciarelli de Volterre, a
pupil of Michael Angelo, and was regarded by some as a
superior work, and by others as a middling production.  The
statue of the king was executed by Biard.
   The age of Louis XIV. was so brilliant for the arts, that
the splendour        of   the   Augustan age, so much boasted of, is
nearly eclipsed by the comparison.
  The      of founding declined under Augustus
           art                                                        ;   and the
reports of  Pliny and Vitruvius, both upon the                        taste then
reigning in painting, and upon the method of the painters
in their days, must give us a very unfavourable idea of their
talents, while the names of Girardon,Desjardins,Bouchardon,
Lemoine, Paget, Lebrun, Lesueur, Bourdon, Mignard, Jou-
venet, &c, have been the glory of their age, and the admira
tion of every country where their works have penetrated.
   The statue of Louis XIV. in the Place des Victoires, by
 Des-jardyis, and the equestrian statue of the same prince in.
the Place VendAme,   by Girardon, were unique performances,
with respect to beauty of design and the elegance and
magnificence of the appendages.      The cities of Lyons,
Rennes, Dijon, Montpelier, Bourdeaux, and Metz, were
necessarily adorned with statues of this prince, and of his
successor; but the revolution of the 18th century was
 equally     fatal   to all     these    works   as     was   the    invasion   of
 Attila    to the bronzes        of Rome, and the fanaticism of the
 crusaders to those         of Constantinople.
   France, which     produced the talents that decorated the
 other cities of Europe,          is,
                             however, stripped of these chefs-

Otarch       may be made from         a variety of articles : — potatoes,
in particular,       will yield a     considerable quantity ; but the
great labour attending grinding or grating them down has
hitherto prevented any great quantity of starch being made
from that vegetable.           When. the potatoes are grated down,
they do not require to be laid in steep to ferment after the
manner of flour, but must be immediately strained through
a sieve; and if the potatoes are of a good quality, ihe, starch
will   settle to the bottom almost instantly        : indeed the opera
tion of straining after the potatoes are grated down cannot
be    performed too quickly.            The produce, however, even
from the best, is far less than most people would imagine ;
 the best potatoes      I   ever used only    produced 4 or    4 \  stones
of starch from 40       stones    of potatoes.
    Potatoe starch is not saleable in the shops, not having              so
long and firm a grain as starch from flour; but if properly
made is preferable to all others for blue-makers, as it melts or
dissolves so easily, and incorporates with the colour with far
less trouble than any other substance whatever.
    When starch       is made from flour, the wheat is not ground
to small      a*  when intended for sale, but ground with a
broader flag      or  bran, as the meal and starch are found to
separate more readily from the bran. When laid in to steep
as much water must be used as to wet completely the whole
meal ; in      three, four, or five days it will ferment, and in

a few days more       will   settle, and all fermentation cease              :       after
this the stuff is fit to     be   what is called washed out.
     The common time allowed               to steep is fourteen or twenty
days   :   as much depends      on the temperature of the weather,
the exact time cannot         be ascertained" but it is much better
to lie a few days longer than to be washed out one day too
soon. This operation is performed by the stuff being taken
from the vats and put into a strong round basket, which is
set across a tub below a pump : one or two men keep going
round the basket stirring up the stuff with strong wooden
shovels called stirrers, while another keeps pumping water
       the meal is completely washed from the bran, which
till all
is emptied     into    some convenient place to feed hogs                        :    this
operation is continued        till   the vats are emptied            of   the whole
stuff, at the same time that it is strained through the basket
into the tub underneath.   As fast as the tub fills, it is taken
out and strained through hair sieves into what are sometimes
called squares, by others frames.   It is then suffered to rest
twenty-four     hours, when the water is drawn off the frame
by plugs fixed at different depths. A thin stuff' is then found
to float above the starch, which is taken off by a tray made
of   a particular form for that purpose              :   this is called slimes,
and is put into a cistern to feed hogs, by being mixed                               with
the bran or grains : fresh water is then pumped into the
squares, and the whole is wrought up with the stirrers till
it is completely incorporated with the water ; it is then
strained through a fine silk sieve, and suffered to rest and
settle twenty- four hours, when the water is again drawn off,
and some more slimes will be found floating, or at least in
a loose and unsettled state, on the top                  of   the starch;    which
being carefully removed, fresh water is again pumped on the
»tarch, and the whole is again wrought up as before ; when
it is again put through the silk sieve. It is now suffered to
rest for some days, — say four or five, — till the starch is again
settled in a very firm state at the bottom of the square.                               It
is necessary    to observe,       if the   starch is wanted          to be what is
commonly called Poland, that               is,

     The       boxes         may   be made         of different sizes                ;   but they are
commonly about four feet long, six inches deep, and twelve
inches broad, and are bored full of holes, so that any re
maining water may drain from the starch.       Thin canvass                                              is
cut in such length and breadth as to line all the inside of
the box, the intention of which     to bring the starch clean  is
from the box after the water    fully drained.

     The boxing  performed   is digging the starch out of the
square with    spade  ora shovel, and filling the boxes. The
length of time for the starch being     the boxes can only be       in
ascertained             by   the starch coming to                   a    hard solid body, which
is   sometimes sooner and                      sometimes longer. The starch                              is
then taken from the

about four or five inches square,     laying                        by             a   ruler or round
piece of  wood   underneath  the  starch,   giving                                          the ppper
side      a   cut across with             a   knife        ;   when       a   small      press   of the
hand will break the starch into such pieces as are designed.

     It   is
been only half-burned                     in the kiln          :    the intention         of this   is   to
suck the water out                 of the starcli          ;     which        if   not done before
it   is   put into the stove,                 it dry into various hard

 to be used  ;  so that it   will not answer for blue-makers,             nor
 for the purpose of the laundry.
    When sufficiently dried on the bricks it is put into the
 stove, (which is nearly the same as a sugar-baker's,) where
it remains     some    time  :   the   duration must depend          on the
judgment      of   the   maker, and the         degree    of  heat   in   the
stove. It is then taken out and             set on   a  table   or dresser,
 when all the sides are carefully scraped or pared with a thin
knife; after which, it is tied up in paper the same as we see
il  in the shops ; when it is again returned into                the   stove,
and continued with         a regular heat night and day till com
pletely dry : it requires some days, but the length of time
can only be ascertained by an experienced maker.
    It may be necessary to observe, that from the first laying
in the   meal to steep, till the last operation of taking from
the stove to be weighed, the manufacture is constantly un
der the survey      of one or more officers of excise.

   Miss   M.,    jet. 5.,  of  a   delicate constitution,      predisposed
to scrophula,      had a purulent        discharge from the right ear
for three years preceding her death : it took place sub
sequent to the Measles, and was generally copious, for
the most part VERY OFFENSIVE, and frequently attended
with pains in the head and ear, but in other respects she
was LIVELY and HEALTHY.
   Two days previous to the 21-st of October 1806, she com
                                                                     plained

  plained of a giddiness in her head, which prevented her
 from walking across the floor without danger of falling;
 she was sick and vomited occasionally,               had   fever, and
 the bowels were costive ; her eyes were             not directed to
 the same focus.        The family physician was now consulted,
 who prescribed a calomel pill and some infus. rosae-: the
 symptoms continued with little variation for 7 days, (during
 which time the accustomed discharge from the ear had
 ceased,) when a swelling was observed below the ear, which
 being    poulticed soon broke, and all the symptoms gradu
 ally disappeared, so that from the 30th of October to the.
  19th of November no medical attendance was required. She
 was then seized with violent pain in the head, had occasion
 ally startings with rigor, which terminated in convul
 sive fits of short duration : between these paroxysms, which
 were irregular, she was perfectly SENSIBLE and quite easy.
 A   large blister was applied to the head, fomentations were
 used, and purging clysters were injected; but these did
 not avert the symptoms : — she died on the 23d.
     On removing the upper part of the scull, the mem
branes     of  the   brain and the cerebrum were perfectly na
 tural and healthy : the lateral ventricles contained about
 four ounces of       a serous   fluid :  the right lobe of the cere
 bellum     was more dark than usual, and flabby ; on cutting
into its substance an abscess was found which contained
 about an ounce of purulent matter ; the dura mater was
 ulcerated at the posterior part of the petrous portion of
 the temporal bone, or round the internal auditory fora
men ; where the bone had become carious, the membrana
tympani      and small     bones   of  the ear were   destroyed, and
a probe could be passed with ease from the internal through
the external     auditory foramen.
    The sutures of        the scull being completely closed, the
brain must      have   been compressed from the accumulation
of fluid      in   the lateral   ventricles,  which    probably took
place about the 21st of October : it must also have suffered
from the abscess which had destroyed the right lobe of.
the cerebellum, and which there is reason to believe had
existed    for years;    yet we find the reasoning       faculty was

 JL he celebrity of M. Fourcroy, and the general merit of
his Treatise on Chemical Philosophy, are more than sufficient
to sanction       a  translation  of it into English.       Any work, in
deed,     by the man not altogether undeservedly called I'Ora-
teur de Science, must merit attention.                But as philosophy
acknowledges          no master,   no  authority   but   what exists in the
nature of things, we may safely venture to examine and
compare the contents of a small volume, which assumes
the sounding title of            "  Chemical     Philosophy."        Respect
for the science renders           us eager to avail ourselves       of every
opportunity of presenting all or any of its branches in a
new, more advantageous, or clearer point of view: the same
motive constitutes it a duty to detect and expose any works
which, under plausible titles, tend more to embarrass, per
 plex, and retard the progress of chemical science, than to fa
 cilitate the acquirement, extension, or elucidation of its
 principles.        Without objecting to M. Fourcroy's implied
 opinion, that a " classification of the phaenomena of nature
 and art constitutes         chemical     philosophy," however          vague
 and indefinite it may be,         we cannot perceive either the         just

                                          a
sophy," in which there        is no notice of pneumatic chemistry,
no classification or description of the qualities and characters
of gaseous bodies. A number of general results, arranged in
the form of corollaries, with some regard indeed to their ge
neral relations, should rather be denominated a concise view
of practical chemistry, than the philosophy of chemical
science. This error, however considerable, as it conveys a
false idea of the nature and object of this treatise, we should
not particularly notice, were it not followed by several
others of a similar origin, but still more injurious to the
general perspicuity and accuracy of our chemical knowledge.
Such errors are the more extraordinary and the more dan
gerous, that the author boasts of the
                                      " numerous corrections
and important additions" which he has been enabled to
make in this third   edition, which, he presumes, from the
"  reception it has experienced in all enlightened countries,
may be ranked with classic books."        He says it has been
" translated into German, Swedish, Danish, English, Spa
nish, Portuguese, Italian, and modern Greek ;" but no men
tion is made of Dutch and Russian.       The chief additions
consist of an introduction, divided into 100 sections, occu
pying 66 pages of this translation. It presents a view, much
more extensive than accurate, of the nature and " general
means of chemistry, principles of bodies, attraction of ag
gregation and composition, chemical operations by means
of fire or liquids, and the classification of bodies."
   The very first section of this introduction consists of two
propositions, neither of which is philosophically      correct.
*' The especial object of chemical philosophy," says M.
Fourcroy:   "   is,   1st. to apply the general theoryof chemistry
to the phenomena of nature and to the         operations of art, the
cause and effects of which are entirely within the province
of this science." This    certainly the inverse object of true
                              is
" Chemical Philosophy," which, since the days of Bacon,
has been first to unfold the phenomena of nature which
exist and are cognisable independent of all theory, and next
to develop the relations of these phenomena, so that the
                                                           observer

observer may arrange them in classes, genera, and •species,
whence results a general theory.            On the accuracy of such
arrangements depends all the merit of the respective theories
of natural phenomena which have hitherto amused man
kind.      To begin     the study  of chemistry, which is   a science
of experience        and observation, by applying any artificial
theory or system to explain natural phaenomena, is surely to
contemplate nature under the veil of art. By such means,
it   is true, a system may be consolidated, but our knowledge
of the ceconomy of nature will never advance one step
nearer truth.         The second proposition is remarkable for a
copiousness of not the most appropriate terms.
                                                          " To show
the connections existing between these phaenomena and their
reciprocal influence upon each other, we must consider this
philosophy       as  comprising   the whole of the important disco
veries made by chemistry."            The " connections" and " re
ciprocal influence" of phaenomena              are not unfrequently
identical terms, and even the analogies of chemical bodies
 are often discovered or known only by their reciprocal in
 fluence    or> each   other.
      M. Fourcroy,        after taking a poetical view of the pro
 gressive    mutations     of all bodies, reduces the objects of his
 consideration to eight articles,       "  which really constitute the
 first principles or elementary basis of chemistry." They
 are as    follow: " 1st, Definition of chemistry; 2dly, Exa
 mination of its general means ; 3dly, Chemical nature of
 bodies; 4thly, Attraction of aggregation; 5thly, Attrac
 tion of composition ; 6thly, Chemical operations ; 7thly,
 Classification      of natural bodies   ; and bthly, Chemical   phe
 nomena of        nature, and their   classification."  These articles
  are again divided and subdivided with tedious minuteness,
  and interlarded with fanciful or erroneous distinctions, which
  may bewilder, but certainly cannot assist young students of
  chemical science.          For instance, although it is acknow
  ledged    that   "  analysis is a division very different from that
  performed by mechanical instruments ;" the author makes
  a subsection      of  "  mechanical analysis (a solecism), spon
  taneous analysis (more properly decomposition), analysis by
   fire, and by re-agents."          Again we have the division of
                                                         " immediate

  he calls mechanical^ analysis, which consists in expression,

 "  mineral analysis, vegetable analysis, animal analysis,"
 &c. &c. to be discussed. Will it be pretended that such
 futile, not to say erroneous, distinctions can either be necessary
 or useful   to the perspicuity, precision or elucidation or che
 mical philosophy               ?      In   general    the briefest is the most clear
 definition, but               there    is neither brevity    nor perspicuity in
 such pedantic distinctions.                     In the next article, on the" at
 traction of aggregation," we have    solid, soft, liquid and   "
 elastic fluid, aggregates." These are followed by •' parti-
 culary attraction,"  (as                   Mr. Desmond                 translates     it)   and
 " molecular attraction."               Several sections are occupied in
announcing                the well known fact, that on our acquaintance
with the operations               of the affinities depends                 all our    know
ledge         of   the    theory and practice of chemistry.                  The descrip
tion of the different chemical                        operations,         indeed, such as
calcination,              evaporation,        &c.,    ismuch more accurate and
precise.
     But          the great    merit    of this       "
                                      chemical philosophy," in
the estimation  of its author,   the  " classification of bodieb,"
                                               is
in which, he tells us,   " after many long attempts        search               in
ing for the  distinction  of  bodies,  he has   fixed upon     me-?                    a
thod          which      divides all beings into eight grand                          classes,
agreeable             to their   characteristic compositions."                          These
classes           are:     "    1st,    Simple     or indecomposable bodies;
sdly, Binary compound                       deflagrated bodies (here translated,

fossil compounds;   7thly, Vegetable compounds; and Sthly,
Animal   compounds."     In this arrangement there     nothing                  is
novel or peculiar.   The  following    the author's classifica

the state of animal compounds; nature of the latter; and
 1 2thly, Spontaneous decomposition of vegetable and animal
compounds."       These twelve sections form the chief divi
sions of this chemical philosophy, which the author, in a
tone of self-gratulation that has but little affinity with the
true spirit of philosophy, assures us, " notwithstanding the
shortness of the work, really embraces the whole extent of
the science  ; makes known all its branches, presents all its
principles,  and conveys,   at the same time, the most general
and most accurate notions     of it 1 !"   M. Fou/croy,     in com*
mon with many other authors,          here asserts   that vegetables
are capable  of effecting  "  a  real decombustion"      of the air,
and that their leaves exposed     to the  rays  of the sun " shed
into the atmosphere a torrent of oxygen gas." Ellis has
Sufficiently confuted these notionsi (See Phil. Mag. vol.
xxviii. p. 273.) The following table exhibits the author's
improved classification   of the acids.

    These 32 acids form   many genera of salts, which con.-
                              as
tain about 380 species, each of which should be profoundly
studied.  Every earthy or alkaline salt may be considered
under the following aspects :
  " 1st. The form, and the varieties of that form : it must be
described geometrically; the inclination and degrees of the
angles must be stated, as well as the primitive formation              of
the crystals, their interior form, their dissection, and the laws
of decrement which determine their varieties.     2d. Its existence
in nature or in art   ; the comparison of the natural with the
artificial salt. 3d. Its savour. 4th.The action of fire, whether
null, dissolving, vitrifying, subliming, decomposing, &c.
5th. The action of light.      6th. The influence of air, whe

stals. 7th. Its union with water, the quantity necessary to
effect  dissolution at the various temperatures, the caloric

refrigeration or evaporation.    8th. The attraction of the
earths which modify or decompose, or do not change the
salt, or which unite with it in a trisule. 9th. The ,effect of
alkalis on     it, whether null or decomposing, sometimes unit

ferent acids upon that contained in the salt, decomposing
it,  changing its nature, or producing no effect upon it.
1 lth. The influence of other salts upon   whether reduced

traction for water.    12th. The dissolubility or indissolubility
of the salt in alcohol. 13th. Its alteration or inalterability by
charcoal, decomposing its acid, or leaving           untouched.

the salt. 15th. Finally, its action on animal oeconomy."
   The properties of metallic salts of importance to be known
are the following

alteration by the various acids, decomposition or not ; at
traction of acids for metallic oxyds, change of the oxyds
discoverable by their colour.         10th. Alteration by earthy or
alkaline salts presenting either an union without decompo
sition, or a double decomposition.           1 1th. Reciprocal action
of mineral salts showing either a simple union, or a simpk
change of bases by the acids, or a displacement of oxygen
which precipitates the two oxyds,             the   one because    it is
partly disoxyded, the other because it is hyperoxyded ; such,
is, for instance, the useful precipitation of the muriatic so
lution of gold by the muriatic solution of tin, which yields
the purple precipitate of Cassius. 18th. Union of sulfurets
and hydrosulfurets, earthy or alkaline; formation of species

    The appearance of this improved edition of            the  " Philo
sophy of Chemistry," as it has been very improperly called,
in   its English dress, induces us to wish that, like the French,
orator, the English orator of science, Mr. Davy, to whom
this translation is dedicated, would devote some of his time
to give an improved edition of his          "  Syllabus of Lectures"
printed in 1802;        we  might   then  say that we have an ele
mentary work on chemistry, worthy to rival the
                                                           "  Chemical
 Philosophy" of        M.   Fourcroy,   and    which might also be
translated into eight living languages. The greatest defects,
 indeed,    of the   present work, next to its omission of the
 characters   of  the gases,  and of eudiometrical operations, are
 a  multiplicity of divisions without distinctions,        and  distinct
 tions    without   differences ;  a superabundance of       terms   fre
 quently altogether unnecessary, and a general redundancy
 of words, occasioned by an attempt at excessive perspicuity,

 which terminates either in confusion or inanity.          The defi
 nitions in general are either redundant, defective, or other
 wise inadequate to convey precise notions of the things de
 fined. Many things are taken for granted as well established
 facts, on which no direct and decisive experiments have
 ever been made ; and the observations and definitions of
 vegetable    bodies are equally erroneous and defective.      Not
 withstanding these glaring defects, and many more on which
 it is unnecessary to dwell, the present volume presents such
 general views, if not of the philosophy of chemistry, at
 least of the modern system of explaining the chemical phe
 nomena of nature, that every chemist will think it deserving
 his attentive perusal.
            XXVIII.     Proceedings  of Learned   Societies.
                           ROYAL   SOCIETY.
      N Thursday      evening, Nov. 5, this Society assembled
after the long vacation, the Right Honourable Sir Joseph
Banks, Bart, president, in the chair. The whole of the
evening was occupied in receiving, and in returning thanks
for, the numerous presents of books from the Royal Aca
demy     of Sciences of Lisbon,   and other foreign societies.
    Nov.    12. —The president in the chair.      A  Bakerian Lec
ture on the Decomposition or Analysis of the Fixed Alka
lis, by H. Davy, Esq. was read. The results of the experi
ments here modestly detailed in this perspicuous lecture
are more important, except Galvanism,         than any which have
occurred since the discoveries of Priestley and Cavendish,
and which have given the Transactions of the Royal Society
of London       a  celebrity throughout the civilized world, un
rivalled in the annals of philosophy.        Mr. Davy, in his last
Bakerian Lecture of last year, on the Agencies of Electricity,
 (see   Phil. Mag. vol. xxviii.     p. 1.) suggested   the probabi
lity   that  other bodies, not then enumerated, might be de
composed by electricity.          Since that time, by means of
several    very powerful Galvanic troughs, consisting of 10O
pairs of plates of six inches square, and 150 pairs four
                                                             inches

                            Royal Society.                        181
inches square,      succeeded   in decomposing potash       and soda.
This    was   effected   by placing moistened potash or soda on
a plate    of platina,    and exposing it to the Galvanic circle.
Oxygen was disengaged, and these alkalis were reduced to
their primitive base, a peculiar and highly inflammable mat
ter, which assumes the form and appearance of small glo
bules     of mercury. These globules are lighter than any
other fluid, as they swim in distilled naphtha.      The base
of potash is of a specific gravity as six to ten of water. At
the freezing point these globules are hard and brittle, and
when broken and examined with a microscope they present a
number of facettes with the appearance of crystallization :
at 40° of Fahrenheit they are soft, and can scarcely be dis
criminated from globules of quicksilver ; at 60° they are
fluid, and at      100° volatile.        When   exposed   to the atmo
sphere they rapidly         imbibe   oxygen,    and re-assume    their
alkaline character.       In distilled naphtha they       may be kept
four or    five days; but   if exposed
                                 either to the atmosphere, or
to  oxygen gas, they   almost instantly become incrustated
with a coat of regenerated alkali : this incrustation can be
removed, and the reduced globule will remain in naphtha,
or separated  from all contact with oxygen, as before ; the
naptha forming a thin film round the globule, and excluding
the contact of oxygen.
   Nov. 19. — The president in the chair. Continuation of
Mr. Davy's Bakerian Lecture on the Decomposition of the
Alkalis. One part of the base of alkali and two of mercury,
estimated by bulk, (or about 1 part of the base to 4 8 of mer
cury by weight,) formed an amalgam, which, when ap
plied in the circle of a Galvanic battery (which produced an
intense heat) to iron, silver, gold, or platina, immediately
dissolved these, and converted them into oxides, in which
process alkali was regenerated.     Glass, as well as all other
metallic bodies, was also dissolved by the application of this
substance: the base of the alkali seizing the oxygen of the
manganese and of the minium, potash was regenerated.
One  of these globules placed on a piece of ice dissolved           it,
and  burnt with     bright flame, giving out an intense heat.
                     a
Potash was found in the product of the dissolved ice. Nearly
                                    M*                             the

 the same effects followed when a globule was thrown into
 water : in both cases a great quantity of hydrogen gas was
 rapidly liberated.        When laid on a piece of moistened tur
 meric paaper, the globule seemed instantly to acquire an in
 tense heat ;     but so rapid was its movement in quest of the
 moisture, that no part of the paper was burnt, only an in
 tense   deep    red   stain marked   the course it followed, and
 showed     a  re-production of alkali.      The specific gravity of
 the base   of  soda is as seven to ten of water : it is fixed in a
 temperature of about 150°, and fluid at J80°. Mr. Davy
 next tried its effects on the phosphats, phosphurets, and
 the greater part of the salts of the first and second de
 gree  of oxydizement, all of which it decomposed, seizing
 their oxygen, and re assuming its alkaline qualities.              The
 specific gravity of this amalgam, after a number of experi
 ments, was found by means of a mixture of oil of sassafras
 with distilled naphtha, in which a globule remained either
 buoyant at top, or quiescent at bottom, in          a  fluid weighing
 as nine to ten of water.
    The sixth section of this lecture        detailed    a great variety
of experiments made to ascertain the difference of the base
of potash from that of soda ; and from the medium taken
of numerous analytical, and of nine synthetical, experiments,
it appeared that 100 parts of potash contain 15 oxygen, and
85 of inflammable base, and that the same quantity of soda
contains 20 oxygen, and 80 base.
   The seventh section was devoted            to an    examination     of
volatile alkali, which chemists,        led  by systematic theory,
have rather hastily taken for granted that it consists merely
of hydrogen and nitrogen. Mr. Davy, after a great num
ber of complex experiments, in which he was assisted by
Messrs. Pepys and Allen, ascertained that oxygen is also an
essential ingredient in ammonia, 100 grains of the latter
yielding 20 of the former : but this result depended too
much on cudiomctrical calculation to be received as an
established fact.                                         r
   The eightfi     and last section consisted   of  general    observa
tions on the      "  series of new facts"  here disclosed,    in which
Mr. D.    related some miscellaneous experiments on the mu
                                                                  riatic

riatic and    fluoric acids, all of which tended   to prove that
oxygen     is one of their constituent principles.    The  earths
of  barytes and strontites, as being most analogous to the al
kalis, were likewise examined, and both yielded considerable
quantities of oxygen.      Mr. D. concluded by remarking the
impropriety of limiting the term oxygen to a specific cha
racter, as opposed to that of alkali, observed the necessity of
improving the nomenclature in consequence of the new facts
new discovered, and the influence of this " metallary
base, as it might be called," on other bodies ; and suggested
 the importance      and  extent  of the new field   these   facts
opened to geology, as likely to lead to numerous discoveries        i
 relative to the formation       of various stones, strata, and
 mountains.
    A paper by E.    Home, Esq. on the Functions of the Spleen,       ,
 was also partly read. Mr. Home, having had some reason to
 believe that the pylorus is not the only organ by which the
 nutriment, taken into the stomach, is appropriated by the
 system, but that the spleen also performs an important part in
 the process    of animalizing the food, took  a dog, fixed a    li
 gature on       the pylorus, and injected five ounces of a
 liquid,  coloured    with indigo, into the stomach : two
 ounces of this fluid were ejected, and, two hours after, the
 dog was killed ; when only one ounce was found in his sto
 mach, while two had been absorbed by the spleen, as the
 pylorus was found entirely empty. The liquid was decomposed,
 and the indigo deposited on the cardiac portion of the sto
 mach.
                     SOCIETY  OF ANTIQUARIES.
     This Society assembled, as usual, on the 5th of Novem
  ber, which was occupied with receiving presents, and pro
  posing or balloting for ir embers.     On the 12th, Sir H. C.
  Englefield, bart., vice-president, in the chair.     Mr. Carter
  exhibited some exquisite drawings of Waltham Abbey, in the
  true Saxon style of architecture, built before the Conquest,
  and supposed about the year 1062. Several Roman coins,
  and copper basons, the latter most probably used for divina
  tion, were also exhibited.       Mr. Weston   presented    to the
                               M   4                       society

  184                  French National Institute*
 society    a fac simile and translation     of the inscription on the
 piece of ordnance in St. James's park, brought from Egypt.
 The inscription states the date of its foundry in 920 of the
 Hegira, (1542 of the Christian aera,) and also a description
 of its powers,      as, ** There is nothing        can stand before me
 but   I  destroy and tear to pieces^     — in  my belly is fire, in my
 mouth thunder and death," &c. &c.                These expressions, it
 must be confessed, are not less rational              than Louis XI V's
fC  Lex ultima legum," or Oliver Cromwell's " Open our
 mouths, O Lord, and we will show forth thy praise !"
which decorated the cannons of these warriors at a much
 later period.        On the 19th, Dr. Neil exhibited to the
 society    the  horn  of a rhinoceros, found near Cairo. It was
 finely carved with several well-executed figures of animals,
in bas-relief, about two feet long, and at the base nearly six
inches in diameter.          It is cut into the shape of a Turkey
slipper, only with a spout like a mouth at the small end. A
curious cup was likewise exhibited, on which were delineated
 the inebriety and excesses of Noah, Lot, his daughters, &c.
It  is  of   a cylindrical  figure, made     of walnut, holding about
two      quarts, lined with tin, and is conjectured to be very
 antient, and to have been the workmanship of our ances
tors at    a  time when biblical      characters were      the chief sub
jects of art.

    Naturalists      have   therefore     thought      that animals   en
dowed with instincts exercise these particular actions in
virtue of an interior impulse, independently of experience,
foresight, education, and external agents; or, in other terms,
that tkeir organization by itself alone determines them to act
in this manner. This result has been adopted by almost all
writers; and, if they have varied, it has been merely in ex
 plaining the manner in which organization can communi
cate this determination : the following is the hypothesis of
one author upon this subject :
    The want of, or the desire for, a certain action can only
                                                                       be

be occasioned         by sensations or recollections of sensations ;
in    a word, by images       : but it is not necessary    that a sensa
tion should be an outward one; because every external sensa
tion requires internal movements of the nerves and brain,
without which it would not have taken place. Now these in
ternal movements may arise in the organs themselves, with
 out any external excitement ; and thus it often happens iu
 dreaming, and in different diseases : there is nothing, there
 fore, to prevent certain animals from being organized in such
 a manner that there are constantly in them interior move
 ments proper for producing sensations, images, and so that
 these images determine imperatively their volition to certain
 actions.
      This hypothesis        seems to have nothing     in common with
 that of innate ideas, which          has for its object merely general
 or    abstract   ideas ; because those who deny, with reason, that
  ^he general      ideas   of mankind   are innate, have never asserted
  that man can have sensations in virtue of internal move-
  ments of his proper body, and without the intervention of
  external bodies ; the experience           of every  day   would   have
  given the lie to their assertion.
      Nor   does this hypothesis seem to have any thing in com
  mon     with    that of materialism : for, whatever idea we form
  of the intimate nature of the thinking principle, we are al
  ways obliged to allow that it only experiences sensations by
   the intermedium of the brain and the nervous system.
       In the last place, it has nothing which connects it more
   than another with the doctrine of fatalism ; for, every action
   being determined either by an actual sensation or by the
   remembrance of a past sensation, or, lastly, by the fear or
   hope of a future sensation, — let these sensations be internal
   or external, the state of the question is not changed.
       It seems to be, however, from the fear of falling intp
    any   of    these    labyrinths, that M. Dupont has indiscri-
    piinately rejected every kind of instinct whatever.
       He begins by showing that the actions of animals of
    superior orders, such as quadrupeds and birds, result from
    the combination of their experience and their physical fa
    culties : but he might have saved himself this trouble ; all
                                                                naturalist

 166                 French National Institute.
naturalists admit it. Afterwards he endeavours to explain
physically how these animals, and children also, learn to
suckle : he shows that several species have the power of
emitting       sounds numerous enough    to form a very com
plicated     language;   and he asserts that he observed they
employed some of         these signs in circumstances so com
pletely similar, that it cannot be doubted they attach a
fixed signification to them.    His observations on this
head are very interesting,      and   must enrich   the natural
history of such species.
   He   also endeavours to prove that the species may per
fect their processes in certain circumstances j but perhaps
naturalists will here discover that he has sometimes mis
taken different species for one and the same species in a state
of greater perfection. Thus, the architect beaver of Canada
is not entirely similar to the terrier castor of the Rhone ; and
the gregarious      spider of  Paraguay is by no means the
same with our solitary spiders.
   We may conceive, from what we have mentioned above,
that the greatest difficulty for M. Dupont would be, to ex
plain how insects have acquired the precautions, so marvel
lous, with which they prepare for the egg they produce, and
for the worm it is about to hatch, the requisite security and
nourishment ; although these insects often never saw, or, if
they did, never will see again, either a similar egg or a si
milar worm ; and although the wants of the worm have no
relation with those of the insect which works for it.
   Among the multitude of examples which we may adduce,
M. Dupont has chosen one only; but we do not think he
has been happy in his choice ; it is that of a false solitary
                                              —
wasp, the industry of which is as follows : During its ex
istence as a perfect insect it attaches itself to the flowers ;
when it is ready to lay its eggs it digs a cylindrical hole in
clayey sand ; it deposits an egg at the bottom : it then goes
among   some  cabbages and seizes upon a small green cater
pillar which it had never before made its prey; this cater
pillar the wasp pricks with its sting,   so as to weaken    it,   in
order that  may not make any resistance against the worm
             it
which    about
        is     to issue from the egg and devour    the ca-
                                                    it
                                                     :

                  it                      then rolls

                                       it
then proceeds to fetch eleven similar caterpillars successively,
which     treats in the same manner
          it                                then closes up the
                                                      :    it
hole and dies.   The small worm        now hatched
                                                 is   devours          ;   it
the twelve caterpillars in succession, and then metamorphoses
itself into  wasp, which leaves its subterraneous apartment
                  a
and flies about among the flowers   becomes impregnated
                                                 ;    it
by the male, and begins again, when     wishes to lay its  it
eggs, precisely the same operations as its mother, and upon
the same species of caterpillars.
     M. Dupont                 not only obliged to suppose,
                        de Nemours          is
and in fact he does suppose in his explanation, that the per
fect insect preserves the remembrance of sensations expe
rienced      byin the state of worm, although
                  it                        a      has entirely       it
changed its form and its organs but he must also think,
                                                 ;
although he does not say so expressly, that the wasp can
never know       eye-sight the caterpillars and the sand, that
                       by
it had nerer learnt to know them except        the touch, and   by
          it by
even      its old touch as     worm     for when worm
                                            a     ;                   a           it   is

in this cell the caterpillars are no longer there. Lastly, as
M. Dupont does not venture to admit that the wasp has the
foresight that the egg             it   deposits will become   worm, and
                                                                      a

                                                              must intend
to insinuate that the wasp does all this solely to amuse itself
by imitating what     had seen in its infancy.
                             it
  Such, in our opinion, are the difficulties which M. Du
pont combats on the one hand, and such are the difficulties
into whichhe plunges himself on the other hand. We have
endeavoured to be impartial in our statement of them, but
itdoes not belong to Us to form any judgment as to their
merits.   Our readers who peruse M. Dupont's memoir will
derive all the pleasure which the wit and imagination of this
ingenious philosopher cannot fail to produce.

        XXIX.       Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
                                 THE COMET.         .
 M.L.   Bouvard, member of the French Institute and of
 the Board of Longitude, has published the following addi
 tional facts respecting this phenomenon :
    "  The comet discovered at Marseilles on the 20th of Sep
tember is the most beautiful that has been seen' these 30 years.
Its nucleus      appears   like   a star  of the first or second magni
tude, but its light is paler : its tail is not very extensive,
being only a few degrees : its light, however, and that of
its nucleus     are striking enough to enable us           to see it every
evening.
    " On    the 30th      of September I       was informed    of the ap
pearance     of this new comet,          and on the same evening     I de
termined      its position with an excellent instrument.             From
this time     I  observed     it regularly when the weather was fa
vourable.
    " The     elements     of   its orbit have been determined by my
 observations     ; and   by employing the method of          M. Laplace
 I found   it  had passed its perihelion        on the 19th   of Septem
 ber 1807, at 6h. 56m. in the morning, mean time, at Paris.
    "  Its perihelion distance, that of- the Sun being taken
 at unity, is 0,647491 .
    " The longitude of the perihelion upon the orbit —27° 56'
 53".
    " The longitude of the ascending node 266° 39' 40".
    " The inclination of the orbit 63° 14' l".
    " Heliocentric motion direct,
    "Thiscomet from the period of its discovery has been con
 tinually removing from the sun and the earth l its distanca
 from the earth, however, surpasses that of the sun, and it in
 creases every day.        This comet will be still visible for some
 time ; which will afford an opportunity for multiplying ob
 servations, and will be favourable to astronomers in supply
 ing them with* the means of ascertaining with great exactness
 the elements of its orbit, which resembles none of the or
 bits of any comet hitherto observed.

                             Vaccination.                        1 Bg
    A   Medical Gentleman has invented a new mode of secret
writing, which can never be effaced but by destroying the
paper; and which produces ten or twelve perfect copies
as soon as one, with no more trouble to the writer.              The
same Gentleman, we understand, wrote the article          " Cipher"
for   the new    Cyclopsedia,     which has excited considerable
attention in the     literary world.
   A New Edition of Mr.      Parkes's Chemical Catechism, which
has been for some time expected, has just made its appear
ance.     We    observe   in it some very considerable additions
and improvements.          The "Essay on the Utility of Che
mistry    to the Arts   and  Manufactures," by the same author,
and which makes a part of the above volume, may be had
by itself.
       •                    VACCINATION.
    M.   Champagny,      the French minister    of the interior,   has
 presented to the emperor Napoleon a report of the present
 state of vaccination in France.         His majesty had directed
 M. Champagny to obtain authentic materials for this report,
 by inviting the prefects and clergy of all the departments in
 the empire to transmit to Paris official documents on the
 subject.    M. Champagny has displayed great zeal for the
 interests of humanity in the performance of the task thus
 imposed upon him; and in the masterly report he has pre
 sented to the emperor on the subject, he records the names
 of such of    the French    clergy as have    been   most active in
 the propagation      of  the vaccine among      their parishioners.
 The emperor, on perusing          the  report, ordered  M.   Cham
 pagny     to intimate to these      enlightened   ministers   of the
 Christian religion,    that their names should be remembered       in
  the future distribution    of church preferments.
     M. Champagny, in his report, expresses his regret that
  the vaccine should have met with some opposition from
  the ignorant in France, in consequence of the translation of
  some pamphlets from the English language, and suggests
  that his majesty should issue some restriction upon the cir
  culation of works of a tendency hostile to vaccination.
                                                               While

  190-         lust of Patents for Now Inventions.
    While   the above encouragement has been given        in France
 to the vaccine inoculation,    the king of Bavaria has gone a
 step further in the cause of humanity.            By a royal or-
 donnance lately published, his majesty has decreed that every
child within his dominions who has not attained the age of
three years shall be vaccinated before the 1st of July 1808,
and that every infant horn in future within his dominions
 shall undergo the same inoculation within three months
after its birth.   Heavy penalties are inflicted on the neglect
of this   decree,  and inoculation for the small-pox is pro
hibited under pain    of imprisonment.
   M.   Lechenault,   one  of the naturalists who accompanied
the French circumnavigator       captain Baudin, has arrived at
Paris.    He  has brought   with him  a fine collection in natural
history, consisting of minerals, mammiferous and oviparous
quadrupeds, serpents, birds, shells, and insects, with a
magnificent hortns siccus, and a very rare collection of arms
and instruments       from   India, Otaheite,     Java, and other
neighbouring islands.      M. Lechenault     left   captain Baudin
at Batavia in extreme ill health.

       proposed       establish
                             19    grand National Museum to

found the learned   but   methodical display of that instruc
                             ;         a

has been pleased to manifest through all his works     an ex                   :
hibition of the
                 «                             bearings and the tics,
                     The strong connections, nice dependencies
                     Gradations    —"
                                    just
which cannot fail to excite even in rude minds emotions                                       of
delight, and which tend to impress those improved       the                             by
most moderate culture with salutary awe,  and   conviction               a
of the all-disposing,                  all-prevailing         wisdom,        power,          and
glory of the omnipresent Deity.
   The writings of Ray and Derham, and the excellently
methodized Natural Theology of Paley, will be proper intro
ductions  or companions to the National Museum.           It-is
obvious that the lecturer, preacher, and writer, have to con
tend with many impediments of language, while        that me                  by
dium alone they endeavour to sway the heart and to affect
the understanding.    Eloquence however animating, propo
sitions  however    clearly enounced      and   syllogistically
proved, do not associate with the impressions of surround
ing objects RO constantly and forcibly as events actually wit
nessed,        and effects with their proximate causes exhibited to
the lenses.         The superiority of example to precept      pro-                is
                                                                                    a
       Vol.    89. No. 115. Dec. 1807.      N                   verb

 1 94              Proposal    for  the Establishment      of
  verb  of all schools    :   this truth is explained in the most sim
  ple manner by the observation of the mental process, which
  associates impressions with ideas, the present with the past,
  giving activity      to memory,       and strength to habit.       A mu
  seum comprehending all objects             of natural science, exhibit
  ing in regular arrangement their classes, orders, genera,
  species, and varieties, while it shall preach and lecture to the
  eye and to the touch, will illustrate the discourse of the phi
  losopher and       the    divine,   and   store   the mind with images
  which will readily      associate    with the objects     of daily and of
  hourly occurrence.
     Perhaps no religious truth has equal force to subdue the
  fluctuations of the human soul, to repress in the instant of
  temptation the beginnings of sinful emotion, with that which
  impresses on the mind and heart the universal actual pre
  sence  of    the all-beholding     Deity.       It is not a light under
  taking, a project       of temporary amusement, which proposes
  to associate every        object of nature with this awful idea, to
  cause   its continual      recurrence, and induce it to predomi
  nate with the energy        of habit.
     That    the scheme      of forming    a museum with a moral and
  religious     view is rather novel, may           perhaps be admitted.
 The curiosity of naturalists         has probably impelled       them, for
  the most part, to collect,             and some vanity         may have
  mingled     with   the    philanthropy     which     has displayed to the
  public    their miscellaneous        rarities.     These principles and
  these collection* have however been subservient to the views
 of   general science     ;   they have enlarged its scope and ex
  tended its career     : but science itself is destitute of dignity,
  unless it be derived from its unwearied service, its high
 fealty to morals and religion.           These can alone invest with
 proper dignity, and sanction with the broad stamp of utility,
 the charter of a national museum.
     Yet to encourage public amusements in their nature
 wholly innocent is not unworthy o! wise legislators. How few
 public diversions are entitled even to this praise. To diffuse
joy amongst the subjects of its care is a glorious effort of aa
enlightened government : but to mix instruction with de
 light- — dtlecta1ulo pariterque monendo — to range the passion.
                                                                        for

                         a National Museum.                        1 §5
for amusement on the side       of virtue,  is entitled to the higher
praise   of generous   and far-sighted policy.
    The games of ancient Greece,and Rome were grand po
litical institutions.    They were employed to call forth into
action a display of various talent, to excite ardent emula
tion, to sooth the public mind, and divert it from the irri
tation of calamity, or of ignorance inflamed by faction : but
they also were tributary to the elegant arts, and gave some of
their richest stores to painting, poetry, and sculpture. What
can more surely tend to the refinement of taste, as applied to
the gracds of art, than the habitual contemplation of the
brilliant varieties, the elegant gradations and harmonies of
form and colour displayed throughout every department                of
inanimate as well as of animated nature ?
    The   advantages   of such   an establishment to the purposes
of scientific inquiry are too obvious to need specification.'
    A national museum, considered in these points of view,           as
adapted both to the instruction and delight of the nation             at
large, cannot fail, it is presumed, to interest all classes          in
its favour.
    We    are blest with a sovereign under whose auspices          and
protection every liberal science, and the arts in all their
branches, have arrived at a degree of perfection exceeding,
in most respects, the attainments of all other nations. The
globe has been widely and accurately explored, and our con
nections with distant regions extended beyond all compari
son with those of any other people in any period of time.
    It is believed that a scheme     of establishing   a national mu
seum has already been contemplated by his majesty, together
with some leading members of his late administration ; and
that the museum collected by Sir Ashton Lever would have/
been purchased as the foundation of such an establishment,
had the specimens been found in a due state           of preservation.
It  may  not  be improper  here  to  observe, that a  museum   formed
on a preconcerted plan of scientific arrangement, is not like
ly to   be attended    with  the    expenses   in which     a rage  for
rarities frequently involves the emulous collector.
    Our catalogue of scientific men, whose names do honour
to their age and country, is too long to be here inserted. It
                                 N    2                           may

 196               Proposal   for  the Establishment    of
may suffice to name Sir         Joseph Banks, the patron       of natural
science, and the student's friend           ;   Dr. Shaw, the classical
historian of animated nature ; Dr. Smith, alter Linnaeus :—
 Mineralogy and chemistry boast of their Chenevix, Hat-
chett, Davy, and Thompson ; — Geology of De Luc, of Sir
 James Hall, Lard William Seymour, and of Kirwan; —Com
parative anatomy of Home, Carlisle, Cowper, &c. &c.
    The wealth of our merchants is equalled by the en
lightened views which direct their magnificent liberality.
Their ardour for the advancement of the liberal arts is dis
 played in their establishment of the City Institution, and in
 the Oriental College at Hertford.             It is not to be doubted
 that they will extensively support the proposed museum by
a gratuitous importation of the productions of distant re
gions, which may be pointed out to them as requisite to the
Advancement of such an institution ; and at the same time
freely contribute to       a fund for its permanent support.
    The spirit of general inquiry awakened by the Royal In
stitution, will secure powerful and numerous friends to the
establishment at the court end of the town.
    Contributions       of specimens from private collectors, whose
names should be inscribed and exhibited with honour, will
soon make the difficulty of selection much exceed that of
collection.
    It   is hoped that his majesty's ministers may be induced
to allot a sufficient sum for the purchase          of a spacious house
in   an airy part    of the town,    to chartered trustees,    empower
ed to receive subscriptions to a limited amount,             upon a plan
of tontine, in which the trustees may be survivors.
    It is proposed that a sum of                       be raised by sub
scription, or sale of shares, at the rate of
for each share ; and that the holders of such shares
be entitled to receive interest thereon, not exceeding the rate
of    five per cent.,     whensoever such division        can be made
from actual receipts, and to increase such interest by annual
addition, in proportion tq the deaths of the several holders of
shares, till the original nominees be all dead ; when all pro-
Ilts arising from the institution shall cease, or be applicable
yholly      to the purposes    of the institution.
                                                                      In

                            a National Museum.                              \9T
    In order to raise money for the payment of such interest
on the subscribed capital, it will be requisite that a certain
sum be collected at the door from each person demanding
admittance to view the museum.
    It   is proposed      that such sum should not exceed            two shil
lings for each person.
    That on one day in every week the museum be open to
any of his majesty's subjects not paying for thoir admittance.
Not more than fifteen           to be admitted at one time, and a cer
tain portion of time to be fixed for showing the museum on
such days to each r,'.: t y.
    That      the trustees and officers of the museum, and mem
 bers    of a committee, to be appointed for conducting the
affairs of the museum, be allowed to grant tickets for the
gratuitous admission of well-educated foreigners.
    That a part of the sum collected for the. establishment of
the National Museum be vested in the names of the trustees
in   the government funds,             and that the dividends thereon be
 applicable to the payment of certain officers and servants re
 quired for the arrangement and exhibition of the museum.
    Other ceconomical details may be considered at the first
meeting        of subscribers, when a committee must be ap
 pointed.                                                       %
    Not     to encumber        this proposal with the enumeration of
 the    several    classes,     &c. of natural objects, it may suffice
 to observe, that it is fundamentally essential to the great ob
jects above expressed, that every article be disposed accord
 ing   to the most approved method            of scientific arrangement.
    With       a view     of illustrating the important arguments so
 luminously developed in Dr. Paley's Natural Theology, it is
 proposed       that  a  considerable part of the exhibition be dedi
 cated to comparative anatomy, illustrated by natural speci
 mens or models, either separately assembled, or displayed m
                                                                          '

relations of all objects of sense and reflection to the well-
being of animated individuals, and species subject also to
thought and voluntary power — are effects in which we fully
discover a power controlling other powers : such as attrac
tion, repulsion, or impulse, capable^of comprehending all
such relations ; to which power all animated beings are
consequently related,      as effects   to  a supreme cause.
   1. We   perceive   changes     in the objects of our senses and
of our consciousness      ; motion beginning and ending ; forms
now distinct, now united ; now dissolved, now restored.
   2. When we move our own limbs, or give motion to, or
restrain the motion of, another body, we are conscious of
exertion preceding the motion.
   The degree of exertion required to move or to restrain the
motion of any power, is called power.
   3. This exertion is commonly preceded               by thought and
will : of which also we are conscious.
   Change implies motion of the sense, or of the object                  :
hence all perceived or supposed causes of change are inclu
ded under the common or general name — power.
   4. When objects are perceived to move one towards
another with velocity, continually increasing as they ap
proach, we say they are moved by powers- of mutual attrac
tion.
   5. When bodies so moved become fixed in contact, we
gay they cohere by powers of mutual attraction.
   6. Cohesion is broken or dissolved by new, superior, and
opposite attractions, orby communicated motion from bodies
moved by power, greater than that which held the cohering
bodies together.
   Experience shows that the continuance              of  an effect may
be preserved  by  a less degree     of power than       that which was
required to produce     it.
   The communication of motion, whether by the exertion
of living beings, or from any moving body to another bodv,
either moving    at the same      time or at rest,   is called impulse.
   7. When     bodies are perceived        to recede from one another
 in right lines, with velocities decreasing in proportion               to
                                  N   4                             their

  200             Proposalfor   the Establishment   of
  their distance, we say they are moved by mutual powers of
  repulsion.
     8. Our experience of mutual attractions, of mutual re
  pulsions, or of impulse proceeding from both or from either,
  does not discover any tendency or power, in all or either,g
  to produce or restore forma possessing distinct parts, in which
  each part concurs to the continued subsistence       of the other,
  and   of the whole.
     9. Forms known       to have been constituted by the cohe
 sion     of others, before known      to have been distinct, and
 forms known to have been dissolved, and to have been again
 restored, arc never perceived to have mutual relations to tbe
 permanent subsistence of each other.
                                             '
     10. When the forms of animated beings are dissolved,
 the particles are observed not to attract one another general
 ly : but several kinds of particles are distinguished by their
 different attractions :      they unite and compose different
forms, each bearing no relation to the permanent subsistence
 of any other.
     1 1.  The forms therefore of animated beings, and conse
 quently the relations observed in the distinct parts, do not
appear to proceed from attraction, repulsion, or from im
pulse derived from these.
     12. The particles of inanimate forms,       united by mutual
attraction, remain in the same circumstances unchanged for
 ages ; but those    of animated forms     are subject to continual
change, and in a short time fall asunder. This tendency to
separate and dissolve soon follows the cessation or abstrac
tion of life, thought,    and voluntary power.
    13. When      we  consider  the powers which conduce to any
mode of being, as attraction, &c, experience leads us to
conclude that the power which causes the continuance of
an effect was the same, or is analogous to that which           pro
duced the effect.
    14.    But different  parts  of the forms of animated beings
bear relation to the continued subsistence of each other, of
individuals and of species, subject to the exertions of
thought and voluntary power.

    15. Different     animated beings bear also relation to the
continued subsistence of each other, and of their respective
species, subject to the exertions of thought and voluntary
power : — mothers to their offspring ; males and females to
their species.
    16. Relations     of position perceived in things whose con
tinued mode of being is the effect of mutual tendencies, in-
flueucies, attractions, or impulses of particles, to concur and
cohere, are artributable to the same tendencies which hare
produced the concurrence and cohesion.                  Relations be
tween forms having no such tendency to cohere, indepen
dent   of life, (v.     clauses 8, 9, 10,)   and   dependent for con
tinued subsistence on the exertions          of  thought, and volun
tary power, are,        by analogy, attributable     to life, thought,
and voluntary power.
    17- Either life, thought,       and voluntary power, exist inde
pendent of form, or they            are produced    by  form   ;   or the-
concurrence of particles, not independently possessing
either, or the cohesion of particles having no mutual tenden
cies to concur, cohere, and subsist, in such manner inde
pendent    of     them.        The   latter supposition makes life,
thought,    &c,    both cause and efiect ; which is absurd. . .
   Our experience is direct, that life, thought, and voluntary
power are neither jointly or separately the results of form :
their continuance is not affected by the amputation               of great
part of the form of animated beings.
    18. The duration        of the form of animated beings is limit
ed by laws peculiar to each species         of living beings    :  its re
lations to   life, Sec,    are therefore limited.
   The limited duration of the forms of living beings is or
dained by the power which constituted the varieties of
form.
    19.  The limitation of a mode of being is a prospective
ordinance ;      it is the act therefore of a power, regarding a
future state     of being different from that immediately pro
duced.
    S0. The power which has constituted the forms of living
beings comprehends all relations to life, thought, and volun
tary power,      limits    and controls attraction,    repulsion,     and
                                                              impulse ;

  tOS            Proposal   for  the Establishment       of
 impulse  ; limits and controls the duration          of its productions.
The power comprehending, constituting,                limiting,   precedes
and exceeds the constitution,        the effect, the production.
    A power then is manifested through all animated nature,
anterior and superior to all limited modes of being ; the
source of all order, or relations to        life> thought,    and volun
tary power.
    2I. But    beside   the   relations  of the      parts   of animated
beings to each other, and      of individuals of the      same species to
each other, which      conduce to the continued subsistence of
the individual,     and  of the   species,     subject to the exertions
of thought and voluntary -power, relations are perceived
throughout all nature to the well-being, the utility, welfare,
and happiness of living creatures.
    22. We know from consciousness,                 and from analogy,
that the exertions of thought and voluntary power are con
tinually directed to utility and happiness as their ultimate
objects.                                  .     .
    These exertions, which draw bodies without                 attraction,
sever them without repulsion, impel by communicating,. not
pre-excited, but original self-motion,              dispose    and adapt
various parts of nature to their ends — utility and happiness.
The ends of their exertions are therefore, in some degree,
similar to those of the power which has constituted the rela
tions of animated form, and subjected it to their direction.
    23. As we trace mutual attractions from minute particles
•f solids and fluids to the wide extent of the ocean and ths
atmosphere, to mountains and to worlds ; so relations to the
utility and   happiness of living beings may be traced from
objects of the microscope to the profundities of space ; from
the farina on the anthers of the wheat-blossom, to the re
volutions of our planet round ihe sun.
    94. But all natural relations to the well-being of individu
als and species are interwoven, and inseparably mingled
with those which concur to their continued subsistence.
All natural relations, then, to the welfare and happiness of
animated beings proceed from the same source, with all
other relations to life, thought, and voluntary power.

 and happiness   of intellectual beings is a moral relation ; a
 relation either identical with, or analogous to, sympathy, or
benevolence, or care to produce present good, or a pruden
tial view to future benefits.  Such relation must proceed
from superior            to inferior power and intelligence.
   26. Experience and consciousness, then, demonstrate our
 relations to a power stupendous and immeasurable ; the au
 thor of all relations to life, thought, and voluntary power :
 a power that regards our happiness ; that has contemplated
 prospectively our welfare in futurity ; the welfare of the man
 ere the foetus was perfect in the womb ; that has limited the
 relations        of our form         tolife, aud thought, and voluntary
 power, and placed there              the limits of physical experience.
   The state of life, and thought, and voluntary power, be
 yond these limits must be sought in the page of Revelation,
 which can alone elucidate those hieroglyphics in the book of
 nature, which conjecture, aided by analogy, may partially
 explore, but which appear, for the most part, to lie beyond
         of our unassisted faculties.
 the reach
   27. We nevicr fail to connect the                   idea      of moral duty with
 that of the moral relation of inferior to superior intelligence.
 The wants of our nature compel us to be social beings ; i. e.
•place us in various moral relations one to another.      The
 power that has thus placed us, has, by    this act, ordained
 every moral duty, imposed every moral obligation.        The
 welfare of all human beings is made to depend on the general
 observance         of    these obligations,         the performance of these
 duties.
    28. We know from experience and consciousness that
 our relations to all objects around us are adapted to the con
 tinual excitement of moral emotion.      All nature teems with
 objects        of delight i we     are organized to receive               it,   &c. These
 relations are         as   plain   as     those of lungs       to air, and limbs to
 motion.          We     are made to depend on others for our happi
 ness   :       we demand their efforts to effect                    it,   and feel their
 claim on us for            similar      exertion.
                                                Sympathy urges us to
 act before         reason       can adjust the measurement of right,

We owe our being        our well-being to a superior power,
                             and
which has ordained that our happiness shall principally de
pend upon our own exertions. Wisdom to discern and choose
between good and evil,              is,
                          perhaps, sufficiently attainable by
all
  ;  and gratitude for the various good presented to our
reach, affords      a   constant bias to that course                    of action which
best suits the state in          which we find          ourselves           placed   by   the
all-disposing Power.
   89. But, Why are we compelled to choose between good
and evil   ?
         Why      evil permitted to exist
                   is                                   ?
         Why are we limited in faculties                    ?
         Why in duration of form                ?
         Why are we in any respect as we                        are     ?
      No objects of sense or consciousness,
                                         from which alone
we derive knowledge, furnish us with answers to these ques
tions.  We must again seek light from revelation.

forms to life, thought, and voluntary power, and to the
limited continuance of our mode of being the relations of           ;

XXXI.   Project for the Establishment of Telegraphs on a

   Engineers*.
                       1st.     A    Nocturnal Telegraph.
JJ.aving          found,      on inquiry        made  about four years ago
into    the progress       of   the telegraphic      art, that no regular es
tablishment of night-signals                 have yet been instituted, simi
lar to thatof the diurnal telegraphs in common use, so that
all correspondence of this nature is suspended during a
period when it may often be essentially necessary, was in             I
duced to form the following project for a Nocturnal Tele
graph, which, together with the second plan that after
wards occurred to me, my remaining upon foreign service
has hitherto prevented me from submitting to the atten
tion of     the   public.
                           Nature and Construction.
   The proposed telegraph consists of six                   fixed lights, dis
posed in two rows             of three lights each, one row          placed ex
actly over the otherf.

  -f-There have been several nocturnal telegraphs already proposed, some
with more, some with fewer lights, some with one or more coloured lights;

be improper, unless were writing an essay on telegraphs but

                                                                it   is
to acknowledge that there   one in the Naval Chronicle, proposed by Mr.
                                is

    206               On the Establishment        of Telegraphs
    i These arc supposed to be kept constantly burning whilst
   the telegraph is worked ; and being hid or shown at pleasure
   by means of blinds, they form forty-one distinct combina
   tions or signals; the combinations of six bodies, which should
  properly be sixty-three, being reduced to this number by
   the ambiguity arising from its being impossible to ascertain
   the relative places      of objects by night      as  by day.
       The construction of the telegraph will                be understood by
  conceiving       six  large  lanthorns   attached     to a strong frame of
  timber, placed in the upper room, or on the roof or terrace
  of a building ;. in which latter case it may                 be protected by
  a shed from the injuries of the weather.                        Each of these
  lanthorns will contain           a lamp, the intenseness of whose
  light   must    be   proportioned to the distance between the tele
  graphic stations, upon which the distance of the several
 lanthorns on the frame from each other will also depend.
      Every lanthorn must have two blinds, one on each side
  of it  ; to which       will be fastened strings passing through the
 ceiling of the signal-room, and guided by pulleys to a con
  venient place below, where they can be worked by a single
 man.        The blinds are so hung, that in' their natural state,
 when the telegraph is. at rest, all the lights are hid except
 the middle one of the lower row, which serves to guide the
 eye     of   the observers, and        is therefore called the standing
 light, being always exhibited during                 the intervals between
 successive signals.
                                      The Key.
      In  the table    of combinations, or key of           the telegraph an
 nexed, it will be observed,that after leaving one for the stand
 ing light, and assigning thirty combinations to denote the let
 ters   of the alphabet, numerical cyphers,          &c,    the remainingten
 places are     left blank. It is   needless to explain the use      of the first
 thirty signals, which are capable of communicating every
kind of intelligence alphabetically, in a manner which must
be evident on inspection*. I have only therefore to point out
     * The list of numbers appropriated to the several signals is not to be con
sidered a part of the key, although I have found it convenient to insert them
there. They are of use only in. the mechanical operation of Working the te
legraph, when every string being numbered, they serve to show which of
Ukiu mutt     be pulled, in order to make the respective signals.

an example of such          a  code at large, for its contents must
necessarily vary according to the circumstances of                         the

composed   of thirty places each, whilst the second will con-
uina number of sections, consisting of nine hundred place•
each, observing only, that the number of sections in both
parts added together must not exceed ten : then, instead of
filling up the blanks in the manner before proposed, a cer
tain number of them must denote, that        The ensuing sig                     "
nal must be read in such a section of part first," whilst the
remaining blanks will signify, that " The two ensuing sig
nals must be read in such a section of part second," specifying
the particular sections of each ; and according to the man
ner in which the two parts are divided, will be had a code of
signals more or less extensive, as is shown in the following
table, by which it will appear, that if the method used in the
second part is carried to its utmost extent, by filling up all
the blanks in that manner, a signal-book may be formed
containing 9000 words and sentences, that may be repre
sented by three changes on the telegraph,   retaining still the
power of using the alphabetical mode when necessary, as
before : and that number is more than can ever be either
useful or necessary in practice, but it might be increased oa
the same principle                        to an almost                  unlimited extent.

     For supposing that only nine of the blanks are used to
 refer to sections of words and sentences arranged according
 to the foregoing method, then the tenth blank may de
 note that " The three ensuing signals are to be read in a
 third part" which may be added to the signal-book, and
 may contain 27000 places of words and sentences, each of
 which will be represented by four changes on the telegraph.
     So that supposing we have six sections in part the first,
 three sections in part the second, and one only in part the
 third,  we might form,      if  necessary,   a code of signals consist

         Total     29880          by four changes on the telegraph.
    The manner of arranging            the   signals in this system by
sections is, strictly speaking, numerical ; but as we carry
our combinations as far as 30, not stopping, as usually prac
tised, at the number 10, it may in some respect* be more apt
ly compared to the disposition of words in a dictionary.
    In the first part, the places in each column are regularly
numbered      from   1   to 30.
    In the second part,        (containing what may be called the
double signals,)      the first place of each section is numbered
 1, 1, the second    1,  2, the third    1, 3, and so on up to     1, 30 :
 after  which    begins,     2,1,     2,2, 2,3, &c,          Sec.,  up  to
30,30; which is the 900th,           and last place   of  the section.
    In the third part, if necessary, containing the triple sig
nals,  the first place is numbered 1, I, I, the second place
 1, 1, 2, Sec, 8cc, up to 1, 1, 30; after which commence*
1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2,      1, 2,  3, S$c»;    and   if this  were carried to
its utmost extent, the la;t place, numbered 30, 30, 30, would
be the 27000th in regular order.

very  of his own, was really the same with atrother theorem
which John Bernoulli had previously mvestigated, ami by
which he had been led to the value of fy dx, when                                                  y     is,   a
function of x alone. Bernoulli, however, was himself too
well       informed          this opinion openly; but under
                            to support
his patronage the question was agitated and he tacitly, at ast,      ;                             If
permitted the republication of the papers against Taylor iIl
the collection of his works,- which was edited at Lausanne
in 1745. But, whatever may have been the opimon of
Bernoulli       his supporters, the after-judirment of suc
                   and
ceeding analysts has settled the debate; and     ui now uni                         it
versally admitted that the two theorems' are totally different
in the objects and purposes to which they cat! be applied1.
That which was discovered                      by
                             Taylor has, un.ier the hands
of La Grange, been made the basis of   calculus similar in               a
its uses and extent to the differential calculus;                                   and the other,
which        was givenBernoulli, performs
                                 by                                          the    same office             in
the integral calculus to which the former                                     is   adapted         in   the
differential.
   Betwixt the two theorems, however, there     not that dif                       is
ference which  might be expected to a'rise from ihc d.vciv.ty
of their objects of application, and the opposite principle
upon       which their demonstrations                            have been made               to rest.
The one rsay              be very easily deduced                   from the other: but,
although          this    is     the case, there            is   not the least reason for
confounding    the theorems together ivor does this circuiri-    ;

   (1). Sin. a + x. Cos. x — Cos. a + x. Sin.             x = Sin. a.
   (2). Cos. a + x. Cos. x + Sin. a + x. Sin.             x = Cos. a.
 we    can  easily  deduce    two     other equations which have
 been usually considered as        the foundation upon which the
 whole theory of these functions            rests.    These equations,
 are
       Sin. a + x .=> Sin. a. Cos. x + Cos. a. Sin. x.
       Cos. a + x = Cos. a. Cos. x. — Sin. a. Sin. x;
 and to have a demonstration        of them, we multiply equation
 (1) by the cos. x, and equation (2) by the sin. x: then by
adding these two products together, we shall find Sin. a + x.
 (Cos*, x + Sin*, x) = Sin. a. Cos. x + Cos. a. Sin. x.
 and as the sum of the squares of the sine and cosine is
 equal to the square    of  the radius    (equal to    unity),  we have
Sin.   a +  x = Sin. a. Cos. x + Cos. a. Sin. x. Again, if
we multiply equation (1) by the sin. x, and equation (2) by
the cos. x, and      if  we subtract the latter product from the
former, we shall have Cos. a + x. (Cos*• x + Sina. x.) =
Cos. a. Cos. x — Sin. a. Sin x; or Cos. a + x = Cos. a.
Cos. x — Sin. a. Sin. x.
    The examples which we have now given evidently show
the advantage that may sometimes be derived from the de
velopment which we have here investigated; and it would
not be difficult to adduce other instances to which it might
be successfully applied.       But  as we have     accomplished what
•we originally proposed; namely,         to  point out the analytical
distinction betwixt the two theorems of Bernoulli and Taylor,
we shall leave the      further consideration       of  the   subject to
those who may      think it worth    the trouble    of  a more minute
examination.

  XXXIII.       On the Quantity of Carbon in Carbonic Acid, and
     on the Nature of the Diamond.                  By William Allen,
     Esq. F.L.S. and         William Hasledine               Pepys, Esq.*
  JL HE    estimates     of  the quantity       of  real carbon in carbonic
 acid differing very widely, and the experiments of Guyton
 de Morveau upon the combustion of the diamond, detailed
 in the 31st volume of the Aunales de Chimie, being liable
 to some objections from the manner in which the operations
 were conducted, we determined to institute a set of experi
 ments, in order, if possible, to settle the question.
     Lavoisier, from the result of experiments apparently con
 ducted with much accuracy, concluded that every hundred
 parts by weight of carbonic acid consisted of 28 carbon and
 f 2 oxygen. This was in a great degree confirmed by the
vrry valuable researches of Smithson Tennant, esq. on the
 nature of the diamond, an account of which is printed in
the Transactions of this Society for the year 1797, and
which were made previously to the experiments of Guyton ;
but notwithstanding this, the result of Guyton's experiment,
which only allowed 17-88 per cent. of carbon to carbonic
acid, has been adopted in all the systems of chemistry to
the present time.
     In  researches    of this nature,        the   results are   much    in
fluenced      by slight variations in the quality of the gas ;
but     having had repeated experience of the accuracy of
the eudiometer (Pepys's) described in this volumef, we
were enabled to proceed in this respect with great confi
 dence.
    Our object was, to consume certain known quantities of
diamond and other carbonaceous substances in oxygen gas,
and we at first determined to employ the sun's rays, by means
of a powerful lens; but considering the uncertainty of a
favourable opportunity in this country, and at the season in
which our experiments              were made, we resolved        to  employ
tfhe apparatus      rcpiesented by the drawing.

                    Description of the Apparatus.
    This   consisted  of two mercurial gasometers, fig. 1 and 2,
each capable or' containing from 70 to 80 cubic inches of gas.
The internal cylinder       CC  is  of cast iron,    and  solid, except
the perforation through its middle ; the externa! cylinder is
also of cast iron ; and the glass receiver slides up and down
in the space between them, which is filled with mercury :
not more than sixteen pounds are required for each, and the
 small bath B, fig. 1.            ,
     To  the top  of  each receiver, a graduated scale or register
H,    is screwed, showing the number of cubic inches of gas,
 measuring from the upper edge of the external iron cylinder.
 The level of the mercury is ascertained by a small glass
 gauge. The registers were graduated               by throwing   up one
 cubic inch of gas at a time.
     The   gasometers    stand   upon mahogany stools, perforated
 for a s eket, to which, according to the nature of the expe
 riment, a small receiver R, or the triple socket TS, or any
 other combination, may be united.
     P replesents the platina tube with its furnace ; the ends
 of the tube are mounted with female screws of brass, to one
 of which the accommodating screw sticket AS was joined.
     T  is a double section    of   the platina1 itray which contained
 the substances     to be heated.       During their combustion, it
  was made to slide easily within the platina tube P. The ac
  commodating socket and platina tray are drawn considera
  bly larger in proportion than the instrument.
      By means of    the triple socket and the cocks, the gas was
  made     to  pass  freely  over the substances in combustion,
  from one gasometer to the other ; and by shutting off- the
  communication with the platina tube, while that with the
  small receiver was open, any portion of gas in the gasome
  ter, fig. 1. might be transferred into eudiometers or measures
  standing in the mercury bath M, for examination.
      In order to discover whether the several sockets were air
  tight, after the apparatus was put together, the communica
   tion   with the gasometer, fig.         1. was closed, and the other
   communications       opened ; the receiver of the gasometer,
   fig. 2, being raised, drew up a column of mercury in the small
                                                                  receiver

 •18             On the Quantity     of   Carbon in Carbonic.          Acid,   <
receiver R, equal to two inches : the communication with
the gasometer was then closed, and the column was support
ed without alteration. This was always tried previous to, and
after every experiment. As the joints would bear this degree
of exhaustion, we were confident they would resist, a much
greater pressure than we had any occasion to employ.    The
glass tubes GG, which connected the platina tube with the
gasometers, enabled us to observe any flash arising from the
combustion of hydrogen which might be contained in the
substances subjected to experiment. In order to avoid prolix
ity, wc shall generally           state the method           which    was invariably-
followed.
   We soon found that oxygen gas, even when secured in
bottles with ground glass stoppers, was not always to be de
pended upon, but was sensibly deteriorated by keeping ; and
therefore in all our experiments we made the gas within an
hour or two of the lime of using                       it,   and always from the
hyperoxygenised muriate of potash.   Its degree of purity
was constantly ascertained                    by
                             the eudiometer before every
experiment,  and was generally determined in about 10
minutes.   The solution employed was that recommended                              by
professor Davy; nsnjjely, the solution of green sulphate of
iron saturated wi^^trous gas *                     ;   and whenever the        dimi
nution had arrived at its maximum,                         and  the gas began to
increase in volume, we substituted                     a   simple solution of the
green sulphate of iron for that saturated  with nitrous gas,
and always had the most satisfactory results   for the simple     :
sulphate absorbs any nftrous  gas  which  may    have escaped
from   the saturated solution, and the residuum in this case
enables us to ascertain exactly the quantity of oxygen con
tained          in
          the gas.
  We    determined to make our first experiment with char
coal, and as Morozzo and Rouppe had ascertained the absorb
ing properties of this substance, and                       our results must
                                                             as
obviously be influenced            by   it,   our attention was directed to
this point. —The following quantities of different kinds                           of

  Certain quantities being confined in common air increased
  yery little in weight, and all in the same proportion j we are
  therefore much inclined to think that this increase is owing
  to an absorption of water from the air ; and we repeatedly
  found that the greatest increase of weight took place in the
  first hour or two after exposure, and arrived at its maximum
  in less than 24 hours, as the following experiment,            selected
   from several others, will prove.
      40 grains of charcoal.from willow wood, which             had been
   put into a bottle with a ground glass stopper immediately
   after they were removed from the fire, were exposed in the
    scale of a delicate balance, in a room where the thermo
    meter was 62° Fahrenheit, barometer 30-26.

Hence charcoal seems to act    as an hygrometer     its greatest                      :
increase          was
                grains on 40,
                           5  or 12-fc- per cent. And  in order
to ascertain to what the increase of weight was owing, we
put 27-25 grains of charcoal, which had been thus exposed,
into  small bottle and tube connected with
       a                                    receiver stand                   a
ing   inthe mercury bath, the whole of the vessels being also
filled with mercury in order to exclude common air. Heat
applied           by   an Argand's lamp produced gas equal to about                                 half
the bulk          of       the charcoal        ;   but   as   soon    as  the temperature of
the  mercury rose to 214° Fahrenheit,                                  elastic fluid streamed
from every piece of charcoal, which quickly condensed, and
J-inch of the tube was occupied with water. This proved
that our suspicion of the increase of weight being principally
attributable to water, was well founded.
  The result of                  these, and other experiments,                    plainly point
ed out the precautions which were necessary                                      in order to ob
tain an accurate result with charcoal                             ;   for   if   we had weighed
                                                                                            4     grains

4 grains of the charcoal a few hours after it was made?
we should only in fact have had 3-5 grains of real charcoal
and our calculations would have been erroneous.   To avoid
this source       of error, we subjected our charcoal                   to a red haat
                                      it it,
immediately before using                  also weighed
                                               and      as speedily     it
as possible  in fact while
               ;                    was still warm.    may be pro  It
per to      state,     that our weights were such as we could tho
roughly depend upon.
   The volume of gas being so much influenced      tempera               by
ture and pressure, these were noted during every experiment;
and thermometer 60° Fahrenheit, barometer 30°, were as
sumed as the standard.   Gay Lussac remarks, that from 32°
to 212° Fahrenheit, dry air expands 0-00208, or -^-^ part of
its bulk for every degree of the thermometer. Dalton makes
it   0-000207     f   or
                      part ffa
                             we therefore divided the whole
                                     ;
quantity of  gas     480,   by
                           and  multiplied the quotient the                      by
degrees of difference under 60°.

carbonic       acid gases,         we resolved to examine for ourselves,
whether  the statements already given were quite correct,
and accordingly made carbonic acid over mercury from
Carrara marble and diluted sulphuric acid, which being
tried with lime water in Pcpys's eudiometer, was all ab
sorbed in      3    minutes except   part in 100.
                                               1   We used two
charges      of    lime water, though one would have been suffi
cient.
     A    glass globe being exhausted by an excellent air pump,
was exactly balanced on abeam sensible to minute portion         a
of grain then being screwed upon one of the glass re
     a         ;
ceivers of the mercurial gasometer previously filled with
carbonic acid gas, 21 cubic inches entered. The globe was
now increased in weight               by
                            10-2 grains.  In order to be cer
tain we repeated the experiment, with exactly the same re
sults.  The 21 cubic inches were to be brought to the mean
 temperature and pressure, as the thermometer stood at 44°
 Fahrenheit, the barometer 29-86.
                                                                                      21

     The volume therefore       at mean temperature and pressure
  Vf6uld have been 21-58 cubic inches.
                    21-58   :  10-2    : :  100  : 47-26
  Consequently 100       cubic    inches      of carbonic acid   gas at
 mean temperature and pressure weigh 47'26 grains.
    We next tried oxygen gas from the hyperoxygenised
 muriate of potash made over mercury, and which, by the
 eudiometer, left only a residuum of 2 parts in 100.                The
 glass globe exhausted     as before, and weighed, was screwed
 on to the glass receiver of the mercurial gasometer contain-1
 ing oxygen, and 21 cubic inches entered, by which it in
 creased   in weight 7-3 grains.           This experiment was repeat*
ed with exactly the same result.             The thermometer and ba
rometer remaining the same,             we take the volume as before
corrected.-
                        21-58 cubic inches.
                   21-58    : 7-3 : : 100 : 33-82;
Then    100 cubic inches     of oxygen gas at mean temperature
and pressure weigh      33-82    grains.       After these experiments
we examined Davy's researches on nitrous oxide, and had
the satisfaction to find that his estimate, both of carbonic
acid and oxygen gases, agreed almost exactly with ours.
    The next point was to ascertain whether lime-water
would take the whole of the carbonic acid gas from a mix
ture with oxygen, or common air ; we therefore mixed a
known quantity of carbonic acid gas with a certain quantity
of common air, and on trying it with our eudiometer and
Hme-water, the whole of the carbonic acid gas was in a
short time absorbed.       We also found, that though the solu
tion of green sulphate, saturated with nitrous gas, would not
take up the whole of the carbonic acid gas, yet the simple
                                                                 green

amounting      only to   2-84 cubic inches, was driven out by a
pressure of oxygen from gasometer No. 1 : when several
cubic inches had passed into gasometer No. 2, the gas was
let out by opening the cock at the top of its glass receiver,
and pressing it down ; the cock being then closed, the gaso
meter No. 2, was completely empty, and the whole of the
gas from      No. 1, was driven through the tubes into No. 2,

withdrawn from the small receiver R, we tried the purity of
our oxygen by the eudiometer- in the manner before de
scribed, and found a residuum 6f 3 parts in 100: we then
disengaged as much gas as fediiced the quantity to 47 cubic

    We now lighted a fire in the small black lead furnace
  under the platina tube, and as soon as it became red hot,
  opened the cocks and passed the gas from No. 1 to No. 2,
 when the charcoal entered into vivid combustion, and heated
 the platina tube white hot.        The operation was repeated-
 many times during six or seven minutes, by pressing alter
 nately upon the glasses of the gasometer. Not the least
 flash of light was observable in the glass connecting tubes-
  G G, nor the smallest   appearance    of moisture.    The fur
 nace being removed, the tube was now cooled by the appli
 cation of wet cloths ; aud when all was reduced to the tem
 perature of the room, we pressed upon the glass of gasome
 ter No. 9, so as to force all the gas into No. I. The cock
 below being closed, we tried the tubes, &c. and found them
 perfectly air-tight.   We next unscrewed the tube and took
 out the platina tray ; but it only contained a light white ash,
 somewhat resembling the shape of the pieces of charcoal,
and weighing only -02 of a grain.       On observing the regis
ter of No. 1, it indicated exactly the quantity of gas that we
began with, so that although 3-98 grains of charcoal had
been dissolved, the volume of gas was unaltered by it; a
circumstance which had been remarked before by Lavoi
sier. The small receiver R was now nearly full of mercu
ry ; the communication with the gasometer being opened,
the large glass receiver was gently pressed upon, until seve
ral cubic inches were forced through the receiver R, and
tube K, in order to clear the latter of common air.          This
being done, on trying our gas with the eudiometer and lime
water, 56 parts- were absorbed out of 10O.        These of course
were carbonic• acid gas ; the test for oxygen absorbed 41,
and a residuum    of 3 was left, which  was; exactly what we be
gan with : This is a striking proof that nothing but carbonic
acid was produced in the experiment.
                   100 : 56: : 52-03 : 89-13.
Then 29-13 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas were produced.

Now    as   the volume of gas was unaltered, it will be fair to
consider the quantity of oxygen gas consumed as equal to
the carbonic acid produced, or 29-13 cubic inches.
   Then, if 100 cubic inches of oxygen weigh 33.82 grains,
29-13 cubic inches will weigh 9-85 grains.
                    100  : 33-82   :  : 29-13      : 9-85.
The weight of oxygen consumed                was therefore 9.85          ains.

   Thus, calculating      by the oxygen consumed,           10O grains

                  First Experiment         on Diamond.
      Thermometer 56° Fahrenheit, barometer 30-20.
   Our oxygen was made as in the former experiment : it
contained no carbonic acid ; and on being tried with the
impregnated green         sulphate left a residuum of 3 parts
in  100.
   Having selected nine of the clearest and most transparent
Brazil diamonds, we found they weighed 3-95 grains.
These were ranged in the platina tray, which was placed in
the tube, and the whole apparatus, adjusted as before, was
perfectly air-tight. The quantity of oxygen was 4g-84 cu
bic inches,    as in the last experiment.           The same precau
tions were used to secure accuracy in the results as in the for
mer experiment; and it would only be an unnecessary intru
sion on the time     of  the Society to repeat them.        The platina
 tube was heated       red-hot,    and     kept so for ten    minutes  ;
during    this  time the     gas  was     repeatedly passed from one
gasometer to the other ; the tube did not become white hot,
as in the experiment with charcoal, because in this case the
combustion     went on more slowly.             When   every thing was
cooled to the temperature of the room, the gas was all passed
into No.    1, by pressing down the receiver of No. 2, and the
volume was precisely the same as when we began the expe
riment.     On drawing out the tray we observed that some of
the diamonds were reduced to a minute speck, and all of
 them resembled opake white enamel : there was no discolo
 ration in the tray, nor any residual ash whatever ; the im-
 consumed parts weighed 1-46 grains; the original weight
 was

XXXIV.     Account ofthe Discoveries made ly the Rev. Dr.
     BUCHANAN, in the course of his Investigations undertaken
     by Order     of the    Supreme      Government           of Bengal.
J. HE  Rev. Dr. Buchanan, who left Bengal some months
ago,  with the view of proceeding to Travancore, to inquire
into the state of the Syrian Christians, arrived in that coun
try about the beginning of November last, having travelled
from Calcutta to Cape Comorin by land. His highness the
rajah of Travancore was pleased to afford to Dr. Buchanan
the most liberal assistance                  in   the prosecution of his in
quiries.     About         the middle     of      November, Dr. Buchanan
proceeded ,from the sea-coast into the interior of the coun
try, north-east from Quilon, to visit the antient Syrian
churches, situated amongst the low hills at the bottom of
the high ghauts,            which divide           the     Carnatic    from        Ma-
layala.     The     face    of the country in general, in the vicinity
of   the   mountains,       exhibits a varied scene of hill and dale,
and winding streams.             These streams fall from the moun
tains, and        preserve the valleys in perpetual                verdure.        The
woods produce pepper, cardamoms, and cassia, or wild cin
namon ;   also frankincense and other aromatic gums.
What          much to the grandeur of the scenery in this
           adds
country     is,
            that the adjacent mountains of Travancore are
not barren, but are covered with teak forests, producing the
largest timber in the world.
   The first view of the Christian churches in this seques
tered region of Hindostan, connected with the idea of their
tranquil    durationfor so many age*, cannot fail to excite
pleasing emotions in the mind of the beholder.      The form
of the oldest buildings   not unlike that
                                is         of some  of the old
parish churches in England      the style of building
                                         ;                both                in
being of Saracenic origin. They have sloping roofs, point
ed arch windows, and buttresses supporting the walls. The
beams of the roof being exposed to view, are ornamented                             ;
and the cieling       of the choir       and altar       is   circular and fretted.
Jn   the cathedral churches the shrines                  of the   deceased bishops

                         Literary Discoveries in India.                       229
   are placed on each side        of the altar.       Most of      the churches
   are built    of   a  reddish stone,     squared     and     polished at the
   quarry ; and arc of durable construction,                  the front wall of
   the largest edifices being six feet thick.               The bells of the
   churches are cast in the founderies of Travancore.                      Some
   of them     are   of  large dimensions,       and    have    inscriptions   in
   Syriac and     Malayalim. In approaching a town in the even
   ing, the sound of the bells may be heard at a distance
   amongst the hills : a circumstance which causes the British
   traveller to forget for a moment that he is in Ilindostan,
   and reminds him of another country.                 When Dr. Buchanan
   arrived at the remote churches, he was informed by the in
   habitants that no European had, to their knowledge, visited
  the place before.         The Romish priests do not travel thither,
  there being no church of their communion in that quarter.
       The number of Syrian churches is greater than has been
  supposed.         There are at this time fifty-five churches in
  Malayala*, acknowledging the patriarch of Antioch.                         The
  church was erected by the present bishop, in 1793.
       The Syrian Christians are not Nestorians.                      Formerly,
  indeed, they had bishops of that communion ; but the li
  turgy of the present church is derived from that of the early
  church of Antioch, called Liturgia Jacoli Apostoli.                      They
  are usually denominated           Jacoliilce ;    but they differ in cere
 monial from the church of that name in Syria, and indeed
  from any existing church in the world.                    Their proper de
 signation,      and   that   which  is sanctioned      by their own use, is
  Syrian Christiaiis, or The Syrian Church of Malayala.
      The doctrines of       the Syrian church are contained in a very
 few articles     ;   and are not at variance, in essentials, with the
 doctrines      of   the church      of England.         Their bishops and
 metropolitan, after conferring with his clergy on the sub
ject, delivered the following opinion : " That an union with
 the English church, or al least such a connection as should
appear to both churches practicable and expedient, would be
     *
       Malayala comprehends the mountains, and the whole region within them,
from Cape Cogmorin to Cape llli, whereas the province of Malabar, common
 ly so called, contains only th« northern districts, not including the country of
Travancore.

a  happy event, and favourable to the advancement of reli
gion."    It is in contemplation to send to England some of
the Syrian youth for education and ordination.
   The present bishop, Mar Dionysius, is a native of Malay-
ala, but of Syrian extraction.        He is a man of respectable
character in his nation, and      exercises  himself in the pious
discharge of the   duties of his high office. He is now seven
ty-eight years of age, and possesses a venerable aspect, his
white beard descending low to his girdle.          On public occa
sions he wears the episcopal mitre, and is robed in a white
vestment, which covers      long garments of red silk ; and in
his hand he holds the pastoral staff. The first native bishop
was ordained by the Romish church in 1663 ; but he was
of   the Romish     communion.         Since that period the old
Syrians  have continued,     till lately, to receive, their bishops
from Antioch     :   but  that antient patriarchate being now
nearly extinct, and incompetent to the appointment of
learned men, the Christian church inMalayala looks hence
forth to Britain for the continuance of that light which has
shone so long in this dark region of the world.
    From the information given by the Syrian Christians, it
would appear that the churches of Mesopotamia and Syria,
(215 in number), with which they are connected, are strug
gling with great difficulties, and merely owe their existence
to some deference    for their antiquity ; and that they might
be expected   soon to flourish again, if favoured with a little
support.    It would be worthy the church of England to aid
the church    of Antioch in her low       estate'.  The church     of
England   is now what the church       of Antioch   once was.   The
mode in which aid can be best afforded to Christians          under
a foreign power    in the East, is not chiefly by contributions
of money, but by representing to those governments, with
which we may have friendly intercourse, that these Chris
tians are of the same religion with ourselves; and that we
are desirous that they should be respected.          The argument,
from the sameness of religion, is well understood by all
Asiatic princes, and can never fail when seriously proposed;
for they think it both natural and obligatory that every
government should be interested in those who are of its own

religion. There are two circumstances which invite us to
turn our eyes to the country of "the first generations of
men." The tolerant spirit of the Wahabian Mahomedans
is a fair prognostic ; and promises to aid our endeavours to
restore to an antient community of Christians the blessings
of knowledge and religious liberty. Another favourable
circumstance      that some of the churches in Mesopotamia,
                      is,
in one of which the patriarch of Antioch now resides, are
said still to remain in their pristine state, and to have pre
served their archives and antient manuscript libraries. A
domestic priest of the patriarch, now in Cochin, vouches
for the    truth of this fact.             We know from authentic his
tory that the churches between the rivers escaped the gene
ral desolation of the Mahomedan conquest, in the seventh
century, by joining arms with the Mahomedans against the
Greek Christians, who had been their oppressors. The re
vival of religion and letters in that once highly-favoured                              f
land,     in   the heart    of   the   antient world,           would       be, in the
present circumstances of mankind, an auspicious event.
   The Syrian Christians in Malayala still use the Syriac
language in their churches  but the Malayalim, or proper
                                       :
Malabar        (a   dialect distinct from theTumul),                 is    the vernacu
lar tongue.          They    have      made     some  attempts to translate
the Syriac     scriptures into                Malayalim     but have not
                                                               ;

proposal was made of sending           Malayalim translation to
                                                a

                                                    it, a
dition that they would transcribe        and circulate the copies
among the people, — the elders replied, That so great was
the desire of the people in general to have the Bible in the
vulgar tongue, that    might be expected that every man
                             it
who could write would make                    a   copy on ollas (palm leaves)
for his own family.
  It  ought .to be mentioned, to the                        praise   of
                                                                present     the
bishop     of   the Romish         church on the coast of Malabar, that
he has         consented         to the    circulation
                                                 Scriptures    of    the
throughout his diocese. The Malayalim translation acquires
from this circumstance an increased importance, since there
will    be now        upwards       of 200,000 Christians                  in Malayala

 who        arc ready to receive it.            The translation       of   the    New
 Testaroent (which it is proposed to print first) has already com
 menced, under the superintendance of the Syrian bishop.
 The true cause of the low state of religion amongst the
 Romish churches on the sea-coast and in Ceylon is, thsir
 want       of the Bible.         It   is doubtful whether some       of the priests
 know           that such a book exists             It
                                               injurious to Christi
                                               !         is
 anity          in India to call men Christians who know not the
 scriptures of their religion : they might as well be called by
 any other name.      Oral instruction they have none, even
 from their European priests.   The best effects may there
 fore be expected from the simple means of putting the Bible
 into their hands. All who are well acquainted with the na
 tives, know that instruction by books is best suited to them.
 They are in general a contemplative people, and patient in
 their inquiries ; curious also to know what it can be that is
 of importance enough                   to be written,   — at   the same time that
 they regard written precept                 with respect.  If they possess a
 book           in   a language        which they understand, it will not be
 left long unread.              In Tanjore,        and other places       where    the.
 Bible      is freely given, the Protestant religion flourishes;                  and
 produces the happiest effects on the character                     of the people.
 In Tanjore           the Christian        virtues will be    found in exercise by
the feeble-minded                 Hindoo, in a vigour and purity which
will surprise           those     who have never known the native cha-
rsc er but under the greatest disadvantages. On the Sunday,
the people, habited in their best apparel, repair to the parish
church, where the solemnity of their devotion in accom
panying the public prayers is truly impressive.   They sing
the old psalm tunes well ; and the voice of the full congre
gation may he heard at a distance.      Prayers being ended,
they listen to the sermon evidently with deep attention ; nor
have they any difficulty in understanding     for they almost   it,
all, both men             and women, can read their              Bible.    Many of
them take down the discourse on alias, that they may read
it afterwards to their families at home*.  As soon as the
  •   It   well known thai natives of Tanjore and Travancorc can write down
           is
what   isspoken deliberately, without losing one word.   They seldom look at
their olUu while writing, and can write in the dark with fluency.

on the palm-leaf is heard throughout the congregation.
Even the boys of the schools have their ollas in their hands ;
and may be seen after divine service reading them to their
mothers     as   they pass over the fields homewards.         This apti
tude   of   the people to receive and to record the words         of the
preacher renders it peculiarly         necessary   that   " the
                                                      priest's
lips should keep knowledge."    Upon   the whole, the  moral
conduct, upright dealing, decorous manners, and decent
dress of the native protestants of Tanjore, demonstrate the
powerful  influence and peculiar excellence of the Christian
religion. It ought however to be observed, that the Bible,
when the reading of it becomes general, has nearly the same
effect on the poor     of   every place.
  When the Syrian Christians understood that the proposed
Malayalim translation was to accord with the English Bible,
they desired to know on what authorities our translation
had been made   ; alleging, that they themselves possessed a
version of undoubted antiquity, namely, that used by the first
Christians at Antioch ; and that they could not depart from
the reading of that version. This observation led to the in
vestigation of the antient Syrio Chaldaic manuscripts in
Malayala ; and the inquiry has been successful beyond any
expectation that could have been formed.
   It had been commonly supposed that all the Syriac manu
scripts had been burned by the Romish church, at the synod
of Udiamper, near Cochin, in 1599;     but it now appear!
that the most valuable manuscripts were not destroyed : the
inquisitors condemned many books to the flames ; but they
saved the Bible.   They were content with ordering that the
Syriac scriptures should be amended agreeably to the read
ing of the Vulgate of Rome ; and these emendations now
appear in black ink, and of modern appearance,      though
made in 1599: but many Bibles and many other books were
not produced at all ; and the churches in the mountains re

 tween    the  inquisition    at Goa    and   the Christians    in the
 mountains.
    In  the acts  of  the   council of Nice, it is, recorded that
Joannes, bishop of India, signed his name at that council,
 A. D. 325. This date corresponds with the Syrian year
 636  ;  for the primitive Syrian church does not compute
 time from the Christian aera, but from Alexander the Great.
The Syriac version of       the Scriptures     was brought to    India,
according to the     belief of  the   Syrians, before the year 636     ;
and they allege that their copies         have ever been exact tran
scripts of that version, without known error, through every
age, down to this day.         There is no tradition among them
of the churches in the southern mountains having ever been
destroyed, or even molested.           Some of their present copies
are certainly of antient date       :  though written on a strong
thick paper, (like that of some MSS. in the British Museum,
commonly called Eastern paper,) the ink has, in several
places, eaten through the material in the exact form of the
letter. In other copies, where the ink had less of a corro
ding quality, it has fallen off, and left a dark vestige of the
letter, faint indeed, but not in general illegible.           There is
one volume found in a remote church of the mountains,
which merits particular description : — it contains the Old
and    New Testaments, engrossed on strong vellum, in large
folio, having three columns in the page, and is written with
beautiful accuracy.        The character is Estrangelo-Syriac,
and the     words  of   every book are numbered.         This volume
is illuminated,     but not after the European manner, the
initial letters having no ornament.            Prefixed to each book
there are figures   of principal Scripture characters (not rude
ly drawn),    the colours of which arc distinguishable;         and in
some places the enamel of the gilding is preserved : but the
volume has suffered injury from time or neglect, some of
the leaves being almost entirely decayed.            In certain places
the ink has been totally       obliterated from the page, and has
left the  parchment in     its natural whiteness;      but the letters
can, in general, be distinctly traced from the impress of the
pen, or from the partial corrosion of the ink.            The Syrian

church     assigns to this manuscript a high antiquity ; and
alleges   that  it has been for some centuries in the possession
of their bishops ; and that it was industriously concealed
from the Romish inquisition         in 1599   :    but its true age can
only be ascertained by a comparison with old manuscripts
in Europe of a similar kind. On the margin of the draw
ings are some old Roman           and Greek       letters, the form   of<
which may      lead to a conjecture respecting the age in which
they were written.       This copy of the Scriptures has admitted
as canonical the epistle of Clement, in which respect it re
sembles    the Alexandrine     manuscript   :   but it has omitted the
Revelations, — that book having         been accounted apocryphal
by some churches during a certain period in the early ages.
The order of the books of the Old and New Testament differs
from that of the European copies, — this copy adhering less
to unity of subject in the arrangement than to chronological
order.      The very first emendation of the Hebrew text pro
posed by     Dr. Kennicott (Gen. iv. 8.)         is to be found in this
manuscript.        The disputed passage in 1 John, v. 7, is not
to be found in it : that verse is interpolated in some other
copies in black ink, by the Romish church in 1599.
     Thus it appears, that during the dark ages of Europe,
 while ignorance and superstition in a manner denied the
 Scriptures of the rest of the world, the Bible found an asy
 lum in the mountains of Malavala; where it was revered
 and freely read by upwards      of  100 churches ; and thai it has
 been handed down to the present          time under circumstances
 so highly favourable to accurate preservation, as may justly
 entitle it to respect, in the collation of doubtful readings of
 the sacred text.
     There   are   many    old  Syriac manuscripts besides           the
 Bible, which have been well preserved : for the synod of
 Udiamper destroyed no volumes but those which treated of
 religious doctrine or church supremacy.             Two different cha
  racters of writing appear ever to have      been    in use among the
  Syrian Christians, the common Syriac and the Estrangelo.
  The oldest manuscripts are in the Estrangelo.
     But there are other antient documents in Malayala, not
  less interesting than the Syrian manuscripts.            The old Por
                                                                 tuguese

   tuguese historians relate, that soon after the arrival            of  their1
   countrymen in India, about three hundred years ago, the
   Syrian archbishop of Angamalee, by name Mar Jacob, de
   posited in the fort of Cochin, for safe custody, certain ta
   blets of brass; on which were engraven rights of nobility
  and other privileges, granted to the Christians              by a prince
  of    a   former age    ;   and   that   while these tablets were under
  the charge of the Portuguese, they had been unaccountably
  lost, and had never after been heard of. The loss of the                      ,
  tablets was        deeply regretted by the Christians ; and the
  Portuguese writer, Gouvea, ascribes their subsequent op
  pressions by the native powers to the circumstance of their
 being no longer able to produce their charter.                It is not ge
 nerally      known, that at a former period the Christians pos
 sessed regal       power in Malayala.          The name of their last
 king      was Beliarte.       He   died  without   issue ; and his king
 dom descended, by the custom of the country, to the king of
 Cochin. When Vasco de Gama was at Cochin, in 1 503,
 he saw the sceptre of the Christian king.
      It  is further recorded      by the same historians,      that besides
 the documents deposited            with  the Portuguese, the Christians
 possessed       three   other tablets,      containing    antient   grants,
 which they kept in their own custody,                and  that these were
 exhibited to the Romish archbishop              Menezes, at the church
 ofTevelecar,         near the mountains, in 1599, the inhabitants
having first exacted an oath from the archbishop," that he
would not remove them.                 Since that period little has been
heard      of  the tablets  :   though they are often referred to in
the Syrian writings, the translation itself has been lost.                  It
has been said that they were seen about forty years ago ; but
Adrian Moens, a governor of Cochin in 1"70, who pub
lished some account          of the Jews of Malabar, informs         us that
he used every means .in his power for many years to obtain
a sisrht of the Christian plates, and was at length satisfied
they were irrecoverably           lost, or rather, he adds, that they
never existed.
     The    learned   world will be gratified to know that all these
antient      tablets,  not only the three last mentioned exhibited
in 1 599, but those also (as is supposed) delivered by the
                                                                     Syrian

Syrian        archbishop                to     the Portuguese on their arrival            in
India, which                are the most antient,                 have been recently re
covered           by the exertions                  of lieutenant-colonel   Macaulay,
the      British resident in Travancore ;                         and are now officially
deposited with that officer.
  The plates are six in number:     they are composed of a
mixed metal             :        on the largest plate is thir
                            the engraved
                           page
teen inches long, bv about four broad.      They are closely
written : four of them on both sides of the plate, making in
all eleven  pages.   On the plate reputed to be the oldest,
there is writing perspicuously engraved in nail-headed or
triangular-headed letters, resembling the Persepolitan or
Babylonish.    On the same plate there is writing in another
character, which has no affinity with any existing character
in Hindostan . The grant on this plate appears to be wit
nessed  by four Jews of rank, whose names are distinctly
written in an old Hebrew character, resembling the alpha
bet called the Palmyrene ; and to each name is prefixed the
title of Magen              ;    that    is,   chief.
     It
      may              be doubted          whether there exists in the world
another document                      of equal antiquity, which   at the same
                                                                          is
time of so great   length and in such faultless preservation,
                                a
as the Christian tablets in Malayala.  The Jews of Cochin
indeed contest the palm of antiquity and of preservation                            ;   for
they also produce tablets containing privileges granted at                                a
remote period.   The Jewish tablets are two          number.                   in
The Jews were long in possession of        third plate, which     a
now appears to                      be the property          of   the Christians.       The
Jews commonly                       show an antient           Hebrew      translation    of
their plates.               Dr. Leyden              made another translation,       which'
differs from                and there has lately been found
                        the Hebrew              :
among the old   Dutch records at Cochin,   third translation,         a
which approaches nearer to Dr.Leyden's than to the Hebrew.
In   a   Hebrew manuscript, which will shortly be published,                              it

 and to transmit copies to the learned societies in             Hindostan
 and in Europe    :  for this purpose an engraver is now employed
 on the plates at Cochin.            The Christian and Jewish plates
 together   will  make     fourteen     pages.     A copy has been sent,
 in the first instance, to the pundits at the Shanscrit college
 at Trichiur, by direction of the rajah of Cochin.
    When the White            Jews at Cochin were questioned re
 specting the   antient copies of their Scriptures, they answered,
 that it had been usual to bury the old copy read in the sy
 nagogue, when decayed by time and use.                   This, however,
 does not appear to have been the practice of the Black Jews,
 who were the first settlers        ; for in the record-chests of their
 synagogues,     old   copies    of   the law have been discovered ;
 some of which are complete, and for the most part legible.
Neither could the Jews of Cochin produce any historical
 manuscripts     of consequence, their vicinity           to the sea-coast
having exposed their community to frequent revolution :
but many old writings have been found at the remote syna
 gogues of their antient enemies the Black Jews, situated at
Tritooa, Paroor, Chenotta, and Maleh, the last of which
places   is near    the mountains.         Amongst      these writings are
some    of great length, in Rabbinical              Hebrew ; but in so
antient    and uncommon           a   character,    that it will require
much time and labour to ascertain their contents.                    There
is one manuscript written in a character resembling the
Palmyrene Hebrew on the brass plates : but it is in a de
cayed state,    and    the   leaves adhere so closely to each other,
that it is doubtful whether it will be possible to unfold them
and preserve the reading.             It is sufficiently established by
the concurring evidence of written record and Jewish tra
dition, that the Black Jews had colonized on the coasts of
India long     before     the   Christian    aera.    There was another
colony at Rajapoor, in the Mahratta territory, which is not
yet extinct : and there are at this time Jewish soldiers and
Jewish native officers in the British service.              That these are
a remnant of the Jews of the first dispersion at the Baby
lonish captivity, seems highly probable. There are many other
tribes settled in Persia, Arabia, Northern India, Tartary,
and China,      whose respective places            of residence   may be
                                                                     easily

easily discovered.             The    places    which    have       been       already
ascertained  are sixty-five in number.   These tribes have in
general (particularly  those who have  passed the Indus) assi
milated much to the customs of the countries in which they
live ;    and   may sometimes be seen by                 a   traveller, without
being recognised as Jews. The very imperfect resemblance
of their countenance to the Jews of Europe, indicates that
thev have been   detached from the parent stock in Judea,
many ages  before  the race of Jews in the West. A fact cor-<
roborative of this          is,
                       that certain of these tribes do not call
themselves Jews,             but Beni-Israel        or Israelites       ;        for the
name     Jew    is   derived      from Judah   ;    whereas the ancestors               of
these tribes were not subject to the kings of Judah, but to
the kings of Israel.  They have in most places the book of
the Law, the book of Job, and the Psalms     but know little ;
of the Prophets. Some of them have even lost the book of
the Law, and only know that they are Israelites from tra
dition,    and from their observance             of peculiar rites.
   A     copy of     the Scriptures      belonging     to the Jews of the
East,     who might be supposed                to have   no communication
with the Jews in the West, has been long          desideratum       a
with Hebrew scholars. In the coffer of synagogue of the  a
Black Jews, in the interior of Malayala, there has been
found an old copy of the Law, written on       roll of leather.
                                                             is a
The  skins  are sewed  together, and the roll about   fifty feet
in length.       It in some places worn out, and the holes
                       is
have been patched with pieces of parchment.      Some of the
Jews suppose that this roll came originally from Senna, in
Arabia    ;others have heard that    was brought from Cash-
                                               it
mir. The Cabul Jews, who travel annually into the inte
rior of China, say, that in some synagogues the Law         still                 is
found written on         a   roll   of leather; not on vellum, but on
                                                         soft                     a
flexible leather, made of goats' skin, and dyed red    which                 ;
agrees with the description of the roll above mentioned.
   Such of the Syriac and Jewish manuscripts as may, on
 examination, be found to be valuable, will be deposited in
 the public libraries of the British universities.

stood that  a  copy  of any book in these catalogues will be
given when required.     The brahmins of Travancore con
sider that th^ir manuscripts are likely to have as just a claim
to high antiquity, or at least to accurate preservation, as
those in the temples in the North ; and for the same reason
that the Christian and Jewish records have been so well pre
served ; which              is,
                    that the country of Travancore, defended

cal gas ; and this I think may be safely concluded from the
following considerations : —
    1 . Upon briskly exciting the electrical machine,             a strong
sulphureous odour may be perceived. From whence can
this arise, except from the real presence            of sulphur, or some
incipient process of its formation ?
    2. In violent thunder-storms also, we frequently perceive
a  sulphureous smell.         This must undoubtedly either arise
from the electric fluid itself, or it must proceed from the
agency of that fluid on certain surrounding bodies.
    3. But sometimes upon such occasions real sulphur has
been produced.         In America, while a company was in a
room together,       a  violent   thunder-storm       came on ;    some   of
the persons present were even           lifted off their feet, and the
chamber windows          were    found covered with real sulphur.
Surely no one will affirm that this sulphur             was  originally in
a concrete state in the atmosphere.              What could    have raised
itfrom    the earth  ? for it does not sublime, as water evaporates,
at the     usual   temperature of the atmosphere. What could
have supported it in the air       ? or  Why should it never       descend
but in a'thunder-storm?            In short, it is     reasonable   to sup
pose that     it was formed    in  the air, and that the electric fluid
is one   of its component parts.
    4.  It is a well-known fact that            the sulphurets  of copper
and iron emit light in any gas, or even in a vacuum ; this is
also a distinguishing property of the electric fluid. And as
sulphur and this fluid are the only two substances in nature
which shine without the presence of oxygen, must we not
suppose that a strong analogy subsists between them ; or
even that they are the same substance differently modified
and combined ?
    5.  It   is a circumstance       worthy of attention,         that  Dr.
Priestley and other philosophers have strongly suspected the
electric fluid of possessing acid properties : in this respect
    Vol. 29. No. 115. Dec. 1807.                         Q                 it

242           On the probable Composition    of Sulphur.
U coincides with sulphuretted hydrogen, which without the
apparent presence of oxygen shows itself to be an acid, by
convertmg vegetable blues into red.
    6. The fumes of sulphur will whiten a red rose, and this
is also    a property of the electric spark.
    J. Dr. Priestley among his original experiments observes,
that    as  he was passing the electrical explosion over lead,      (I
believe, to form those curious circles which he first remarked)
he found some sulphur upon the lead.           This he attributes to
the disengagement of the sulphur contained in the ore. Yet
it would      be proper to repeat the same experiment with pure
lead, and observe if it be possible to procure the same result.
— Indeed I      am inclined to think, that the black grains men
tioned as being produced, when wire is melted by the elec
 tric explosion, have been too little examined.        Perhaps they
may     sometimes    be sulfhureis  or sulphuretted   oxides   of the
metal, instead       of being pure oxides,   as has been   generally
 supposed.
     In short, from the facts above stated,  I am led to conclude,
 that sulphur is probably a compound substance, contain
 ing the electric fluid as one of its principles, and perhaps
also some surrounding atmospherical substance or substances
as the other. By passing a strong spark through pure oxy
gen and other aerial fluids, or by experiments upon sulphur
itself with a particular view to this subject, we may hope
that its composition will be finally proved.
    As in the infancy of chemistry those gases passed unob
served, which the labours of Priestley have since proved to
be such general agents ; so perhaps in future years,         the gal
vanic,     electric, magnetic, and other subtle fluids may be
found equally universal in their operations.        Perhaps poste
 rity may find the electric fluid to be a component part of
all the simple combustibles.            Perhaps to its presence
 oxygen may owe its power of supporting combustion,
and     its acidifying   principle.  For as the electric fluid is
infinitely more subtle than oxygen, and seems to pos
sess the properties of combustion and acidity without the
apparent presence       of oxygen ; it  is more improbable       that
                                                          electricity

            Description of an improved Galvanic Trough.          248
  electricity should owe these qualities to the gas, than that
  oxygen should derive them from electricity.         Perhaps to this
  fluid, independent of oxygen, the muriatic acid may owe
  its acidity ; and as the electric fluid has been shown above to
  possess    the  quality of removing colour,      the muriatic acid
  may owe the same property, which it possesses, to this very
  active fluid. Perhaps, in fine, it may have a greater share in
  the formation of nitric acid than has been generally imagined.
 But passing by conjectures, which          the present generation
 has   little  hopes    of seeing verified, I shall come to a con
 clusion,     happy if the above hints should conduct some
 fortunate genius to open so wide a field of interesting and
 important discovery.           I am, sir, yours,

 XXXVI.         Description   of an Improved Galvanic       Trough.

                            To  Mr. Tilloch.
HS1Ri aving     experienced considerable inconvenience in the
 course of my galvanic experiments, with the emptying the
 troughs, and of correcting any defects as to the plates be
coming unsoldered, or the trough leaking; I have removed
those difficulties by the following construction upon the
principle of Volta's Couronne desTasses. — The box is form
ed as usual, but with a series of wooden partitions, in
place of the usual plates of metals, about half an inch
distant from each other, and well covered with cement ;
a piece of copper wire bent as Z, C, (fig. 3. Plate V.)
with a ring R soldered to it in a direction parallel to the
zinc and copper plates : the end Z is soldered to the zinc
plate, and the end C to the copper ; the ring is for the conve-
niency of passing a wire through, when the experiments are
concluded, so that all the plates may be raised at once from
the trough.      It is evident by this arrangement that we have a
power equal to the sum of both the zinc surfaces : allowing
for the loss sustained by the common method, from the part

covered        with cement, we should                 have a battery        composed
of 4-inch        plates   equal     to one composed     of 6-inch plates,
according to the construction                of Cruikshanks. The plates
in this arrangement can               easily    be     repaired, and         the acid
fluid may be left in the trough.

     N. B. It will
                 necessarily be understood that the bent wire
is to be placed on each partition, and the same order observed
as in other galvanic arrangements ; that a zinc plate soldered
to one bent wire shall be in the same cell with a copper plate
soldered to another bent wire,* and taking care that these
plates        arc not in contact with          each    other. This species of
galvanic arrangement may be seen at                     Mr. Eastwick s, 102,

    A  third character is taken from the breadth,        as well abso
lute as proportional, of the teeth, being much more con
siderable in the fossil elephant than in that of India.           We
may ascertain this by referring to the fifth column of my
table.     We there see that the fossil elephants have almost
all from 008 to 0-09 in breadth, and the teeth of the living
from 0 06 to 007.
    If these differences stood alone, perhaps they would not be
sufficient to establish a distinction or species ; but as they
agree with    the differences in the     jaws    and in the crania, as
we shall soon see, they become important.
    But are there none else in the fossil state but these teeth
with narrow laminae       ?
    I have mentioned a specimen already with broad laminae:
it was dugup near Porentrui,in the department of the Upper
Rhine. Without being very much altered, it is sufficiently
so to entitle it to the appellation of a true fossil.         Nine la
minae remain entire,        and  an uncertain     number    have been
carried off from behind.           These     nine laminae are thick,
much undulated, and occupy a space of 0"180 in length :
their breadth is still more considerable than in other
fossil teeth, being O.O9o.         This tooth must have belonged
to a very old elephant.
   M. Adrian       Camper speaks of three fragments of fossil
teeth,   which  he  has in his cabinet*, the laminae of which
are as broad as those in living elephants ; but we must
know whether      the teeth to    which    these fragments belonged
had numerous        or few laminae,      before we can institute a
comparison.
    M. Authenrieth      informs me that he law at Philadelphia
some     teeth, which, in his opinion, resembled much more
the African than the Asiatic elephant: but Mr. Barton po
sitively assures me that these were fresh teeth brought from
Africa. That which was engraved tor Mr. Drayton's work
upon Carolina, resembles the common fossil teeth ; and
those of which M. Humboldt brought over some fragments
from Mexico also resemble them, as well as those which
Mr.    Barton speaks of.

     M. Humboldt          indeed     says,     that he found near Santa Fe
  an immense quantity of' fossil elephant bones, as                     well   Afri
  can as      of  the Ohio species       ;   but  a   closer examination          has
  since shown, that all these bones were of                 a  particular species
  of mastodontus.
     It seems therefore clear, that beyond comparison                              the
  greatest number        of fossil elephants.         teeth have narrow lami

  covered are neither very important nor well authenticated.

  Varieties in the Size and Curvatures of the Tilths                        of Ele
    phants — Comparison of fossil Tusks with those                        of living
     Elephants.
                      a. Tusks of the living Species.
     Let    us now examine the varieties              of tusks,   and the differ-
  dices remarked in this respect among elephants.
     Their texture exhibits no important differences. It al
 ways presents upon its transverse section those streaks
 which       proceed   like an arc of       a  circle from the centre to the
 circumference,        and   form, in growing, curvilinear lozenges
which occupy the whole disk, and which are more or
 less broad, and more or less perceptible to the eye.                           This
 character^ common to all elephant ivory, and depending im
mediately upon the pores of their pulpy nucleus, is not to
be found in the tusks of any other animal.                       It is to be seen
in all fossil tusks,         and    it refutes the opinion of Leibnitz*j
adopted by some other writers, and even by Linnceusf, that
the mammoth horns might have belonged to the trichecus
rosmarus.          The     tusks    of    these     animals,    however,       seem
wholly composed of small round accumulated grains.
    The size of tusks varies according to the species,                        sexes,
and varieties ;        and as they arc growing all their lives, age
more than any thing else influences their dimensions.
    The African elephant,             as   far as we are able       to ascertain,
has     very large     tusks in both          sexes.     The African female,

sion, has larger tusks than any mala or female Indian ele
phant of the same size, that we are acquainted with.
   It is from Africa we receive the most ivory, and the
greatest      number        of tusks, and they              are   also harder and
whiter than any others.
  But our limited knowledge                   is.   confined to the elephants of
the Western         coasts,    and to those            of the South of Africa           :
we are ignorant     those of the Eastern shores resemble
                        if
them in every thing, and   there be any varieties in the in
                                      if
terior.
   We know from Pennant, however,                         that the coast        of Mo
zambique furnishes             tusks ten feet long,               being the largest
ever known.
   In   theIndian species there are more varieties, which Mr.
Corse develops with more care than any other writer*.
  In the first place, no female of this species has long tusks                          :
they have them small, and directed in        straight line        a
downwards, (this was very properly mentioned     Aristotlef                by
in a passage since improperly contradicted,) and some of
them are so short that they cannot be seen until the lips are
lifted up.
   Further,     there are several males which have not large tusks.
Tavernier says, that   the island of Ceylon
                               in                                     it  only the
                                                                           is
first born of each female which has tusksj.                            On the con
tinent of India they distinguish                    the dauntelah, or elephants
with long tusks     the mookna,
                        ;      which have very short ones.
The latter have them always straight. Wolfs, who travelled
much in Ceylon, says, also, that there are several males in
that island without tusks, and that they are named majanis§.
   Among the dauntelah they again distinguish, according
to Corse, the pullung dauntelah, the tusks of which are                               di
rected almost horizontally     and the puttel dauntelah, in
                                       ;
which they are directed straight downwards.   Between these
two extremes there are several intermediate, and they have
also given names to individuals in which one tusk differs
from the other, or which               have only one.             But all these va

rieties have nothing constant, and are mixed indiscriminate
ly with each other. We find them together in the same herds.
     In Bengal the tusks weigh little more than seventy-
two pounds, and they do not exceed fifty in the province of
Tipperah, which produces the best elephants.                           There are
tusks in London, however, probably from Pegu, which
weigh       150 pounds.           It is in fact from Pegu, and from
Cochin-China, that the largest elephants and tusks of the
Indian species come. The coast of Malabar furnishes no
tusks, according to Pennant, more than four feet long.
     I have drawn up the following table of the length, diame
ter, and weight of the largest tusks, taken from other
authors, or actually inspected by myself.
     The tusks from Africa are not distinguished                       here from
those     of India,     and there       is not all      the accuracy we could
wish in the kinds of measures employed.

       As     the tusks grow         during the life of the animal,             and the
   body does not, the size of an elephant cannot be concluded
   from its tusks, even by establishing the proportion between
   individuals of one same variety and the same sex: as, on
   thcother hand, ihe tusks rot, or break at their points, accord
   ing to the greater or less use the animal makes of them ; and
   they are sharpened more or less abruptly into a point, we
   cannot conclude their length from the diameter at their
   base.
        Finally, their weight cannot               be concluded from           their di
   mensions,            (Messerschmidt in the Philosophical Transac
    tions,) because thdr cavity at the base may be more or less
    filled.
        The     degree      of curvature of      the   tusks of elephants varies
    almost as much as their size.                     We have seen above the
    most common differences in this respect among the Indian
    elephants,           In various cabinets there are several tusks to be
                                                                                      seen

 seen with curvatures           more or less strange, and in particular
 some are spiral.          Camper saw several of ihem in the British
 Museum*,           and    Grew      represents    one   f   which    is    turned
 round several times          ;  and     I  know     from    M. Fabroni, that
 there is one       of this description in the Florence cabinet also.
 They are      frequently seen in the form of the Italic S, &.c.
                                 I.   Fossil Tusks.
    It is   impossible to ascertam          if there   have been among fos
sil elephants the same differences as among those of India,
with    respect to the tusks of the different sexes, and different
varieties, since fossil tusks are generally found separate, and
a sufficient number of heads has never been found to entitle
us to say      if  there   were     ever any adults without long            tusks.
We     are equally little enabled          to ascertain    the limits   of fossil
tusks      in point of smallness.              The small-sized tusks have
been little sought alter, having excited less attention amongst
the workmen.
    We       are perfectly      well   acquainted, however,          with     their
limits in point of size           :  the large ones have never been neg
lected, and those who have described                 them have never been
tempted to diminish their volume.
    I have drawn up a table of the largest fossil tusks, the di
mensions of which have been given.                        From this we may
see that they do not much surpass those of living elephants,
at least     of  the  African    species.
    It may be further remarked, that if elephants were allowed
to  live     their natural age in forests, without being hunted,
their tusks, growing during their whole life, would acquire
a size much more considerable than they generally have.

  '454           Memoir   upon liv'ing   andfossil Elephants.
     As   to the texture, we have seen a little before, that it is ab
  solutely the same in all the species, and the tusks of the mas-
  todontus are not distinguished in this respect from those of ele
  phants. It only remains therefore to compare their curvature.
     Several fossil tusks have only one very common curva
  ture : such are the tusks in our Museum.
     But   there is   a sufficient   number of them, the curvature
 of which      is much greater    than we see in the tusks of living
 elephants.        The  shape approaches a semicircle,        or the half
 of   an ellipsis divided by its small axis.
     There are four fossil       tusks described     : — that of Messer-
 schmidt, in the Philosophical Transactions ; that in theStras-
 burg cathedral, according to Herman ; that of the church of
 Halle, in Suabia, according to Hoffman and Beyschag ; and
 that    of the cabinet of Stutgardt, according to Authenrieth
 and Secgcr.       This striking resemblance of four of the most
 entire fossil tusks we know, in a point which distinguishes
 them from the tusks of living elephants, is worthy of remark.
    Some have thought of making a distinct character from
 this circumstance : but it may be easily inferred, that this
 great curvature depends only upon the length               of the tusks,
 where this circumstance has been remarked.
    The part of      the tusks once made being no longer subject
to change, each increase in length will also be an augmenta
tion in the number of the degrees of the arc it describes.
    It  is thus that the incisor teeth     of hares, when the opposite
ones are broken,       curl up into a spiral direction.
    It is proper, however, to observe, that a tusk from Africa,
in our Museum, although six feet long, is by no means so
crooked as the four we have quoted. —There are also some
fossil teeth turned like a still-worm, as we see in living ele
phants.       Pallas quotes one from the Petersburgh cabinet*.
There is one also, but less twisted, in the Stockholm cabinet,
of which M. Ouensel sent me a drawing.
    Thus tusks can establish            no certain character, either
among the living species, or between the latter and the fossil
specie*.

             XXXIX. Life nf the Duke de Chaulnes.
 .Michael Ferdinand d'Albert d'Ailly, duke                           de
 Chaulnes,     peer  of France, lieutenant-general of        the king's
 armies, his     majesty's governor        and   lieutenant-general of
 the province of Picardy, and reconquered countries, Artois,
 &c, was born at Paris in 1714. We shall here only
 consider the duke de Chaulnes          as   a   man of science, and
  relatively  to  the  arts which    he    cultivated   with  so much
  success  ; taking our principal      traits from the     very elegant
  life of this nobleman, given by M.          de  Fouchy, one of the
 most celebrated members of the Academy of Sciences. .
     After a long series of military services, which obtained
 him the most distinguished honours from a just and bene
 ficent sovereign, the duke de Chaulnes retired, and dedicated
 the whole     of his leisure to the cultivation of the arts and
 sciences, for which his mind was eminently qualified by
 peculiar talents. He procured a very large collection of
 scientific books, of instruments for making experiments
 in natural philosophy and mechanics ; he arranged a most
 extensive cabinet of the subjects of natural history ; and he
 built himself a laboratory to enlarge this collection by a
 number of his own inventions, which were daily produced by
 his fertile mind.     He applied himself with great assiduity to
 dioptrics, and the improvement of mathematical instruments,
.especially those which belong more particularly to astronomy.
     In 1755 he published n Memoir, which contains experi
 ments relative to an article in the beginning of the fourth
 book of Newton's      Optic3.
     The  great   English philosopher       had    remarked, that in a
                                                                   dark

dark room,       if               of light from the sun in the
                      we receive a ray
axis   of   glass,
            a      concave o^ one   side, convex on the other,
and silvered on the convex side, this ray would necessarily
be reflected on itself; but that if we opposed to the reflected
ray a white paper or pasteboard pierced in the middle to let
the direct ray pass through, the opening in the paper would
be circumscribed by four or five coloured rings.                      The dnke
de Chaulnes,  in repeating this experiment, found, by a most
fortunate chance, that when we dull the fore surface of the
glass by breathing on it from above, the rings, so far from
losing their distinctness, become more brilliant than before.
Nothing further was necessary to raise his curiosity.     He
first thought to render this effect permanent, by substituting
for the breath some water mixed with a little milk to dull
the glass   ;   and he varied the experiment in so many different
ways, that at last  he" discovered the cause of this singular
phenomenon to proceed 'from inflection; that        from the        is,
•property which rays of light have of bending at the ap
 proach of solid bodies. He found that the breath and the
water mixed with            milk formed        a   kind of round net work,
Vvbich produced the appearance                 of coloured rings     ;that, by
substituting for this kind of covering                 a   clear muslin, there
are obtained, instead of rings, coloured squares or chequers                 :
and that parallel threads give bands or belts. In short, he
made such good use            of this happy fiance, that Newton's
experiment became in his hands an object altogether new,
and far more interesting than had hitherto been.
                                          it
   Whilst       the   duke de Chaulnes             was amusing himself    with
his dioptric experiments and improvements, he applied
himself to another object equally important      this was the  :
perfecting of astronomical instruments, or, to propose the
problem in its fullest extent, the art of producing from in
struments of          a   very small radius, an equal degree of accu
racy at least     with     that obtained from those of   considerable
                                                                a
radius, such  as were then commonly used.       This problem,
on account of its difficulty, might till then have been ranked
with those of the trisection of an angle, and the quadrature
of the circle but experience has proved to \K that he was
                 •,
 fully competent to resolve         i'.

204                    Life of t lie Duke          de   Cliaulnes.
   The duke de Chaulnes, in 1755, gave the world a me
moir which contained the principles of this discovery. He
first thought to apply the motion of an endless screw, to
obtain these minute divisions.      The screw made of steel
-would itself mark- the widths of the worm on the edge of the
limb to be divided; and these marks, which ought to be
perfectly equal, he thought might be regulated by means of
an index;         and hence the smallest parts would become                          accu
rately obtained by means             of   very fine           and truly      equal    sub
divisions.
     Who would not conceive, with him, but                            that a division
made in this manner was exact                  ?        Could    we   suppose        there
would        be   any inequalities in a small number of steps of
snch     a   screw   made with care, and in those of the same
species of screw all marked with the same worm ?         The
dukede Chaulnes, nevertheless, found by experience that no
confidence whatever is to be placed in this method : the un
equal hardness         and expansion           of   the particles     of     steel in the
screw, and        of   the brass in the instrument,                renders the steps
of    the one unequal to those            of   the      other.     Whence it fol
lows     that     this method   of dividing instruments cannot be
depended on, and           that we must determine bv observation
the value of each part of        a    micrometer, and not content our
selves  by measuring the whble, or a large portion of its
course depending for the intermediate divisions on the
equality of the worm of the screw, as \$ commonly done.
This is      a new source      of error, for  discovery of which
                                                        the
%ve   are indebted      to the duke de Chaulnes, and which may
alter the most important and best made observations.
      It now      became    necessary       to try other methods. The
duke de Chaulnes had found for                a long time, that by apply
ing a micrometer to a microscope he could measure aceu-
lately as far as the four thousandth part of a line. It w&s
on this truly ingenious principle, that he, first of any one,
undertook to give the division of astronomical instruments
a greater degree of accuracy than they were hitherto thought
capable      of receiving. We cannot                    here follow       him through
the whole      of his contrivances : all                we can say     is,   that never
was anv       principle    applied    with          more address,          and we are
                                                                             astonished,

  astonished, in reading this work, at the resources with which
  his genius furnished him, and the sagacity with which he
  profited by an infinity of circumstances, that probably would
  have escaped other persons.         The fruit of so much labour
  and    attention   was   the  production of an instrument eleven
  inches radius furnished with achromatic telescopes, the ac
  curacy of which was so great, that, when compared with
   two excellent quadrants of six-feet radius in measuring sol
   stitial meridian altitudes of the Sun and Arcturus, the same
   precision was obtained as with them. This trial was the
   strongest and most certain proof of its excellence to which
   it could have been submitted.
       Not only    did he give his instrument the degree of ac
   curacy    which    we have just spoken of, but he also con*
   trived means of rendering all others equally as exact that
   might hereafter be made, by a large platform, which he pro
   posed to construct on this principle, and which was, if we
   may use the expression, to serve in future instead of an
   able artist.    We leave men of science to judge whether the
   duke de Chaulnes has not completely resolved this difficult
    problem, and likewise to appreciate the degree of gratitude
    due to him for this discovery, so valuable to all the mathe
    matical and astronomical world.          This entirely new art, the
    principles of which he had given, as before observed, in
    1765, have     since been     published in greater detail in 176&,
    in the description of the arts published by the academy.
       Every thing that the duke de Chaulnes did with regard to
    the construction      of astronomical instruments, proved to
    him the great utility of achromatic telescopes.           This was a
    sufficient inducement for him to endeavour to improve them,
    and he gave the public a MemoiPy-in-which he details his
    ideas on the subject.
        We   are astonished,   in reading this work,     at the inventive
     powers of his genius, in contriving methods for determining
.    quantities, which, to superficial observers, appear not
     worthy of notice* The same microscopes which before
     served for dividing his instruments are here again found
     useful,   but employed       in a   very  different   manner,    and
                                                                 mounted

 266                Life of the Duke    de Chautnesi
mounted on      a kind of micrometers, which      measure the m6~
 tion of th£ instrument to the four hundredth part of a line*
 It was by the help of these microscopes and several other
ingenious instruments, that he measured the exact degree
of refrangibility    of different kinds of glass; the convex and
concave curvature of all the pieces of an object glass without
separating them from each other. This singular problem
appears at first sight     impossible to resolve,   or to determine
even with any degree       of precision when  the curvature   of the
glass which is to correct the aberration of refrangibility,      and
destroy the colours, is such as it ought to be.
    These discoveries were followed by the invention of a new
parallactic instrument more firm and convenient than those:
already m use, by several reflections on the manner of ap
plying the micrometer to these telescopes, and to measure
accurately the value of the parts of this instrument.            For
•this purpose   he used a wall, which, that it might be seen
from a distance, had the singular property of presenting to
the observer thick strokes, by means of which he could
measure very small intervals. This Memoir shines through
out with the genius of the inventor, and cannot be read
without admiring his contrivances to avoid difficulties, which
at the  first glance appear insurmountable.          Unfortunately
this was his last work, and it makes us greatly regret that
others which he proposed to execute on this subject, were
prevented    from being finished by his death.
    The duke de Chaulnes's disposition was of the most
amiable kind : the mildness from which it proceeded was
ornamented by the greatest politeness, and he could scarcely
reckon any but friends among all those with whom he lived.
The king himself was well acquainted with his zeal and his
merit, and often showed him the strongest marks of that
kindness which gives pleasure to a good subject and happi
ness to a gentleman of the court.         From his elevated situa
tion one would suppose he was out of the reach of chagrin
and reverses, but he experienced some of the most unplea
sant ones for a considerable time.         He however opposed to
them the constancy prescribed         by philosophy,    and the pa

long with impunity against such enemies to health, and his
constitution, although strong, at last gave way.
    He died the 23d of September, 1769, in less than five
hours,     of  a death    that perhaps may be called sudden, but
which     was    certainly not unforeseen, as he put his worldly
affairs   in order some days before, and received the sacra
ment with those unfeigned sentiments of religion and piety
which had always been the rule of his conduct.

     Mrs. R.     £et. 49, first applied for surgical assistance on
 the 30th of      July 1806, for      a disease in her breast, which
 proved to be a confirmed cancer.             About eighteen months
 preceding the above date she discovered a tumour in the left
 breast,    which     was   hard, and   attended    with acute darting
 pains at irregular        intervals, but not such     as to prevent her
 from attending her domestic concerns.                The breast, now,
  was not much enlarged, but ulcerated on the left side near
 the nipple, the skin was puckered, and adhered firmly to
 the diseased      part  of   the gland :   the discharge was ichorous
 and profuse, and produced extensive inflammation of the
  integuments on which it ran : the pain was much increased?
  the glands in the axilla were enlarged and indurated, and a
  general    debility pervaded the whole system. The disease
  being    too  far advanced to admit of its being removed by an
  operation, the ferri rubigo was given in moderate doses : the
                        4                                      .    ulcer

  26S        Surgiccd Cases in (tie Flnslury Dispensary.
  ulcer was dressed with the ung. sabinae for some days, then
  with the ung. arsenicum ; neither of which produced the
  least effect.     A  small blister was then applied between the
 ulcer and the axilla, and repeated for fourteen successive
 days ; the pain from which was very trivial, and the darting
 pain,    which had been very Severe in the beginning, was
 nearly subsided, the appetite was much improved^ and her
 health and spirits were greatly recruited;
     The old ulcer, and that produced by the blister^ were
 dressed      with   the   ung. sabinae, and the thin         ichorous
 discharge      was   now succeeded by well digested          purulent
 matter.
     At  the beginning     of September    a small blister was applied
 from the ulcerated       part nearest the axilla, around the upper*
 part of   the breast,    nearly to the sternum, and repeated for
 many days, so as       to form an ulcerated surface about an inch'
 wide.     That part of this new ulcer between the breast and
 the axilla was dressed with the ung. arsen. cum pulv. bpii,
 the upper part with the. ung. sabinae.          The sloughs occa
 sioned by the caustic were trivial, and the pain inconsidera
 ble, but a free discharge of purulent matter continued from
 every part     of the ulcer.
     On the 8th      of September     she   caught cold, and had at
 troublesome cough with pain in the chest, which was" re
 lieved much by taking a few doses of the lac ammon. cum
 tiuct.   scillae.
    The caustic dressing      was applied about every       other day,
 sometimes to one and sometimes to another part of the ulcer,
 and the whole covered with the ung. sabinae.             This was at
 tended with very little pain,      and the health      of the patient
 was much improved.. The scirrhous tumour appeared to
 enlarge at the upper part till about the middle of October,
when it became stationary, and was greatly diminished in
 size by the beginning of November.
    The ulcer was now dressed with the ung. sabince alone.
The discharge was good, and the breast entirely free from
pain.      Some alterative powders, composed of hydrarg. cum
,sulph. with nitre, were given, and a,ne of the following pills
was ordered to be taken even- nis,ht.   =r

     This treatment was continued, with very little variation,
till February 1807, with evident advantage, the health being
completely reinstated : nb pain was experienced                     in the
diseased part, which was greatly reduced in size, so as to
be much smaller than the other breast,
     The ferri rubigo was again given for some weeks, then
the above powders, and occasionally the pill at night, the
ulcer being dressed with the ung. sabiriae the whole time.
With this mode of treatment every thing appeared in the
 most favourable         light, till the beginning of September,
 when the breast was nearly reduced to a plain surface, and
 the ulcer was exceedingly small, without the least pain hav
 ing   been experienced therein for        many months         :  the dis
 charge was much reduced in quantity, and continued well
 digested purulent matter.
      She had now a troublesome cough, with pains appareatly
  rheumatic      in her limbs ; these did not yield to the usual re-»
 'medics, and she lost strength fast, so that in the beginning
  of October     she was nearly confined to her room.
      October the 17th, on removing her from the bed to the
  chair, the left thigh bone gave way, without any fall or vio
  lence, and the left arm became bent above the elbow, pro-.
  ducing exactly the appearance represented in the Philosophi
   cal Transactions in the case of Elizabeth Quenot of Paris,
   who died of mollities ossium.            In this state she did not
   experience much pain, when lying still, either from the
   thigh or arm, but the least motion increased her sufferings
   exceedingly.       The breast remained perfectly easy, and the
   discharge continued as before. The left arm now became
   cedematous, her appetite declined, and she died extremely re
   duced on the fourth of November 1807,                                 i

   *' The design of M. Haiiy," as the translator observes, <cin
composing this work, was not to produce a compilation of
earlier performances, a collection of insulated dissertations,
in which every former theory shall be exhibited, but none
exammed      ;  it was rather to give a cast of unity to this de
partment of human knowledge, to present Natural Philosophy
though in an abridged, yet in a complete form, to free it
from a great number of superfluities with which it had been
overcharged, and to develop scarcely any but theories now
solidly   established,      though    perhaps previously      contested,
that he might be the better able to place Physics in the situa
tion it ought to occupy, by assigning their due portions to
the comparatively recent branches of Magnetism, Electricity,
Galvanism,       Crystallography, 8cc, and by enlarging those
boundaries which some modern authors seem to have esta
blished upon too narrow a space."
    The object which Mr. Gregory had in view in the Trans
lation, was, by giving this work in the same form as his own
treatises   on     Astronomy       and   Mechanics,     to  complete a
course of Natural Philosophy.             He has not, however, con
fined himself to a bare translation, but has given many valu
able notes, which add considerably to the usefulness of the
work.
    Mr. Gregory      has done justice to the author in his transla
tion, and     has, we    think,   rendered a service to the public, by
giving, in an English           dress, a work written professedly for
the use of the French National             Lycaeum, in conjunction
with Biot*s Elementary           Treatise on Physical Astronomy,
and Francceur's Elements           of Mechanics.
    The work      seems to be well adapted fo        the purpose it was
intended to answer, and has less irrelevant verbiage than is
generally to be met with in French works on Physics.                It is
not, however, entirely free from this fault        :  the following  ex
                                                                ordium,

                     as an example:
     "      having elucidated the properties of the liquid

is blended with that which the science inspires of itself, to
iolicit us towards the study of this fluid in the midst of       ;
which we are continually immersed, which acts upon us in
io many different ways, and to which we are indebted both
for the preservation         of life,   and for        furnishing
                                                        one                us with

words which are their symbols."
 A        translator of     Mr. Gregory's acknowledged reputation
might certainly have taken upon him to retrench such exu
berances, without stepping beyond his province.   But, as
we have already stated, the work   other respects

    System      of Gesture-sigJis       for     the  Deafly- Dumb.         By
   J.  M. Weinberger.
    This tract    is in the German language,            and M. Weinber
ger,  as  far   as we  know,     is the   first  of  his  countrymen who
has devoted       his attention to the study          of that science, by
which Messrs. Sicard          and   L'Epee    have rendered      their names
sacred     to   every   friend    of humanity.           M.   Weinberger's
labours, however,         deserve a higher title than that of im
provements upon            the systems        of his predecessors.         He
first sets out with an attempt to simplify the mode of con
veying ideas and language between the deaflv-dumb.                         He
discusses the most remarkable methods that have been pro
 posed for gesture, language, and emblematical writing, and
 concludes by giving a hand alphabet of his own invention.
 This new system gready excels the finger talk at present
 adopted, in so far as it requires the use of one hand alone ;
 and the characters arc so contrived as to be capable                 of  suc
 ceeding each other with great rapidity.
    M.   Weinberger       seems to have been          extremelv successful
 in his practice     as a teacher    of  the deafly-dumb       in Germany ;
 and in his work he has detailed the results of some public
 examinations of his pupils, who displayed great proficiency.

coction of madder was injected into the stomach, in the
same manner as the indigo ; but this not answering the pur
pose, rhubarb was substituted, in consequence of its extreme
sensibility to alkali.     This experiment succeeded, and the
 cardiac portion of the stomach, with a ligature on the py
 lorus, communicated the rhubarb to a kind of plexus in the
 spleen, and thence to the bladder. The application of alkali
 1o  the urine immediately discovered the presence of the
 rhubarb, but none appeared by the same means in the liver :
 hence it was inferred, that the spleen assists in secretion, as
 well as in assimilating the nutriment.
    On the 30th of November       the Society held their anniver
 sary   meeting  ;  when the president delivered with the Cop-
 leyan medal,   as usual, a very eloquent address to Mr. Home,
 taking a brief but perspicuous retrospect of the philosophi
 cal labours and discoveries in physiology of that gentleman,
 from the commencement of his professional career, as the
 relation and successor of the late Mr. J. Hunter in 1785, to
 the present period.      In the course of the learned President's
 review of the relative importance of this Fellow's numerous
 communications,       he took occasion to contrast     the  general
 estimation of theTransactions of the Royal Society of London,
 which are produced and supported by the voluntary contri
 butions of its individual members, with those of other nations,
 where they are supported by considerable revenues drawn
 from the state.     This comparison was not a little flattering to
 the talents  and  spirit of Englishmen, and to their disinter
 ested love of science.
    The Society then      proceeded  to the choice  of  the council
 and officers for the ensuing year ; when the       following   gen
 tlemen were elected of the council :
    Of the old council —The Right Honourable            Sir Joseph
 Banks, Bart. K. B. ; sir Charles Blagden,         knight; Henry

esq. Secretaries.
   Dec.    10.  The President in the chair. The minutes of the
proceedings of the anniversary, the amount of the receipts
and disbursements, and lists of members dead and new ones
elected   during the last year, were laid before the Society ;
after which a mathematical paper, by Mr. Woodhouse, on
the form of the teeth of wheels, was read.                In this paper
the author      proposed to unite the method of epicycloidal
curves, invented by De la Hire, and improved by Camus,
with the analytical method proposed by              Euler, in order    to
reduce them to general practice.
   Dec.   17.   The President in     the chair.     The Croonian Lec
ture, by Mr. Carlisle, on the nature and chemical qualities
of the muscles, and natural history of muscular motion,
was read.      Mr. C. began by taking a physiological view of
the circulation    of the blood,  and   of the influence   of the nerves,
so far as they operate on the muscular           fibre.   He then no
ticed the existence of an oxide of iron discovered in the red
globules   of  the blood,  which     he considered as materially      in
fluencing the muscular fibre, and the healthful state of the
animal oeconomy; and proceeded to relate the results of nu
merous experiments on vegetable and animal substances, in
all of which he found an oxide of iron, as in peas, yolks of
eggs, bile, urine, &c.        The yolks of eggs he discovered to
be   entirely composed of a fatty oil and an oxide of iron ;
but his experiments on the nature of the muscular fibre are
not yet iu   a state to be   laid before the Society.
   Dec. 24.       The President in the chair. A paper,           by  Mr.
Smithson, on quadruple         and binary compounds, particularly
the sulphurets, was read.         The author seemed to doubt the
propriety of the distinction, or rather the existence, of qua
druple compounds,        believed    that only two substances       could
                                S  2                                enter

  enter  as elements   in the composition of one body, and con
  tended that in cases of quadruple compounds,               a new and
  very different substance was formed, which had very little
  relation to the radical or elementary principles of which it
  was believed to be composed.         This opinion he supported
  by reference to the sulphurets of lead (galena) and of anti
  mony,     and to the facts developed by crystallography.        In the
  latter science he took occasion to correct and confirm           some
  remarks of his in the Transactions         for   1804,   on different
  crystals, which he acknowledged          have     not hitherto    been
  found in nature.
     In consequence of the Christmas holidays, the Society
  adjourned till Monday the 14th of January 1608.
                     SOCIETY    OF   ANTiaUARIKS.
     Mr. S. Lysons laid before this Society         some    curious ex
  tracts from the antient records, containing           directions to a
  bailiff for the management of land, aud also         a recommenda
  tion  of oxen in   preference   to  horses   for agricultural pur
  poses,   written in the reign of Edward      III.
     Mr. R Smirke, in a letter to sir H. C. Englefield, bart.
 gave an account of his observations on the substances used
 as colouring in the paintings found in Saint Stephen's.              It
 appeared to Mr. Smirke, that oil had been used as a varnish
 for these paintings    ; and as they were executed        prior to the
 supposed period of the discovery of       oil painting in 1410, it
 was inferred that this art may have been          of English origin.
 This is the more probable, since several English words exist,
 even since the beginning of the 11th century, in which,
 among the articles of the materia picloria, is enumerated oil
 for the painting of public edifices. Hence it was extremely
 probable, that, as oil was used, it was at least combined with
 some one colour, in this country, nearly a century before the
reputed aera of the discovery of oil painting. Of some of the
 colours in these paintings, which are now completely en
closed from the view by the new improvements, the compo
sition could not be determined.

    On   the 21st    of November         a meeting   of  the    com
mittee of directors of the British Institution was held at
the Gallery in Pall-mall, for the purpose of adjudging the
premiums offered for ihe three best companions to pictures
selected from the works of the old masters. — The following
was the decision    :
    To Mr. Pocock, jun. the premium of one hundred pounds
for his picture of " Archbishop Becket's Insolent Visit to
the Palace of Henry the Second, with the Intention                 of
excommunicating that Monarch."             Painted as a companion
to Mr. Angerstein's " Theodosius" by Vandyke. —To Mr.
James Green the premium of sixty pounds, for his picture
of " Gadshill and the Carriers ;""rrom the second act of the
first part of Shakespeare's Henry the Fourth.          Painted as a
companion to Mr. Buncombe's ""Candlelight" by Rubens. —
To miss Reinaglc         the  premium of forty pounds, for her
"   Landscape with Banditti."         Painted as a companion to
lord Grantham's        "   Mercury and Admetus" by Salvator
Rosa.                                                        ,
   The stimulus thus      afforded  not only to»those artists who
have been so deservedly successful, but also to their less for
tunate competitors (among whom are several who have pro
duced works of considerable merit), will doubtlessly be
evinced in their future performances.        Indeed, we confidently
anticipate that the governors of the British Institution, if
they pursue the liberal line of conduct that they have hither
to adopted, will ultimately enjoy the satisfaction of bring
ing the arts to' a state more nearly approximating to perfec
tion, than they have ever yet arrived to in this country.

   Medicine, which is nothing eke than the application of
the laws of the animal ceconomy to the cure of diseases, has
lately made one of its most important discoveries, viz. Vac
cination. Its preservative properties are at present sufficiently
demonstrated ; but observations are still wanting,         as to the

modificationsof which it is susceptible.     M. Hall£ has
communicated to the Institute some very interesting observa
tions upon the irregularities which the vaccine inoculation
has undergone at Lucca in the course of 1806.
  These differences did not affect the progress, the periods,
nor the essential characters of the vaccine eruption.
     They   were manifested in the form             of the pimple, which, by
extending and confounding itself with some small pustules
round the principal one, lost both its regular form and the
umbilical depression, which it presented at the moment of
its formation.
   In the nature of the crust which succeeds the pustule,
the latter had not the brown shining colour of the crust of
the common vaccine ; it was irregular in its form, like the
pimple  which had given birth to                it,
                                      and left in the skin                  a
hollow, which afterwards filled up completely.
  Finally, eruptions   pustules over the whole body were
                             of
seen at the moment the areola wasiformed around the                     prin
cipal button.
   These irregularities were epidemical throughont the whole
territory of Lucca.
   The counter proofs made             by     small pox-inoculation     upon
individuals      who had exhibited     irregular symptoms of
                                            these
vaccine, demonstrated that their irregularity had in no mea
sure altered  the preservative properties of vaccine.
     The third branch of natural history, that which                 treats of
minerals, has been recently enriched with                3   most interesting
fact.
     M. Vauquelin      has  discovered the presence of platina in
the famous silver mines       of Guadalcanal in Est'remadura.
     This   metal   had only been found      Peru hitherto, where
                                                    in
it   is   combined    with   a    multiplicity of different      substances.
In      those   of Guadalcanal,  alloyed with silver, copper,
                                    it   is
antimony,  iron, arsenic,  kail and  sulphur.     sometimes    It
forms   tenth of the mass.
          a
     The
      same chemist has made some very important experi
ments upon the refining of iron ores.
  France, although poor with respect to precious metals,
 ompensates for this deficiency in the quantity of fine iron               ;
                                                                          but

but we know equally well how much this metal differs iti
goodness, according to the mines from which it comes, and
the forges in which it is wrought.
    M. Vauquelin, in order to discover the causes of these
differences, has begun to analyse with great exactitude the
minerals and fluxes generally exposed to the furnace, and the
scoriae or other matters which are separated from it.
    He found in the scaly iron ores of Burgundy and Tranche
Comte, besides oxide of iron, silex, alumine, lime, oxidated
manganese, phosphoric acid, magnesia and chromic acid.
A part of these substances remains in the flux, and they are
ever found in the best refined iron, although the greater
quantity passes into scoriae, and those substances         which are
sublimed in the furnaces.
    It is to the remains of chrome,        phosphorus, and manga
nese, that M. Vauquelin         attributes the bad qualities of cer
tain kinds of iron which are brittle both when hot or cold ;
and all the attention of forge- masters should be directed to
free their metal from these noxious substances.
    Besides these useful remarks, M. Vauquelin has made a
very curious one: viz. that this composition, whether in ores
or particularly in the sublimate of furnaces, resembles much
that of meteoric stones. Nothing but nickel is to be found
in   the latter.   As  all those substances     which   are sublimed
do not remain in the flue of the furnace, and some are with
out doubt elevated into the air, he thinks it not improbable
 that these substances enter into the composition of meteoric
 stones : the only difficulty would be, to ascertain how sub
limed metals      could unite in the atmosphere in such large
masses as we find.
    This subject of iron    ores has been treated in another point
 of view by      Mess.  Descostils    and Hassenfratz in the Me
moir under the title of Spathic Iron. (See Phil. Mag. vol.
 xxv.)     These ores are more or less fusible, and furnish iron
 of various qualities. M. Descostils thinks that the difficulty
 of melting    some  of them is owing        to the  magnesia which
 enters into their composition.        All the infusible spathic irons
 he has analysed     furnished him with this earth j and having
                                    S 4                         added

9BO                French National Institute.
added a portion    of it  to some    specimens fusible by them
selves,  he deprived    them    of this property. From this he
xplains the effect of     the exposure to air and      humidity, in
order to facilitate the flux of these minerals:      this must hap
pen, because there is some sulphuric acid, which dissolves
the magnesia, formed by the decomposition of the pyrites.
M. Hassenfratz, however, disputes this theory, and asserts
that he has seen infusible spathic iron ores, although they
contained no magnesia.         He thinks that exposure to the air
can only destroy the cohesion of the mineral.              We shall
give an account     of  the judgment,     when   it is  pronounced,
upon this interesting question in metallurgy.
    M. Lelievre has described a mineral, which has been also
mistaken for a spathic iron, and which was found to contain
more than one halt of oxide of manganese combined with
nearly one third of carbonic acid, and only 00'8 of iron and
O0'2 and a half of lime.        It is therefore a carbonated man
ganese, a new species in this genus.
    The same mineralogist has described a stone, which he
 discovered in the island Elba. It contains more than half
 its weight in oxide of iron, and a little oxide of manganese.
 The rest is formed of silex and lime. Its crystalline nucleus
 is a prism with a rhomboidal base,             colour black and
 opaque, hardness a little inferior to that of feldspar, and
 specific gravity four times that of distilled water.* M. Le-
 lievre names it Jeuite, from the battle of Jena, one of the
 most memorable events of this century.
    M.   Baraillon, a correspondent of the historical class,
 having discovered in the trenches, which he caused to be
 cut in the antient Roman city of Neris, near Montlucon,
 some antient tin vasts, M. Mongez, member of the same
 class, has had the curiosity to ascertain their degree of pu
 rity. It results from the analyses made by M. Anfrye, in
 spector-general of the mint, that they contain nearly three
 tenths and a half of lead.       We know from the experiments
 of M. Proust, that a similar alloy presents none of the dan
 gers generally conceived.
    We mentioned last       year an important application    of che
                                                              mistrv

mistry to the arts, which consisted in rendering common
alums equal to Roman alum for dyeing, and we have seen
that it is only requisite to purify them from a little iron.
    To the different methods invented for this purpose, M. Se-
                                                                       g
guin,    a  correspondent, has added a new one, taken from
the difference and the solubility of pure alum and alum
charged with iron. He dissolves sixteen parts of common
alum in 24 of water, allows it to crystallize, and by this me
thod obtains 14 parts of alum as pure as that of Rome, and
almost as pure as that of Liege.
    We may apply this        process   to the first manufacture, and
 obtain at once an alum       a  third more in value.
    The    same   chemist    has   continued   his labours upon the
 analysis   of the juices  of  vegetables.
    He   has recently treated    of those which contain no tannin;
 all have more or less albumen and bitter principle.             The
 more abundant the albumen is, the stronger is the smell,
 and the sap is more easily corrupted.            Mushrooms, cruci-
 ferae and solaniae are of this description.         M. Seguin gives
 a view of the proportion of these two principles, in twenty-
 two natural families of plants, by remarking in several the
 differences of these proportions in the various parts of the
 vegetable, and in the same plant Iaken at different ages.
 All   these   saps,  treated by the sulphuric      acid, or the mu
 riate of tin. acquired the smell of pears or boiled apples, and
  sometimes of fermented liquor, like cyder and beer.
     What renders this description of researches so difficult, is
 the prodigious quantity of reactions, and various combina
 tions, which enter into elementary substances so few in
 themselves.
     We have had new proofs of this in the memoir of
 M.   Thenard,     professor in the college of France upon nitric
  ether.
     We know that the ethers are odoriferous and combusti
 ble liquors, which are obtained by treating alcohol with the
  acids. The best known is the sulphuric ether.            We are in
  debted   to the inquiries    of Messrs. Fourcroy and Vauquelin
  for being acquainted with the progress of its formation, and
                                                                   all

  all the combinations        formed with it.     The theory of the
 nitric ether was less perfect.         What was mistaken for this
 article in the shops was not even a true ether. The nitric
 acid is formed, as we know, of azot and oxygen; alcohol, of
 carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.              Thus, there are only four
 elementary substances in the two liquors, and there are
 formed, by bringing them together, ten combinations suscep
 tible of being separated : viz. a great deal of water, of oxi
 dated azotic gas,      of ether, a little oxidulated azotic gas, ni
 trous gas, carbonic acid gas, acetic acid, and a substance
which is easily charred. One portion of these substances
remains in the first vessel,       where the mixture    takes place ;
 another passes into the receiver by distillation, and there
takes the liquid form ; a third remains gaseous.
     It is this last portion which is almost wholly ether ; and
In order to obtain it separately, we must pass the gas through
a course of flasks submitted to great cold.          The ether is se
parated      in  the form   of a  yellowish liquid,  which  we must,
by means of lime, still deprive of the nitrous and acetous
acid it contains.
     M. Thenard concludes, from his experiments, that in
these     operations the oxygen of the acid is combined with a
great deal of hydrogen, alcohol, and little of its carbon :
from this result plenty of water, gaseous oxide of azot, a
small quantity of nitrous acid and nitrous gis, and but
little   free azot ; that the other is formed from the union        of
the two principles of nitric acid with de-hydrogenated and
slightly de-carbonised alcohol; and that the residues of car
bon, hydrogen,        and oxygen, furnish the acetous acid and the
charry matter.
     It may    be easily conceived how difficult it must be thus to
seize, in their minutest details, actions so fugitive, and to
separate combinations so various, and so easy to be altered,
and reciprocally converted into each other.          We regret that
our limits prevent us from giving an idea of the ingenious
and delicate processes resorted to by M. Thenard.
    We may remember the theory peculiar to count Rum-
ford, as to the cause of heat, which he attributes to certain
                                                           vibrations

vibrations of the particles of bodies, and not to a particular
substance, or to caloric, as admitted by several chemists.
A very strong objection has been made to him ; which is,
that bodies are heated when they are condensed, , as if the
condensation pressed out the caloric contained in them, and
which, no longer finding any room, manifests its departure by
its effects.         Thus water     and    alcohol, when          mixed,        lose   a
fortieth part of their volume, and gain several degrees in the
thermometer.      Pieces of money come out quite hot from
the die under which they are stamped.
   Count Rumford has answered these objections by experi
ments which are not less certain, and in which condensation is
accompanied with cold.   Thus, some solutions of salts in,
pure water lose both in volume and in heat.   We know
well, that salts on dissolving often produce cold, and we
explain this phenomenon by the necessity of a solid sub
stance absorbing caloric            when       it   becomes     liquid    :    but this
explanation        nor appear applicable
                     does                         a solution   when
already completely  effected is simply diluted with  a fresh
quantity of water.
   We know that          when confined is susceptible of ac
                            steam
                                                                                            '
quiring a heat far superior to that of boiling water ; and
count Rumford, long ago, invented a speedy and ceconomi-
cal method of heating liquids, by introducing into them this
steam   in     a state    of extreme   heat.
   He    has made an extremely fortunate application of this
discovery in the art of soap-making, and has succeeded in
boiling this article completely in six hours, while sixty were
requisite      in the usual way.          The kind of percussion which
heated steam gives to the mixture                   of oil   and ley, by penetra
ting into      it,
              and suddenly condensing, contributes, accord
ing to count  Rumford, to the acceleration of the process.
   This learned chemist has also succeeded in adding new
perfection to cauldrons destined for heating liquids,    ap                      by
plying to their bottoms several tubes which descend into the
flame, and           by   thus multiplying the surface            of     the   bottom
without increasing            its diameter.  By these             means we            not
only save fuel, but also the cauldron                ;   because the latter, re

  sisting more the effect of the heated steam, does not require
   to be so  thick*.
      Almost the whole of meteorology                depends     on the variable
  action of heat upon the atmosphere.                  It is the air, when va
  riously heated, that produces the winds, by the inequality of
  its dilatations ; and the winds, carrying <U+2666>he vapours into
  warmer or colder places than those where they were formed,
  cause their more complete solution, or their precipitation
  more or less rapid, i. e. fme weather or rain.
     M. Dupont Nemours, member of                      the   class  of history,
 has presented         to   the class      of  sciences     some reflections,
 which have the merit             of rendering in       some     measure sensi
 ble, the futility of every altempt to predict these phenomena
  from the analogy and experience of the past.
     The zone, in the different points of which the sun is ver
  tical in the course of the year, is never precisely the same
 upon the earth for two consecutive years, nor even for an
 infinity of centuries       :  in the mean'timc the precession of the
 equinoxes, which does not collect them at the same points
 until after more than 26,000 years, and the variations of the
 obliquity of the ecliptic, of which the period is still more
 tardy, contribute to vary this zone : and even supposing
 that we had one day of observations antient enough, — in order
 to be applicable, it must have been requisite that the surface
 of   the earth, the seas, and mountains,             which     are not less es
 sential elements of this phenomenon, had not changed in
 this whole interval.
     M. Dupont admits that electricity contributes also to vary
 the weather, forming nater by the combustion of hydrogen
gas.      It  is true that it seems         now clearly ascertained, that
this    gas   does    not   exist    in   the   region where storms are
formed     :   but  M. Dupont         supposes that it is brought down
from higher regions            in  tempests, which, by their violence,
disturb the natural order of the strata of the atmosphere.
    • The application of tubes to boilers does not appear to have been an inven
tion of count Rumford.s.      Patents were taken out in England for such a con-,
ttruction of boilers several years ago.       A patent was likewise taken out
some years ago   for heating water by passing    steam into it.   Edit.

      SIR,                                            Dec. 27, 1807.
J. HE cloudy state of the weather for some weeks past had
made me almost fear that I should no more see the comet ;
but within this hour      I  have found it very distinct, 32' 32"         E.
of a Cygni, and 1° 5? 30" N. of that star :                  it is therefore
within the circle of perpetual apparition, and              never sets.    A
small    cluster nebula       was    to-night in the field of Blunt's
night-glass at the same time. The comet formed nearly the
angle of a small equilateral stellar triangle, through whose
haze the angular star was nearly as distinct as the other two.
    After much attention the comet was visible to the naked
eye,   forming a straight line with v and % Cygni, and will be
readily found in the tail of the Swan, a few evenings hence,
between v and f .
    Through my       seven-feet      Newtonian reflector its disc        was
 very conspicuous and defined            :  but   I  could   not with any
 attention ascertain its tail.         By  due labour     I think it will be
 visible  a month longer.
    As   the  month is concluding,          I write in haste, that your
 many readers may          not    be    tempted to forgo their search
 after this curious object.
                                 I am, sir,
                                         Your obedient servant,

                             ANOTHER         COMET.
     A    letter  from    a gentleman,          dated    Crantits,   Orkney.
  Oct. 30, says     :—
                       "  Last night        I   observed    another comet,
  It was nearly vertical to this place about eight o'clock.               The
  nucleus is fully as large to appearance as the other comet,
  which is also still visible. This new comet is very large
  and distinct.      It 'appears      to be on its approach to the       Sun  ;
  will probably    be visible for        a considerable time; and       seems
  to have moved, since         I  first saw   it last night, about two     de
  gree."
                                                                      M. Ca-

       M.   Caselli,    an astronomer      of Naples, accounts for        the
    extraordinary heat of the past         summer, which continued         so
   intense      throughout the whole          month     of September, by
   ascribing      it  to the   extreme    purity    of the face   of the sun,
   which this      year was turned towards the earth.        For nearly two
   months he observed none of the spots which are commonly
   perceived in it. Hence M. Caselli concludes, that the sun's
   rays, having been emitted in greater abundance and with less
  interruption, produced that violent degree of heat, which,
  though      it scorched     the fields, nevertheless increased        their
  fertility.
                                  LECTURES.
      Dr. Clutterbuck, one of           the Physicians to the General
  Dispensary, Aldersgate-street, purposes, during the ensuing
  Spring, to give a Course of Lectures on the Theory arid
  Practice of Physic,        including an Outline of Physiology and
  the Materia Medica. — The introductory Lecture will be
  given on Friday, January 22, at six o'clock in the evening,
  and be continued on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays,
 at the same hour.            Further particulars, with a Prospectus,
 may be had on application at the Dispensary,                 or at No.  17,
 St. Paul's Churchyard.
     Mr. Taunton's Spring Course of Lectures on Anatomy,
 Physiology, Pathology, aud Surgery, will commence on the
 S3d of January, at eight o'clock in the evening, at the
 Theatre of Anatomy, Greville-street, Hatton Garden.                    The
 nights    of  lecturing   are  Tuesday,   Thursday,     and  Saturday.
     In  these Lectures it is proposed       first to take  a  comprehen
sive view      of   the structure and oeconomy        of  the  living body,
 and    then to consider the causes,            symptoms, nature, and
treatment of surgical diseases, with the mode of performing
the different surgical operations.
     An ample field for professional instruction will be af
forded, by the opportunity which pupils may have of attend
ing the clinical practice of both the City            and   Finsbury Dis
pensaries.

   EE. The frame or cott, containing a mattress or pelisse,
stuffed with straw. — Two or three hammocks may be sus
pended, and will answer as well as the cott.
   FF. Rings and iron hooks, by which the cott, bed, and
mattress are supported.
   GGG. Four handles projecting from the under frame, one
foot three    inches long each, by which the whole may be
carried by four men.
   HHHH. Four semicircular hoops, over which a cover can
be thrown,     to protect the patient from the weather.
   The under frame        and   pillars should be made of ash or
elm, well seasoned.
   The elastic, or upper frame, should         be made  of ash,  re
markably clean and well seasoned, thick in the middle
where it is supported, and tapering towards the ends.
   The total expense of the whole, including the iron-work,*
should not exceed four pounds ten shillings.
           Directions   for  using the Bed and Frame.
   The lower frame may be fastened by ropes to any cart or
waggon, of the^ame size, or larger than itself.
  The sick or wounded person should first be placed in the bed.

     The frame should then be placet! over the bed, and the
 ropes at the head     of the bed suspended upon the iron hooks.
     Then the ropes at the feet should be hooked up.
     The frame, containing one or two sick men, can he easily
 lifted by the four handles by four men, and carried to any
 distance to   a cart  or baggage-waggon.
     The lower frame is then fixed to the cart by ropes, and
 the machine is ready to move.
     When     the   sick  are  taken   from   ihe baggage-cart, the
 whole frame       should   be lilted    at once, and carried to the
 hospital.
     The  bed should then      be unhooked,     first at the feet and
 then at the head, and the frame taken away.
     Upon large English waggons,             two or three      of  these
 frames may     be   conveniently   placed.
     If the carts  of any district  are too small for the breadth     of
 the frame, it may be made narrower,           so as- to   adapt   it to
 that conveyance.
     When    the   machine, which       is delineated in     the  plate,
was first invented, it was solely intended for the use           of  the
army.
     To this purpose it has been successfully applied ; and is
in common application in several of the garrisons of Great
Britain, as affording the easiest meansof transporting sick or
wounded soldiers, from garrison or quarters, to the hospital.
     Since the time of its heinsj adopted by the army, it has
likewise been brought into the service of a gr.e.u many of
the public hospitals, not only for the purpose of conveying
maimed or bedridden patients from their houses to the
wards, but for removing such patients, as were under the
necessity of undergoing operations, from the wards to the
operation room, and returning them again from the opera
tion room to the wards, without subjecting them to the ne
cessity of being dressed, or even removed from the beds.
    Having successfully      answered   these purposes,   it has of late
been used, when fixed upon a cart, waggon, or upon the car
riage   of apostchaise, for removing wounded persons, or such
                                                                      m

as wereafflicted with disease, and who were unable to support
the motion of a chaise or coach, from different parts of the
country to towns where they might enjoy the benefit of me
dical advice.
     In this manner,         the use        of       it,   in Scotland,             has become
of    late very general, and,                  fortunately, very beneficial to
those who have travelled               in   it   ; all of them concurring, that
they were      insensible of any unpleasant motion during their
respective journeys.
     To enumerate the instances of                      successful application

distance of 74 miles, in two days.
     A    gentleman,       with an attack of gout both in his hands
and feet,      was       removed from Edinburgh to the north of
England,       above 140 miles,                in three days.
 -   In both    these instances,            and      a     great many more, the bed
and       frame were       suspended            to the           carriage      of   a   postchaise,
and, with      a   servant    sitting in front, travelled                       post.

state of the most severe bodily distress ard debility.
   In all these removals, the patients have borne testimony
to their enduring no additional pain or                     inconvenience from
the motion       of     the machine;             all of them, even    the most      in
severe cases,  declaring, that they were alike insensible of

XLV.        Project for the Establishment of Telegraphs on a
    New Construction.               By Capt. Pasuey, of the Royat
    Engineers.
                               [Conchidcd from p. 2 10.]
       2d.   A   Tohj 'gram malic Telegraph          for Day      Signals.
J.N   the reflections concerning the use              of  telegraphs  in gene
ral, into which          I was    unavoidably     led    whilst digesting the
above proposal, it appeared               to me  a   fundamental      principle
of the art, to aim             as  much as possible at celerity and di
spatch,     which      I   found     were in some measure to be gained
by employing a number of words and scutences adapted to
the key of the telegraph, according to the method of sec
tions, instead of adhering entirely to the tedious alphabetical
mode, which (to the best of my knowledge) is the only
one in common use.
    Still there remained           a  defect, in its being impossible la
express a      variety of significations, without making two or
                                                                           three

                        on a Neiv Cons I ruction.                      293
 three signals for each.        The only      remedy     for this at first
  seemed to be, increasing the number          of combinations of the
 telegraphs already established by adding more bodies, as,
 for instance, to construct an Admiralty tek graph with seven,
 -eight, or nine bodies instead of six ; but this remedy is only
 partial, because additional bodies would run into confusion
  before the signal code can be enlarged to a sufficient extent.
     On further consideration it therefore occurred           to me, that
 it might be allowable to propose a new diurnal telegraph ;
 and if my preceding observations are granted, I hope it may
 meet with approbation, being capable of exhibiting seven
 hundred and seven thousand two hundred and eighty distinct
 combinations, whereas no former one used in this country
 has exceeded sixty-three.         I now proceed to describe the
 nature of the      telegraph proposed, which, for the sake of
 distinguishing    it from others on a more confined principle,
 I shall call the Polygrammalic        Telegraph.
                       Nature and Construction.
     Four upright     posts are erected, each having two arms
 moveable on      a   spindle at top, which in their natural po
 sition hang down, but can be raised by means of strings
 to various degrees of extension, so as to appear in positions
 either vertical, horizontal,     or inclined     at  an angle    of 45*
 with the horizon.        The length of the arms may be about
 six feet from the     centre of motion to the ends, or more, in
 proportion to the distance between the telegraphic stations.
 The strings will be worked by two men.                         <
    The combinations of two         arms   in   the   several   positions
 enumerated are twenty-eight,         of which     a table  is  given in
 Plate  VIII :  eighteen of   these are allotted to the alphabetical
 characters, and ten to the numerical ciphers, so that using
 the common mode, of signal making, every post with its
 arms might form        a complete telegraph, were it not the ob
ject of  the present    proposal to go further.        A book is there
fore made of words and sentences arranged in regular order,
to the extent judged necessary, and let signal 2567 signify,
 for example, " The enemy have landed on the south-west
 coast"    and let   signal 9304 signify,
                                               "A     convoy is just   ar-
                                    T  3                            rived

29*             On the Establishment          of Telegraphs
rived from the West Indies."              Then   these two pieces   of in
 telligence will    be successively         communicated     by   the two
signals.     Fig.  2, 2.
    But this telegraph has another property, I believe entirely
new, of expressing words or parts of words not exceeding
four letters, by a single signal. For instance, let it be re
quired to communicate the following order* alphabetically :
" Send 1000 men to Dover," or, " Three regiments wilt
march to Leith     :"  the first   will be effected by five signals, and
the second by seven,         as  in fig. 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, and 4, 4, 4, 4,
4,4,4.
    In working this      telegraph no signal is required to denote
the end   of  a word, it being sufficient to mark a pause by
leaving one of the posts in its quiescent state.              And to di
stinguish    between       the  numerical      signals referring to the
book or code, and such as are really intended to denote
numbers, the unit place of the latter must never, but that
of the former must always, be placed on the fourth or right-
hand post of the telegraph.               Hence this post, when left
quiescent between two numbers, will not be considered to
denote    a pause     or break,     as  it would    between   two words.
Thus, fig.     5 will signify one thousand, whilst             fig. 6 will
denote   the  looodth word or sentence in the book, and must
be referred to there for its signification.               Also, in con
sequence of       the   last remark,       the  signals 5th, 6th, 7th,
and 8th, the fig. 7, 8, 9» 10, will signify 104, 506, 820
pounds.
    Observing this restriction, it will be found that a signal
book may be formed, containing 10,999 words and sen
tences,   if thought     necessary,      each to be    expressed   by one
change on this telegraph, whilst all unforeseen intelligence
can be communicated by an improved alphabetical mode,
without these two methods interfering in the least with each
other ; so that I trust it will be allowed, that the object I
had in view, namely, increased dispatch in signal making
without loss of clearness or precision, is fully obtained.

  P. S. In describing                  the principles            of   the polygrammauc
telegraph, I avoided entering into the minutiae of its me
chanical construction ; by which, however varied, no funda
mental part of the scheme can be affected. A model made by
my directions in Malta proved to all who saw it the practica
bility of the machine ; I shall, in explanation, say a few words
here, which will perhaps be almost equally satisfactory.
  The under part of the posts is solid, but the upper part of
them is composed of two side pieces with a space between,
within which               the arms  One of the arms is repre

its natural position, so as to be entirely hid by the post when
the telegraph is at rest.    A roller A is fixed to the arm near
its head, having an iron ring a, a, a, screwed                               upon one side
of    it,

ends of which are fastened to     in contrary directions. The

other ends of these strings are brought down into the signal
room, and have seven knobs (1,                                   4,

them, the intervals                   between     which are proportioned to the
circumference              of   the    roller, in such     manner that as they
                                                                 a

                                                 its pivot (which coincides
with the centre of              the roller) to the seven positions required
in signal making.                As the arm rises to any of these posi
tions,  the corresponding tooth of the ring              will be             a

     It  has been already observed           that one man is to work two
posts ; the arms must therefore be so poised, by                       duly pro
portioning          the    weight of     the   part (B)      above,   and  of the
part (C) below the pivot, that he may with ease be able to
raise two arms with each hand, the requisite preponderance
of the lower part being at the same time preserved.
     With regard to the signal houses chosen for this kind of

  J. HE following outlines of tablets, supposed to be affixed
 to different parts of an arranged museum, are not offered as
 a complete plan of a museum arranged with a view to the
 illustration       of natural theology, but            are  sketched slightly,
 with     the view       of merely suggesting       the practicability    of such
 mode of exhibition.

  Thus, we may            say the    heavenly bodies are attracted by, or
  gravitate toward, one another.                  Some say, all bodies are
  impelled by external agency in all cases of what is com
  monly called attraction and repulsion.                      Of late this has
  been     maintained by Le Sage of Geneva. It is not material

     4. About four-fifths    of  the surface  of the globe consist of
water.      This large proportion of water displays various re
lations to the sustenance and welfare of animated beings.
It    supports vast multitudes,        whose whole organization,
under very different forms, is peculiarly adapted to that
element.        Some of its inhabitants require salt in addition to
the water they inhabit.         The well-being of others requires
fresh water. The welfare of others requires                  occasional
change from the former            to the latter.     Some animals to
which water is principally necessary require occasional re
 sidence in air. Some commonly respiring air, and dwelling
 on land, seek their principal sustenance and comfort in the
 water. The organization of these is variously adapted to
 either element.       Fresh water, as drink, is requisite to the
 maintenance      of most land animals.      It  is highly important,
 if  not essential, to the maintenance of man.          Its relations to
 our comfort       are innumerable.      It is necessary to veeeta-
 tion.    It  contributes to tire formation of earthy inanimate
 solids,    perhaps to the solidification    of the greater part of
 the habitable globe.
     The earth in its turn prevents the water from putrefying
 by affording, conjointly with the air, and with the influ
 ences of the sun and moon, facility to its continual mo
 tion ; straining it through crevices and pouring it along de
 clivities.     The surface of the earth assists evaporation : its
  cavities cool and condense vapours.
      The relations of earth to the wants and comforts             of all
  living beings are innumerable.
      The air which surrounds the globe is requisite to the sup
  port of life, and to the well-being of all living creatures.
  The heat retained by the earth preserves a great portion of
   the air from being chilled to the destruction       of vegetable and
               8                                                 auima

   298                Proposal  for  the Establishment     of
   animal life.     Evaporation of      water gives coolness to a great
  portion    of  air,  which, from       excessive   heat, would   other
  wise lay waste the torrid regions.
     Heat, so necessary to the sustenance, and so conducive to
  the comfort of living beings) contributes incessantly to pro
  duce countless modifications of earth, air, and water, and
  is itself incessantly controlled by their reagencies.
     Moderate cold and moderate heat are terms nearly con
  vertible.    Where the moderation of either is required, a
  moderate      degree    of the other becomes requisite. — See
  further,    Paley, Nat. Theology, chap. xvii. and xxi.
     5.  Planetarium.       This machine       is intended to   represent
  the relative situations     of  the   sun and the     planets, (one of
  which is the earth,) at different periods of time. The
 planets are restrained by their relations to the sun in their
  respective orbits.      The sun dispenses light and heat to all.
  We may refer, by analogy,           to other planets, the advantages
  which we fully experience from our relations to the sun.
"The revolutions of the earth round its axis cause the vicis
 situdes of day and night.            But the darkness, the coolness,
 the tranquil repose of night, are no less requisite to the well-
 being of man and other animals, than the cheering in
 fluences of the day. The earth's orbit, or path round the
 sun, has such relation or inclination to the equator, and the
 axis of the earth is placed in such relation to its orbit, that
 the sun becomes at different periods             of the year perpendi
 cular to different portions of the globe, and thus produces
 the continual succession and order of the seasons, cherishing
 all nature, and making life delightful.
     The stagnation of the ocean is prevented, and the ebb and
 flow of the tides effected, by the influence of the moon as
 well as of the sun.
     The planets are all placed in definite relations one to an
 other,     and   each   affects   the other by mutual attraction.
 "  This subsisting law of attraction falls within limits which
 utility requires: — If the planet Saturn had attracted the earth
 in  a proportion increasing according to its distance (instead
           8                                                           of

     It is destined to contain        a  substance  so soft as easily to
 receive external     injury ; so important to the continuance         of
 life, that   a very slight    injury   suspends or extinguishes the
 vital energy.      This substance is accordingly enclosed in a
 strong bony case, '? adapted not for motion, but solely for
 defence.      It is lined with soft membranous coats. Hollows
 and inequalities may be observed           in the inside of the skull :
 these exactly fit the folds of the brain, keeping the sub
  stance steady, and guarding it against concussions." — Paley,

            Relation to the well-being of the individual.

  ance to sensation, the      source    of all animal delight; which

is liable to be disturbed or suspended             by less injuries to the
brain than those which affect life.
   h. The Spine in its cavity is a long canal conveying the
substance of the brain through a great part of the animal
form.    Like the skull, it affords to its contents a firm hard
covering. Like the skull, it is variously perforated, sending
forth minute ramifications of brain through all parts of the
body.    But, unlike the skull, it is curiously adapted to va
rious motions ; none of these motions, however, occasion
it to press at any time on any of the fine branches of brain
which issue from its cavities. Were not this circumstance
most nicely adjusted, every motion of the body would be
liable to induce palsy, and to endanger life.
   " The head rests immediately on the uppermost of the
yertebrae,    and is united to it by a hinge          joint, upon which
joint the     head    plays freely forward and          backward,   as    far
either way         ligaments allow." —
               as the
     " Thestrength of the compages, and the security against
luxation is an instance of wonderful contrivance. Where so
many joints are concerned, and where in every one derange
ment would be fatal, a peculiar protection is provided : the
                                          is,
                                     moveable joints between
vertebrae are articulated ; that
them are formed         by
                      means  of  those projections called pro
cesses,     which   so lock   in with   and overwrap one another as
to secure    the body of          not only from accidental
                              the vertebra
                                                                             by
slipping, but even from being pushed out of
                                                its place
any violeuce less than that which would break the  bone."
     The relations of                             of the indi
                         the spine to the subsistence
vidual     are nearly the same  with  those of the skull            :   it   is
further related to the well-being and comfort of animal life

  c. Ribs. These are fixed              by strong cartilages at one of
their ends to the vertebrae,            at the other to the sternum.

adjustment to all the         motions of the spine,    the remark

  human form,       requires peculiar strength.         All the larger and
  stronger muscles of the body, which move the thighs and
  hind-legs of quadrupeds, move round or are attached to it.
  The   bones differ    from those above and below them in size
  and compactness,        and    derive great firmness from their cir
 cular disposition.        If great strength was requisite in the
  covering which was to protect the brain of the individual,
  no less was needful for that which was to form the shelter,
  and    as It were the antenatal      cradle, of the newly conceived
  being.     Here   one    of  the  most   interesting relations of ana
  tomy is displayed ; a relation not only to the safety and well-
  being    of the individual, but       also  to the continuance     of the
  species, in the remarkable expansion of the bones                  of the
  female pelvis beyond those of the male.               These, and nume
  rous other formations having similar relations, are obviously
  formed by a power regarding prospectively their future use.
      e. The exact correspondencies of legs, feet, arms, and
  hands, enable them to cooperate equally and mutually                    in
  powerful exertion and in rapid movement.
      f. Teeth. These        are different    in different animals    ; but
"
   wherever they are found, a provision is also found for giving
   those motions to the jaw from which their chief use is de
   rived.    A   relation then exists between the muscles            of the
  jaw    and   the solid substance, between           the form    and sub
   stance   of the jaw   and    the teeth,   between     these and the or
   gans necessary to deglutition,           between the latter and the
   gullet ; between that and the           stomach    ;  between the sto
   mach and the gastric juice ; between this and the absorbents,
   lacteals, and lymphatics, which secrete the chyle or neces
   sary nutriment, and convey it to the thoracic duct ; between
   this duct and the subclavian and other veins, between veins
   and arteries, between arteries and lungs, between all and
   the heart.
       g. The mutual relations of muscles and nerves, of mus
   cles to each other, and of nerves to each other, contributing
   constantly to the security and well-being of individuals and
   species, will appear to the most cursory observer.

  are applied to the construction        of  the telescope .or camera
 obscura.      The perception arising from the image is a sub
 ject of distinct consideration.         The instruments, as far as
  they relate to the production of the image, are of the same
  kind. The end is the same ; the means are the same. The
 lenses of the telescope and the humours of the eye bear a
 complete resemblance to one another in their figure, in their
 position, and in their power over the rays of light ; viz. in
bringing each pencil to a point at the right distance from
 the lens : in the eye at the exact place where the membrane
of   the retina is spread to receive      it." — Paley,  p. 23.
     "  The   ear is no less artificially     adapted to its office than
 the            "
       eye.:' — The      external   ear  is calculated to catch and
 collect the pulses of air — These, passing through the barrel
 of the ear, strike on the thin membrane known by the name
of the drum, which, stretched over bony cavities, presents
a concurrence       of circumstances very analogous to the con
struction of that instrument." — Vide p. 46.

    The organs of smell direct many, perhaps most, animals
to   a proper choice of aliment, and greatly contribute to gene-*
ral delight.      The internal part of the nose has six cavities,
called    the  maxillary frontal and spheroid sinuses, on each
side. These are lined with a thick but very irritable mem
brane, in which the sensation of smelling certainly begins.
    The tongue is covered with irritable papillae, supposed to
be formed      by the extremities of its nerves.          Its delight in
flavours prompts its exertions in the work of deglutition.
    The organs of touch are diffused throughout the whole
surface of the forms of most animals : perhaps some tribes
of insects are alone to be excepted.            The cutis (a delicate
network       of fine   vessels,   disclosed upon removal of the
epidermis, the exterior or scarf skin,) is found to have
throughout its whole surface innumerable papillae,                   like
minute granulations, which are most easily observed where
the sense of feeling is most delicate.

female.       This  is  requisite in   a state in which it    is ordained
that subsistence shall depend         upon exertion : for during the
period of parturition,        &c., it is necessary that the strength
of the male should he exerted for the maintenance of both.
The difference between the strength of              males    and 'females
 will be found generally proportionate to          the different degrees
 in which such necessity shall be found to exist.
      The teats of females of different species are adapted in
 size, form, situation and number, to their respective young.
 "    At the moment       the young animal      enters   into the world,
 its maintenance,        the maternal milk, is ready for it."
      The new-born child       is without teeth.     "  It is evident that
  the act of sucking will      be performed with       more ease, both
  to the mother and        infant,  while the edges of the gums are
  smooth and soft, than when           they are bordered with sharp
  bones. By the time they arc wanted the teeth are ready."
      The remarkable increase of ingenuity and courage in most
  brutes during the tender and defenceless state of their young,
  appears to be a relation of instinct. This impulse of instinct
  guides the sexes of all species, directs the young to the
• teat,   induces birds to build nests,' and brood on their eggs,
  •rges fish from salt to fresh water, and insects to provide fora
  progeny of which they never live to see the birth. — Ch. xviii.

       The   teeth   of animals    are   adapted   to the mastication    of
   varieties of food.        Where long- continued mastication         and
   trituration is requisite, the teeth are broad and solid ; where
   less comminution is needful, they are hollow and sharp.

       The gastric juice of birds of prey, of an owl, or a kite,
   acts upon animal fibre alone, will not act upon seed and
   grasses at all.     The gastric juice of ruminating animals,           as
   the sheep and the ox, speedily dissolves vegetables, but makes
   no impression upon animal bodies."              The construction of
    the stomachs of ruminating animals differs considerably
    from that of animals which require animal food.                   Birds
    furnished with soft bills are provided with gizzards neces
    sary to   triturate their grain.      Those which possess hard,
    strong, and hooked bills and claws, whose gastric juices

    We discover in plants,          as well  as in animals, numerous
relations to the preservation of individuals, and of species ;
but we perceive also a limitation of the faculty of motion,
which renders it doubtful whether any of their movements
are spontaneous,       or can be considered as proceeding from
internal power,       independent of the immediate agency of
eome external force attractive, repulsive, or impulsive.
    Their forms, like those of animals, are composed of he
 terogeneous particles, which, when once separated, display
no tendency to reunite in similar form. They are composed
in   great measure      of numerous tubes, which convey juices
to each     part necessary to nutrition and to growth.                  The
period   of  vegetable    like   that  of  animal   form    is limited j —
of various extent in different species. 'Like animals, plants
grow to a limited magnitude according to their species, and,
 having attained to a certain growth, soon tend to decay.—-
 Moderate      heat and    light are requisite to their sustenance or
 well-being.       They are subject to variations of health, from
defect or excess of nutriment.           The organization of some is
 adapted    to  subsistence     in  water.    Watry situations are de
 structive to others.        Relations exist between different parts
 of  vegetable    forms,     and   between different individuals, on
 which depends the continuance of their species.                 Plants are
 incapable     of  locomotion     ; but  provisions    are   ordained for
 the conveyance of their seeds to proper distances, that they
 may have room for growth.                Analogies of plants to ani
 mals may be specified to a great extent ; and in the com
                                                                     pletion

 pletion      of this scheme may be referred to the respective
 classes,    orders, &c.       It may suffice here to observe, that the
 most important difference between the animal and vegetable
 appears to be, that constant means are every where provided
 for conveying to the stationary plant whatsoever is necessary
 to its subsistence, and to the continuance               of  the  species   j
 while the locomotive           animal is left to seek such means for
 itself.     The   vegetable   appears to possess life and very limited
 sensai  ,i ft ;  but neither thought nor voluntary power.                In
 the animal, all relations to the subsistence of the individual,
 and to the continuance          of the species,    are wholly subject to
 the exertions of thought, or of voluntary power, or of both
 united.          24 Classes.

organic       remains should be classed according to the order of
the strata in which they are found,                with specimens of the
strata j carefully distinguishing            the gravel fossils, or those
found     in   alluvial   deposits  ;  likewise   the peat or surface fos

   into the tray. We began with 49-64 -cubic inches of oxy
   gen ;    and every thing being properly adjusted, kept the
   platina tube red-hot for a quarter of an hour, and during
    this time the gas was passed from one gasometer to the
    other,   as  in the former experiments.       When the tubes, &c.
    were cooled down to       the temperature of the room, all the

                and on the Nature       of   the Diamond.           317
    In order to see how far the weight of the precipitate of
carbonate   of lime would agree with the results of the fore
going experiments, we drew off 20'5 cubic inches of the gas
which had been thus altered by the combustion of diamond
in the last experiment by the register H, and received it in
bottles over mercury ; then admitting lime water, we ob
tained a copious precipitate of carbonate of lime, which
being dried at the temperature          of   212° Fahrenheit,   weighed
 12 grains.
    But as the 20-5 cubic inches require the same corrections
to bring them to the mean temperature and pressure ; we
say, as the actual volume of all the gas is to its correction,
»o is the quantity drawn        off to that which it would    have been
 at the mean    :
49-84:    51-2O   : : 20- 50: 21-00, the volume after the correc
 tions were made.
    Then, to find how much carbonic acid was contained in
 these 21-06 cubic inches, we state it thus: As the total
 quantity of gas after the experiment is to the total weight of
 carbonic acid gas found by calculation, so is the quantity
 of gas experimented upon to the weight of carbonic acid
 gas which    it ought    to have contained,
                51-20   :  13-91  : : 21'O6: 5'72 grains.
     Every 100 grains of precipitated carbonate of lime contain
 44 grains of carbonic acid ; 12 grains were procured in our
 experiment.                 100   :44:  :  12 : 5-2S
 Therefore the carbonic acid conlained in our precipitate of
  12 grains weighed 5-28;             by calculation it should have
 weighed 5'72; this is as near as we had a right to expect
  from the difficulty     of collecting    the precipitate.

     Upon the suggestion of our mutual friend Professor Davy,
  we next examined the results of the combustion of stone
  coal and plumbago ; thermometer                57°  Fahrenheit,  baro

    A  portion of this coal was placed under sand in a crucible,
and exposed to a strong heat for one hour; 4 grains of it
thus prepared were put, into the tray : our oxygen left a
residuum of 5 parts in 100, and we began with 49*84 cubic
inches as usual.            The tray being placed in the platina tube
was heated to redness for about 10 minutes.                            When the
gas   was  first  passed,      we     thought      we saw  a  flash  in  the glass
tubes.     On suffering the whole to cool the quantity of gas
still remained the same, and the tray being drawn out con
tained only -5 of a grain unconsumed.                       From the gas thus
charged    with 3-5 grains of coal,
          Lime water absorbed                   53 parts from 100.

 cubic inches.
                            100: 53      : : 49-55 : 26-26.
    Consequently            26-26 cubic inches of carbonic                acid gas
were produced.

    Here, contrary   to what happened in other experiments, the
calculation by    carbonic   acid rather exceeds that by oxygen :

left a residuum of 2 parts in 100, and we began with 49-84
cubic inches.      The tray, with its contents, being         placed   in
the platina tube, was heated to redness for a quarter of an
hour, and the -gas made to pass over it several times. When
 all was cool, the original quantity was neither increased nor
 diminished,    and on    withdrawing the tray we found only -2

        Thermometer      60° Fahrenheit,             barometer 30-23.
    Muscular fibre distilled in          a coated glass retort left a    black
 shining coal, 4 grains of which were put into the                  tray. Our
oxygen left a residuum of 2 parts in 100.                   The tray and its
contents being placed          in the platina tube, was             heated   to
redness for 8 minutes.          The first time the gas was           passed,  a
lambent flame filled the whole length of the glass tube, and
the gas became      turbid or milky.              It was passed frequently
through the heated tube, but we observed no repetition of
the flashes.    Hence we conjecture, that if the diamond had
contained hydrogen we should probably have had a similar
appearance. After the experiment all the apparatus was,
as   usual, perfectly tight, and the volume of gas unaltered.
On examining the platina tray a minute portion of charcoal
remained, and a quantity of saline matter adhered to it so
firmly, that it became difficult to ascertain the quantity of
carbon consumed,       and we forbore to make the                calculation;
we however examined the gas.

        Thermometer        59° Fahrenheit,    barometer 29-45.
    Some of the animal charcoal of last experiment was heated
to redness under sand for one hour.            4  grains were placed
in the platina tray ; and as we were so much embarrassed
in the last experiment with the saline matter which adhered
to the tray, we exactly balanced it with its contents.            Our
oxygen, made as usual, left a residuum of 2 parts in 100,
and we began        with  "49•84  cubic inches.    When   every  thing
was adjusted, and the platina tube red-hot, on passing the
oxygen, flashes .resembling lightning ran along the glass
tube ; and this was repeated 5 or 6 times. The whole of
the gas became         very cloudy, exhibiting a turbid milky ap
pearance. The tube was rendered white-hot by the com
bustion of the carbonaceous matter in oxygen.                The fire
was kept up about 8 minutes, and the gas passed several
times.      When all was cool, we could observe no alteration
in  the volume      of gas by the register. The tray contained a
mixture     of   salts j and, being weighed, was lighter by 3-2
grains.      This loss was not wholly carbon, for it is well
 known that animal substance contains a variety of salts, as
phosphates, muriates, &c, some of which, though not
volatile in a low red heat* might be decomposed and dissi
 pated in the intense white heat produced by the combustion
 of  the carbonaceous matter in oxygen ; and we accordingly
 found the internal parts of the gasometers and tubes very
 slightly covered with a sort of efflorescence. On examining
 the gas after the experiment,

    The quantity of      oxygen at the mean would               therefore be
 49*02 cubic inches.
                       100    :41  : :  49-02    :  20-09
    The carbonic acid       gas produced was therefore 20-09 cubic
 inches.
                      100: 47-26:: 20-09: 9-49
           and this carbonic acid weighed 9-49 grains.
    Now the coal in       the tray had lost 3-2 grains ; but as
 the whole of this was not carbon, but part of it volatile
 saline matter,     &c.,      we shall      endeavour to estimate        . the
 carbon     by the experiment on plumbago.                    When 13-35
 grains   of carbonic  acid    contained      3-80 grains    of  carbon,
                     13-35:3-80: : 9'49 :2'70.
    The quantity of carbonic acid produced in this experiment,
 therefore, contained 2-70 grains of carbon.

          Carbon      2-70
          Leave?        -50 for volatile saline matter, &c.
    So that, this being granted, the present experiment agrees
 with   the foregoing.
    In two Af our first experiments with box-wood charcoal,
the calculations gave us in one case 29- 75 parts of carbon in
 100  of carbonic acid, and in the other 30*68; but we were
not then fully aware of the absorption of water by charcoal,
which rendered      the quantity        of  real    carbon employed less
than indicated by the weight.              Also in another experiment,
in which 4 grains of diamond were consumed, the calcula
tion gave us 29-96 per cent, of diamond in carbonic acid ;
but apprehending that a slight degree of inaccuracy had
crept into this experiment, we have not detailed it with the
rest ; but    we  have thought        it right     to give a simple   state
ment of matters      of fact ; in no one instance             have we    en
deavoured     to strain or accommodate these               to suit any par
ticular   theory, being fully          aware     that   every experiment,
carefully made and faithfully recorded, will remain an im
mutable truth ;o the end of time, while hypotheses are
                                                                 constantly

constantly varying,       and even the most beautiful theories are
liable to change.
   The experiments      above related give us the   following results  :
                                By carbonic acid.    By oxygen.

                     mean           28-67             28-60
    Hence we conclude that 100 grains of carbonic acid con
tains 28-60 of carbon, which does not greatly differ from
the results    of the experiments of Smithson Tennant, esq.
on the nature of diamond. — See Phil. Trans. 1797.
   This gentleman        made    his experiment in the following
manner    :   A quarter of      an ounce of nitrate of potash was
rendered    somewhat     alkaline by exposure to heat, in order
that it might more readily absorb carbonic acid ; it was then
put into a gold tube with 2| grains of diamond ; and being
subjected to heat, the diamond was converted into carbonic
acid, by uniting with the oxygen contained in the nitric
acid. The carbonic acid thus produced combined wiih the
potash ; and on pouring a solution of muriate            of lime into a
solution    of this salt, he obtained a precipitate       of carbonate
of lime: this being decomposed by muriatic acid, gave as
much carbonic acid gas as occupied the space of 10- 1 ounces
of water. The thermometer was at 55° Fahrenheit, the ba
rometer     29-80.    In   a   second experiment he procured a
larger quantity, or equal to 10-3 ounces of water.
   If we therefore consider an ounce of water as consisting
of 480 grains,     and a cubic inch    of water   equal to 253 grains,
and then make the proper corrections for temperature and
pressure, one of his experiments will give about 27 per cent.
the other about 27-80 for the carbon in carbonic acid, which
is somewhat less than our estimate; but the difference may
easily be accounted for, from the different methods employed.
                                    X2                             The

  324      On the Quantity ofCarlon In Carbonic           Add, &c.
     The experiments of Guyton, as detailed in the Annales de
  Chimie, vol. xxxi. page 76, are liable to very strong ob
 jections ; but at the same time the candid manner in which
 he has related every circumstance merits considerable praise.
 It   is impossible,    however, not to observe, that the quantity
 of gas before and after the experiment could not, from the
 construction of his apparatus; be very rigorously ascertained.
 We      object also to nitrous gas as a test for oxygen ; and as
 it  is acknowledged that the wooden support included in the
 oxygen gas took fire, the product of carbonic acid must
 have been influenced by it; so that, if no chance of error
 had existed in estimating the carbonic acid gas from the
 residuum after ban-tic           water had absorbed a part, still the
 result   would   not   have   been  satisfactory.
    The experiments which we have had the honour of laying
 before this society prove several important points :
     1st. That the estimate given by Lavoisier, of 28 parts of
 carbon in every IOC parts of carbonic acid, is very nearly
 correct;     the mean    of our experiments makes it 28-60.
     2dly. That the diamond is pure carbon ; for, had it con
 tained any notable proportion of hydrogen, it must have
been discovered, either by detonating with the oxygen, as
 in   the case  of animal charcoal, or by diminishing the quan
 tity of oxygen gas.
    3dly. That well burnt charcoal contains no sensible quan
tity of hydrogen ; but if exposed to the air for a few hours
it absorbs moisture, which renders the results uncertain.
    4thly. That charcoal can no longer be considered as                 an
oxide of carbon, because, when properly prepared, it                   re
quires quite as much oxygen for its combustion as the dia
mond.        This is also the case with stone coal and plumbago.
    5thly. It appears that diamond and all carbonaceous sub
stances     (as far as our present methods       of analysis are capable
of demonstrating         their   nature)  differ principally from each
other in the state of aggregation of their particles. Berthollet
has well remarked, that in proportion as this is stronger,
decomposition        is   more difficult    : and hence    the variety  of
temperatures required for the combustion                of different in
flammable substances.

 XLTX.        On thai Power       of the  Eye,     by which it is adjusted
      to  see    Objects    distinctly     at   different  Distances.    By
.     Ez. WALKER,          Esq.
                               To    Mr. Tilloch.
  P      SJR'
  1 HILOSOPHERS           have    varied much in their opinions, for
  near two hundred years, respecting that power of the eye
  by which it is adjusted to         see   objects distinctly   at different
  distances.
      Kepltr, M.       le  Cat, and      some other philosophers sup
  posed,    that when we view distant objects the eye contracts
  itself' and becomes      flatted, by which means the distance be
  tween the       crystalline lens and the retina is decreased; but
  when near objects are seen, the axis of the eye is lengthened,
  and this distance is therefore greater. DCS Cartes, Dr. Pem-
  berton, and Dr. Young, have adopted the opinion that the
form of       the crystalline    lens alters with the distance of the
  object from the eye.          Dr. Porterfield thinks, that the         ad
  justment      of  the eye is produced by an alteration        in the cur
  vature    of the cornea        and   a motion     of the crystalline lens.
•De la      Hire imagined,        that the eye undergoes no change,
  except the       contraction     and dilatation of the pupil.         Mr.
  Ramsdun and         Mr. Home conclude from their experiments,
   that the     adjustment is produced by three changes in the
  eye; a motion in the crystalline lens, an elongation of the
  axis of vision, and an increase of curvature in the cornea.
   llalier, Smith, Jurin, Monro, and many others, have also
   written upon this subject.            But as none of the hypotheses
   hitherto    advanced have been demonstrated,             either by deci
   sive experiments or from the known laws of dioptrics,
  this property of vision seems still to remain in much ob
  scurity.
      Ou entering upon           an  inquiry of this nature, it will be
  necessary 'to reject all       suppositions      that are not conform
  able to those beautiful mechanical             laws which are seen in
  every other part of the animal            ceconomy.      I cannot there
  fore suppose that the whole globe             of the eye alters its form
                                                                       every

every time we view objects at different distances.                     Nor d jes
it   appear    probable that the power of adjustment lies either
in   the vitreous   humour or in the crystalline lens, for they
are too dense            to admit    of that infinite variety of changes
which the eye undergoes every day.
  As the crystalline lens alone is sufficient                to form a distinct
image of an object upon the retina, it                       is therefore very
reasonable to    suppose that the aqueous and the vitreous
humours are designed for other purposes than merely to
act as refracting mediums.
   The vitreous humour is a dense transparent substance,
which seems designed by nature to preserve the lenticular
form of the crystalline, and to keep it at the same distance
from the retina ; for the crystalline lens is so deeply imbed
ded in the vitreous humour, and adheres so closely to                           it,
that the crystalline cannot suffer any change in its form,
without giving motion to some part of the vitreous.
'
  Now, as nature performs all her mechanical operations
by the  most perfect mechanical laws,      must appear im
                                                        it
probable, from the density of these substances, that any
change should take place, either  the figure of the crystal
                                               in
line lens or in its distance from the retina.
     Just before        the crystalline lens the iris   is   placed.   The     use
of this organ       is    to contract and enlarge the pupil        ;   and as    it
is put in motion            by
                    almost every ray of light that falls upon
the cornea,    seems necessary  for its preservation that
                                                                                it it
                   it

  The contraction of the pupil answers two important pur
poses; one to exclude too great     quantity of light, which
                                             a
would     beinjurious to the eye, and the other to give us                       a
distinct view of near objects.   But how   contracted pupil
                                                         a
should produce this effect may be explained from the fol
lowing property of vision, viz. —
  That we have no vision perfectly distinct, but        ravs             by
which enter the eye in direction parallel to the axis of the
                                 a
crystalline lens.
     This will     be easily understood from        the      following obser
vations   :

                            First Olservation.                        i
      If we  look attentively at a remote object, which subtends
   a very small angle at the eye, that object will be seen more
   distinctly than any other object that may be near it ; because
   those rays that enter the eye near the axis of vision are so
   nearly parallel, on account of the great distance of the ob
  ject, that the eye can distinguish no difference between these
   and parallel rays ; and those rays passing through the cry
   stalline lens, near its axis, and falling perpendicularly upon
   the retina,   produce vision as perfect as the distance and
   magnitude of     the object will admit.     But those rays which
   form    an angle with the visual axis fall obliquely      upon the
   retina, and produce indistinct vision.
                          Second   Observation.
     If we   look at  a near and small object with attention, the
  pupil    will contract so as to admit only those rays that are
  nearly parallel to the axis of vision.       Suppose, for example,
  that we look at the point On the letter i in a printed book,
  the remaining part of the letter, and all the surrounding
  letters, will be seen imperfectly, for the same reason that was
  given above.
                           Third Olservation.
     Let the   same object (•) be brought within two inches of
 the eye, and it will appear indistinct, because the rays issuing
 from     it will enter the eye in a diverging state, in conse
 quence of the pupil's being too large for the object.         But if
 the pupil be contracted by means of a perforation about -^
 of   an inch    in diameter, placed before the eye, made either
 in a thin piece of metal or a slip of paper, the object will be
 seen distinctly, because no rays will then enter the eye,
 except those that are nearly parallel to the axis of vision.
     Hence it is evident, that we have no perfect vision, but
by rays which enter the eye in a direction parallel to the
axis of the crystalline lens, and fall perpendicularly upon
the retina; and as all rays that fall upon a convex lens
parallel to its axis are converged to the same point, the fol
lowing conclusion must        be strictly true,  viz.
                                                              When

                  Objects   distinctly at different Distances.                    343
     When        an object is seen     distinctly, its image      is painted at
the same          invariable
                      distance from                      the crystalline  lens,
whether the object be near or remote.
The same Property            of Vision demonstrated ly Experiments.
    It            of the convex lens, that when its aperture
          is a property
is contracted, the image of a near object is painted at the
same       distance from        the   glass,   as   a    remote one when its
aperture      is enlarged.
   The instrument with which I made the following expe
riments   consists of two large tubes, one within the other,
like the tubes of a telescope. At the end of the large tube
a double convex lens of 24 inches focus is fixed to represent
the crystalline lens ; and the other end of the instrument
contains a piece of ground glass, 4} inches in diameter,
polished on one side, to represent the retina. This instrument,
being fixed upon a proper stand, was carried into a room
and placed at about five feet from a window from which
I   had an extensive view.
                               First Experiment.
    After    Icontracted the object glass to two inches, I
                 had
drew out the inner tube until the picture of remote objects
was distinctly  painted upon the rough                    glass, but near ob
jects were represented imperfectly.                                                       •
                             Second    Experiment.
  When T had contracted the aperture of the lens to half
an inch, near objects were represented very distinctly, but
the picture       of remote objects        was less conspicuous.
                               Third Experiment.
  The aperture of the lens being further contracted to       of                 -J-
an inch in diameter, all outward objects appeared indistinct                          ;
but   a   plumb-line, which hung down                   the middle   of   the   win
dow, was clearly represented upon the artificial retina. This
line was not seen upon the retina in the first experiment,
and only like an enlarged shadow in the second.       The                         di
stance between the glasses was the same                     in all the experi-
                                       Y   4                                ments,

ments, and no alteration whatever was made                                    in the instru
ment,   except in the aperture of the lens.
   Whence it is evident, that a large pupil gives us a distinct
view of remote objects ; that a contracted pupil gives us a
clear view of near objects ; and that no part of the eye, ex
cept the iris, suffers any change in making these adjust
ments.
The same Property                   of Vision demonstrated                by a more simple
                                           Experiment.
     Let   a remote object be            observed through an aperture of
about      3*5.   of     an     inch in diameter, made in the manner al
ready mentioned,                  and      if   the object be seen in a proper light
it will    appear          as   distinct        as tothe naked eye.    Then intro
duce a pin, or any other small object, in a line between the
remote object and the eye, at the distance of five or six
inches from     and these two objects will appear as distinct
                         it,
when seen together as when                                   they are viewed separately     ;
but the moment the aperture                             is    taken away from before the
eye, the near object will be seen very indistinctly and as                        ;
the aperture may be removed so instantaneously as to render
itimpossible for any change to take place in the internal
parts    of   the        eye,    it   is   therefore evident, that the iris           is   the
                       is by
only organ                     which   the eye          is   adjusted to distinct vision.
   Hence        as clearly proved as any proposition in optics,
                  it
that the rays issuing from    near object, after having passed
                                                 a
through    small aperture, are conveyed to the same point
              a
upon the retina as those from      remote one    the rays from
                                                        a                ;
both objects being nearly parallel.
   These experiments also prove, that an eye which has
lost the crystalline lens,  the iris has not received any in
                                            if
jury, may still retain                 its power             of adjustment.

p. 143,) after I had left Town, and could not therefore at
tend to the proof which the engraver obligingly sent me,
unfortunately contains three errors, which I beg here to
correct, viz. the minor THIRD should be   161 2 &c., instead
of 191.  The   numerator of the ratio of the DIEZE minimum
should be 19,683, instead of 16,983 ; and that of the COMMA
and HALF should be 1953 instead of 1593. At page 142,
vol. xxviii., the temperament or difference of the equal tem
perament V, from the Diatonic V, should also be corrected
and made — 2 — TV m, instead of — 1-J- 2 — ^ m.
   Such of your readers as arc in the habit of attending at

  446          On the Stanhope and other Temperaments
  proceedings I did expect (when I left Town in August last)
  would quickly appear to the public, from the proof of the
  first sheet of a printed Narrative of transactions, between
  certain persons relative to the Stanhope Temperament, which
 was shown to me at the Institution ; and as this         "  Narra
 tive" promised to throw some additional light upon the Let
 ter to the Duke of Cumberland, relating to me, (vol. xxviii.
 p. 143,) I abstained from replying thereto before I went
 out    of Town.     Since my return, which was but a short
 time before Christmas, I have not been able to learn any
 thing concerning     the progress of the  " Narrative,"  but hear,
 that the public may very shortly expect some further remarks
 from his Lordship on his Temperament, and which it were
 much     to be   wished (for the interests of science) that his
 Lordship would communicate through the medium of your
 Magazine. On these accounts, I shall further defer my ob
 servations on his Lordship's Letter, and on the merits or
 defects of his system, since the appeal to mathematical
writings and truths which I meditate, may perhaps apply
 at once to the whole of his Lordship's case, if he really has
anything further to advance, and save me and your readers
much trouble : in the mean time, as a great part of his
Lordship's Plain Statement is made to turn on a comparison
of his system with      three others,  viz.  the Isotonic or equal
temperament,      M. Print's    system,   and  that  of M. Kirn*
larger,    I beg to present your readers with the notes of these
three systems, expressed in the small intervals 2, f and m,
as has been done for his Lordship's system, in my table,

 In    the month     of August there were admitted on the books
 of the City and Finsbury Dispensaries 189 surgical patients.
                Cured or relieved             -        -        171

     Mrs. A. C.      aet.  53,   of a   thin  spare habit      of body   and  of
 « very delicate constitution,             has   been afflicted with     hernia
 in the left thigh upwards of            20 years    :  it first appeared sub
  sequent to a difficult labour,          and was much aggravated by a
 second labour about two years afterwards : she suffered much
 from carrying heavy burthens, and was frequently confined
  to the house for some days. For about the first eight years
 it could be easily returned by placing the body in a hori
  zontal position      ;  but from that time it has been irreducible,
  and occasionally attended          with great pain, sickness, vomit
  ing,   and   constipation of the bowels j for which, however,
  she had not      any surgical assistance till the present attack,
                                                                          which

     which took place on Monday August 24th, when she was
    seized with violent pain and tension of the abdomen similar
    to labour pains. The neighbours gave her the usual carmina
    tives ; but the pain increased,      the tumour     enlarged, vomit
    ing, hiccup,    and cold sweats        came on   ; she was worse on
    the 25th, and      was   delirious  at   night. On the 26th in the
    morning    an aperient medicine was given,         but that was im
    mediately rejected on its being received into the stomach.
    At four o'clock in the afternoon an enema was injected, but
    that also returned immediately without any feculent matter.
    On the 27th      she   was much worse during the whole day,
    feculent matter being vomited in large quantities. I saw her
    for ihe first time at nine o'clock in the evening, when the
   pulse was scarcely perceptible, the extremities cold, the eyes
   had a peculiar wild stare, and the body was partially covered
   with a profuse cold sweat : she appeared to be nearly in arti-
   culo mortis. Having explained the extreme danger of the case
   to the patient and to her husban,d, she expressed            her desire
   of having the operation immediately performed. The hernia
   was situated under Poupart's ligament, on the inner side of
   the large blood-vessels (the usual seat of crural or femoral
   hernia). An incision of about            three inches   in length was
   made through       the integuments along the        middle of the tu
   mour, beginning at the inferior edge of Poupart's ligament.
   The fascia was thin, and very little adipose substance inter
  vened between the integuments and hernial sac; which last
   was also extremely thin, but did not contain any fluid, and
   adhered to the omentum, which was much discoloured and
  compressed, the circulation having ceased in every part of it.
   It  was then removed by excision close to the mouth of the
  sac, the edges of the integuments were supported in contact,
  by two sutures and some straps of adhesive plaster.                The
  patient lay perfectly quiet during the operation, from which
  she did not express any sensation of pain. Two spoonfuls of
  an aperient medicine were then given, which remained on the
  stomach.     She was quiet during the night, but did not sleep.
  28ih. There hadnot been any pain or sickness since the ope
  ration, the pulse was somewhat more distinct, but the ex-
  Vremitics   remained cold. The aperient medicine was repeated,
                                                                     and

       On the Means             of gaining Power in Mechanics.                      351
and succeeded by a copious evacuation by stool. The hic
cup and vomiting returned in the evening for a short time ;
after which she slept well, and was much recovered in the
morning, when               some breakfast with an appetite.
                          she took
September the 1st the wound was dressed, which had nearly
healed by the first intention ; she appeared to be gaining
health and strength rapidly,                 and was completely            recovered
by the 10th.
  In the course of the year 1807, 1419 surgical patients
have been admitted on the books of the City Dispensary.

                                  To    Mr. Tillock.
       SIR,
Among          the mathematicians             of   every age much labour arid
time have been employed to discover the means of gaining me
chanical power ; and even in these enlightened limes, although
numerous individuals    of distinguished talents and reputation
persist in asserting the impossibility of gaining such power,
the contrary            opinion        is,
                              notwithstanding,    cherished and
acted upon         bymany, perhaps, of equal genius and science.
                        as
Yet,     inconsistent as  may appear, the result of the experi
                                 it
ments and practice during more than 2000 years,      that                     is,
principles and maxims have gradually been established ut
terly discouraging everv hope of success                     in   the pursuit.
                                                                                    This

 352       On the Means          of gaining Power in Mechanics.
     This variance of opinion among those who may fairly                               be
 presumed the best informed and most intelligent,  respecting
 a very   simple mathematical question, (as it may be here
 after proved,) implies, or rather makes it evident, that
 doubts have been, and are still, entertained of the infalli
 bility of the admitted principles ; and there is reason to su
 spect, that to the influence these have had on the generality
 of mathematicians and mechanics, may be imputed the
 disappointments experienced in many of their attempts,
 which might else have succeeded : for it is remarked, that
 the world is mostly indebted for discoveries and inventions
 to illiterate men, whose genius was not checked or restrained,
 like that of the learned, by rules and maxims, beyond which
 they never dare or deign to look.
    As    a mere private gentleman,                having    but a very super
 ficialknowledge         of mechanics, in which I occasionally
amuse myself with experiments,        my taking ground on
either side is quite out of the question ; but I am going to
state a fact which cannot be controverted, and which, iu
addition to the instance of CEffyreus's wheel, seems to jus
tify those who are seeking the perpetual motion.
    I have constructed an engine, rather simple than com
plicate, which produces the following effect :
    On applying my moving power,                    a weight    of two pounds—
while this descends through a space of only three feet, a
weight of twenty pounds is thereby raised two feet per
pendicular*.
   Some friends and              acquaintances        to whom        this circum
stance was mentioned,             were either incredulous,       or suspected
my being deceived in the operation of                   the machine, or mis
taken in some other way.     But the operation is so very
nimple that I cannot be mistaken  or deceived ; for the en

      DEAR SIR,
xiMONG all            the     casualties to which ( vegetable life is ex
posed,     nothing         seems so destructive or difficult to be ob
viated,    as   the      effects   of predatory insects.     There   is pro
bably an infinite variety of vermin, particularly in green
houses, stoves, and similar contrivances to force vegetation,
which, in       the shape       of flies, caterpillars, worms, or grubs,
are constantly blasting the hopes                of the cultivator.     I be
lieve, however,             it has been      clearly ascertained, that the
most prevailing            and    obnoxious of all these enemies is the
plant-louse, the aphis of Linnasus; a genus perhaps the
most numerous of the whole system, for every kind of ve
getable has, it is said, a species of this insect, to whose
ravages      it   is peculiarly       liable  : and  another circumstance
tends materially to confirm               the mischief, when it has once
begun, for, according to the general opinion o/ naturalists,
these pernicious animals multiply with astonishing rapidity
and certainty,            wherever they         intrude;  and   from     their

   It must give great satisfaction to those who practise or

mind it might be,       were we in possession of a good literary
historv of the Arabs,        Persians, and Turks, there has been
no work of this description yet attempted, from the insur
mountable difficulties hitherto attending its execution. These
difficulties do not ariae from the three Eastern nations al
luded to having neglected to transmit to posterity the history
of those of their countrymen who have cultivated the va
rious branches of science        and literature.  It is rather the
abundance     of the   books of this description they have com
posed, than the want of materials, which has been the ob
stacle to the execution of a literary history of the East.
Grammarians,       interpreters and lecturers upon the Alcoran,
theologians of all     classes, doctors and jurisconsults    of all
sects, philosophers, physicians, historians, prose-writers,
poets ; — in short, from the immediate companions of the
Prophet down to those who in the last century were the
honour of Turkish literature, all have found their historians,
as well as the khalifs, the sultans, and their ministers.      Be
sides  all this, we have histories of celebrated       men   of all
kinds, of each     of  the  principal cities in the country of the
Mussulmen, such as Mecca, Medina, Sanaa, Damas, Bag
dad, Cairo, &c. We may add, that in most of the annals
composed by the Arab historians, such as Ebn-Athir,
Aboulfeda,     Makrizi, Aboulmahasen and others, we find,
after the recital of the political events of each year, a ne-
crological article, containing the names of all the celebrated
men who died in the course of the year, with more or less
detailed accounts of their lives and writings.         With these
materials,    however, for composing a literary history of the
Eastern     countries,    there is a multitude of difficulties to
be removed before we can render our materials of any
service.
   The literary history of      a  nation may be divided into two
principal parts : the history of letters and sciences, and that
of the persons who have cultivated them. The first ought
to make us acquainted with the commencement, and the
various revolutions, of each science or particular branch of
literature, and the causes which have concurred to accelerate
or retard its progress. It is the systematic part of literary
                                   Z 2                     historv,

396                 Notices respecting New Books.
history,     in which       those who     have   acquired celebrity in
learning or science by their labours, their discoveries, or
their errors, appear by turns upon the stage, but merely as
an accessory part of the picture, and without drawing off
the attention from the principal          object to fix it upon each of
them in particular.           The second part of literary history,
which may be called biographical, is composed of the par
ticular histories of those who have contributed, either by
their own labours or by their influence and benefactions, to
 the cultivation and advancement of human knowledge.
Each of them here appears isolated, in order to make us ac
 quainted with the time, place, and circumstances in which
he lived, the means of instruction which nature or fortune
 presented     to him, the application      he made   of them, the la
bours for which posterity is indebted to him, the services
he rendered, the monuments he has-bequeathed of his talents
 and zeal.       According to the importance of the part which
 each of them has performed, he occupies in this kind of histo
 ric gallery a space more or less considerable ; but no person
whose literary or scientific career has been marked by any
 (tervice rendered, or any work left to posterity, should be
 omitted.       Thus   the principal  cities, the seats of administra
 tion,    or the places illustrated by any great events, have
 claims to a place in the general chart of a great empire ; and
when it is requisite to draw a map of a province, the small
 est cottage,     which contributes its     share to the support     of the
 charges    of  the  state,  cannot  be omitted    without   hijustg.ce.
    The biographical part of literary history is, properly
 speaking, the only one with which the Orientalists are oc
 cupied ; and it is only by comparing and classifying the
 abundant materials of this kind which they have left us, that
 we can afterwards extract what is necessary for composing
 the systematic part neglected by them.             It is therefore with
 biographical       history exclusively we must commence : but
 even here the task is not easy ; it requires great opportuni
 ties, time, and discernment, and the concurrence of several,
 as the following observations will convince us.
     In  the first place,     all the materials for a labour of this
 kind     are   in manuscript,       and consequently       they require
                                                                     much

                  Notices respecting New Books.                   357
much critical skill, and a knowledge far from superficial           of
the languages in which they are written.
    Secondly, it is impossible to unite all these materials;
                                                                    —
the number of booksellers who possess them is not very
considerable, and but a small part of them falls to the lot
of each. Some even of the most essential documents do
not appear to have      as yet    arrived in Europe,      or are alto
gether unknown.
    Thirdly, the Orientalists     having but a small number of
proper names,     the  same name, Abdallah, for example, or
Mahomed, Ali, Hassan, Hosain, &c, is necessarily com
mon to a very great number           of men.       In order to remedy
the confusion which would             result from this homonymy,
there is added to the name       of  each, 1st, a surname (conya)
taken from the name of his eldest son,           as  Abou-Mahomed,
Aboul-Hassan,       (father of Mahomed,           father of Hassan):
2d,    the name of his father, and frequently that of his
grandfather : 3d, a. surname taken from the place where he
was born,     or where he lived,    as  Ispahani, Baconi, Bagdadi,
&c. : 4th, an honorary title (lakab) — this is peculiar to the
cadis, or their assessors, the imans, the sheiks, the doc
tors, and monks — such      as  Boha-eddin,     (the splendour of re
ligion,) Djelal-eddin, (the glory of religion,) Tadj eddin,
 (the crown of religion.)      In the order of these names and
surnames, the honorary title is generally first ; then comes
the surname (conya) properly so called, then the name fol
lowed by that of the father and grandfather, and lastly, the
surname taken from the place of birth : sometimes the same
person bears several names of this last description. Thus, in
order to designate completely the celebrated physician Abd-
allatif, the author of a great number of works, he is thus
described   :  Mouwaffik-eddin Abou-Mahomed Abd-allatif
Ben Yousoff Mauseli Bagdadi.              Mouwaffik-eddin (the pro
 tector of religion)    is his   honorary title; Abou-Mahomed
 (father of Mahomet) is his surname, taken from the name
 of his eldest son ; Abd-allatif is his own name; Ben Yousoff,
 (son of Yousoff,) the surname taken from the name of his
 father j Mauseli, from Mosul, Bagdadi, frrom Bagdad, are
                                   Z   3                     surnames,

358               Notices respecting Neiv Books.
surnames, which intimate that his family was originally from
Mosul, but that he was born at Bagdad. Many individuals
have, besides, certain nicknames, or surnames taken from
some illustrious ancestor, or circumstance of their life. This
multitude    of names     and   surnames contributes     in several
ways to throw      much    confusion  upon literary history, and
chiefly because they rarely designate a person by the whole
of these names, and the same individual is sometimes called
by his honorary titb only, as Djelal-eddin, or by his name
without any surname,       as Abd-allatif, or by the name of his
son, as Aboulabbas, (the father of Abbas,) or by that of
his father, as Ebn-Arabschah, (the son of Arabschah,) or
lastly, by the surname taloen from the place of his birth, as
Djordjani, Schahrestani, Soyouti.          We    may  be often led
into error, therefore, by supposing      several personages  to be
one only, and vice versa. In the second place, the copyists,
 by omitting the words Abou, (father,) or Ebn, (son,) or
confounding together these two words, often call Abd-allah,
 or Abd- ah ah man, the person who is really called father
 or son of Abd-allah, or Abd-alrahman. Lastly, there is so
 great a number of celebrated men, whom we arc accustomed
 to know merely by one of their surnames, that the Oriental
 biographers themselves can -neither discover their names or
 surnames.      There are none of the learned who are occupied
 with the literature of the East, without excepting Herbelot
 and Caziri, who have not been often led into error from some
 of  these causes.    The titles of books being also almost al
 ways   conceived   in an indistinct manner, and several works
 of various writers having either the same or very similar
 titles, this is also a new source of-mistakes, from which the
 Eastern historians themselves have not always been exempt.
     From all these considerations, it is evident, we are not yet
 competent to the task of a general history of the literature
 and science of the Arabs, Persians, and Turks ; and we
 must begin by clearing away this chaos, and by putting the
 materials into the hands of a greater number of persons, by
 publishing successively, either entire or in extracts, the
 most important works of this kind. It is also to be wished,
                                                               that

                 Notices respecting  New Books.              355
that no occasion should be neglected of giving detached no
tices upon the most celebrated writers ; and by pointing out
their names and writings, we .should employ all the means
furnished by criticism,   in order to present with the greatest
possible exactness,   and in original characters, the entire
name of the authors, and titles of their works.
    The most important books of this description,     and those
which    would  furnish  the  greatest  number   of articles for
literary history, are:
    The Kitab Aljihrisi, by Aboul-faradji Mohamed Ben-
Ishak, better known by the name of Ebn-Abi-Yacoub Ne-
dim : it is a catalogue of Arabian authors and their works,
for the three first centuries of the llegira and a part of the
fourth.
    The JVafyat Alayan, or dictionary of illustrious men, by
Ebn-Khilcan.
    The Tarik/i Alislam, by Dhehebi.
    The Menlwl Alsapi, another.dictionarv of the same kind,
composed by Aboulmahassen, forming a continuation of
the preceding.
    The Kitab Almohadhara,     an abridged   history  of Egypt,
by Soyouti, which contains a very useful      catalogue of cele
brated men who lrave been born or lived in that country.
    The Kitab Casclif Aldkonnun, or library of Arabian, Per
sian, and Turkis.li books, by Hadji Khalfa.
    This last work, of which Herbelot has already made so
 great use, is the same from which the author of the Cyclo-
 pedical View of the Sciences of the East has extracted the
greatest part of the materials he has collected in the volume
now before us ; but he has also laid under contribution six
other works,   four of which     are written  in Arabic, one in
Persian, and   one in Turkish.
    The author explains, in the preface, the plan according; to
 which he has arranged the extracts from these various works.
The last six have merely served to supply the desiderata in
 the general picture of the sciences of the East by Hadji
 Khalfa.    Sometimes the extracts of several of these works
 have been blended together;    but oftener he has contented
 himself with abridging them, indicating the source of each in
                               Z  4                   particular,

particular, and leaving to his readers the care of comparing
and combining them. This arrangement is disadvantageous
to the author, and favourable to the critic, who may thus
compare more easily each of these extracts or abridged
translations with the originals, and thus ascertain and rec
tify the errors which may have escaped the translator.
   Frequently,  persons who devote their attention to one
branch of literature, and who have wasted much lime and
labour in acquiring profound knowledge, contract a kind of
enthusiastic love for the object of their studies, which some
times appears excessive to readers who judge with greater
coolness.  The author of the work now before us does not
appearaltogether free from this weakness ; and there are
few who will consent to allow Hadji Khalfa the epithets
bestowed upon him by our anonymous author, of the triple
Hermes of the literature of the East, the Bacou, the Meusel
of the Arabs, Persians,   and Turks.  We may, however,
excuse this exaggeration in a man of letters, who has had
courage enough to undertake a dry and painful task ; and
we ought to remember, that, without this enthusiasm, the
most of those works which have extended our knowledge,
and placed the study of the sciences and literature in the
flourishing state they now are, would never have existed.
   We find, immediately after the preface, the Life of Hadji
Khalfa, whose name is Mustafa, the son of Abd-allah ; his
surname, Hadji Khalfa, is composed of two Arabian words,
Hadji (pilgrim), and Khalifa, or, as the Turks write and
pronounce        it,
              Khalfa or Kafa (assessor)   he takes the name
                                                     :
of Hadji from having accomplished the pilgrimage to Mecca
in the year 1043 of the Hegira, (A. D. 1633,) and he
added Khalfa to    when he obtained the place of second
                        it
assessor in the office       of Basch-mohoesebe, or chief of the
accounts.        He    was also known    the name of Catib Tche-

                                         himself, was printed
with his Chronological Talles,      work of which there

The Turkish editor of these Chronological Tables has finished
the Life of Hadji Khalfa, which the latter had added to one
of his works, entitled Mizan-Alhakk, i.e. The Balance of
Truth. It shows us Hadji Khalfa consecrating the greatest
part of his life to study or teaching,             neglecting no method
of increasing his knowledge,               and   voluntarily renouncing
the pleasures and         illusions of ambition, in order to amass,
in tranquillity, the materials for a great number of useful
works, with which he has successively enriched the litera
ture of his country.           He finished his mortal career in the
year 1068 of the Hegira (A. D. 1657). We are ignorant
how old he was, the year of his birth not being mentioned ;
but it is probable that he was not 60, since he was ap
pointed to the situation of adjunct or commissary in the
office of accounts for Natolia, being the first he filled, in
the year 1032.
    To the Life of Hadji Khalfa, in itself a precious relic of
literary history, succeed short notices of the seven original
works,    the extracts       from    which compose the work before
us; and    after   all,  a tale    in the form of a dialogue, extracted
from the    last of     these     works  j but   the original Arabic   has
for its author, according to report, Imam Gayali.
    The interlocutors engaged in this dialogue are,              a young
Arab named Beschir,              and a young Persian named      Schadan,
 and   their conversation takes place in presence of the khalif
 Haroun Raschid,           who arrives at the moment these two
 young people, both strangers, meet, and imbibe a mar
 vellous sympathy for each other. The khalif, after having
 received their salutations and politely answered them, struck
 with the vivacity of their looks,            addresses  himself   to  Be
 schir, and      asks   him whence he came, and how old he is.
 Beschir answers him in a sententious and enigmatical                man
 ner.    To   the question put by         Haroun,    "  Combien  d'annees
 avez-vous     ?" (How old         are you f)  "  Aucunes."   (None)    he
 amwered     :  the years are in the hands of God !           How many
 do you count,         then    ?   I count,   said  the  Arab, from one
                                                                        UP

   362               Notices respecting New Books.
   up to 100,000. In what manner, said the khalif with emo
   tion, must I interrogate yon in order to obtain a rational
   answer?      Ask me, said Beschir, how much time of my
   life has gone past.      The khalif puts this question to him,
   and receives for answer, Fourteen years. He then leaves the
   two young philosophers to themselves.
       Schadan earnestly entreats Ecschir to enter into conversa
  tion with him, and to place him among the number of his
  friends ; but Beschir, who does not seem inclined to receive
  as    friends  any who could      not by their talents or wisdom
  contribute to the improvement       of his mind and heart, sub
 jects Schadan to a rigorous examination, from which the
  latter does not shrink : " for you know," says he to Beschir,
  " what the Arab proverb says : Amid the flying sand of the
 Desert, we can easily distinguish a man on horseback from
 him who is mounted on an ass."
      The questions put by Beschir to Schadan turn upon sub
jects of dogmatic theology, the interpretation, of          the  Alco
 ran, grammar, etymology,            poetics, aesthetics,    gnomics,
 lexicology, scriptures, jurisprudence, traditional          theology,
 medicine and morals ; and the answers of Schadan           leave him
 nothing     to desire.  The two young people then embrace, and
 swear a sincere,     friendship. The khalif, who had overheard
their whole conversation,        can scarcely  believe his ears.    All
the readers     of this work will not   partake  in this enthusiasm,
perhaps, upon hearing that Beschir proposes questions of the
following nature : What is the Arab word, which, with
out any change of letters, can be a verb, noun, and parti
ciple ? Why do walnuts eaten before dinner lock up the bow
els, and when taken after dinner produce a contrary effect ?
Why is a certain word in the Alcoran a nominative ?
     We must admire the answers of Schadan, however, when
Beschir asks where God was before he created the world ?
and wherefore did he create it ? Schadan thus answers these
questions :
                  " Where indicates a place ; and God not being
contained in any space, to ask where God tvas, is an absurd
question.       The manner of acting peculiar to God is too
elevated to afford room for asking how and uherefare he
                                                                 acts :

                  Notices respecting New Books.                   3C3
acts  ;  by the sole omnipotence of his will he has produced
those things which his knowledge embraced, and he pro
duced them without means and without cause."
    Schadan     answers   several   literary  questions in a similar
manner     ; we shall quote one     only, which    presents a pleasing
anecdote.       Beschir  asks    him    the origin   of this Arabian
proverb    : "The    camel would be      a good bargain, were it not
for the cursed animal hanging at its neck            ;"  and  Schadan
relates the   following   story :
    An Arab who         was plagued with a vicious camel, ex
claimed in    a  moment of anger :         " May my wife be always
barren     if I  do not sell thee for a piece of silver !"         His
choler being over, he devised the following method of ful
filling his oath, which he repented. He suspended a cat to
the neck of his camel, and cried round the market,                 "A
camel and cat to sell together, but not separately ; the camel
for a piece of silver, and the cat for 400." The people hear
ing this, exclaimed in         the  words of the proverb : " The
camel would be       a good bargain, were it not for the cursed
 animal at its neck."
    Haroun invites the two young philosophers to his palace,
thinking himself fortunate in securing their friendship.
 " Servant of God," said Beschir to him, " thy society is
as little fit for us as ours is for thee."          " How so ?" said
 Haroun. "Because," answered the Arab, " thou art the
 slave of our slaves." The khalif became angry, but Beschir
 soon appeased him by explaining the meaning of his answer.
Haroun dissolves into tears, and, on withdrawing, asks
Beschir to be pleased to dictate something to him upon
 which he might meditate usefully. Bescl'.ir gives him this
 passage in the    Alcoran   :
     " Have   you not seen that we have granted them several
 vears of respite? and when, the vengeance with which we
 menaced them has come upon theoi, the respite we have
 granted them has been of no use to them."
     The anonymous author has not given the sense of this
 passage correctly ; but as he gives the original in a note,
 the translation may be easily rectified by those acquainted
 with   the language.
                                                                   The

 364              Notices respecting New Books.
    The work of Hadji Khalfa consists of        a short preface, an
introduction,     a bibliographical    dictionary,   and the con
clusion.
    The preface displays in few words the object the author
has in view.      The introduction is divided into five chapters,
subdivided into sections, paragraphs, &c. The first chap
 ter has for its object the definition of science in general, its
division into various principal branches, and the subdivisions
of these last ; the second treats of the origin and history of
sciences and books ; the third, of the different classes of
writers and books ; the fourth contains         general considera
tions upon the      sciences,  upon those    who   have cultivated
them, upon the circumstances which favour their cultiva
tion, and the obstacles to their progress; upon the qualities
which a learned man onght to possess, and other similar
subjects : the fifth chapter is a kind of supplement to the
former, and contains various miscellaneous observations not
alluded to in the preceding chapters.
    In spite of the multitude of divisions and      subdivisions in
this treatise,  which may be regarded as a synoptical picture
of   the sciences, and every thing relating to them, we do
not think Hadji Khalfa has adopted the most perspicuous
arrangement.       He has often confounded considerations of a
general nature with those which have a particular object;
and although he may have had some idea of a general sy
stem of human knowledge, he is far from having realised
this idea in a manner to entitle him to rank with Bacon,
or the author     of  the preliminary    discourse to the French
Encyclopedia.
   The work, however, notwithstanding its faults, deserves
to be better known. The introduction is the most deserving
of notice ; and our anonymous author has translated it from
beginning to end, with some slight exceptions, and it oc
cupies nearly 160 pages of the volume.               Some people,
perhaps, would have preferred the suppression of this intro
duction,    and would have wished to have seen,         if  not the
whole,   at  least the principal articles  of the Bibliographical
Dictionary of Hadji Khalfa, from which those who cultivate
Oriental literature would certainly derive very great advantages.

     The
       learned and philosophical author of Mithridates                       is
now no more, having finished a long laborious life, at the
age of 75, about   year ago. He was one of the most in
                          a
defatigable scholars in Germany,      country already so fertile
                                                 a

                              ;
and was distinguished in several other branches of science.

is    much celebrated in Germany as that of Dr. Johnson

besides his learned and judicious works upon German phi
lology, Adelung              has     published    numerous      and    valuable
writings, both upon civil and literary history, as upon ra
tional philosophy,   physics, chemistry, and finally upon
diplomacy.   See the " Teutchland Gelehrte" of Hamberger

                         a
years of assiduous labour, will furnish general notions upon all
the languages, and the texts of each are carefully explained.
The author has only been able to finish what concerns the
languages of Asia and those of Europe. This first part com
prehends the languages of Asia to the number of 159.
   The second part     preparing for the press, and will em

for granted that the work will be continued and completed,
that we may flatter ourselves with possessing    this book      in
every thing which the title promises, namely, general ideas
                                                                           upon

  upon all the known idioms, and the Pater Nosier in fivchnn-
  dred languages or dialects.
     We shall then         be in   possession, within a very narrow
  compass, of the materials necessary for resolving the splen
  did problem in the author's contemplation : we shall know
  the characters and differences of each language, in order to
  account     for the progress, followed by reason and genius,
 among the different races of mankind, for determining with
 more certainty, or conjecturing with more probability, the
 origin of the idioms,          and in part the history       of  the nations
 who speak them.
     It would seem, however, that besides vocabularies, or
 attempts at vocabularies, in each language or dialect, three
 kinds of auxiliaries would be still desirable, in order to create
 or render complete the comparative science of the idioms of
 the whole earth.
    The first would consist in faithful pictures of all the in
 tonations and articulations of the known languages.
    The second, in the different         alphabets    of  these    same lan
 guages, exactly drawn, with explanations which should an
 nounce and determine the value of each character.
    The third, in order to serve as a kind of control, would
be the knowledge         of  all the intonations    and     articulations   of
which     the human voice is susceptible.              It  is thus that,    in
the   different   artificial arrangements employed in botany, we
prefer uniting the advantages of the natural order.
    But these auxiliaries are still wanting.
    The first and second, with respect to           the dead languages ;
because,      in general these languages have several characters
and vowels and consonants, upon the value of which the
learned are not yet agreed ; and with respect to certain lan
guages     in  the Eastern part      of Asia,   because the characters
of these languages are the signs of ideas, and by no means
of sounds or articulations ; and because, when pronounced,
they give, in each of these idioms, words completely
dissimilar     with    respect    to  perfectly   identical      ideas    and
written     signs  : lastly, with     respect  even to the       living lan
guages, and       the   characters    of which   represent      intonations
and    articulations,     because,   as  repeatedly     confessed     by the
                                                                      editors

editors and  interpreters of foreign alphabets, without ex
cepting the learned sir William Jones, it is impossible to
represent in words the just value of certain characters, and
the exact intonation or articulation they express.
    We may       add upon the subject   of     the unexplained
                                                       simple
representing of the existing alphabets, thai this task alone,
which is physically possible to execute,         however, so  is,
tedious, laborious, and difficult, that in reality we have
nothing of this kind but monographies.   The work     exe                      is

  lines  : who is there so audacious, or so foolish,      as to  pretend
  to trace the scale     of  all their possible divisions, to classify
  and calculate all the effects of the general or partial con
  course and reciprocal influences of all these parts ? What
  alphabet can there be invented, to represent         by simple sign3
  so many new and delicate ideas?             What    an inexhaustible
  source of contradictions        and endless disputes ! Even at the
  present day     our   knowledge is not extended to the language
  of antient ideas.
     Let   us ask for example, between two         analogous articula
 tions   D   and  T,   which is the hard or the soft, the strong or
 the weak, we shall be told without doubt that T is the
 hardest ; and the President de Brosses, Beauzcc, &c, will
 be    quoted : nevertheless, upon opening the excellent Port
 Royal Greek Grammar and its numerous abridgments, you
 find that the T is soft ; and this grammar adds, that the
 consonant       which    rs  not soft, becomes so when we pro
 nounce it too gently.           Le Roy, in his Greek Grammar, is
 also clearly of opinion that T is soft ; and in order to finish
 the climax,     a  learned Greek Grammar lately printed informs
 us that soft is synonymous with hard.        Upon this point, there
 fore, and upon many others, the ideas and the language are
 still to be made and fixed.
     This   is a superfluous but a new       proof of this truth, so
 frequently forgotten         and  incessantly confirmed by expe
 rience, that the human mind is on all occasions forced to
 acknowledge either irs imbecility or its uncertainty.              We
find, on the subject of the alphabet, that it is often reduced,
particularly when it wishes to embrace various languages, to
content itself with approximations, probabilities, and hypo
theses ; happy if it can always avoid contradiction                 and
error.
     We shall      see  therefore without    astonishment,     that the
learned author of Mithridates has not taken the pains to
employ exotic characters, nor even to appropriate to his
use, by necessary additions, the Roman alphabet, the only
one he employs.          He  was  of opinion that this alphabet pro
nounced broad         as the  Germans do, is sufficient to render
in   a tolerable manner the value       of all the foreign alphabets.
                                                                    We

We shall find, perhaps, that this       is to content ourselves        with
a too distant     approximation : the Roman alphabet, if we
renounce exotic letters, certainly agrees better with facilita
ting  some comparison      of  the languages      with       each other —
the Russian language for example — because             the first prevails
among the most enlightened            people in    the     world   ;  but it
will only procure incomplete or inaccurate notions of the
numerous and important foreign languages, and most of
which have peculiar sounds and articulations, such as the
Roman alphabet cannot be used to express.                 It is necessary,
in order to represent faithfully these languages with the !etteis
of the Roman alphabet,        to add to this alphabet some new
characters,    as  the inhabitants of India, when writing the
Shanscrit,    when they neglect to employ the Deuanagari
characters, add certain letters to the alphabets of their Chasha
or vulgar languages, because the Shanscrit is generally richer
in sounds and intonations than the Chasha.
    M. Volney     has suggested   that the Roman alphabet might
be employed for writing the languages of Asia: see his
Methode nouvelle el facile d' apprendre les lungues Arabe,
 Persane et Turqne. Paris, 1795, in 8vo.                   This idea may
succeed    with the assistance of the learned           ;   it would save
 Europeans much       time and trouble.         An entirely      new lan
 guage has been agreed upon for chemistry            :   is it more diffi
 cult  to  grant,   for certain languages, an alphabet already
 completely    known in    a great measure, and which, in time,
 might become the universal alphabet          of the country      ?
    Whatever may be the imperfection which results in the
 new Mithridates, from the exclusive employment of the
 Roman alphabet, deprived of the additions necessary for the
 comparison of languages, we admit that this book is singu
 larly rich in facts relative to this comparison, and that it
 will be very useful even to those who possess the most
 novel works of this nature.       It will be particularly so to ex
  perienced travellers, who   may wish to procure a good guide in
 their inquiries upon the idioms of the countries they visit.

  JL HIS Society met on the evenings of the 14th and 22d,
 when A. Marsden, esq., in consequenee of the indisposition
 of the president, was in the chair. A very curious paper
 on Oxalic Acid, by Dr. T. Thomson of Edinburgh, was
  read.    It contained the results of a great variety of experi
 ments made to ascertain the relative qualities of the consti
  tuent parts of this acid, on a principle of calculation laid
  down by this able chemist in the last edition of his excellent
  System of Chemistry.       It is impossible to convey any ade
  quate  idea  of  the various  facts detailed in this interesting
  paper, in the present summary of the society's proceedings,
  as Mr. Davy's illness has unfortunately prevented him from
  attending the society, and the inexperience of the other
  secretaries in reading, and their low voices, were such as to
  render them scarcely audible.

   N.   Carlisle* esq., the secretary, laid before the society some
mgenious observations on the round painted boards, con
taining verses and figures, found in some families in Staf
fordshire, and called rondles.       A great many conjectures on
the origin and use of these round boards, about five inches
in diameter, and one fourth of an inch thick, were extracted
from the Gentleman's Magazine j and it is supposed that
they are   of the  age  of Henry VII.     o-r VIII.    ; that they had
been imported from Flanders,         and used      either  as conversa
tion cards, or wooden platters. The circumstance of their
being found chiefly in Staffordshire sanctioned this opinion,
and that they might have been the precursors of some of our
Delft ware. The poetical stanzas, written in old English
characters, supposed of the above age, are chiefly amatory,
and some of them rather indelicate          :  the poetry is generally
as bad as the sentiments are trifling.          The figures are also
very coarse, and painted mostly round the outside, and the
verses in the centre.

offered a prize of .50 golden ducats, for the best Memoir on
the following subject : " The difference of colour remarked
between the blood of the veins and that of the arteries.
having induced an opinion among several            of the learned,
that the same difference exists in the blood        of the embryo
in an inverse degree ; but as experience has never confirmed
this with respect to new-born infants, the society is de
 sirous that, by researches and direct experiments upon in
 fants bora of healthy mothers, (either by the instant liga
 ture of the umbilical cord at its two extremities, at the
 moment of their birth, or in any other way,) it should be
 determined   if there really exists an inverse difference   in the
 colour of the blood    ;  in what it consists ; what are the con
 stituent principles of the blood of the infant ; — keeping out
of the question the acid particles, which must be mixed with
 it by the contact of the atmosphere i"

*' What is the influence of the acid and other kinds of gases
upon electricity produced by friction ? and what arc the
 relations of the other electrical phenomena, such as attrac
 tions, repulsions, sparks, &c, with the principal gases ?"

but the memoirs not being satisfactory, it has been renewed
 for the year 1 809.
       LVI.   Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
               PROFESSOR DAVY'S NEW METALS.
  JL he experiments of Mr. Davy on the alkalies were            re
 peated on the 14th and 28th instant (January) before the
 Askesian and Mineralogical Society, with a very large Gal
 vanic apparatus of Mr. Pepys's, consisting of 120 pairs of
 plates of 36 inches surface each         (containing near seven
           4                                              hundred

                     Professor Davy's New Metals.                            373
 hundred  weight of copper and zinc).   The solid caustic
 potash was used, slightly moistened by the breath.  The
 metaloid obtained was highly inflammable, swam in recti
 fied naphtha,       but was difficultly separated from the potash,
 in which it   is   plentifully imbedded, after being exposed to the
 Galvanic action. Water being dropped upon                 it,
                                                 the particles
 explode similarly to grains of gunpowder thrown into the fire.
      The metaloid obtained from       not so highly inflam
                                          soda    is
 mable, and can therefore be collected more easily.   A glo
 bule about the size of  small tare being thrown on paper
                               a
 moistened, instantly became apparently red-hot, and, run
 ning off the surface of the paper, fell luminously through
 the air.
      Mr. Allen     has also repeated     Mr. Davy's experiments, and
 obtained both the metaloids              byfour troughs of fifty pairs
 each of sixteen inches surface.             The metaloids obtained by
 Mr. Allen were exhibited            by   Dr. Marcct at the Theatre of
 Guy's Hospital.
      Mr. Dibdin, in his introductory lecture           at the Royal      Insti
 tution,   afew days ago, announced that some of the primi
 tive earths, as they are called, such as Barytes and Strontian,
 having many alkaline qualities, Mr. Davy was induced
 to submit them to similar experiments, and has discovered
 that these also consist of metallic bases, united to oxygen,
 forming compound bodies analogous to the two fixed alkalies.
                               To   Mr. Tillock.
        RIR,                                           London, Jan.   24, 1808.
  I     am convincedyou would not wish any mistakes to re
 main uncorrected in your excellent Magazine.
  I  have just read the account given in the Number for
 November, of Mr. Davy.s Bakerian Lecture. Your Report,
      am sorry to say,    is   in some particulars not
                                                 quite correct.
I Iwas present at the reading of the paper before the Royal
 Society, and     paid particular attention to the statements
                    I
 of facts.
    It will be merely doing justice to the author, to mention
 accurately the particulars of his important discovery.
                                     A    a   3                                   It

37*               Napoleon's       Prlzefor Galvanism.
    It is stated in your Magazine, that the basis of potash
is volatile at 100°.        Mr. Davy's account was, that               "it  is
volatile at    a heat a  little below     redness." — It   is likewise said
that the amalgam of the bases of potash and quicksilver, when
applied in the circle of a Galvanic battery, dissolved iron,
silver,     gold, and platina.         Mr. Davy merely mentioned
that it dissolved these metals ; he said nothing that I can
recollect of the Galvanic battery.
    Glass, it is said by the Reporter on the Lecture, as well
as   all other metallic bodies, was dissolved by the basis of
potash.
    The    real statement     with   regard to glass was, that the basis
of potash decomposed it by combining with its alkali, and
by forming a red oxide of less degree of oxygenation than
potash ; which oxide was likewise procured by other means.
    It is stated that the specific gravity of the basis of soda is
to that    of water   as 7 to     10.   Mr. Davy    said "   as 9 to    10."
    Mr. Davy mentioned nothing about                 the  effects   of  these
new      and extraordinary         bodies    upon  the   phosphates and
phosphurets; but detailed some remarkable experiments on
 the phenomena of their combinations with phosphorus
 and sulphur.       lie  said    nothing concerning the specific gra
vity    of the  amalgams of       the bases of potash and soda.
    As   the account in       the   Philosophical   Magazine has been,
 copied into many periodical publications, it is but justice to
the discoverer of these new facts to correct its inaccuracies ;
 as  otherwise they may be attributed to the author by those
who     repeat his experiments, on the faith of the statements.
    You will, therefore, I trust,          take the trouble     of inserting
thi« letter in your next number.           I am, sir, with   great respect,
                                your obliged humble servant,

    The annual prize of 3000 livres, founded by               the emperor
of    the French     for the best experiment made in the course
of the year on the Galvanic fluid, has been decreed to Mr.
Davy, member of the Royal Society of London, for his

               NEW PHOTOMETRICAL          TELESCOPE.
   Dr. Brewster of Edinburgh       has invented a photometrical
telescope, the primary object of which is to ascertain the
relative brightness of the fixed stars, though it is capable of
measuring the relative intensities of all other lights.       With
out any additional apparatus, it becomes          a micrometer   for
measuring the distance of any two stars          comprehended in
the field of view, or the angle subtended       by any two lumi
nous points.
                SINGULAR CURE FOR THE OOuT.
    M.  Cadet de Vaux, in his Journal         d'Economie Rurale,
mentions the following     as a fact :
    "A    lady above eighty years      of  age,  whom    I  have the
 honour of knowing intimately,          was attacked with rheu
matic gout thirty years ago. It seized therwhole body ; her
 pains were excessive ; and during six weeks the efforts of
 art to relieve her were ineffectual ; when a friend of the lady
mentioned the cure of a similar disorder by drinking enor
 mous quantities of hot water, to the amount of forty-eight
 glasses in the space of twelve hours.         The severity of the
 pains the lady endured determined her to make the experi
ment, and she set about taking, every quarter of an hour, a
 cup containing seven or eight ounces of hot water (not
 merely warm, as this occasions vomiting, an effect that is
 not required). Thirty glasses were found sufficient to re
 move     the pains, as it were by enchantment.            She then
 stopped, and fell into a profound sleep, which she had not
 enjoyed for a long time before. Nothing of the disorder
 remained, except a sense of weight in one arm ; but dreading
 a relapse,   she determined,   after  a  fortnight, to repeat the
 operation, and carried it on this occasion to forty glasses ;
 when hunger, and a desire to sleep, put a stop to the expe
 riment.     From this time   the cure was complete.
    "About fifteen years afterwards, the same lady, then sixty-
 five years old, had a new attack of her former disease, with
 an entire loss of the use of her limbs t she had recourse to
 her former remedy of hot water, and with the same success
 as before.     From that time she has had no return of the
 disease,   and at present enjoys a good state     of health."

   376                Singular Clock. — Lectures.
     M.  GriebeJ,    a watch-maker   of Paris, has invented a clock
  without weights, of     a globular form, the dial-plate of which
  is transparent, and, by means of a reflecting lamp on Ar-
  gand's construction, shows the figure to a great distance.
  By a particularity of formation, neither the wheels, the
  hands, nor the pendulum, cast any shadow.          The light may
 be made stronger or weaker, and adapted to the sick-cham
  ber, or to clocks in the most public situations ; where it
 answers the purpose of a time-piece and a lamp at the same
 time.

I.     On the two Systems             of Musical Temperament recom
    mended      by   Earl Stanhope, — Mr. Hawkes's System, &c.
    By Mr. JOHN FAREY.
                                To  Mr. Tilloch.
        SIR'
TJ
JLIAVING         bestowed some pains to illustrate the System of
Musical Temperament described by Earl Stanhope in your
xxvth volume,         as   applicable to keyed Instruments, by the
help     of   a   Monochord,        whose divisions are according to
geometric mean proportionals, I beg now to present to your
readers, the notes of the other System, described by his
Lordship in the        same Essay,        to be effected by making three
successive      tempered     Fifths, and two     successive   major Thirds,
in different       parts   of the scale,      beal   equally quick respec
tively.
    The table accompanying this, is divided into 10 columns,
entitled at the bottom, as has usually been done.
    Column 4 contains the number of complete vibrations
made by a musical string or other sounding body in one
second of time, when the intervals are agreeable to Earl
Stanhope's Monochord System ; whose logarithms, lengths
of strings, and other particulars for comparison herewith,
will be found vol. xxvii. p. 195 *, and vol. xxviii. p. 141 .
   * I
       beg here to coirect an unfortunate error in the length of string which
I have in this    page assigned to Lord Stanhope's 6th, owing to my having
taken out the number answering to the logarithm -8100300 (instead of
•8010f!OO) viz. -6456987 instead of -6324554 ; for which correction I with to
acknowledge my obligation to Mr. J. Barraud, a gentleman engaged in these
inquiries, who has verified the numbers in this column, except in some of their
last places, independent   of thelogarithms iu the preceding column.

4                         On      Earl      Stanhope's two Systems         of
     Columns 5, 6,                  8, and 9, are intended to explain the
                                   7,
Equal-beating                 System of his Lordship (see vol. xxv.
pp. 301, 302j xxvii.p. 203;    and xxviii. p. 150): the 5th
contains the complete vibrations (which Earl S. would call
Beats) made in one second or. time ; wherein 240 is assumed
as the pitch of C on the Tenor Cliff line (a ledger line be
low the Treble, or the same above the Bass stave in music),
on the authorities quoted in the article Concert pitch, in
vol. ix. part I. of Dr. Rees's New Cyclopaedia, lately pub
lished.
     I   am aware that            Earl Stanhope,         (vol. xxv. p. 303,) refers,
in his Tuning Table,                    to   the    Octave below my C instead of
above         it,   at least      for tuning of some of his notes, but
I    have preferred           this Octave, and added to my calculation,
vol. xxvii. p. 203 extending the same to the equally heat
                               ;
ing Thirds in this his Lordship's System.
   If the Third bA in his Lordship's Table be tempered
                              E
sharp 1-06G commas, and the Third bAc, also sharp -843
parts of   comma, both of these will beat 10-00 times per
              a
second     ;    and       his three successive               Fifths   GD, DA    and    Ae,
•ftempered        "4721, -3163 and -21 16 parts of
                       flat                         comma                       a
respectively, will each be found to beat 3-158 times per
second nearly.     The half of the number of Vibrations                                  in
columns        4    or 5, or       of Beats        in   this Octave, will answer to the
first Bass Octave,                    and    twice       these   numbers   to   the    first
Treble Octave respectively and the half or double of these
                                               ;
again, will express the next descending or ascending Octave
respectively, and so on, throughout the whole scale.
   Columns     and  6contain the logarithms and lengths
                                  7                                                      of
strings in this System, for comparison with the notes in his
Lordship's Monockord System* vol. xxvii. p. 195; as co
lumn      8 intended, to compare with vol. xxviii. p. 141
               is                                                                        ;
in  which column,      have preserved the terms
                                  I                 and m,                  f
the same, and     thrown all the differences between this and
the monochord system, into the term 2, as the same are
expressed      column 9: from whence
                  in                       appears, that half    it
the notes differ more than ]± Schismas from each other re
spectively,         in   these two Stanhopian                Systems.

 6                   On   Earl   Stanhope's two Systems
                                               of
   Since it appears, (vol. xxviii. p. 304,) that Mr. William
 Hawkes asserts the superiority of his System (vol. xxvi.
 p.      i) over that of Earl Stanhope, as being "the best
      1 71
 principle for tempering our present scale" with 12 notes in
 an octave, I have devoted a column of my present Table to
 his System, and whereby a comparison of the same may
 be made, with either of Earl Stanhope's Systems ; and
 where the differences in schhmas and minutes, between any
 of the respective          notes in each, may be obtained by a very
 easy subtraction.
              a comparison it will appear, that Earl Stanhope's
      From such
 notes some   of them differ materially from Mr. Hawkes's
 corresponding ones, and that both of them differ much,
comparatively,            from   the   Equal Temperament,        a mode    of
tuning, which Earl Stanhope says, (vol. xxv. p. 291,) was
approved by one half of the most eminent musicians in En
gland,       whom      his Lordship particularly consulted on the
subject      :   although Mr. H. and his Lordship so cordially
agree, (vol. xxviii. p. 305,) and (vol. xxv. p. 305,) in con
demning the same.
   In my last, I omitted to mention, respecting the Isotonic
system in column 4, (vol. xxix. p. 347i) that if each note
therein,         all of which contain        fractional parts of the very
small interval m, be increased                to the next whole number,
as    48-iVto49m, 46£             to 47 m,    &c.,   these   trifling altera
tions will reduce it to my Equal Temperament, mentioned
vol. xxviii. p. 65, and the same can then be practically
tuned, by the help of perfect corichords only ! We may
therefore now hope, that " Equal Temperament," which
so many have commended, and others condemned, pro
bably without having ever heard any music performed in                    it,
will be brought to the test of experience, and practice suf
ficiently extensive, to get over the prejudice which will na
turally arise, on the hearing of any new system whatever.
  Many,       know, have imagined, that the system which
                 I
was aimed at          by
                   the professional Tuners before Earl Stan
hope wrote, was an Equal Temperament, to be effected                      by
the judgment of the ear, and Mr. Hawkes thinks that their
practical results agree very nearly with his system both of      :
these opinions      hare much reason to doubt, and cannot
                     I
                                                                     refrain

     Musical Temperament, — Mr. Hawkes'                  s System,        &c.   7
refrain from again endeavouring to call the attention of some
gentleman, possessed of good Instruments and the necessary
knowledge and experience in making experiments and cal
culations in harmonics, and requesting him to employ the
best professional Tuners to tune his instruments, without
any intimation to the Tuners, of his intentions or object ;
and before such instruments are put out of tune.by use or
standing, to ascertain exactly, by the beats of the different
conchords,       by a monochord ; and by other methods also
for further satisfaction, the exact value of every interval in
an Octave, using single strings only : these experiments
varied and repeated, on Organs and Piano-Fortes, tuned by
as many good tuners as possible, would, by their results,
ehable us to say, how far any one system whatever has been
adopted, or can be accomplished, by the method of tuning
in use, and within what limits the different tuners, or the
same persons at different times, do in practice fix each note.
Such     an one would          doubtless perform        the most valuable
piece   of   service to the practical musician,        and perhaps enable
him to profit from            the labours      of theorists in harmonics,
by enabling        him with more certainty and facility, to ac
complish the "tuning," with which by practice his auditors
are become acquainted,              and wherewith most of them are
satisfied*, if the same did not lead to an amelioration of the
system. With such information before them, the musical
public would perhaps be enabled to judge, of the preten
sions of the many musical quacks, who are almost every
year bringing forth some new and fanciful system of tem
perament, (of which an almost inexhaustible fund yet lav
behind,) and crying up the same with a confidence, equalled
only by that with which rival empirics condemn them :
until at length the Science of Harmonics, and the valuable
discoveries of Dr. Robert Smith on the nature of imperfect
   * Let it always be recollected, that

  II.   Essay upon Machines                in Gtneial.        By M. Carnot,

                                        Preface.
   Although              the theory to be discussed be applicable to
   every subject which concerns the communication of motion,
   I have given to this work the title of Essay upon Machines
   in General ; — in the first place, because it is principally
   machines       I  purpose to treat of, as being the most important
      i  For  a Translation   of Carnot.* " Reflections on the Theory of the Infini
   tesimal Calculus,"    see Phil. Mag. vol. viii. p. 222, and 335 ; and vol. ix. p. 39.
                                                                              branch

                             On Machines in General.                                        9
branch  of mechanics j and in the second place, because I do
not mean to treat of any machine in particular, but solely
of the properties which are common to all.
   This theory is founded upon three principal definitions :
the first regards certain movements which I call geometrical,
because they may be determined by the principle of geome
try alone, and are absolutely independent of the rules of
dynamics.         I       have  not thought that we could easily pass
over them without              leaving some obscurity in the elucidation
of the principal              propositions, as I have particularly shown
with respect to the principle of Descartes.
   By the second of my definitions, I endeavour to fix the
signification         of the terms force soliciting and force resisting .-
we cannot,            in my opinion, perspicuously compare causes
with   effects in machinery                 without   a marked distinction be
tween these               different forces     ;   and this, is the distinction
upon which            I   think something          vague and indeterminate has
been always left.
  Lastly, my third definition                      is   that by which I give the
name     of   moment             of activity of         a power, to a quantity in
which    a power is mentioned which is really in activity or                                in
movement,             and     where    we also take account              of   each    of   the
instants employed by this force, i. e. of the time during
which it acts. Whatever it be, we cannot refuse to allow
that this quantity, under whatever denomination we de
signate      not to be continually met with in the analysis
            it,   is
of machines in movement.
   With       the         assistance   of   these definitions,     I     arrive      at   pro
positions which are very simple                    :  I   deduce   all   of   them from
one same fundamental equation,     which, containing    cer                           a
tain indeterminate quantity, to which we may attribute dif
ferent arbitrary values, will give successively    each par                in
ticular case, all the determinate equations required for the
solution of the problem.
   This equation, which                     possesses     the   greatest      simplicity,
generally extends                to all imaginable cases        of equilibrium             and
movement,             whether the movement changes hastily, or va
ries   by
       insensible degrees              even applied to all bodies,
                                        :
                                             it
                                             is
whether hard, or endowed with           certain degree of elasticity
                                                   a                                            ;
                                                                                           and

  lo                        On Machines in General.
  and     if I   am not deceived, it is sufficient   of itself, and inde
  pendently of every other mechanical principle,            to resolve all
  the particular cases to be met with.
      I
      easily draw from this equation a general principle of
 equilibrium and movement in machines properly so called,
 and from the latter naturally            flow other principles more or
 less general, several         of which   are already known and very
 celebrated, but which have been hitherto either inexactly or
 vaguely explained, rather than rigorously demonstrated.
   Without departing from general principles, I have united
 in a scholium, and as clearly as possible, the most useful
 remarks for practice, and which, from their importance,
 appeared to me to merit a particular development.      Every
 person repeats,  that  in  machines in movement,   we always
 lose in time or in velocity what we gain in power ; but after
 perusing the best elements of mechanics, which seem to be
 the true place where the proofs and explanation of this prin
 ciple should be found, — Is its extent or even its true signi
 fication easy to seize ? Has its generality, with most readers,
 that irresistible        evidence which should characterize mathe
 matical truths       ?    If they exhibit this striking conviction,
ought we not to see mechanics instructed in these works,
incessantly renounce their chimerical projects ? Would they
not                   in spite of every thing that has been
       cease to believe,
taught them, that there  is something of magic in machines ?
The proofs given them of the contrary only extend to
simple machines : now they do not think these capable of
any great effect, and they cannot be brought to believe that
it must be the same in every case imaginable ; they only
speak of that where there are solely two forces in the system,
and they are contented with an analogy : this is the reason
why these mechanicians always hope that their sagacity will
make them discover some unknown resource, some ma
chine which is not comprehended within the ordinary rules ;
they think themselves so much the more certain of meeting
with      it,
         the further they remove from every thing which
seems to have any relation with machines in use, because
they imagine that the theory established with respect to the
latter, cannot be extended to constructions which do not
                                                                  seem

                      On Machines in General.                               11
seem to have any connection            with them. It is in vain         to tell
them that every machine may be reduced to the lever : this
assertion is too vague and too wire-drawn to be admitted
without a profound examination ; they cannot persuade
themselves that machines which appear to have nothing in
common with those denominated simple ones, are subject
to the same law, nor that we can pronounce upon the in
utility ofa secret which has not been communicated to any
person   thence
         :        it happens that the most absurb ideas, and
the furthest removed from the simplicity so advantageous to
machines, are those which furnish them the most hopes.
   The method of rooting out this error is certainly to attack
it in its very source, by showing that not only in all the
machines known, but also in all possible machines, it is an
invariable law — that we always lose in time or in velocity
what we gain in power, — and to explain clearly what this
law signifies j but to this effect we must raise ourselves to
the greatest generality possible, and not stop at any parti
cular machine, or resort to any analogy. In the last place,
there must be a general demonstration, deduced imme
diately and geometrically from the first axioms in mecha
nics : this is what I have attempted in this Essay. I have
strongly insisted upon this fundamental point, and I do not
know if I have succeeded in placing it in a sufficiently clear
light   ; but on attacking error we are compelled to substitute
truth in its place            —I
                        have shown what is the true end of
                          ;
machinery     :   if it unreasonable
                              be      to expect prodigies from
them beyond all probability,      we shall still find there is
plenty of utility in them  for exercising the most lively ima
gination.
   The reflexions         I   propose upon this law lead me to say a
word of perpetual             motion : and I have shown not only that
every machine abandoned to itself must infallibly stop, but
I assign the very instant when this must happen.
   There will also be found among these reflections one of
 the most interesting properties of machines, which I think
 has not yet been remarked ; it          is,   that in order to make them
 produce the greatest possible effect,              i. it
                                                             must   necessarily
 happen that there be no percussion,                        e. that the move
                                                                          ment

 merit should always change by imperceptible degrees ; which
 occasions, among other things, some remarks upon hy
 draulic machines.
    Finally,    I  terminate this production by some reflections
upon the fundamental laws of the communication of move
 ment, which, if they be not agreeable to every body, have at
least the merit      of brevity.
    I repeat that this Essay has merely for its object machi
nery in general ; each machine has its peculiar properties :
here we have only to do with those which are common to
all ; these properties, although sufficiently numerous, are in
some measure all comprehended in one very simple law :
it is this law I purpose to explain, to demonstrate, and de
velop, always regarding           machines under the most general
and direct point of view.
                               Introduction.
   I.   There is no want      of excellent   treatises  upon machi
nery   :   the properties peculiar to those in frequent use, and
particularly to those called simple, have been inquired after
and expounded with all possible sagacity.             In my opinion,
however, too little attention has been bestowed in the de
velopment of those         properties which are common to ma
chinery      in general, and which for this reason no more
belong to the cords of a machine than to the lever, thr
vice, or any other machine,               whether simple or com
pound.
   It  is not,   however, because geometricians have neglected
to ascend to the general principles of equilibrium or move
ment     ;  but it is only, as it were, en passant that they have
spoken of their application to the theory of machines pro
perly so called : and perhaps there is none of these prin
ciples to be found which unites to a rigorous demonstration
a sufficient generality, to make it answer solely and in
dependently for the solution of the various questions which
may be proposed, as well upon the equilibrium as upon the
movement of machines, i. e. for reducing every question to
a business     of geometry      and  calculation; — this is  the true
object of mechanics.

                          On Machines in General.                             ] 3
     II.   Among     the    principles        more or less   general which
have been hitherto proposed, we shall                    only mention two
Yery celebrated ones, and upon which we shall have                       some
observations to offer.
     The first is that which assigns for                the   general   law   of
equilibrium       in weighing machines, that the centre of gravity
of     system is then at the lowest possible point ; but al
     the
though this antient principle be very simple and general, it
does not seem that all the attention it deserves has been paid
to   it: it is certainly, first,
                              because it is subject to some ex
pressions, like all these where a maximum and minimum is
mentioned : second, because it has no relation except to a
particular species of force, which is gravity : thirdly and
lastly, because it appears difficult to give a general and rigo
rous demonstration          of it. But first, we shall show that by
a small change         in the display of this principle, we may make
of it      a very    precise,      geometrical,       and true proposition,
without any exception whatever.       Secondly,    although it
has no      relation        gravity, yet it is easy to apply it
                          except   to
to all imaginable cases : for this purpose it is only re
quisite to substitute a weight in the place of each of the
powers which are of a different genus ; this is very easy by
means       of    passing upon a return pulley, in such a
                 a line
manner that there now remains no other defect to this prin
ciple than that of being indirect. Thirdly and lastly, al
though we cannot demonstrate it rigorously without ascend
ing to the first principles of mechanism, it      however,      is,
easy to account for      so as to remove every doubt,
                              it                        we              if
had even no other proofs, as we shall show when we come
to the exact demonstration which we shall endeavour to give
of   it in the course of this Essay.
     Let us imagine therefore machine    a            to which there are no
other forces except weights applied  suppose  besides, to
                                                  I
                                                  ;             it,
be of any arbitrary form, but that no movement has been
given to it; this being done, whatever be the disposition of
the bodies of the system,     clear thatit   is         if
                                            there be equili
brium, the sum of the resistances of the fixed points or any
obstacles, estimatedin the vertical direction, contrary to the
gravity, will be equal to the total weight of the system                       ;
                                                                              but

 14                              On Machines in General.
but    if a
       movement is given, a part of the gravity will be
employed to produce   and                 it,
                             only with the surplus that
                                                      it   is
the fixed points               will   be charged       ;        thus, in this case the sum
of the vertical                                 of
                                the fixed points will be less at
                           resistances
the first instant            total weight of the system
                                than the                    thus                              :
from these two forces combined (the gravity of the system
and the vertical charge of the fixed points) there will result
from         single force equal to their difference, and which
            it   a
will push the              system         from top to bottom                  as   if
                                                                                    it   were free   :
thus the centre                of gravity will             descend          necessarily with         a
velocity equal to this difference divided                                  bythe total mass of
the system. Again,      the centre of gravity of the system
                                      if
does not descend, there will necessarily be an equilibrium.
     In general therefore — For ascertaining that several weights
applied to any given machine should make        mutual equili               a
brium,       it      is
               sufficient to prove that  we  abandon  this ma    if
chine to itself the centre

descend.
     III.
        The immediate consequence of this principle, which
is true without exception,        that          is,
                                          the centre of gravity if
of the system at the lowest possible point, there will ne

tion,   it   sufficient, in order to prove
                 is                             to show that the        it,
centre of gravity   will not descend    Now, how could      :de                               it

I suppose that      required to find the general law of equili

 Comparison of the Crania of the Elephant of India and that
   of Africa— External Characters taken from the Ears-
   Parts of the Cranium susceptible of Variation in one and
   the same Species.
 L had    the good fortune to be the first to remark, in 1795,
 the distinctive characters presented by the crania of the two
 elephants, and which are so much the more interesting, as
 they may be applied to living, or entire individuals, without
 being obliged to examine their jaws*.          was able tore-       I
 cognise them at first only by the comparison of a cranium
 of each species j I have now verified these observations by
 inspecting seven real crania, (five of which are Indian, and
 two African,) and several drawings.
    When these crania are separated from their lower jaws
 and placed upon the grinders, and upon the edges of the
 alveoli of the tusks, the zygomatical arcades are nearly ho
  rizontal in both           species.
       If we    next view them laterally, what is very striking                                      is,

                                                                                                that

     16         Memoir    upon  living and fossil Elephants.
    that the summit of the head is almost round in the African
    elephant, and that it rises in the Indian elephant into a kind
    of double pyramid.
       This summit answers        to the occipital    arcade of man      and
   other animals,      and is so high    in the elephant merely for the
   purpose of giving to the       occipital face of the cranium a suf
   ficient extent for a cervical ligament and occipital muscles,
   proportionate to the weight of the enormous mass they have
   to support.
       This difference in the form      of the summits     proceeds   from
  the difference in the inclination of the frontal line, which
   retreats much further in the African elephant, where it
  forms with the occipital line an angle of 1 15°, than in the
  Indian elephant, where it makes an angle of 90° only.
       From this come the principal differences of the profile,
  such as, 1st, The proportion of the vertical height of the
  head at the distance from         the end   of  the bones  of the nose
  to the occipital      condyles, which        are nearly   equal in the
 African elephant, (being         as 33   to 32,) and the first of which
 is nearly one-fourth        larger in the Indian elephant (being
 as 24 to 19).         2d, The proportion of the distance from
 the edges     of  the alveoli of the tusks at the summit to a line
 which     is perpendicular to     it and    goes   from the end of the
bones of the nose to the anterior edge of the occipital hol
 low. The first of these lines is almost double that of the
other in the Indian elephant (being as 26 to 14).              It is little
less     than one -fourth larger in the African elephant (being
as 21 to 16).
      Besides these in the proportions, there are also differences
in the contour:          1st, The front of the Indian elephant is
hollowed       into  a sinking and concave curve ; that of the
African elephant is on the contrary a little convex.                   2d,
The sub-orbitary hole is larger          in  the  Indian [elephant. In
the African, it resembles a channel rather than a simple hole.
3dly, The temporal hollow is rounder in the African ele
phant ; and the apophysis, which distinguishes it from the
orbit, is thicker than in that of India, in which this hollow
has an oval contour.
                                                                  When

               Memoir    upon  living and fossil Elephants.            17
    When      observed   by their front view, these crania also pre
 sent very remarkable differences.                                     ,
     1st, The greatest length of this front, taken from the
 summit to the edge of the alveolus, is at its greatest breadth,
taken between the post-orbitary apophyses of the frontal
bone, as 5 to 3 in the Indian elephant, and as 3 to 2 in the
African elephant.
  ; 2d, The aperture of the nose is nearly in the middle of
 the face in the Indian elephant ; it is one-fifth further re
moved from the edge of the alveolus than from the summit
of the head in the African elephant.
    When seen from above, these crania differ, particularly by
their zygomatical arcades ; they are more salient in the
African than in the Indian elephant.
    When we look at them behind, we are struck with new
characters     :
    1st,   The height of      the  wings of the sphenoidal bones,
forms      in the Indian     elephant more than three-fourths of
that of the occipital surface, while         in the African elephant
it scarcely forms one half.
    2d, In the African elephant the posterior extremity of
the zygomatical arcades is nearly on a level with the occi
pital condyles ; in the Indian elephant it is much lower.
    3d, The occiput is terminated in the upper part in the
African elephant, by a semi-elliptic curve, and its base is
formed by two lines in a very open angle.                In the Indian
elephant, the sides are in convex arcs, and the upper part of
the arc is slightly concave.
    The grinders      are placed    in both species    upon two lines
which converge        before ; they differ  only by   their laminae, as
we have s.iid above.
    Most of, the characters we         have   described, contributing
Jo the      general    configuration    of   the head,     are sensible
externally ; there      is one still more prominent, and which
may distinguish the two species at the firstglance.             I think
I wa-s the first to remark it : it consists in the size of the
eirs.               v
    The Indian elephant      has middling-sized     ears : — they are so
large   as  to cover the whole shoulders in the African elephant.

18                 Memoir       upon   living and fossil Elephants.
     I
    made myself certain of the first point: 1st, In three
elephants which I saw alive ; and I dissected two of them :
two were from Ceylon, and the third from Bengal.        2d,
In two other individuals which I                   saw in a state        of   preserva
tion. 3d, In all the figures well known to belong to the
Indian species, particularly those of Buffon, Blair, and
Camper.    4th, In the figure of a fcetus elephant from Cey
lon, described by Zimmermann, in a quarto volume upon
the subject          *.
   Upon       second point, I have the following proofs:
                   the
1st, The elephant from Congo, dissected by Duverney. We
may see its figure in the Mtmoire pour servir d I'Hist. des
Anim. par. iii. ; and I am sure that the ear is not exagge
rated, for it is still preserved in the Museum, and I have
seen and examined it.
     2d,     An      ear preserved in the       king of Denmark's              cabinet,
arid       taken from an elephant killed at the Cape                          of Good
Hope         by     captain Magnus Jacobi, in 1675.        It is three
ftet and a          half long, and two feet and a half broad f.
     3d,   young African elephant in our Museum j its
              A
ears, although shrivelled up by being dried, are still as large
as its head.
   4th, An embryo elephant from Africa, in our Museum.
     5th,      All   the    well-known       figures    of   the   African elephants.
     From          these    characters we may be assured                  from    what
species those figures have been drawn the origin of which
is unknown, or such as are to be seen on antient monu
ments.
  Thus that of Gessner \, copied by Aldrovandus §, is an
African elephant. That of Valentine    copied   Labatf       |f,          by           ,
and altered           by   Kolbe**,     is   equally so.

                                                      being                           before
able to apply with certainty the osteological characters of
the cranium to the fossil elephant, we must determine what
are the variable parts of one individual from the other, ill
one and the same                        species.          1    have therefore subjected my
Indian crania to   comparison with each other, and
                                       a                                                         I      did
the same with my African <one9.

ference.

occiput and the alveoli of the tusks.
   The occiput      more swelled in every direction in the
                               is
former than in the latter, without regard to the length of
the tusks.

deficient in the size              of   the tusks is compensated by a greater
thickness in the osseous substance of the alveolus.   The
reason      is,
           that the alveolus, serving as base and   socket       a                a
for the muscles of the proboscis, could not shrink                                    as well
as the tusks,           without the proboscis               losing the strength and
thickness which               necessary for it.

and, what          is   very  remarkable, even without any reference
with that of             the tusks.    Our large mookna skeleton has
them longer than our two daunitlalis, although its tusks
are the smallest of all. To conclude, — this increase in length
does not exceed an inch.
     It   could not be considerable                   without the organisation of
the proboscis being essentially changed,                      because the mus

the alveoli    of the tusks, and those    the upper part are in
                                                           in
the    front, above the bones of the nose. The base of the
proboscis has therefore necessarily for its vertical diameter
the distance between  these two points    and      the alveoli   ;        if
are prolonged beyond                 a   certain measure,            the proboscis would
assume      a     monstrous size.
      1s very important to notice this article,
     It                                         because   fur                         it
nishes the most distinctive character of the fossil elephant.
   If we compare together the small number of figures of
elephants' skulls found in the works of naturalists, do not                      I
think any stronger differences will be found than those                                     I
have mentioned.
     The    table       annexed to           the    succeeding         article    expresses
these differences            by     numbers.
     A    celebrated        author         has     supposed      a   difference between
the crania of males                 and females, which               we have not men
tioned, but he has been deceived                            by   simple external ap
pearances.
     Our small          mookna from Ceylon                 had, at the root           of the
proboscis,        a   very perceptible protuberance, which the female
had not.          M.     Faujas, imagining that this protuberance be
longed      to     the    osseous          parts,    has    represented          these     two
heads in PI. xii.            of his Essais           de Geologie.         "   In order      to
avoid,"      be says,          p.   238,    "    falling into an error, when we

  find the heads       of a male    and female fossil elephant, we must
  not mistake them for two different species."
     Dissection has shown us, however, that this protuberance
  was only produced by two cartilages peculiar to elephants,
 which cover the entrance of the canals of                 the proboscis into
  the osseous nostrils.
     These cartilages were a little more swelled in this indi
  vidual than in the others.
      It  is not   even a character         common      to   all males.       The
 dauntelah      of Bengal     had it not.
     The same learned geologist has given to his figures much
 larger tusks than these two individuals had in reality,                     "   In
 order," he says, p. 269,            "   to make those understand, who
 never saw an elephant, the manner in which these animals
 carry their tusks."          It was not necessary, however, to give
 large    tusks  to  the   female,   which never has any in the Indian
 species.

         Examination of the Cranium of the fossil Elephant.
     The cranium was very cellular ; the osseous lamina com
 posing it were too thin to be preserved in the fossil state                       :
 they are therefore found in innumerable fragments ; but
three only are mentioned as being in a state of good preser
vation, and the most entire of the whole wants a part of
the occiput.
     They belong         to  the   Petersburg!! Academy * ; the best
was found upon the banks of the river Indigirska, in the
most eastern and coldest part of Siberia, by the learned and
intrepid Messerschmidt             of Dantzick, who           gave a drawing
of it to his countryman             Breynius.      The     latter had it en
graved       at the end      of  a memoir he inserted in the               Philo-
Dophical      Transactions      f, and to this day it is the only public
document         *ve  have    upon     this part   of   the   skeleton     of the
fossil elephant.
     I  have copied the figure        of Breynius in PI. ii. fig. l, be
sides the African and Indian crania ; and I have reduced
the three to the same size nearly, in order to facilitate their

comparison.   The first glance shows that the fossil eie*
phant resembles, in its cranium as well as in its teeth, the
Indian       species rather than any other.
                 the drawing is not correct enough for an
      Unfortunately
exact comparison, and it is not made upon a well-deter
mined projection. The part of the alveoli, that of the con-
dylon for the lower jaw, and the anterior edge of the
temporal hollow, and of the orbit, are seen a little obliquely
behind, while the occiput and the grinders are in a rigorous
profile.
   We see distinctly enough, however, a striking difference
in proportion in the extreme length of the alveoli of the
tusks.  It is treble what it would be in an Indian or African
cranium of the same dimensions; and the triturating sur
face of the grinders prolonged, in place of meeting the
alveolary edge, would intersect the tube of the alveolus at
one-third of its length.
   This difference is so much the more important as it agrees
with       the form    of    the  lower jaw, as we see below ; and, as
we have already              said, it would of necessity produce an
other conformation in the proboscis of the fossil elephant ;
for where the sockets of the muscles. of the proboscis were
the same,       :..   upper part of the nose and the lower
                      e. the
edge of the alveoli of the tusks      in this case the base of
                                              ;
that organ  was three   times larger in proportion than    our          in
living elephants or rather the sockets of the muscles were
                         ;
different,     and     a fortiori its   total structure was different.

94        < Memoir        upon  living and fossil Elephants.
     But in order      to   infer from    any one of these    crania the
dimensions         of   the animal     to  which jt belonged, it   is not
necessary       to refer to its first dimensions, into which the
                                                                          /
excessive length of the alveoli of the tusks enters ; these
only should be taken into consideration which are really
homologous.
      Now, by comparing them with those of the cranium of
our Indian skeletons of the mooluia and comerea, we fin4
 that the fossil animal            must have been nearly twelve feet
 high. A comparison with the skeletons of the Indian
 dauntelah and meylice would give a little more to the fossil.
      As  soon as    I  was acquainted with this drawing      of Messerr
 Schmidt,      and     added to    the differences  it presented those I
 had myself observed in the lower jaw and in some isolated
 teeth, I no longer supposed that the fossil elephants were of
 a different species from those of India.
      This idea, which I first announced in a memoir to the
 Institute, opened quite new views to me upon the theory of
 the earth    ;   a hasty glance at other fossil bones induced me to
 presume every thing I have since discovered, and determined
 me to devote myself to the assiduous researches and tedious
  labours in which I have been occupied these ten years past.
      I ought therefore to acknowledge, that it is to this draw
  ing, buried as it were in the Philosophical Transactions for
  seventy years,          that the public are indebted for all those
  works upon which           I set so high a value.
      I  must not dissemble,            however, that the characters it
   presented     me required to be confirmed by some other speci
   men, in order that they might not be considered as the same
   species, and in spite of their agreement with those of the
   lower jaw, I was happy to find a drawing of another
   cranium.
       I applied to the Pctersburgh Academy; and this illustrious
   body, to which I now belong, complied with my wishes,
   with, a generosity worthy of a Society to which science is so
   much indebted.
       The Academy          ordered  a superb coloured    drawing of the
    natural size to be transmitted to me of another fossil cranium
    from Siberia, in their collection also.          It was accompanied

with   a drawing     of the lower jaw of a cranium of a rhino
ceros, in two positions.            In these drawings I found a con
firmation of what I had conceived from seeing Messer-
schmidt.
    The cranium, which served for the model, is not so com
plete. The grinders, and a part of their alveoli, are want
ing, as well as the middle part of the zygomatical arcade.
Nothing characteristic            is however     missing : there is the
same length and the same direction              of the alveoli ; the same
size   of  the lacrymal tubercle,          and the same general form :
every thing in fact convinces us that the fossil skulls partake
of the same characters.
    I have carefully      engraved this fine drawing in my Plate
viii. fig. 2.
    The parallelism of        the grinders is a difference        which may
 be established       independently        of the drawings of Messer-
 schmidt or of the Petersburgh Academy.
    M. Jajger assures me of the same fact, with reference to
 a portion     of a cranium in       the   Stutgard cabinet, and which
 may be found in my Plate iv. fig. 4 : another piece, drawn
 by Peter Camper, shows the same character *. I have copied
 his figure, Plate iv. fig. 3, and I have placed beside it
 fig. 1 and 2, those of Indian and African crania, seen from
 below, in order to show the more remarkable convergency
 of their front teeth.
     We have in our Museum              a portion of the occiput and of
 the temporal bone of a fossil elephant, brought from Sibe
 ria by the astronomer Delisle, which afforded me an oppor
 tunity   of comparing      these parts more closely than the others,
 of which I         had   drawings      only ; but I found         some very
 trifling   differences  ;  I   have given a back view         of it in fig. 7,

 X he     prison of Mont Saiiit Michel, from its situation,
stood more in need that any other of some chemical agent
to correct the numerous local vices in point of salubrity.
     Putrid and malignant fevers, so familiar among individuals
crowded together in the same place, using food of slender
succulency,         and overwhelmed with grief and sorrows, raged
with unceasing fury in the prison of Mont Saint Michel.
     Juniper berries and incense were frequently burned in the
cells ; but instead of changing the atmosphere and neutrali
zing the vapours exhaled from the bodies of the sick prisoners,
these means only disguised the smell.                       From the moment
M.     Morveau's method was resorted to, the number of these
fevers, and of course the mortality, sensibly diminished.
     In order to be convinced of these truths, it is sufficient, in
my opinion, to inspect the necrology of this prison, and to
compare the mortality of various years, having an eye to
the increase and diminution of the number of prisoners.

   + In this year the regular use     of fumigations was ordered, and the prison
was furnished with two     sets of M. Dumouticr.s apparatus,

    It  was  in   the year   1801   that   I  succeeded    M. Romilly,
who fell a victim to a putrid fever, which he caught while
administering relief to the prisoners ; and I was astonished
to find more than one half of these unfortunates                 attacked
with this species of fever.
    The cells of the prisoners      had a fetid smell,    of  so pungent
and tenacious a nature that my clothed retained             it four-and-
twenty hours after their exposure to the free air.               In these
circumstances I hastened to employ M. Guyton's process.
A mixture of muriate of soda, black oxide of manganese,
and sulphuric acid, was put into proper vessels, which I
ordered to be taken into the cells several times. This process
was repeated the following day by M. Hidou.                                 ,
     These experiments were attended with no accident what
 ever, and produced a very sensible diminution of the fetid
smell with which the air          of  the   prison was impregnated ;
and we had the satisfaction very soon of seeing the epidemy
 of putrid fevers also diminished.
     In order   to obviate the dangers which this mode of clean
 ing   the  atmosphere    presents, particularly where there are no
 other apartments to remove the patients into, M. Costaz,
 prefect     of  the   department,     furnished    us   with the large
  apparatus of M. Dumonticr,              since which period these
 machines are carried through             the   hospital   several   times
 daily.
     Since the commencement           of 1804, the number of pri
  soners has increased      one-third ; the structure of the cells
 has not       been   changed,    the   same    misery pervades       every
  corner   of them, nor     has the amelioration in the food         of the
  miserable     inhabitants arising from their labour, been suf
  ficient to change the nature of the diseases with which they
  are infected ; and yet putrid fevers have almost entirely dis
  appeared.
      I am certainly of opinion that M. Guyton's process wai
  the means of extinguishing the putrid fever in the prison.
  I am the more inclined to believe in its efficacy iiom the
  circumstance      of this fever being epidemical in      several neigh
  bouring districts, which occasioned an order by the prefect
  to fumigate the churches ; and from the year 1 804 to this
                                                                    period,

       the Destruction of putrid Miasmata *.
                                                                        14th of April,    1807.
 A he         communication             of M. Hedouin                       has   induced     mc
to think that   it would be interesting to publish an account
of      the
         advantages  resulting from the employment of my
anti-contagious process on other occasions. I am extremely
sorry to observe, however' that in spite of the solicitation
of the government, this method is not generally known or
practised ; for in the Journal de Paris of the 17th instant, we
find that a contagious disease appeared in the prisons of
Dreux,         and that all the judges              of    the        tribunal of criminal
justice       had been seized          with it and died.
   The following two facts                I   have    received              from undoubted
authority       :
      About the end of last autumn, the rot made its ap
       1.
pearance in some parishes in the department of Loire and
Cher. Madame de P., the proprietor of two flocks of Merino
sheep,        ordered   fumigations           of oxy-muratic acid                 to be made
in     the folds and stables       :    at first in open vessels,                 by pouring
sulphuric acid upon the mixture of sea-salt and oxide of
manganese ; and afterwards, by means of the large apparatus.
The success of this induced her to intimate throughout the
parish, that she would lend the apparatus to those wmo had
diseased sheep.  A farmer in the same commune had al
ready lost several sheep,                and     heapplied the preservative.
He opened the apparatus                   twice a-day, for three minutes at
each time, according to the instructions he had received.
The rot became mild ; one half of the flock were not affect-
   with
 pi}       and he did not lose
              it,              single sheep.    a

     Two other farmers of                  the same commune             made a simi
larly successful experiment.  Their diseased flocks were al
lowed to pasture along with the healthy, the latter having
been previously fumigated in the folds, and no contagion
was communicated.                      The apparatus       has    of course become
of   general    use in the department.
     2.   The second fact               was communicated           to me by the di
rectors of the hospitals at Besancon.
   Several hundred weights of meat had    been left neglected
for some time in the cellar of the public hospital : it diffused
so infected a smell that it was impossible to enter the place
to carry it away, and a pitch-fork was used for that pur
pose. They afterwards introduced into           with the same     it,
precautions,            a    flask   of anti-contagious iras, the flap of
which was opened                   and the door of the cellar was closed.
When this flask                   was    withdrawn     a  few hours afterwards,
there      existed      no smell           whatever,    except  that which was
diffused       by   the     oxy-muriatic.           Its emanations having been,
very strong, the window was opened, in order to procure                                   a
current of fresh air. The cellar was then so completely
purified that fresh meat was put into                      it   and completelv         pre
served.
     The stench occasioned                    by   the carcase     of   a   dead rat was
also destroyed              in   a   few minutes,      by   the    use      of   the   same
apparatus.
  The hospitals of the department have been since provided
with the regular fumigating apparatus; and glass bottles,
containing  supply of sulphuric acid, nitre, and sea-salt, are
                    a
 placed in the halls, with which the fumigations                             are repeated
 every evening.                  The      from these precau
                                        benefits   resulting
 tions have been felt in an astonishing degree.  Besancon                                    is-
 always  crowded  with   prisoners of war and   wounded  sol
 diers, among whom no contagion whatever has made                                        its
 appearance since the adoption of this salutary process.
                                                                                  VI. Ex.

VI.    Experiments upon the liquid Sulphur of Lampadius.
           By Messrs. Vauquelin and Robiquet*.
                                   Process.
JUampadius, who             was the first to observe this particular
fluid, which he        called   liquid sulphur, obtained it by the
distillation of pyritous turfs, and pyrites mixed with a cer
tain quantity of charcoal or saw-dust. Messrs. Clement and
Desormes      employed the charcoal and sulphur in order to
form completely the liquid sulphur, which M. Lampadius
considered as a combination of sulphur and hydrogen ; but
these chemists announced the process as being very difficult
in its execution,       since they had only succeeded once out of
twenty times.         Nevertheless, three successive experiments
have   furnished    us   with results equalfy satisfactory, and we
have not remarked that they have any other essential pre
cautions than that of cooling the flasks adapted to the ap
paratus, in order to avoid the volatilization of this singular
substance.      We therefore took, as Messrs. Clement and
Desormes directed, finely pulverized charcoal ; we employed
it in   a   very dry state,       and introduced it into a porcelain
tube, to which was adapted, by one of its apertures, a small
retort containing sulphur; at the opposite extremity we
placed a large tube with a simple curvature, which was in
serted into a flask       three-fourths filled with water; care was
taken to make a hollow in that part of the tube which en
tered into the water, in order that it might serve as a tube
of safety for the porcelain tube ; this first flask, which ought
to have three tubulures, has a straight tube at one of them,
and at the third, a tube communicating with a second flask
surrounded by snow or pounded ice : to this last we adapted
a tube, crooked so as to collect the gases.                Things being
thus arranged, the porcelain tube is strongly heated in a
reverberating furnace ; when it is red-hot the sulphur vo
latilizes;    after  a  certain time, there passes into the first
flask a liquid of    a  citron    yellow colour, having the appear
ance   of  an oil, collecting      into globules upon the surface     of
                      • Arm.  it Chimit torn. lxi. p. 146.
                                                                    the

the    water,      and    falling    to   the bottom of the liquor when
they have acquired            a certain volume.        If  we pass too great
a quantity       of sulphur,       a portion    joins this oil  and   gives  it
more colour and density ; the other is condensed in the first
glass tube, and is fixed the instant it comes in contact with
the water.        If the    first flask is so near the furnace     as to  make
the temperature exceed 20 or 25 degrees of Reaumur,
the liquid sulphur boils, is volatilized, and passes into the
second flask, when the cold water completely condenses it.
 We remark, that when we                    heat  the charcoal   alone, there
is continually           liberated      carbonated     hydrogen gas mixed
with carbonic acid            ; that    as  soon  as the sulphur passes, sul
 phuretted hydrogen gas is disengaged in very great quantities,
 and that as soon as the liquid sulphur begins to be formed,
 little or no gas is liberated.
      Physical properties. — The liquid sulphur obtained in the
 first operation is of a citron yellow colour, which seems to
 be merely accidental,             and owing to a superabundant portion
 of sulphur, since           by a new distillation we obtain it perfectly
  colourless,       very    transparent,      and of great fluidity j there
  remains in the vessel where it has been rectified a portion
  of sulphur, which unites in a mass or in small regular cry
  stals    if  the distillation has not been carried too far.               The
  density     of  liquid sulphur        is  considerably   more than    that of
  distilled water      ;   it has   a very   strong, fetid, sulphurous, pun
  gent, and        garlic-like       smell.     It has an extremely sharp,
  pungent, and very cold taste.                 The astonishing facility with
  which this fluid decomposes the light announces its great
 combustibility.
      Chemical properties. — When exposed to the air in any
  vessel, it vaporizes very speedily, and without leaving anv
   residue, when it is very pure : if we bring it within a few
  inches of an ignited body it takes fire very rapidly, yields a
  white      flame, which latterly becomes purple ; it diffuses a
   suffocating smell of sulphurous acid, and deposits upon the
   tides of surrounding bodies a yellow dust in every respect
   resembling sulphur.
      The water in which the liquid                sulphur has been    received
   assumes a       milky     appearance.in a few hours ; and the vessels
    3    .                                                                   are

   32    Experiments upon the liquid Sulphur         of Lampadiuf*
  are spotted    with some deep black specks. This water has
  the   same    smell with the liquid sulphur, although much
  weaker,     it possesses the property of precipitating several
  metallic     solutions, and particularly those of lead in an
  orange yellow, that of oxigenated murcury in white, that
  of tin in brick-coloured      yellow ; it does not redden turnsole.
     Concentrated      sulphuric acid does not seem to have any
  very remarkable action upon this substance ; latterly, how
  ever, it dissolves a certain quantity, and acquires a fetid
  smell.
    The nitric    acid seems to make     it undergo more alteration ;
 the liquid sulphur at first occupies the upper part of the
 liquid, but upon agitation it is divided into globules, which
 unite with great difficulty.        Upon placing this mixture in a
 convenient apparatus, so         as to make the gas pass through
 lime-water at a heat of         15  or 18 degrees, an elastic fluid
 Is liberated, which       does   not disturb   the lime-water,    and
 which inflames with the          same   colour   as oxide  of carbon.
 But the combustion takes          place instantly, and sulphurous
acid is extricated after     a  very pungent smell : the heat must
be extremely well managed, otherwise the sulphur would
pass into the lime-water.
    The nitric acid employed in this operation contains no
trace of sulphuric acid ; when we put it into oxy-muriatic
acid gas it acquires a citron yellow colour, and in a few
seconds that of the gas disappears ; and if we place it in
contact with the atmospheric air, it diffus.es a very fetid
and arsenical-like smoke in great abundance.              It has the
property of taking fire upon being brought near an ignited
body      this gas when well washed also inflames, and after
combustion exhales       a  smell of sulphurous acid, stronger or
weaker in proportion as it has been more or less washed.
    We poured upon the liquid sulphur a mixture of the sul
phuric and nitric acids, but there was no inflammation, and
the action even seemed to be Confined to a simple solution,
at least by diluting it with a certain quantity of water the
whole became perfectly clear. Some experiments seem to
show that the weak acids have more action upon this sub-
atance then the concentrated one*.
                                                                 Pure

    Pure caustic potash acts very feebly upon liquid sulphur :
 after some time, however, it is coloured, and acquires the
property    of precipitating      several metallic solutions     in colours
peculiar to this combination.
    Ammonia       seems      to  dissolve it   a  little more easily,      it
assumes a deep yellow colour,             and also precipitates the me
tallic solutions     :  caustic barytes     dissolves it also in    a great
 proportion,     and     assumes    an   orange colour     ; it precipitates
the metallic solutions in the same manner.
                seems to dissolve it in any proportion,           the solu
    Alcohol
tion is abundantly precipitated by water, and ;he sulphur
unites in small globules, which fall to the bouom of the
liquid.
    We   see  from these first efforts, that nothing whatever in
dicates the presence        of carbon in liquid sulphur, and they
authorize     us to think that it is only hydrogenated sulphur,
if  not to suppose that sulphur itself is a compound body.
The action of the oxygenated acids upon this substance ap
pears very^ remarkable, and seems to indicate a state of sul
phur analogous to that of the charcoal and the azot in the
gaseous oxides of carbon and azot.
    Note ly M. Vauquelin. — The above experiments were
made at my request, by            M.   Robiquet.       They are still far
from    demonstrating         the nature of the elements          of liquid
sulphur : we should have continued them                  if M. Berthollct
jun.   had   not announced          to  the  Institute    that he was en
gaged in a similar        investigation.     I should not now have
published these        facts, if I had not also informed the Insti
tute that   I  was    of   the same opinion with M. Berthollet,
having    been busy       in examining the composition of liquid
sulphur,    and   that I had even given M. Bint a considerable
quantity of it in order that he might expose light to its
action, and determine it possible, by its refrangent power,
the portion of hydrogen it contained.

     Temperament.
                                      To     Mr. Tilloch.
         SIR,                                                  Stratford Place* Feb. 3, 1808.
JL   have just           read    the paper             " On         the Stanhope      and other
Temperaments              of    the       Musical Scale," which                  is written by
Mr. John Farky,                       and        published "in the last number                  of
your Philosophical Magazine.                           The inaccuracy of Mr. Fa-
rey's statement obliges me                       to inform you correctly what the
facts were.
     Some menths ago                  I   received       from Dr. Callcott            a    printed
copy of         a   pamphlet,             entitled,      "
                                                        Plain Statement of Earl
Stanhope's Temperament, by                         Dr. Callcott." He begged me
to look it over, and to correct                        it,
                                previous to its publication.
But,     at that time,   extremely busy about my nautical
                               I   was
and other important pursuits, which made         very incon                  it
venient to me to comply with his request.      received from              I
the Doctor          a    letter, dated June 10th, 1S07, of which                               the
following are extracts, viz.
   " Curiosity has been so strongly excited                                 by   the Stanhope
Temperament,              that  I     thought        it   my duty even to record my
own errors on the subject; and therefore have printed 50O
copies of the pamphlet, not to sell, but merely to distribute
hereafter,          as   evidence how incorrect,
                                         imperfect, and in
complete my notions    were, compared with the improve
ments now making                   by
                        the superior mathematical and expe
rimental researches of Earl Stanhope."
     "
     I have ordered the advertisement of publication to be

separate and particular address on the subject                                   ;       and therefore
another pamphlet, containing a narrative of my original
dislike and subsequent recantation, will be (I am sure) in
teresting to his royal highness and all the world."
   Finding by that letter that Dr. Callcott had                                                already
ordered         "   the advertisement                of.   publication to            be    inserted in
all the papers for the 26/A      June,"    resolved to take the

rected     it,
             returned
                I        to Dr. Callcott.
                                     it         did thi« merely             I
out of good nature, and in order to prevent an imperfect
statement of my temperament from being published, when
itwas in my power to make    more correct.  Dr. Callcott
                                                     it
did himself           send,      by       Mr. Feigusson, that corrected copy
of   the   "Plain          Statement,"          to Mr. M'Millan the printer,
with directions from him (Dr. Callcott) to print the same.
He also sent,             by
                  the same person, to the same printer, the
manuscript of his letter to the duke of Cumberland.
  These facts are    sufficient refutation of the idle reports
                                 a
which have reached Mr. Farey upon this subject.
  As Mr. Farev has obliged me, much against niv wish, to
take up my pen again on his account                                 I
                                                                    ;must freely confess
that I     can perceive no merit                     in   his calculations.
I      have      expressedlength of the wire which yields the
                                     the

                                                           in
plain language of two thirds of the length of the wire which
yields the sound of the key-note C. This d<ies not, how
ever, satisfy Mr. Farey.  He     not contented till he has
                                                      is
told us, that two thirds may be expressed     -6666668 ad                       by

     He   not even content with this; for he introduces,

       What would any man think of a mathematician                               who
    should express the number 869               1  in the following manner?

       The difference between              a  man of real science, and one
    who has the ambition to be thought so, is very great.                        The
    first seeks to render difficult subjects, perspicuous and clear.
    The other, on the contrary, envelops even the most simple
    ideas    in the mysterious garb of hard words and scientific
   jargon. If Mr. Farey be of the first of those two classes, I
    should recommend to him to simplify and amend his tables.
                         I am, sir, your most obedient servant,

     VIII.    Upon the Decomposition of the Acetate of Barytes                      hy
                    means of Soda.            By M. Darcet*. .
    J-n   a late number of the Annalcs de Chimie f, M. Porpcres
    says, when speaking of the formation of the acetous acid in
    bad digestions, that in order to ascertain the presence of
    this acid,    "  he saturated        it with pure soda* and afterwards
    decomposed the acetate of soda by barytes ;" and he adds,
     "  that having set the soda free, he dissolved il in alcohol,
     which,     by seizing        upon the water of solution,               operated
     the precipitation        of    the    acetate     of  barytes     which       wai
     formed."
        The result of this experiment             is necessarily inaccurate,        as
     the following details will prove.
        I supppse that we have a solution                   of barytes     saturated
    hot:    if we pour it into acetate of soda,              there is immediately
    precipitated an infinity of small brilliant and iridated laminae.

If we     separate them from theliquor after its complete cool
ing,    if       we them in the smallest quantity of water
                        wash
possible, and dry them speedily by squeezing them between
several sheets of blotting paper, we shall have nothing but
pure crystals of barytes without mixture of acetate.                                  I   as
certained this in the following manner:
   1st,      exposed a part of these crystals to the air : in a few
             T
days,     the distilled water with which I washed the carbonate
obtained, gave no more precipitate by the addition of the sul
phuric acid, the carbonates, or alkaline sulphates. The whole
mass     of crystals           had therefore been converted into carbonate,
which would not have taken place if they had contained
acetate of barytes.
  • 2d, I dissolved two or three
                                 grammes of these same cry
stals in distilled water; the solution blued turnsole paper
which        was reddened          by an acid         :   there was an excess       of al
kali therefore.
   I    added some             drop*    of sulphuric acid to this solution,
and there was formed a solution                  of sulphate of barytes. I
tried     the     liquor       again    with        the reagent paper, and            I still
found    an excess of alkali.  I added by degrees sulphuric
acid, until there was a slight excess of acid in the liquor :
I filtered and found no more barytes, but little free sul
                  it,                                                  a
phuric acid  this would not have happened
                      ;                         the crystals           if
had contained acetate of barytes for'upon this supposition,
                                                     :
at the moment when the excess of acid began to hecomg
sensible to the  reagent paper, there must have been only a
very small quantity of acetate of barytes decomposed, and
acetous acid set at liberty. The filtered liquor should there
fore have contained      slight excess of acetous
                                    a                                         acid,       and
more acetate of barytes not decomposed     which               ;             is   contrary
to the result of experiments.
   3d, The mother                 water   of the crystals employed in the
preceding experiments, should contain nothing except the
little pure barytes which the cooled liquor could hold in
solution, besides the whole of the acetate of soda which had
been employed.                   What also demonstrates                the    analysis of

  38         On the Decomposition    of the  Acetate   of Barytei
   deposited are nothing else        than crystals of barytes : when
   tried as I have pointed out above, they only give very pure
   carbonate of barytes, and not an .atom of acetate.              If we
   also try these mother waters with the sulphuric acid, or
   with the alkaline carbonates, we immediately ascertain that
   they contain but little barytes, and plenty of acetous acid :
   this becomes still more perceptible if we evaporate them to
   dryness] and redissolve the residue in distilled water: for
  this solution      no longer contains an atom of barytes, but
  merely acetate      of soda ; tbe little barytes in it being carbo
  nated during the evaporation.
      Hence it follows, that barytes         does   not decompose the
  acetate of soda, and that, on the contrary, if we try the
  inverse experiment it will succeed. In fact, we shall decom
  pose the whole of the acetate of barytes by adding a suffi
  ciency of pure soda for saturating the whole acetous acid.
      It is not my object to invalidate the conclusion       in M. Por-
 peres's memoir:         they appear to be    just,  and   conformable
 to what is already         known.    I criticize   one  of the   proofs
 only they have furnished, and I profit by ihis occasion to
 mention that M. Anfrye and myself have already published,
 in the Annales Je Chlmie, a memoir upon the Affinities of
Barytes ; wherein wc have proved that in the classification
 of the alkalis, barytes should not be placed before potash and
 soda, except with respect to the sulphuric and carbonic
»cids ; that in every other circumstance, potash and soda
have affinities superior to that      of barytes.    How   does it hap
pen, then, that notwithstanding the facts so clearly demon
strated in our memoir, various authors have continued barytes
in its     old order of affinities?       In my opinion,    the results
published of experiments ought to be adopted, or refuted by
repeating them and showing their errors.
     I  shall conclude this note by calling to my assistance one
of the     processes,   the excellence of which has been demon
strated in our operations upon barytes on a large scale; — it is
naturally inferred from the facts above laid down.
     The decomposition of the muriate, the nitrate,            and  the
acetate     of barytes, by potash and soda, is so complete and
easy,     that it is certainly the simplest way of procuring in a
                                                            laboratory

                                               by means          of Soda.                                         39
 laboratory the barytes we require.    For this purpose we
 strongly calcine, in close vessels, 100 parts of sulphate of
.barytes well mixed with 20 parts of charcoal in powder.
After             calcination the crucible is allowed to cool ;
               an hour's
the residue is separated from it ; it is then diluted in water,
and        a    sufficient quantity                        of nitric acid, muriatic acid, or
acetous acid,                 is added               to    it:     the mixture is then slightly
heated,             which liberates                  a great       quantity of sulphuretted hy
drogen and carbonic acid,                                      of which    we must be upon our
guard.   When the effervescence ceases, and the reagent
paper announces in the liquor a slight excess of acid, we filter
and evaporate     in order to decompose the sulphuretted hy
                                  it,
drogen,  and  to precipitate the sulphur which was held in
solution*. The residue                                is   re-dissolved         in   the least            possible
quantity of water, and we                                 add to this solution            a   saturated       so
lution of caustic potash.                                  There       is   precipitated, even at the
moment              of mixture,   great quantity of crystals of harytes
                                               a                                                                  ;

         pressing them between several sheets of blotting pa

                                                          in
water: the filtered liquor deposits the barytes upon cooling,
                by by
which     this process    far purer and cheaper than that ob
                                                is
tained                  decomposing the nitrate                        of barytes,        by   exposing           it
alone to            a    high temperature.
  It must be observed, that we ought                                          to prefer the employ
ment of the muriatic or acetous acid                                           to that        of    the     nitric
acid   ;   in      place, because the first two acids form
                    the      first

washing    easier in this case
                    is          secondly, because in the so    :
lution,          the nitric acid, on being decomposed,                                        oxygenates          a
part of the sulphuret of barytes, and there     then                                 is                   portion

much concentrated that no barytes remains in solution ; that
whatever precaution we may take in the preparation of the
caustic alkali by lime, if not during the filtrations, there will
always be          a   portion of it carbonated           ;   consequently, the same
quantity will            be wanting         in   the quantity    of barytes we ought
to obtain      :                      its precipitation, as we

tity of it : that by washing also we experience a real loss;
and lastly, that by a new solution in boiling water it carbo
nates still more of it: it is visible that all these subtrac
tions united             leave       but    a    small quantity,      while by the    de
composition              of       the nitrate we
                                  absolutely obtain the whole
quantity of barytes  it contains, and °which amounts to very
near the half of the weight of dry salt ; and that besides, this
operation is neither difficult nor^expensive, when we know
how to manage it properly.
  Now the following are the precautions necessary to ensure
success ;
   Fill near two thirds of the crucible with dry and pulve
rized nitrate ; place the crucible with its lid in a common
furnace, in a gentle heat, so as merely to melt the salt in
its water of crystallization; increase the fire progressively
and with caution,                of the swelling up which
                                        on account
latterly takes place  when the mass, which should be then
                                    :
of a cherry red, lets no more bubbles escape, cover the cru
cible with an inch or two of charcoal ; adapt to the furnace
its dome provided with    pipe of gun metal : heat it thus for
                                           a
 a quarter of an hour; take the crucible from the fire; break
 it,   and pack up the barytes as                    quickly    as possible.
  I     also       treated         by    this process    seven     pounds      of nitrate,
 which   I     had divided into three common crucibles and placed
 in one furnace     produced the complete decomposition in
                             :I
 two hours, and     obtained three pounds six ounces of per
                             I
 fectly pure barytes. But    must be observed, that
                                                it    the ba                   if

                        it   is                     afterwards
                                                                        it
                                                                        is
 completely impossible, whatever heat we employ, to deprive
 itentirely of carbonic acid.  This    the whole difficulty at
                                                          is
 tending my operation.                     I     am therefore of opinion that         it   is
                                                                                    really

really more ceeonomical to extract barytes from the nitrate
by means of fire than to follow M. Darcet's process; for,
even supposing that the quantity of barytes was equal in both
cases,     what      I   have demonstrated could not exist-'— the price
of                       I
                was obliged to employ would have cost me
       the potash
almost double the expense. As to the purity of the article, as
we are obliged to manage the washings carefully, I do not
see that the process of M. Darcet merits the preference in
this respect; for it is very probable that the barytes thus
obtained should retain a little of the salt contained in the
mother water; and, on the contrary, that extracted from
the nitrate is extremely pure, if before decomposing it we
take the precaution of calcining it slightly and redissolve                        it,
in order      to separate        a   portion   of the iron proceeding from
the sulphate employed.

periments which               these
                         inquiries would   produce, might we
not establish the theory of one of the most important opera
tions of pharmacy, and the relations which its results must
have with the alkaline soaps ?
     Such are the considerations which led me to the follow
ing experiments           :
    I placed in                      equal parts of olive oi^
                       a tubulated bell glass
litharge, and water : I adapted to the orifice of the bell glass
a tube inserted into lime water, with a bladder at the orifice
to prevent the access of the external air j this bladder was
so disposed that I could move a spatula in the interior of the
bell glass, in order to keep the matter from sticking to the
bottom of the vessel.   The mixture having been brought to
the boiling point, I saw the oxide of lead successively pass
from red to yellow, and from yellow to white.   During the
time the experiment lasted carbonic acid was almost always
liberated. I allowed the apparatus to cool, in order to exa
mine successively the results                      of this experiment.
     The water which                had          served   asthe intermedium had a
strong metallic taste. When                           placed in contact with yeast
at the necessary temperature,                         I
                                                     never able to produce

acid and the hydrogen-..ted sulphurets f.                               I   passed sulphu

retted hydrogen into        until no more                                   precipitate         was
formed   ;      and  I   filtrated               in order to    separate the sulphuret
of lead.
  The filtered liquor had also very strong saccharine taste;

sulphuretted hydrogen.      My attempts to ferment                                       it    were
equally fruitless as before the separation of the oxide                                  of lead   :
exposed         to the air,        it   strongly attracts its humidity                  ;     when
     *
     Iwas for moment led into an error, because
                 a                                              I   had inadvertently used
yeast, which still contained some alcohol, not having               been properly washed.

   1   was convinced by various experiments that                 it  was of no importance
whether in the solution of the oxide of lead the fats                 or oils were rancid or
not, although Scheele thinks they should be rancid.                    In fact,   it   will   be seen
in the course of this paper that tliit circumstance               is   completely       foreign to
the solution.
                                                                                       projected

A\              Upon the Combination        of   the jkced Oil*
projected upon live coals, it burns like the oils : on boiling
it with the red, yellow, and white oxides of lead, it only
dissolves the yellow one: when distilled several times with
the nitric acid, it produces in it the formation of the oxalic
acid; when distilled in a retort in the open fire, a part
ascends in distillation, as observed by Scheele : on increasing
the fire, it gives empyreumatic oil as a result, acetic acid,
carbonic acid, carbonated hydrogen gas, and a slight spongy
charcoal, which does not contain any oxide of lead.
    From what I have described, it is strongly to be presumed
that oil, when combined with the white oxide                  of lead, is no
longer in the same state as it was before this combination.
    In order to separate it from this oxide I made use of the
acetic acid, because          the  solubility of the acetate of lead af
forded me an easy method of separating it from the oil, the
properties of which I was about to examine.
    This oil has the consistence of fat, having also the same
rancid taste      : it is insoluble in water, and soluble in alcohol,
and is precipitated by water           in the   same way as the volatile
oils,   and like these last is volatilized         in part with    the oil in
distillation*.
    The slightest ebullition        is sufficient for combining it per
fectly    with   the   white  oxide   of lead, and gives it a strong em-
plastic consistence, which does not take place with litharge
and massicot.
    The yellow       and white oxides of lead cannot be combined
•with   the  common       oils ; I ascertained this fact by an ebulli
tion much stronger than if I had employed litharge.
    It results, therefore, from these experiments, that when
we treat the fat oils with litharge, the oxygen of the latter
carries off their carbon, and previously their hydrogen, in
order to form water and carbonic acid.
    That this subtraction, rendering oxygen more abundant
in the oils, gives rise to that saccharine substance which
Scheele calls the sweet volatile principle of oils.
    That this sweet principle differs from the mucoso-saccha
   * All  the fat oils are dissolved in alcohol ; those, however, which have
been   treated with litharge are much more strongly characterized with this
property.
                                                                         rine

               with the Oxides   of Lead and      the  Alkalis.         45
rine by the property it possesses of dissolving the yellow
oxide of lead ; that its saccharine taste is independent of the
presence of the oxide; that it differs from sugar by its vo
latility, and by the impossibility to ferment it.
    That oil deprived of      the   principles which have given rise
to the sweet principle,      and   of   the quantify of hydrogen and
carbon which constitutes it a fixed oil, acquires several                of
the properties of the volatile oils.
     Finally, that this last state of oil is the only one which
can be combined        with the white oxide of lead.
     From the knowledge I have acquired of the theory of this
combination of the oils, I did not think it right to neglect
 to ascertain to what extent the opinion of several chemists
is founded, who consider the plasters as true metallic soaps.
The analogy between the plasters and the soaps can only be
verified by observing in their respective combinations a re
 semblance in the phenomena, or at least in the results.
     I  mixed some pure soap-makers' ley with olive oil ;             I ex
 posed    this  mixture  to the   air under   a  bell  glass.   Eight days
 afterwards there was only a slight absorption ; the soap had
 still a strong alkaline taste, and the oil of this soap was not
 entirely dissolved in alcohol        :   but at the end of six weeks
 the absorption of the oxygen was complete ; the soap was
 very white, of a good consistence ; the alkaline taste was but
 feeble ; diluted sulphuric acid liberated carbonic acid from
 it;    the oil proceeding from this decomposition            had the same
  consistency with that from the plasters, was dissolved cold
 in alcohol with the greatest facility, and was precipitated
  from it by water.
      I  made soap in the same way as the soap-makers;               I exa
  mined with the greatest care the liquor remaining after the
  operation     was finished, but       I  could    discover no trace     of
  sweet principle.
      As   the  absence   of this principle in     the alkaline soap-ma
   king probably depends only upon a greater' or less subtrac
  tion of carbon or hydrogen, and the action of oxygen
   upon oil, and the state of the oil, are absolutely the same in
   the making of plasters as in soap-making, I think the plas
                                                                        ters

   46          Description   of the Mountain Barometer.
  ters should be considered relatively to the soaps as the inso
  luble metallic salts are relative to the alkaline salts.
     I  am convinced that the defect       in the consistency of the
  soaps of potash by no means depends upon the state of the
  oil, but rather upon the kind of combination ; for I never
  obtained any thing but         a  soft soap on treating by potash
  some oil proceeding from        a very dry soap of soda.

        SIR,
  -L HE various advantages which are likely to be derived
 from taking altitudes of every description, in a short time,
 with   very  little  trouble,   and at  a small expense, gives me
 every reason to suppose the curious and enlightened mind
 will be pleased with a description of a new portable moun
 tain barometer, contrived,        and most peculiarly adapted, for
 that  useful  purpose, by     a gentleman well known in the phi
 losophical world.       Its great simplicity in use, as well as
 portability,   renders it superior to any barometer yet made.
    The celebrated experiment devised by Pascal (says the
 French National Institute, in their Transactions of 1805,)
 and   which proved, that      a  column of mercury decreased in
 proportion as     the barometer was carried to a greater height,
after having proved the gravity of the air, must have made
the mercury be considered as a scale capable of measuring
the height to which it is carried.         But this scale being very
small,    in comparison of the heights which it ought to mea
sure, it was soon perceived, that it would be necessary to
improve the construction of the barometer, so far as to
render sensible and appreciable the smallest changes in the
height of the mercury.         The necessity of avoiding or of cal
culating the continued variations which the barometer ex
periences, even without changing its place, presented an
other obstacle, much more formidable, and which seemed

  48            Description   of the Mountain     Barometer.
  of  the   earth, to   a  considerable precision,      than any other
  known process, that it might have been             supposed that, in
  the course of thirty years, which have             elapsed   since this
  branch    of science    has   been perfected, a very great number
  of observations would         have been   made, and the heights of
  almost the whole surface of our own country ascertained by
  the numerous travellers who continually traverse it.               The
  contrary is however the case ; and the small number of ob
  servations of this kind may be attributed to several causes.
    The instruments are of considerable expense, and, from
 their complicated construction, easily liable to be out of
 order in the course of a long journey.
    The observations themselves, though each not taking up
 any very long time, yet, when multiplied on every hill and
 valley, as they ought        to be, for the purpose of obtaining a
just   idea  of the  face  of the country surveyed, in the aggre
 gate  consume much of the traveller's time ; and the comtant
 unpacking and re-packing the instrument, becomes a greater
 labour than our natural indolence.. easily submits to.
    It has moreover been generally supposed, that two instru
ments and two observers making simultaneous observations
at the upper and lower stations         of the height to be measured,
are indispensably necessary.           This, of course, would put it
out of    the   power of    a  solitary traveller to make any obser
vations at all.
    Whether from these,           or other causes,    the fact is, that
whoever       reads the numerous       Tours, Surveys,     and   Reports
of the different parts of our island, published within these
last twenty years, and many of them professedly with a view
to science, either of agriculture, mineralogy, or- geology,
will be perpetually disappointed, by meeting with mere
guesses at the elevations       of the tracts of country     described  :
though     a  knowledge of      those elevations is almost indispen
sable to the geologist,       mineralogist, and military surveyor;
highly     useful to the    scientific agriculturist, and very inter
esting to every one, who, from mere motives of enlarged
and enlightened curiosity, reads books of travels, or em
ploys his own leisure in traversing the countries described by
other voyagers.
                                                               I cannot,

     I cannot,
            therefore, but hope, by simplifying the baro
meter, and thereby rendering the instrument much less ex
pensive, and its use at the same time more easy, and show
ing that very considerable accuracy may be attained by a
single observer, this most useful branch of science may be
cultivated, to so great an extent, that, in the course of a
few years, we may have almost as perfect an idea of the re
lative heights of the different parts of England, as we now
have      of their horizontal distance.
     barometer, nearly similar to that which I am now
     A
about to describe, was constructed, several years since, by
Dr. Hugh Hamilton, and is by him described at large in
the fifth volume of the Transactions of the Irish Academy.
I                    in his hands, nearly seventeen years
    saw the instrument,
ago, and was much pleased with its performance.   I do not
know, however, that any more were then made.        I have
lately constructed the barometer, whose description I shall
now give, which is still more simple than Dr. Hamilton's,
and much cheaper, and which, in many trials I have made
of     appears to unite solidity, lightness, and ease of ob
     it,
servation, to as great   degree as can be wished.
                                   a
     The barometer              tube     about 33£ inches in length
                                           is                                     ;   its
bore     is   a    tenth   of   an inch in diameter, and its external                 di
ameter        is   three-tenths of an inch.            This sized bore        is   fully
sufficient to allow the free                    motion of the mercury *.            The
cistern    of box-wood, turned truly cylindrical, and
              is                                        one                    is
inch in its external diameter, and an inch in depth   short               ;   a
stem projects from its top (the instrument being in   posi                    a
tion for making an observation), for the purpose of giving
a  firmer hold to the tube: this stem      perforated  with is                         a
hole sufficiently large to admit the tube, which      glued to           is
it   in    the usual mode.             The       tube   projects into the cistern
   • Several barometers have been latelyi constructed by Mr. Jones, with the
lower part of the tube only twentieth of an inch in bore, something on the
                                   a
principle of the marine barometers. Tins alteration was made because in
some few instances when very carelessly used, air had got into the tube. In
the form now adopted*   this defect' seems completely remedied, and the mo
tion of the mercury, though full free enough for accuracy,        rendered so

equable, that observations in carriage are much easier.

                Description
exactly to half its depth. The bottom of the cistern is closed
by a strong lid of box, which screws on the cistern, and,
pressing against a leather glued to the inside of the lid, ren
ders the whole perfectly impervious to the mercury in every
position.  The tube being filled and boiled in the common
way, and the instrument held inverted in a perpendicular
position, mercury is poured into the cistern till it is filled
within two-tenths of an inch of the top. The lid is then
firmly screwed on, and secured from being opened, (by idle
curiosity,) by a small screw passing through its side. The
essential part of the instrument is now finished.     The end
of the tube, in the cistern, can never be uncovered by the
mercury in any possible position, and, of course, no air can
ever enter into it ; and, as the areas of the cistern and tube
are as the square of the diameters, the diameter of the bore
of the tube being M, its external diameter •3, and the di
ameter   of the cistern     1*0, the area   of the cistern is    100 — 9 91,
and there being two-tenths  of an inch left empty in the. cis
tern, the mercury must fall 182-tenths, or 18 inches and
two-tenths, before the cistern is quite full ; a space adequate
to the measure of greater heights than any known mountain
on the earth, much more to that of any height in this coun
try.  It will not easily be believed, by those who have not
seen it, that the air will act on     cistern thus completely
                                            a
closed, and      of which     the wood,   in    its thinnest part,    is   above
a quarter of an inch in thickness but the fact
                                            ;      that even    is,
when the pores of the box wood are closed                 by
                                               thick varnish
(except    that part which touches the mahogany tube,) in
           in
order to prevent the wood from being affected     damp, the    by
mercury, on turning up the barometer, takes jts level almost
instantaneously, certainly in less than half minute; and  a
that, when the instrument            is   suspended     by   the side   of    the
best mountain barometer, of Ramaden's construction, with
an open cistern, no difference whatever can be perceived in
their sensibility to the variations of the atmosphere.                      It   is
obvious that the variations of altitude in this instrument, its
dimensions being as above stated, will be one ninety-first
part less than in   barometer furnished with an apparatus for
                      a

     level  this defect might be remedied by dividing the scale ac
             :
    cordingly j but it is much more convenient to divide the scale
    to real inches, and make the necessary allowance in the result.
       The       tube and cistern being thus prepared,                   are mounted   in
    a mahogany tube or frame                     of the size of   a   common walking-
    stick.        The   stem      of
                                cistern goes into the mahogany
                                       the
    tube, and is there secured hy a piece of brass tube, which
    fits to the cistern and mahogany frame to which it is screw
    ed ; or the stemmay be on the outside, cut into a male
    screw, and so be screwed into the mahogany tube. The
    tube is secured in the mahogany case by passing through per
    forated corks in the usual way.
       For the observation of     the height of the mercury, two
•
    opposite slits are cut in the   mahogany tube, reaching from
    about 32 to 20 inches for the long scales; and 32 to 25
    inches for the short ones                    ;   which   are sufficiently long   for
    any purpose in this country.    The front slit has its sides
    bevelled, and is, exteriorly, about three-fourths of an inch
    wide j on one side is fixed a brass scale, divided as usual to
    inches, tenths, and twentieths.     On this scale a nonius
    slides, moveable by a small knob, which rtads off, as in
    other barometers, to 500th of an inch.  To this nonius a
    small portion of brass tube is attached, which embraces
    the barometer tube, and                 its lower edge        is,   in observation,
    made     tangent to the convex surface of the mercury, as
             a
    in other well-constructed barometers and the very narrow ;
    slit behind gives abundant light for observation.
        On the bevelled side of the front slit, opposite the scale,
a      thermometer      placed for taking the heat of the instru
                         is
ment      ;      and there   is   room for the scale of correction, placed
on Ramsden's attached thermometers,                  as well as Fahrenheit's
scale. This thermometer                     is   so contrived as to take out     of its
place, and answers the purpose of the attached and detached
thermometer.
      A   thin brass tube, with slits in                 it,
                                                    turns half round, on
two pins, in the usual                  manner, and covers the apertures
above described in the mahogany tube when the barometer
isnot in use.
      The mahogany            tube     is   made rather tapering, and with           a

ferrule at the end opposite the cistern.                This ferrule un
screws, and shows a steel ring, by which the barometer may
be suspended        when convenient.
       Along the mahogany tube is a scale of feet, carefully
divided to inches ; the feet being accurately laid down by
 small dots, on the heads of brass pins, sunk into the wood.
 A      scale of this kind   is always convenient,     and may often be
 of     great use.
        To  those travellers whose        pursuits may lead them to the
  measures      of the higher     class  of mountains, I would venture
  to ftcommend a barometer constructed with a tube of two
   feet    long only ; so that the whole instrument should not
   much exceed 25 inches in length.                This barometer would
   not of course be useful until the mercury fell below 24
   inches, which would be at a height of about 6000 feet in
    the atmosphere : but its great portability into regions where
   from both the difficulties of the path, and the rarity of the
    air breathed, every ounce of incumbrance becomes a serious
    evil; and moreover, the great security •to the instrument
    itself arising from its shortness, would, I am persuaded,
 .
    render it well worth while to carry such instruments where
     great altitudes are to be measured; and it is to be remem
     bered that the instrument loses no part         of its accuracy when
     it once comes into action,         by being thus shortened.
         Having    thus   described     the instrument, a few practical
     remarks on the manner of using it may not be superfluous.
         When I am about to make an observation, about five
     minutes before      I arrive at the place I take out the thermo
      meter, holding it by the upper end at nearly arm's length
      from my body, and, if the sun shines, in the shade of my
      person.     Ii very soon takes the temperature of the air, and
      is not sensibly affected by the heat of the hand. The heat
      being observed and written down, the barometer is turned
      up ; the brass tube half turned ; and the instrument held be
      tween the finger and thumb of the left hand aboue the slit,
       so as to let  it hang   freely in a perpendicular position.      Few
       persons, if any, have        sufficient steadiness   of hand  to pre
       vent little  vibrations    in   the  mercury  in  this position : the
       hand, therefore, should be either rested against any fixed
                                                                       body,

              Description       of the Mountain Barometer.                     53
body, or, if no such occurs, by kneeling on one knee. The
cistern should be. let down so as to touch the ground, the
left hand holding the barometer in a vertical position, which
a little practice  will render veiy easy. The index must then
be moved by     the knob till its under surface, as before stated,
is tangent to the mercury. A few light taps should be given
to the tube, to ascertain that the mercury has fallen as low
as it can.  The height being then read off and registered,
together with that of the attached thermometer, the brass
tube is turned back, so as to cover the slits ; the instrument
gently inverted, and the whole is finished.                   All   this may be
done in two minutes.
  It  may not he improper here to add, that I have found
by experience that it is not necessary to quit the chaise in
order to make observations with this barometer ; it is only
requisite for the horses to stand still. The thermometer, if
held at arm's length out of the chaise window, will give the
temperature exactly, before the order is given to stop the
carriage ; and the delay to the traveller will not much ex
ceed a minute, as the observation may be read                      off and writ
ten down while the carriage is again going on.
  The most convenient mode for deducing the heights from
the barometrical observations              is,   certainly,   by   the common
logarithmic tables and ;         it
                         unnecessary  isto detail the     here
method, which may be found in numerous books.      is,                    It
however, necessary for this method to carry the tables of lo
garithms, which    sometimes inconvenient.
                       is                      The engraved
table formed     by    Mr. Ramsden

      it                                     Several inge
nious formulae have been devised, which may either be en
graven on the instrument itself, or committed to memory.
Of                 George Shuckburgh has given
      the former,sir                             very con           a

elegant one of the latter sort but these, though very simple
                                       ;

observed heights              of   the barometer,           and           halve the sum to
obtain the mean    height.                  2d, Subtract the lesser
                                                     height

Multiply the number thus obtained        the tenths, &c. of      by
an inch of difference of height. The result will he nearly
the number of feet, answering to the difference of height be
 tween the two barometers                       at the   temperature               of freezing.
When   the lower barometer stands between 29 and 30 inches,
and the elevation does not exceed 1500 feet, this rule will
give the height within one foot of the result from the loga
rithmic method.    When the elevation       about 3000 feet,         is
the error will be nearly three feet, and at heights greater
than 3000 feet, the error increases      higher ratio.      in   a                            Itis

do not exist         ;              where a knowledge of the
                         and in those parts
comparative heights of                  hills is the most gene
                                     the different
rally useful, they seldom exceed 10OO feet; at all events,
such observations as relate to great elevations may be always
recomputed by more rigorous methods at leisure.
  The correction of the heights thus obtained, for the tem
perature of the air above freezing, is by sit George Shuck-
burgh supposed to be                  height of the thermometer, and
                                   as the
to be 2*44 thousandth          of the approximate height for each
degree       of   Fahrenheit, additive when the temperature is above
freezing, and subtractive when below freezing.  Genera]
Roy's observations and experiments lead to a supposition
that the correction is not exactly as the height of the ther
mometer, and that at about the temperature of 5O degrees-
it amounts to 2-5 — thousandths, and is less, both much
above and much below                 that temperature. For the purpose
of immediate computation,                  I take the correction at 2-5,
which, though certainly Tather too great, will in general be
productive of very small error, and affords a rule which is
easily remembered and quickly applied.    It is this :
   For every four degrees that the mean   temperature of the
two detached             thermometers exceeds             32 degrees,      add    one
hundredth    of the approximate height,                     as before obtained,
to it  for every 40 degrees one tenth, and so for any greater
         ;
or lesser number of degrees.
     I   have            mentioned the correction, which in
                  not hitherto
fact ought to be the first in order, viz. that for the differ
ence of temperature of the two barometers themselves : but
this correction is in general so small, as to be safely neg
lected.  Should            it,
                      however, be thought necessary to apply
it in this approximate method of computing hc-ights, the

follows, and   wants no table, though he has given one

for it.
   When the barometer                    stands at 20 inches, the expansion
of the mercury for one                  degree    of Fahrenheit      is   two-thou
sandth of an inch,               when    it   stands   at 30 inches   it   is   three-
thousandths, and for the intermediate inches                    it   increases ex*

actly as     the height of the mercury; that is, at 21 inches it
is -0021, at 22 inches .0022, and so on; so that the height
in inches is the number of ten thousandths of expansion for
one degree        of Fahrenheit.          This       is very easily remembered.
The expansion for any other number of degrees is in propor
tion to the degrees themselves ; that is. for two degrees it is
twice   as   much,          for ten degrees         ten   times    as      much, and so
on.     Take therefore the difference                  of height of             the attached
thermometers   at the two stations, and multiply the expan
sion for one degree at the coldest barometer (which will al
most always be the one at the highest station) by the num
ber of degrees of difference between the heat of the two ba
rometers, and add the quantity to the observed height of the
coldest barometer, and it is corrected for the expansion of
the mercury by the heat of the instrument.
     An example will make             the whole clear.

  One hundredth of an inch is therefore to be added to the

   These two examples show how near the truth the method
here recommended will come, even in considerable heights.
   It has been already observed, that in observations made
with the barometer      I   have described, a small correction is
necessary on account of the rise of the mercury in the cis
tern, as the barometer falls.           Altitudes being in all cases

measured by the differences of the heights of the mercury at
the two stations, and these differences being evidently al
ways too small in this barometer, the corrtction is obviously
always additive.  As in constructing different barometers,
the interior and exterior diameters of the tube will not al
ways be exactly similar, though the cisterns may be turned
always alike ; this error, and of course the correction for                                it,
should be in each instrument deduced from          comparison     a

It will probably vary in different instruments from nine                        a
tieth to    a   seventieth.     Indeed,        ifit    were always taken at an
eightieth, in instruments constructed as above directed, the
possible error could only amount to about one foot on                                      a

bable   error to be incurred              by   using   a   single one.          There      is
no doubt,   that when very great accuracy      required, two    is

the habit of taking observations of altitudes      single ba      by   a
rometer,             had many opportunities of repeating my
                and have
observations on the same hills when the barometer has been
at different heights, and either falling or rising during the
time of observation   and more than once

 again, and note the time.          If the barometer has altered in
 the interval, a simple proportion corrects either of the three
 observations, and reduces the height to what would have
 been observed       had the mercury been stationary.        It is true
 that this method supposes the motion of the mercury to have
 been uniform during the interval of observation ; but except
 in  very variable weather,      which   does not often occur,     par
 ticularly in summer, when the greater number of these ob
 servations will naturally be made, this supposition is liable
 to but small error.       It is also true, that a traveller has often
 no opportunity of making a second observation at the spot
 he sets out from.       Even in this case, a near approximation
 may often be made by observing, for example, at a stream
 on each side of the hill to be measured.          If also he observes
 the barometer repeatedly in the morning before he sets out,
 and sees its tendency, and does the s-ame at every halt, during
 the day, he will have data whereon to found a nearly accu
 rate correction.      But if all this should be out of his power,
 even under the most unfavourable circumstances, barome
trical observations will give a much more accurate idea of
 the outline of a country than any we now possess ; and it
 should be ever remembered, that observations though defec
tive,   if carefully  made, and faithfully    recorded, are valuable,
 and if repeated by different travellers the errors will, in most
cases, compensate each other, and from the whole very ac-r
 curate conclusions may be drawn.

   P. S. On comparing several barometers made by Mr. Thomas
Jones, since this description was first written, I find that in
 some of them the mercury does not take its true height on,
 turning       up the instrument,          quite so quick       as in the two
 which     he first constructed for me.             This difference   is owing
 to the greater closeness of fibre in some pieces of box wood
 than in others, but it does not affect the accuracy of the in
 strument.         In order to give a quicker action to these baro
 meters     I   advised  Mr. Jones        to bore a small hole or two           in
  these cisterns,       and insert a     pin of open grained wood into
  them.       This answered perfectly well; but a curious circum
  stance occurred : when deal or willow wood pins were in
   serted, the mercury, when shaken for some time, passed
   through the pores of these woods in the form of a fine black
   powder, and it was necessary to substitute ashen pins to
   confine it in the cistern.          It may not be superfluous to say,
   that the weight       of   this   barometer     is less than a pound and
   a half.      The weight of Ramsden's last improved barometer
   is 4-J- pounds, and that of his earliest about 6f pounds.                      I
    subjoin a few observations by which the accuracy of this
    barometer may be fairly estimated.

A.   correspondennt         asserts   in your Magazine for last

cation  of 2lb. descending through        three feet, he raises 20lb.
through two feet.     He wishes       to have some        person's opi

have many ; and on so extraordinary an assertion,                         I   could
not forbear giving mine.
  As the gentleman has neither given a description nor
drawing of his machine, it is impossible to give any other
opinion of it than a general one, and that must be against
it : for it is not very likely that the gentleman should have
discovered any latent property in the mechanical powers;
since they have been tried in so many different ways and
forms, and by so many ingenious persons, that, had there
been      such latent power, surely some of them would have
discovered it.      But they have hitherto found, that these
powers act according to certain immutable laws, beyond
which, not one jot can they be forced. The mechanical
powers, by a little consideration, may all be reduced to the
effect    of   a lever, or a combination              of   levers ; and       I   can,
with safety, affirm that the lever possesses no such power as
that which he attributes to his machine.
     I
     should limit this last expression a little, for I do not
attempt to deny what he so positively asserts, but this I can
with equal confidence assert ; that though his machine may
perform as above related, it is impossible that it should con
tinue to do so ; that    that   is,
                                  should continue to produce
                                            it
a  rotary motion,  with that  power with which        set out.     it
It   must sooner or later come to         state of rest, and will then

require as much             external power to restore the machine to
its former state, as          it    had apparently gained power beyond
the laws       of   mechanics,        by   its first effort.   Then where           is
the advantage        of the machine         ?
     If   the gentleman         would        as to favour us
                                           be so obliging
with      adrawing and description of his machine, we may
judge of the fact much better and        convinces the world
                                           ;        ifit

  XIII.    Extract of a Memoir upon the Products which result
    from the Action of the Metallic Muriates, tlie Oxy-mu-
     riatic Acid, and the Acetic Acid, upon Alcohol. By
     M. Thenard*.
  JV1. Thenard demonstrates in this memoir, that the                  me
  tallic muriates form with alcohol only a very small quantity
  of ether ; that this ether, which is at first dissolved in
  a great quantity     of alcohol, may be separated from it by a
  gentle   heat in  the   form of gas, particularly by means of
 warm water, which seizes upon the alcoholic part, and puts
 the etherated part at liberty to a certain point ; that this
 ethereagted gas has a very great analogy to that obtained with
 the muriatic acid and alcohol ; that in both cases it has the
 same smell and taste, the same solubility            in water, the same
 manner of burning         with   a green    flame diffusing vapours    of
 the muriatic acid, although before the combustion no re
 agent indicated the presence of the gases ; in short, thifrfhty
 only differ from each other by the etherated muriatic gas
 not liquefying, except at a heat of 12-5 of the centigrade
 thermometer, while the other becomes liquid at + 16-5.
This difference being very slight, M. Thenard thinks              we can
no longer hesitate to acknowledge the nature and mode of
formation to be the same in both : thus in the metallic muri
ates, it is only the excess of acid which acts upon the alcohol,
&c. that for this    reason alcohol cannot be converted into ether
except    by a great   quantity of metallic muriate, and that this
conversion is the easier, the greater excess of acid the mu
riate contains, and the more it is soluble in alcohol : the
muriate    of tin therefore will succeed better in this operation
than any other. In all cases the oxide of the muriate is not
de-oxidated, and a portion only of this tixide is precipitated.
    Proceeding to consider the action'of the oxy-muriatic acid
upon alcohol, he shows that in the re-action of these two
bodies upon each other, which is very brisk, almost all the
oxy-muriatic     acid is decomposed, and that much water is
produced, plenty of muriatic acid, undecomposed alcohol,

                                                                  a great

   a great quantity of oily matter thicker than water, having a
   cool taste like mint, and a peculiar smell completely diffe
   rent from that of ether : further, a small quantity of car
  bonic acid, a matter easily charred, and probably acetous
  acid, but no ether            : — that   the oxy-muriatic    ether of Scheele
  is merely muriatic ether               properly so called, when made of
. a    mixture of alcohol,             muriatic acid, and black oxide of
  manganese         ;  or of muriatic ether and sulphuric ether, when
  made with the black oxide                of manganese, sea-salt, alcohol,
  and sulphuric acid            : — that Pelletier's    is also of this nature,
  since he made it by using the foregoing mixture; and that
  the oxy-muriatic             ether said to be obtained by passing the
  oxy-muriatic acid through alcohoj, is nothing else than a
  solution in alcohol of a greater or less quantity of oily mat
  ter.     We      may      even     separate    the oil from     the   latter    by
  means      of water,      and     we re-form it all at once by dissolving
  this oil in     a   determinate quantity of alcohol.
       The novelty in this part of the author.s labours does not
  consist in this formation of oily matter, water, acetous
  acid, &c. ; for Scheele, in his Memoires de Chimie, speaks of
  the     oily matter ; and M. Berthollct, in the Memoires de
  I. Academic for 1785, speaks of this matter, and besides of
  water, acetous acid, &c, as produced in this operation.
  M.     Thenard's claim to novelty consists in his having proved*
  that the oxy-muriatic acid could not with alcohol form
  ether ; and he has explained why Scheele and so many other
  chemists happened to obtain it.
       In the last place, being anxious to examine the formation
  of the acetic ether, M. Thenard mixed together 120 gram
  mes' of highly concentrated alcohol, and                        120 parts of
  acetic acid, of ah acidity determined by the quantity of pot
  ash required by this acid for its saturation ; he distilled                   this
  mixture,       cohobated        it twelve times, and thus sensibly de
  composed the who|e of the alcohol employed, and 66" 16
  grammes of acetic acid, representing 32 grammes of dry
     •  M.   Berthollet,  in the Memoires    de I./lcadmie for 1785,  has   even an
  nounced that the muriatic          acid and alcohol produce but very little ether ;
  and we may perceive (hat he is inclined to regard this small quantity of ether
  as foreign to the re-action of these two bodies.

acid, or        as   it    exists       in   the    aeetite    of   potash well           melted.
About      120 grammes only                    of   acetic ether were formed, how
ever, although no gas was liberated; and the operation when
terminated presented a loss of seven grammes only : from
this M. Thenard is led to think that a portion of the oxygen
of the acetic acid is combined with a portion of the hydro
gen of the alcohol, while the other principles of the acid and
those of the alcohol unite to constitute ether. Otherwise, if
no water wis formed, it would be necessary, in order to ac
count for this operation, to admit that the best rectified al
cohol contains nearlv one-fifth of its weight of water, which
is scarcely probable.   This ether has a pleasant smell of
ether and acetic acid, and yet it neither reddens turnsole
tincture nor turnsole paper; it has a taste peculiar to itself,
and very different from thai of alcohol.   Neither its specific
gravity nor its tenuity, has been as yet exactly taken ; all
we know is, that it is lighter than water, as it floats above                                       it,
and more turbid than alcohol.       Water seems to dissolve
more of        it   than   of    the sulphuric ether.               It    burns with       a   yel
lowish white flame, producing an acid, which    probably the                    is
acetic. Finally,, in   sealed flask, adoes not seem  to alter it

by    Mr. Paul's mtthod, in order to/estimate                   the quantity of
camphor dissolved.                  I     weighed the camphor before and after
the solution, and               I       found that the distilled water had ab
sorbed     1 6   grains        of   it   per   pint,    and the carbonic acid                  only

15   grains.     As I  had   been    obliged to filter the liquors and
to dry the filters, I thought that the camphor not dissolved
must have lost its weight by evaporation, and that the ba
lance did not give me the just quantity absorbed by the
water : I therefore sought for a reagent, which evinced to
me the presence       of camphor in the water.
    I found that      potash precipitated the camphorated water,
while     soda   or ammonia did not affect it ; but the potash
must be pure and caustic.            If it contains carbonic acid, it
does not precipitate the camphor ; and               if  after  having pre
cipitated it we expose the vessel to the air, the liquor absorb
ing carbonic acid resumes its transparency.
    Here, therefore, is a new method of distinguishing pot
ash    from soda.       Camphorated water is in this respect a
 more certain reagent than the nitro-muriate of platina, and
 more easily procured.        But the metallic salt is more con
 venient, as it precipitates the carbonate of potash.
    On trying by caustic potash camphorated water charged
 with carbonic acid, I obtained no precipitate, except by put
 ting in a great excess of alkali : this precipitate did not seem
 to be greater than that obtained in distilled water.               I think,
 therefore, that carbonic       acid does not sensibly favour the
 solution     of camphor in water         ; but it at least results from
 these    experiments, that the water does not merely charge
 itself with the aroma of the camphor,           as some chemists think,
 and that this concrete volatile oil is dissolved in a proportion
  sufficient for the purposes       to which       it is applied.     When
  the camphor is reduced very small by trituration with some
  drops of alcohol, water takes up more of it than 16 grains
 per pint,     and some chemists have dissolved even 30 grains.

  mets, und hope that, though not quite accurate, they will not
 be found to err much.
     The drawing    (see Fig.) represents the comet's orbit simply
 applied   to, but   not projected on the plane of the ecliptic.
 The outer circle     t,  ss, tt, ltf, is drawn at pleasure with
 any radius. —A B C D is the earth's, and E V F part of the
 comet's orbit : X S V its axis : 8 8 the line of nodes :
 V   the perihelion point, and S V the perihelion distance.
     The elements of the orbit are nearly as follows : The
 perihelion distance = 0-64802 ; the distance of the earth
 from the sun S     A  or S B being = 1-00000.
    The time of    the comet's   passing the perihelion at  V  was
 September 18th, 22 hours 10 minutes M. T.
    The longitude of Von the orbit was 28° 41' in Scorpio.
    The longitude of the ascending node 26° 36' in Sagit
tarius.
    The comet    passed   the ascending node September 29th,
 18h 48m.
    The longitude of the axis S X as seen from the sun, was
in 13° 11' of Gemini j and its elevation or north latitude
24° 43'. — The inclination of the orbit 63° 15': — this is
easily conceived, by supposing the visible part of the orbit
from re to F to revolve upon the line of nodes 8 re till any
point in the orbit, as F, is elevated 63^-° above the plane of
the ecliptic.
    The comet was seen here soon after it passed V ; the earth
at that time was nearly at A, moving from thence towards B ;
while at the same time the comet moved from            V  towards
F ; and consequently its motion was direct.

sible to   see the comet in the inferior part of its orbit E V,

  XVI.     A  Second    Letter from E. V. on        the   Means    of
                   gaining Power in Meclianics.
                           To  Mr. Tdhch.
  MSIR,dch as  the moderns are reckoned to surpass the antients
  in mathematical knowledge,         and notwithstanding    the ex
  perience and improvements in mechanics, during the later
 and more enlightened ages, it is a mortifying truth that we
  are even at this day totally ignorant of the means formerly
  employed, and very extensively in use, to move to vast di
  stances, and raise to great height, prodigious masses and
 weights,   such as the celebrated columns of Egypt, Rome,
  &c. ; and that with all our advantages over the antients, we
 still remain unable to equal their practice in these respects.
 It  does not appear that our predecessors    were gifted with su
 perior intellect or strength to the present race ; their mean*
 must have been mechanical, and therefore must be within our
 reach. — Why then should we not attempt and expect to do
 as much as they did ?       It is truly surprising that an art of
 so useful and important a nature, so nearly allied to the me
 chanical powers in constant varied use and progressive im
 provement among us, has so long been lost and escaped
 discovery ! Perhaps the time is not distant when this mighty
 secret shall again be common for the general benefit of so
 ciety.   My humble      endeavours    have occasionally been di
 rected to this end   ; and   with this view I have contributed
 my mite,    and shall continue so to do     by the communica
 tion, through your valuable Magazine,         of  relative  experi
 ments and results which may be novel, in the hope of sti
mulating the exertions of the more scientific ; — fori as
                                                             " great
events oft owe their rise to trivial cause," my hints may
haply furnish abler heads with ideas which may lead further
 than I can pretend to penetrate ; and thus, between us, the
period   of success may be accelerated.
    In my last, I gave account of an engine of my contri
vance, which gained considerable power : — this engine has
since been so improved, that with the same moving power,
the same     velocity,  &c, it   raises a weight of thirty pounds
                                                            instead

instead   of twenty,     and there     is consequently reason to be
lieve that    it may yet be made far more powerful.
    Aware of the reception which this extraordinary fact, so
contrary to established opinions, is likely to meet, I have
sought, and been so fortunate as to find, additional support
in further experiments, and the construction of another
engine materially different from the first, which, however,
produces similar, and indeed greater effects.
    More of this shall     be the subject      of my next paper; and
in   the   mean    time, those     of your numerous readers, who
may    think with me, thai the means of gaining power cannot
be limited to the     two which I have thus announced, have a
wide field opened for the exercise of their genius in this re
search.                 I have the honour to be, sir,

                been favoured with some          additional information
respecting the efficacy        of sulphur,      and the proper way of
applying it to vegetables,       I  now fulfil the conditional pro
mise I made in my last letter*.              The method is truly sim
ple j for nothing more        is required than to sprinkle sublimed
sulphur, or, as it is^commonly called, flowers of brimstone,
over the leaves     of the   tree or plant,      wherever the effects  of
worms      or insects prevail, or may           be expected    to   come.
This may       be so easily accomplished, that it seems super
fluous to point out any particular plan or apparatus. The
sulphur may he tied up in a piece of muslin or linen, and
with this the leaves and young shoots should be dusted ; or
it may be thrown on by means of a common swandown
puff, or even a dredging-box.               However, if this practice
become general, no doubt some convenient instrument

  By the same friendly communication I have received fresh
assurances, not only of the powerful influence of sulphur as
a vermifuge against the whole tribe of worms and other in
sects, which infest, and prey upon, vegetables ; but I also
find, that in other respects this substance is even congenial
to the health of those trees and plants on which it is sprin
kled — that peach-trees in particular were remarkably im
proved by the sulphur         ; they absorbed          it,     may be said,
                                                             and,    it
were even fond of           it;    for    it   was evidently absorbed, and
must               into the vegetable system.

     Upon   the whole,     it    may be observed,            that, independently
of   its deleterious effects on the vermin, the question respect
ing   these sanative      powers of such an insoluble substance as
sulphur,     seems to be one    of the utmost importance    and,               ;     I

              the Cause   of coloured     concentric    Rings.               73
ject-glasses upon each other, is highly interesting. He very
justly remarks, that these phtenomena are " of difficult con
 sideration," but that " they may conduce to further disco
 veries  for completing the theory of light, especially as to
 the constitution of the parts of natural bodies on which
 their colours or transparency depend*."
    With    regard to the explanation         of the appearance       of  these
 coloured rings, which is given by Sir I. Newton, I must
 confess that it has never been satisfactory to me.                     He ac
 counts for the production of the rings, by ascribing to the
 rays of light certain fits of easy reflection and easy trans
 mission alternately returning and taking place with each ray
 at certain stated intervals f.        But this, without mentioning
 particular objections, seems to be an hypothesis which can
 not be easily reconciled with the minuteness and extreme
 velocity of the particles of which these rays, according to
 the Newtonian theory, are composed.
    The great beauty of the coloured rings, and the pleasing
 appearances     arising from the different degrees of pressure of
 the two surfaces of the glasses against each other when they
 are formed, and especially the importance of the subject,
 have often excited my desire of inquiring further into the
 pause of such interesting phaenomena ; and with a view to
 examine them properly I obtained, in the year 1792, the
 two    object-glasses    of Huygens, in the possession of the
 Royal Society, one      of 122 the other of 170 feet focal length,
 and began a series     of experiments with them, which, though
 many times interrupted by astronomical pursuits, has often
 been taken up again, and has lately been carried to a very
 considerable extent. The conclusions that may be drawn
 from them, though        they may not perfectly            account for all
 the phaenomena of       the rings,     are yet    sufficiently well sup
 ported, and of such       a nature    as  to point out several modifi
 cations   of light that have been totally overlooked, and others
 that have never been properly discriminated.                  It will, there
 fore, be the aim of this paper to arrange and distinguish the
 various modifications       of light in       a clear and        perspicuous

74                       Experiments        for   investigating
order, and afterwards to give my sentiments upon the cause
of the formation of the concentric rings. The avowed in
tricacy of the subject *, however, requires, in the first place,
a minute detail of experiments, and afterwards a very gra
dual development of the consequences to be deduced from
them.
.    As   the word modification             will frequently be used, it may
not be amiss to say, that                 when applied to light, it is intend
ed to stand  for a general                expression of all the changes that
are made in its colours, direction, or motion : thus, by the
modification of reflection, light is thrown back ; by that of
refraction, it is bent from its former course ; by the modi
fication of dispersion,              it   is divided into colours,                 and so   of
the rest.

                                           visible.
     In   the beginning      of my experiments
                                      followed the New        I
tonian example, and having laid the two object-glasses of
Huygens upon one another I soon perceived the concentric
rings. It is almost needless to say that I found all the New
tonian observations of these rings completely verified ; but
as his experiments seemed to be too much confined for draw
ing general conclusions, I endeavoured to extend them : and
by way of rendering the methods                         I   point out very clear, I
have given         one    easy   particular           instance of each, with the
addition of     generalization of

     First Method. On table placed

down      a   slip of glass the sides         of which         were perfectly plain,
parallel, and highly polished.   Upon this       laid    double      I             a
convex lens of 26 inches focal length, and found that this
arrangement gave me      set of beautiful concentric rings.

whatever may be its focal length,   set of concentric

will always be obtained.    have seen rings with lenses

varieties of focus, from 70 feet down to one quarter

surface will give them.
  To ensure success,          it   is that the glasses should
                                        necessary
be perfectly well cleaned from any adhering dust or soil,
especially about the point of contact    and in laying them
                                                        ;
upon each other     little pressure should be used, accom
                       a
panied at first with      little side motion, after which they
                             a
must be left at rest.
   If the surface of the incumbent lens, especially when                         it   is
of  a very short focal length,        free from all imperfection
                                               is
and highly polished, the adjustment of the focus of the
above-mentioned eye-glass, which    always use for viewing

                is                              small spot           a

ficient adjustment to find the rings.
    Second Method.   Instead of the slip of glass, laid down         I
a well polished plain metalline mirror; and placing upon                           it
the same 26-inch double convex lens,        saw again   com

plete set of concentric rings.
    It singular that, in this case, the rings reflected from
         is                                                                           a
bright metalline surface will appear fainter than when the
same lens    laid on

light  this may however be accounted for
        ;                                         the brilliancyby
of the metalline ground on  which   these faint rings are seen,
the contrast of which will offuscate their feeble appearance¦
    Generalization.        On the        same metalline surface every va
riety of      lenses may b« laid,         whatever be the figure         of their
                                                                             upper

  76               Experiments   for  investigating
  upper surface, whether plain, concave, or convex, and
  whatever be their focal lengths, provided the lowest surface
  remains convex, and concentric rings will always be ob
  tained ; but for the reason mentioned in the preceding para
  graph, very small lenses should not be used till the experi
 mentalist has been familiarized with the method of seeing
 these   rings, after which lenses     of two inches focus,     and
 gradually less, may be tried.
     Third Method.    Hitherto   we  have   only used  a plain sur
 face upon which many sorts      of glasses have been placed ;   in
 order therefore to   obtain a still greater variety, I laid down
 a plano-convex lens of 15 inches focal length, and upon the
 convex surface of it    I  placed the 26-inch double convex
 lens, which produced a complete set of rings.
     Fourth Method. The same lens placed upon a convex
 metalline mirror of about 15 inches focal length gave also a
 complete set of rings.
     Generalization. These two cases admit      of  a much greater
 variety than the first and second methods      ; for here the in
 cumbent glass may have not only one, but both its surfaces
 of any figure whatsoever ; whether plain, concave, or con
vex ; provided the radius of concavity, when concave lenses
are laid upon the convex surface of glass or metal, is greater
than that of the convexity on which they are laid.
    The figure of the lowest surface of the subjacent substance,
when it is glass, may also be plain, concave, or convex ; and
the curvature of its upper surface, as well as 6f the mirror,
may be such as to give them any focal length, provided the
radius of their convexities is less than that of the concavity
of an incumbent lens ; in all which cases complete sets of
concentric rings will be obtained.
    Fifth Method. Into the concavity       of  a double concave
glass of 8 inches focal length I placed a 7-inch double con
vex lens, and saw a very beautiful set of rings.
    Sixth Method. Upon a 7-feet concave metalline mirror I
placed the double convex 26-inch lens, and had a very fine
set of rings.
    Generalization. With these two last methods, whatever
may be the radius of the concavity      of the subjacent surface,
                                                         provided

            the Cause   of coloured concentric Rings.             CO
provided it be greater than that of the convexity of the in
cumbent glass ; and whatever may be the figure of the upper
surface   of  the lenses that are placed upon the former,      there
will  be produced concentric rings."       The figure of the lowest
surface of the subjacent glass may also be varied at pleasure,
and still concentric rings will be obtained.
              II. Of seeing   Rings by Transmission.
    The  great   variety of the different combinations of these
differently figured glasses and mirrors will still admit of fur
ther addition, by using a different way of viewing the rings.
Hitherto, the arrangement of        the apparatus has been such as
to make them visible only by reflection, which is evident,
because all the experiments that have been pointed out may
be made by the light of a candle placed so that the angle of
incidence and of reflection towards the eye of the observer
may be equal.         But Sir I. Newton has given us also an
observation where he saw these rings by transmission, in
consequence of which I have again multiplied and varied the
method of producing them that way, as follows :
    First Method. On a slip of plain glass highly polished on
both sides place the same double convex lens of 26 inches,
which had already been used when the rings were seen by
 reflection.    Take them both up together and hold them
against the light of a window, in which position the con
centric rings will be seen with great ease by transmitted
light. But as the use of an eye-glass will not be convenient
 in this situation,   it will be necessary to put on a pair of
.spectacles with glasses of 5,. 6, or 7 inches focus, to mag
 nify the rings in order to sec them more readily.
    Second Method.      It would   be easy to construct an appara
 tus for viewing the rings by transmission fitted with a pro
 per eve-glass ; but other methods of effecting the same pur
 pose are preferable.      Thus, ifjhe two glasses that are to
 give the rings be laid     upon a hollow stand, a candle placed
 at a proper angle      and distance under them will show the
 rings conveniently by transmitted light, while the observer
 and the apparatus remain in the same situation as if they
 were to be seen by reflection.
                                                               Third

ft                           Experiments        Jor    investigating
     Third Method.                A
                       still more eligible way is to use daylight
received upon     plain metalline mirror reflecting it upwards
                         a
to (he glasses placed over                  it,
                                as practised in the construction
of    the common       double microscope        but  forbear entering
                                                            :       I
into   a    further detail of this last and most useful way of seeing
rings       by transmission, as       shall soon have occasion to say
                                           I
more on the same subject.
   Generalization. Every combination of glasses that has
been explained     the first, third, and fifth methods of see
                             in
ing rings          by
            reflection will also give them     transmission,             by
when exposed to the light in any of the three ways that have
now been pointed out. When these are added to the former,
it   will    be allowed that we                 have an extensive variety                of     ar
rangements for every desirable purpose of making experiments
upon rings, as tar as single sets of them are concerned.
                                      III. Of Shadows.
     When two or more sets                      of rings    are to be seen,      it      will    re
quire some artificial means, not only to examine them cri
tically, but even to perceive them  and here the shadow of
                                                        ;
some slender opaque body              will be of eminent service.   To
east shadows            of  proper
                             a     size and  upon places where they are
wanted,          a   pointed penknife may be used as follows                         :
     When   plain slip of glass or convex lens
                 a                                 laid down,             is
and the point of    penknife     brought over either of them,
                                 a                is
itwill cast two shadows, one of which may be seen on the
first surface           of   the glass or lens, and the other on the lowest.
  When two slips of glass are laid upon each other, or                                            a
convex lens upon one slip, so that both are     contact, the              in
penknife will give three shadows; but       the convex lens         if
should be of very short focus, or the slips of glass
                        a                               little                           a
separated,           four of them may be perceived                    ;   for   in   that cas•
there       will     be one formed on the lowest surface                      of the incum
bent glass or lens  but    my distinction of shadows this
                                  ;        in
will not be noticed. Of the three shadows thus formed the
second will be darker than the first, but the third will be
faint.        When           a   piece   of looking-glass       is   substituted for the
lowest slip the third shadow will be the strongest.
  Three slips of glass in contact, or two slips with                                     a      lens
upon them, or also                    a   looking glass,        a   slip and    a    lens put
                                                                                     together,

                  the Cause        of coloured    concentric          Rings.              79
together, will give four shadows, one from each upper sur
face and one from the bottom of the lowest of them.
  In all       these cases a metalline mirror may be                        hid under     the
same arrangement without adding to the number of sha
dows, its effect being only to render them more intense and
distinct.
  The shadows may be distinguished by                                the   following    me
thod : When the point of the penknife is                             made to touch the
surface    of the uppermost glass or lens, it will touch the
point     of its own shadow, which may thus at any time be
easily ascertained : and this in all cases I call the first sha
dow j that which is next to           the second it,after which            ;
follows the third, and so on.
  In receding from the point,                       the      shadows will mix to
gether, and thus become more intense but which, or how          ;
many of them are united together, may always be known
by the points of the shadows.
  When     shadow
               a       to be thrown upon any required place,
                              is
hold the penknife nearly half an inch above the glasses, and
advance         itsforemost gradually towards the incident
                      edge
light.  The" front should be held little downwards to keep
                                                   a
the light from the underside of the penknife, and the sha
dows to be used should be obtained from                             a   narrow part     of it.
   With this preparatory information                        it      will   be easy to point
out the use that              is      to be made       of   the shadows when they
are wanted.
                             IV. Of two      Sets      of   Rings.
 I         now proceed to describe
        shall                        somewh.V more com      a
plicated way of observation,                 by
                               which two complete sets of
concentric rings may be seen at once. The new or addi
tional set will furnish us with an opportunity of examining
rings     situations where they have never been seen before,
          in
which will be of eminent service for investigating the cause
of their origin, and with the assistance of the shadows to
be formed, as has been explained,                       we shall not find          it   diffi
cult to    see them          in   these situations.
     First Method.                Upon   a  well polished piece of good look
ing-glass lay down                a   double convex lens of about 20 inches
focus.   When the eye-glass has been adjusted                                  as usual    for
                                                                                      seeing

 80                               Experiments       for   investigating
 seeing one set of rings, make the shadow of the penknife,
 in the order which has been described, pass over the lens ;
 then,    it sometimes happens in this arrangement that no
               as
                          the shadow will, in its passage
 rings are easily to be seen,
 over the surface, show where they are situated.  When a
 set of them is perceived, which is generally the primary one,
 bring the third shadow of the penknife over          in which                it,
 situation  will be seen to the greatest advantage.
                    it
     Then,          if   at the same time           secondary set of rings has not
                                                     a
yet been discovered,                    it   will certainly be perceived when the
second      shadow of the penknife    brought upon the primary
                                                         is
set.       As soon as   has been found out, the compound sha
                                   it
dow, consisting of all the three shadows united, may then
be thrown upon this secondary set, in order to view     at                                it
leisure and in perfection. But this compound shadow should
be taken no further from the point than   necessary to cover        is
it
 ;   nor should the third shadow touch the primary set. The
two sets are so near together, that many of the rings of one
set intersect some of the other.
     When           a sight of the secondary set has been once obtained,
it   will be        very easy to view     alternately with the primary
                                                    it
one       slight motion of the penknife, so as to make the
          by   a
third shadow of    go from one set to the other.
                                  it
   Besides the use of the shadows, there     another way to          is
make rings visible when they cannot be easily perceived,
which      is       to take hold        of    the    lens with both hands,          to press
it  alternately  little more with one than with the other;
                         a                                                                     a
tilting  motion,  given to the lens in this manner, will move
the two sets of rings from side to side       and as      well      ;           it   is
known        faint object in motion may be sooner perceiv
               that      a
ed than when       at rest, both sets of rings will
                             it   is                 these                          by
means be generally detected                     together.
     It   will       also     contribute       much to facilitate the method               of
seeing two sets of rings,                    if   we receive the         light in   a    more
oblique angle of incidence,                     such      as   40, 50, or even 60 de
grees.         This will           increase    the distance between the centres
of the primary                      and at the same time oc
                             and secondary sets,
casion   more copious
           a          reflection of light.
  Instead of common looking-glass
                         a                convex glass mirror   a
                                                                                         may

                  the Cause   of coloured concentric Rings.                  81
 may be used, on which may be placed either a plain, a con
 cave, or a convex surface of any lens or glass, and two sets
 of rings will be obtained.
       In   the same manner, by laying upon a concave glass              mirror
 a convex lens, we shall also bave two sets             of rings.
       The generalizations that have been mentioned wben one
 •et    of rings was proposed to be obtained, may be easily ap
plied with proper regulations, according to the circumstances
of the case, not only to the method by glass mirrors already
mentioned, but likewise to all those that follow hereafter,
and need not be particularized for the future. In the choice
of the surfaces to be joined, we have only to select such as
will form a central contact, the focal length of the lenses
and the figure of the upper surface being variable at pleasure.
    Second Method. On a plain metalline mirror 1 laid a pa
rallel slip of glass, and placed upon it the convex surface of
a    1 7-inch    plano-convex    lens, by which means         two sets      of
rings were produced.
     Upon       the same mirror the plain side   of the plano-convex
glass may be laid instead of the            plain slip, and any plain,
convex, or concave surface being placed upon the convexity
of the subjacent lens, will give two sets of rings.
   The plain side of a plano-concave glass may also be placed
upon the same mirror, and into the concavity may be laid
any lens that will make a central contact with    which     it,     by
arrangement two sets of rings will be obtained.
   Third Method. Upon small well polished slip of glass
                                 a
place another slip of the same size, and upon them lay                       a
39-inch double convex lens. This will produce two sets of
rings   ; one of them reflected from the upper surface of the
first slip of glass, and the other from that of the second.
    Instead of the uppermost plain slip of glass we may place
upon the lowest slip the plain side of            plano-oonvdx
                                                        a
or  plano-concave lens, and the same                  variety which has
been explained in the third method,              by   using any incum
bent lens that will make         a   central contact, either with the
convexity or concavity of the subjacent glass, will always
produce two sets of rings.

 *                 Experiments            for   investigating
  Fourth Method. A more refined but rather more difficult
way of seeing two sets of rings, is to lay a plain slip of glass-
on a piece of black
                     paper, and, when a convex lens is placed
upon  the slip, there maybe perceived, but not without par
ticular attention,not only the first set, which has already
been pointed out as reflected from the first surface of the slip,
but also a faint secondary set from the lowest surface of the
same slip of glass.
     It will                        sets of rings by a reflec
                be less difficult to-seetwo
tion from both surfaces of the same glass, if we use, for in
stance, a double concave of 8 inches focus with a double
convex of 7} inches placed upon it. For, as it is well known
that glass  will reflect more light from the furthest surface
when air rather than a denser medium is in contact with                          it,
the hollow space of the 8- inch concave will give      pretty            a

   Fifth Method. The use that intended to be made of two
                                                is
sets   of rings requires             of them should be dependent
                                that one
upon the other       :   this   circumstance that will be explained
                                is   a
hereafter;       but the following instance, where two indepen
dent sets of rings are given, will partly anticipate the subject.
When      double convex lens of 50 inches
            a                                   laid down with a
                                                           is
slip of glass placed upon                it,
                                and another double convex one
of 26 inches      then placed upon the slip, we get two sets of
                   is
rings  of different sizes; the large rings are from the 50-incb
glass, the small rings from the 26-inch one. They are to be
seen with great ease, because they are each of them primary.
By tilting the incumbent lens or the slip of glass these two
sets   of rings may      be made           to cross   each other in any direc
tion   ;    the small set may be laid upon the large one, or either
of them may be separately removed towards any part of the
glass. This will be sufficient to show that they have no con
nection with each other.    The phenomena of the motions,
and    of   the various colours and sizes assumed               by   these   rings,
when different pressures and tiltings of the glasses are used,
will afford some entertainment.     With the assistance of the
shadow of the penknife                   the secondary set belonging to the
rings from the 26-inch lens will be added to the other two.
                                                                              sets;

    lets  but in tilting the glasses this set will never leave its
           ;
    primary one, while that from the 50-inch lens may be made
    to go any where across the other two.
                         V. Of three             Sets    of Rings.
       To see three sets of concentric rings at once is attended
    with some difficulty ; but by the assistance of the methods
    of tilting the glasses and making use of the multiplied sha
    dows of a penknife, we may see them very well, when therfc
    is a sufficient illumination of bright daylight.
       First Method. A 26-inch double convex lens placed upon
    three slips of plain glass, will give three sets of rings. 7.he
    slips of glass should be nearly 2-tenths of an inch thick,
    otherwise the different sets will not be sufficiently separated.
    When all the glasses are in full contact, the first and second
    sets may be seen with    little pressure and a small motion^
                                      a
    and, if circumstances are favourable, the third, which is the
    faintest, will also appear.    If it cannot be seen, some of the
    compound shadows of the penknife must be thrown upon
    it ; for in this case there will be five shadows visible, several
    of which will fall together                  and     give different intensity to
    their mixture.
       Second Method.               When     a   single slip of glass, with           a   34*
    inch lens upon       it,   is   placed     upon      a   piece    of good looking-
    glass, three      sets   of rings may               be seen   :   the first and third
    sets are pretty bright, and  will be perceived   only pressing      by
    the lens   little upon the slip of ghss; after which
                a                                           will be              it
    easy to find the second set with the assistance of the proper
    shadow.     In this case four shadows will be seen and when              ;
    the third shadow         is   upon the first set, the fourth will be over
    the second set and render             visible.
                                          it
        Third Method.    When two slips of glass                        are laid upon      a
    plain metalline mirror, then      26-inch lens
                                                 a                      placed upon the
    slips will produce three sets of rings   butnot very easy         it
                                                                      is
                                                             ;
    to perceive them. By tilting motion the third set will ge
                                      a
    nerally appear like small white circle, which at
                                  a                    propef                    a
    distance will follow the movement of the first set.                           As soon
    as the     first and third sets are in view, the third shadow                   of the
.   penknife may be brought over the first set,                         by   which means
                                             F2                                           the

    84                         Experiments            for   investigating
the fourth shadow will come upon the second set, and in this
position of the apparatus it will become visible.
         Fourth Method.                   On   plain metalline mirror lay one slip
                                               a
of glass, but with                   a   small piece of wood at one end under                       it,
so that   may be kept about one-tenth of an inch from the
               it
mirror, and form an inclined plane.      26-inch lens laid               A
upon the slip of glass will give three sets of rings. Two of
them will easily be seen and when the shadow of the pen
                                             ;
knife   held between them, the third set will also be per
           is
ceived.          There          is   but one shadow visible              this arrange
                                                                                in
ment, which               is   the third      ;    the first and second shadows being
lost      in   the bright reflection from the                         mirror.
    Fifth Method.   placed    6f-inch double convex upon an
                                 I                  a
8-inch double concave, and laid both together upon     plain                                 a
slip of glass. This arrangement gave three sets of rings.
They may be seen without the assistance of shadows,                                                  by-
using only pressure and tilting. The first had    black and                           a
the other two had white centres.
                                VI. Of four               Sets   of   Rings.
     The difficulty of seeing many                             sets   of rings       increases    with
their number, yet                    by  a   proper attention to the directions that
are given, four sets                     of concentric rings may                he seen.
i    First Method.                   Let     a     slip of glass, with         26-inch lens
                                                                                a
laid upon           it,   be placed upon
                               piece                  a           of looking-glass.  Under
one end of the slip,  small piece of wood one-tenth of an
                                         a
inch thick must be put to keep     from touching the looking-
                                                          it
glass. This arrangement will give us four sets of rings. The
first, third, and fourth may easily be seen, but the second set
will require          some management.                      Of the three shadows which
this apparatus gives, the second and third must be brought
between the first and fourth sets of rings, in which situation
the second       of rings will become visible.
                     set
     Second Method.     When three slips of glass are laid upon
a    metalline mirror, and      plano-convex lens of about 17
                                                  a
inches focus   placed with its convex side upon them, four
                          is
sets of rings may be seen; but this experiment requires                                             a
very bright day, and very clean, highly polished slips of
plain glass.              Nor can            it    be successful         unless all the fore
                                                                                                 going

               the Cause   of coloured concentric Rings.                85
 going methods       of seeing multiplied      sets  of rings are become
 familiar  and easy.
    I have seen occasionally,      not only four and five, but even
 six sets of concentric rings, from        a very simple arrangement
of glasses   :  they arise from      reiterated     internal  reflections ;
 but it will not be necessary        to carry this account of seeing
multiplied sets of rings to      a greater   length.
                   VII. Of    the Size   of   the   Rings.
    The diameter of the concentric rings depends upon the ra
dius of the curvature of the surfaces between which they are
formed.      Curvatures of a short radius, cceteris paribus, give
smaller rings than those of a longer; but sir Isaac Newton
having already treated on this part of the subject at large,
it will not be necessary to enter further inVo it.
    I should however remark, that when two curves are con
cerned, it is the application of them to each other that will
determine      the   size of the rings,     so that large ones may be
produced from curvatures of a very short radius.                A double
convex lens of 24- inches focus, for instance, when it is laid
upon a double concave which is but little more in focal
length, gives rings that are larger than those from a lens of
56 inches laid upon a plain slip of glass.
                          VIII. Of     Contact.
    The size of    the rings is considerably affected by pressure.
They grow larger when the two surfaces that form them are
pressed closer together, and diminish when the pressure is
gradually removed.         The smallest ring of a set may be in
creased    by this means to double and treble its former dia
meter   : but as the common or natural pressure of glasses laid
upon any flat or curved surface is occasioned by their weight,
the variations of pressure will not be very considerable when
they are left to assume their own distance or contact.                 To
produce that situation, however, which is generally called
contact, it will always be necessary to give a little motion
backwards and forwards to the incumbent lens or glass, ac
companied with some moderate pressure, after which it may
he left to settle properly bv its own weight.
                                   F3                             IX. Of

86                       Experiments        for   investigating
                           IX. Of      measuring Rings.
     It may    be supposed           from what          has been said concerning
the kind      of contact which              is required for glasses to produce
rings,      that an attempt           to take     absolute measures must be
liable to great inaccuracy.   This was fully proved to me
when I wanted to ascertain, in the year 1 792, whether a lens
laid upon a metalline surface would give rings of an equal
diameter with those it gave when placed on glass. The
measures differed so much that I was at first deceived; but
on proper consideration   it appeared that the Huygenian ob
ject glass, of 122 feet focus, which I used for the experi
 ment, could not so easily be brought to the same contact on
metal   ason glass ; nor can we ever be well assured that an
equal distance between the two surfaces in both cases has
been actually obtained.   The colour of the central point, as
will   be shown hereafter, may serve as a direction ; but even
that cannot be easily made equal in both cases.  By taking
a sufficient number of measures of any given ring of a set,
when a glass of a sufficient focal length is used, we may
however determine its diameter to about the 25th or 30th
part of its dimension.
   Relative measures for ascertaining the proportion of the
different rings in the same set to each other, may be more
accurately taken ; for in that case the contact with them all
will remain         the same,       if we   do not disturb the glasses during
the time     of measuring.
                         X. Of       the Number             of Rings.
     When  there is a sufficient illumination, many concentric
rings in  every set will be perceived ; in the primary set we
see generally      9, or 10, very conveniently.
                     8..                         By holding the
eye    inthe  mo=t   favourable situation    have often counted
                                                              I
near 20, and the number                of them
                                      generally lost when they
                                                       is
grow too narrow and minute to be perceived, so that we can
never be said fairly to have counted them to their full extent.
In   the second          set   I   have seen      as    many as in the first, and
they are     full
                bright.
                    as                The third         set, when      seen
                                                                        it   is       bya
metalline mirror under two slips, will be brighter                                than the
                                                                                  second,

                 the Cause    of coloured   concentric   Rings.            67
  second, and almost as bright             as the   first:   I  have   easily
  counted 7, 8, and 9 rings.
     XI. Oftke        Effect of Pressure    on the Colour     of tlie Rings.
     When a double convex object glass of 14 or 15 feet focus
 is laid on a plain slip of glass, the first colours that make
  their faintest appearance will be red surrounded by green ;
  the smallest pressure        will turn the centre into        green   sur
 rounded by red : an         additional pressure will give     a red centre
 again, and so on till there have been so many successive al
 terations as to give us six or seven times a red centre, after
 which the       greatest    pressure   will only produce      a very large
 black one surrounded by white.
     When    the rings are seen by transmission,           the colours are
 in  the same      manner subject to a gradual alternate change
 occasioned by pressure; but when that is carried to its full
 extent, the centre of the rings will be a large white spot sur
 rounded by black.
    The succession and addition of the other prismatic colours
 after the first or second change, in both cases is extremely                 .
beautiful   ;   but   as the experiment may be so easily made, a
description,       which    certainly would fall short of an actual
view of these phaenomena, will not be necessary.
    When      the    rings are produced by curves of a very short
radius, and the incumbent lens is in full contact with the
slip of glass, they will be alternately black and white; but
by lessening        the   contact,   I have seen,   even    with a double
convex lens      of no more than two-tenths            of an inch focus,
the centre     of  the rings white, red, green, yellow,         and black,
at pleasure.        In this   case I used an eye-glass of one inch
focus   ; but     as   it requires much practice to manage such
small glasses,         the experiment may be more conveniently
made by placing a double convex lens of two-inch focus on
a plain slip    of glass,    and viewing the rings by an eye-glass        of
2^   inches ; then having first brought the lens into full con
tact, the rings will be only black and white, but by gently
lifting up or tilting the lens, the centre of the rings will as
sume various colours at pleasure.
                                    F4                            XII. Of

88                         Experiments     for    investigating
         XII. Of diluting and concentrating the Colours.
   Lifting up or tilting a lens being subject to great uncer
tainty, a surer way of acting upon the colours of the rings
js by dilution and concentration.   After having seen that
very small lenses give only black and white when in full
Contact, we may gradually take others of a longer focus.
With     a   double convex lens of four inches the outward rings
will begin     to assume a faint red colour.   With 5, 6, and 7,
this appearance will increase ; and proceeding with lenses of
a larger focus, when we come to about ]6, 18, or 20 inches,
green rings         will gradually make their                appearance.
     This    and other colours come on much sooner                         if   the centre
of   the lens is not            kept in    a   black contact,       which in          these
experiments must be attended to.
  A lens of 26 inches not only shows black, white, red, and
green rings,             hut the central black begins already to be di
luted so         as to    incline to violet, indigo, or blue. With one
of 34,      the white about the dark centre begins to be diluted,
and shows a kind                             With 42 and
                                of gray inclining to yellow.

   One of my slips of glass, which        probably    little con
                                                        is              a
cave, gave jhe rings still larger when the 122 feet glass was
firmly pressed a»ainst it.     used   little side motion at the
                                       I            a
same time,          and      brought   the glasses        into such contact that
they adhered sufficiently to be                     lifted up together.    With

 centre which      I  have never   seen in  any prismatic    spectrum.
  It  is a kind of light brown, resembling the colour of a cer
  tain sort of Spanish snuff. The 1 70 feet object glass ihowed
  the same colour also very clearly.
                  XIII. Of t lie   Order  of the Colours.
      The arrangement of the colours in each compound ring or
  alternation, seen by reflection, is, that the most refrangible
 rays are nearest the centre ; and the same order takes place
 when seen by transmission.           We have already .shown that
 when a full dilution of the colours was obtained their arrange
 ment was violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red ;
 and the same order will hold good when the colours are
 gradually concentrated again ; for though some of them
 should vanish before others, those that remain will always
 be found to agree with the same arrangement.
     If the  rings should chance to be red and green alternately,
 a doubt might arise which of them is nearest the centre j
 but by the method of dilution, a little pressure, or some
 small increase of the focal length of the incumbent lens,
 there will be introduced an orange tint between them, which
 will immediately ascertain the order of the colours.
     In the second set of rings the same order is still preserved
as in the first y and the same arrangement takes place in the
third set as well as in the fourth.         In all of them the most
refrangible rays produce the smallest rings.
XIV. Of the        alternate Colour and Size     of the Rings belong
               ing to the primary and dependent Sets.
     When two      sets of rings are seen at once, and the colour of
the centre of the primary set is black, that of the secondary
will be white; if the former is white, the latter will be black.
The     same alternation   will take place if the colour of the centre
of   the primary set     should be red or orange; for then the
centre of the secondary one will be green j or if the former
happens to be green, the latter will be red or orange. At the
same time there will be a similar alternation in the size of
rings ; for the white rings in one set will be of the diameter
of   the black in the other ; or the orange rings       of the former
will be of equal magnitude with the green of the latter.
    When three sets of rings ar« to be seen, the second and
                                                                 third

  90    Surgical    Cases in the   City and Finslury Dispensaries.
  third sets will be alike in colour and size, but alternate in
  both particulars with the primary set.
     The same thing will happen when four sets are visible j
 for all the sets that are formed from the primary one will
 resemble each other, but will be alternate in the colour and
 dimensions of their rings with those of the primary set.

 XIX.      Report    of Surgical     Cases    in the City and     Finslury
    Dispensaries/or      September    1807.    By  JohnTaunton,£^.
 An    the month      of September there          were   admitted on the
 books    of the City and Finsbury Dispensaries               237 surgical
 patients.
                Cured or relieved           -       -     205
                Died        -      -                -        4

         Since which time there have been admitted 963.
    One of the fatal cases was that of Mrs. M. S. aet. 67, who,
 soon after the birth of her ninth and last child,             was   seized
with femoral hernia          : the   tumour was       small, but painful,
attended      with    sickness and inclination to vomit; these
 symptoms       did not last long, as the hernia receded without
assistance    :  she had another attack in about six weeks,
which     was also    of short duration     ;  the hernia   soon became
irreducible,     and she had been       exposed     to similar attacks for
the last sixteen years of her life, for which time it had never
been completely returned : these were occasionally longer
and more severe       ; the symptoms frequently continued for two
or three days, but were removed without any                   operation on
medicine, except some Daffy's elixir.
    On    the   22d   of August she was seized with the usual
symptoms,        viz.   pain over the whole belly, particularly in
the region of the stomach, with a sensation of heat, vomit
ing, cold sweats, intermitting            pulse, and suppression of
stools for four days : the tumour was now much larger than
before, being nearlv the size of a child's head at birth : at
this period she had       a motion of    a  small quantity of feculent
                                                                   matter,

matter, after which the bowels were confined for three days,
when she was taken with diarrhcea, an acute pain in the
bowels,     cold sweats,       pulse   variable, vomiting of feculent
matter ; but the hiccup was not very distressing : — these
symptoms cotuinued For nine days, being sixteen from the
attack, when she sunk under the disease.
    The medicines given during               this illness were, opium,
calomel, extract. colocynth. cum            calomel,    enema communis,,
and the enema cum nicotiana.                She could not be prevailed
on to submit to the operation.
    On dissection, the intestines were distended with flatus,
the colon was much enlarged and inflamed, part of the syg-
moid flexion was contained in the hernial sac, but not the
whole circumference of the intestine, which left thecanal per
vious. The adhesions were firm around the mouth of the sac,
from which the intestine could not be separated, and the coats
were much thickened by inflammation which approached to
gangrene. The omentum was much inflamed and adhered to
the hernial sac ; and that part of the omentum within the
sac was much enlarged               and more firm, which, together
with    the adhesions,       had rendered     this an irreducible hernia.

                              ROYAL     SOCIETY.
 On      the 5th    of February,      a letter from    Mr. Knight, to the
 president, was read, on the            inconvertibility of the bark of
 trees into the alburnum.              The author, as usual, detailed
 the effects     of a. great many experiments             made to confirm
 this opinion,       which     he  announced      in  the   conclusion of a
 letter read before the Society last season, (see Philosophical
 Magazine, No. 109, vol. xxviii. p. 43.) One of the most
 obvious reasons         assigned   for the truth    of this opinion was,
 that many trees having barks very dissimilar, have wood
 very similar ; and that, had the alburnum been formed of the
 bark,    the wood must consequently have been as different as
                                                                             the

 the bark was.      On  the other hand,   many     trees  with   bark
very similar,    have wood very different. These facts, in con
junction with     some   minute    experiments, Mr. Knight con
 cluded   as decisive that  the bark is not transmuted, as Mal-
 pighi supposed, into alburnum ; but that each performs its
 peculiar function in thececonomy of vegetation.
    February 11 and 18.         Several mathematical papers on
 the properties   of a circle, &c,   were presented   to the Society
 by the astronomer royal,      but were   not  of   a nature    to be
 read.    A curious paper on eremites, or the idiotism of the
 inhabitants of alpine regions, who are affected with goitres,
 or swellings about the head, was read.        From the author's
 researches   among the people of Switzerland, and his inves
 tigation of the supposed connection between this species of
 mental imbecility and goitres, (which are generally ascribed
 to the effect of using snow-water on the glands,) he was led
 to conclude that cranites exists frequently where there are no
 goitres, and that many families suffer the latter complaint
 without experiencing the former.
    February 25. A. Marsden, esq., in the chair.               A ge
 ological paper on the whin-dykes in the north of Ireland,
 in a letter to Mr. Davy, was laid before the Society.
    A  continuation   of Mr. Home's experiments on         the func
 tions of the   spleen was read,    in which   this able naturalist
 operated    on asses with    extract and tincture of rhubarb, as
 related in his former experiments on dogs.          The spleen and
 the colon were found impregnated with the rhubarb, when
 none was found in the liver.        Several curious experiments
 were made to ascertain the quantity of serum and of rhubarb
found in the blood in the vena cava, the left auricle of the
 heart,    and other members     : but the results are not satis
 factorily established.
    A letter from Mr. Murdoch, to the president, was read,
 containing an account of the origin, progress, and present
state of gas-lights.      It appears that so long ago as 1739
Dr. Clayton, in the Philosophical Transactions, discovered
 the inflammability     of gas procured from coals : but this
knowledge was never adapted to practice till about sixteen
years ago, when the author, at a foundry in Cornwall, first
                                                            proposed

               New Process       for preparing    Calomel.          Q3
 proposed theapplication of this gas-light to oeconomical pur
 poses, and actually carried it into effect.           In 1798 he also
 established it on a larger scale at Messrs. Bolton and Watts,
 Soho, Birmingham.             But at Messrs. Phillips and Co's
 cotton   factory it has been carried to the highest degree of
 perfection, and on the most extensive scale, of any place in
 the  kingdom.       From     a statement     of the relative expense
of candles     and gas,    it appears   that  for the light which that
manufactory       required, 2O0OZ. a year would be expended
in candles   ; whereas     ihe wear and tear and expenses      of gas
lights do not much exceed 600/. a year, amounting             to about
one-third the expense of caudles.
   IMPERIAL ACADEMT OF SCIENCES AT ST. PETERSBURGH.
    This Academy has published the 13th volume of their
Memoirs. It contains, among other interesting articles, a
description of the celebrated silver mine of Zuseoff, on
Mount Athol, in Siberia, with an account of the total pro

    This body   has announced the        following as the subject of
a prize question :       "  What are the chief diseases of plants,
and what analogy exists between them and those of ani
mals?"
    The prize is 100 ducats; and the memoirs, written in
Latin, French, or Polish, must be sent before the first of
September 1808 to the rector of the University, under
cover to Messrs. Reiser or Karner, bankers in Wilna. The
prize will be adjudged in the month of January 1809.

           NEW PROCESS         FOR PREPARING       CALOMEL.
An     important improvement in the preparation of that es
sential article of the pharmacopoeia, calomel, has been re
cently introduced by Messrs. Luke Howard and company,
chemists.      It consists in a peculiar mode of conducting the
final sullimation by firej by which the vapour of the calo
                                                                  mel,

  mcl, instead of being       suffered   to concrete,   as usual, into a
  solid cake at the upper part of the vessel, is thrown out ititd
  Water,   where it is instantly condensed into a white powder
  possessing the impalpable fineness of a precipitate.               The
  imperfect operations of grinding and levigating are thus su
  perseded,    and    the  defects    which   have  so   generally been
  complained    of   in the medicine from this cause remedied.
 The product       is lighter   than levigated calomel,       in conse
  quence of its     greater  comminution, three parts by weight
 occupying the same space          as Jive of the latter.
     M.   Douett Richardott,       a French    agriculturist, has long
  practised with success a           new method of curing          cattle
 whose stomachs are swoln from having fed upon wet forage.
  It consists in administering to the animal the twentieth part
 of   a pound of gunpowder, mixed in a pint of milk, when
 first seized with the colic from eating grass or clover
 highly charged with dew. This remedy was long ago an
 nounced     in the French       Journals, but M. fiichardott has
 been the first to    publish the results of its application.
     M. Allaire, a French chemist, has published a new me
 thod of scouring wool, which consists in dipping it repeat
 edly in a ley of quick-lime.             The chalky earth forms an
 animal soap with the grease.            By this means the wool is
 speedily and     ceconomically        scoured, and without     altering
 its quality.

    XXII.     On Blasting Rocks, and Tamping.         By JohK
                            Tayxor, Esq.
                           To  Mr. Tilloch.
        SIR,
 A. letter     from an engineer of celebrity to Mr. Nicholson)
 and published in the ninth volume of his Journal, introduced
 to the public some time ago an account of the use of sand
 in blasting rocks or other hard substances : a letter from
 another gentleman, published in your Magazine soon after,
 continued the subject, and mentioned other modes of con
 fining the gunpowder employed for this purpose ; and we
 have been lately informed of the result of experiments made
in France upon what Mr. Nicholson calls Mr. Jessop's me
 thod of blasting rocks with sand, by a notice published in
 the Philosophical   Journal of July      last.
    As  the process has      long been     known, however, in this
 neighbourhood,     and the constant experience      of the work
 men in the mines and       quarries agrees pretty nearly with the
 French report, it may not be useless to detail the instances
 in which it may be advantageously employed, and to point
 out the cases where it is not likely to be effectual ; and in
mines the latter are more numerous than the former.
    As another substance has been lately introduced into use
 here, which possesses advantages occasionally overall others,
 it will likewise give me pleasure to make it more generally
known, especially      as  this is an operation on the easy execu
 tion   of which   often depends the safety of the lives of
 the persons conducting it. The new process I allude to, is
 that of closing the hole, upon the proper charge of gunpow
 der, with clay wrought to rather a soft consistency, and
 rammed-in in sufficient quantity, which, where the resis
tance is not too great, possesses the following advantages.
 It may be applied to holes bored in all directions; may be
 perforated for the fuse without danger, and is peculiarly adapt
 ed for rock in which gunpowder is liable to be rapidly in
jured by water.      Sand can only be used where the rock is
 bored perpendicularly or nearly so ; and in mines but few
 holes of this description occur, the effect of a given quan-

tity of gunpowder being certainly greater in those holes the
mouths of which are lower than the end which contains the
charge.         This fact    has frequently            been shown
                                                              charge    by    a
in    a detached          piece of rock confined by tamping, as the
miners call        it,   in the usual way, and fired with the mouth
of the hole upwards.               A   certain quantity of tamping will
in this position         be blown out,       and the rock remain entire.
If    the samehole be recharged with the same quantity of
powder, and tamped so as to present an equal resistance,
the rock will be torn to pieces                   by
                                   merely altering its posi
tion, so that the charge may lie higher than the mouth of
the hole. Thus       may be inferred, that in firing artillery
                          it
there   more danger of bursting guns when they are laid with
        is
their muzzles depressed, than when pointed at any degree
of elevation.
   Holes for blasting     mines are so frequently very wet as
                                  in
to preclude the use of sand where other circumstances
would favour      for though, by violently compressing tough
                    jit
clay into the fissures, the portion of the hole that  to con                 is
tain the gunpowder may be made dry, yet to render       so                             it
throughout  its whole length would be process considerably
                                                         a
too tedious. Here the advantage of applying clay for tamp
ing   is   very great.    The hole    instantly filled up with
                                             is                                              a
water-tight        substance, and an opening for the fuse   made                  is
through      it   with an iron rod,           by
                                          pressure so gentle as 16

   Clay   likewise more likely to be used
             is                                                    by   miners than
sand,      if   they are acquainted generally with its effect, frotn
its being always at hand,              it   being so necessary          to the other
operations of boring                                 always in
                                  and charging holes that          it   ia

     I
    am inclined to believe that though in these cases both
sand and clay must yield to the usual mode of tamping,
yet that clay will commonly produce the fracture where
•and will fail to do so.  About ten years ago an experi
ment was made in Cornwall upon a loose rock on the sur
face, and sand was               blown      out without   any effect    having
been produced          :equal quantity of gunpowder, confined
                           an
by a      small quantity of tamping, broke the rock ; which
proved that the resistance was far inferior to that of the com
mon mode.     And from many late trials made with clay, in
holes moderately deep, in Wheal Friendship copper mine
and the tunnel of the Tavistock canal, I have found clay to
answer nearly as well as tamping ; though certainly in what
the workmen call shallow holes, and in very hard rock,
neither that nor sand                           In quarries
                                       can be depended
                                       upon.
and open works where deep holes can and always ought to
be had, where the ground is for the most part dry, and the
rock is seldom very hard, both will be found eminently
useful,     and will contribute much to the safety of the work
                                                                  '

     Mr. Farey mentions, in his letter in your Magazine, his
having seen coal-ashes employed as tamping.  The fact                        is,
that most friable substances are proper for this purpose,
those being the best that combine with friability    cer               a
tain degree of tenacity the miners esteem soft yellow copper
                                  :

perhaps    broken tile but what

  These substances              are beaten into the hole upon the charg*
of gunpowder, while              a     small taper iron rod called the nail,
kept in during the process, forms, on being withdrawn, the
vent for the rush filled with gunpowder, which constitutes
the fuse.        by the occasional attrition of this iron nail
                 It   is
against siliceous particles, either in the act of ramming or
striking     out, that dreadful accidents sometimes occur.

The    use of copper nails would prevent this ; but though.
often tried, the miners, from their being not quite so con
venient, will not continue the use of them.
   The plan of adding to the resistance of tamping by load
ing the aperture of the hole, as proposed by M. Gillet
Laumont, is in continual use among the Cornish miners,
but in a more simple and effectual way than he suggests ;
and it is certain that some rock could not be blasted without
this assistance.
   M.    Pictet,   it is said in  the  same  article of the   Philo
sophical Journal for July,          has  conceived    that a more
effective explosion for the purposes of mining might be
obtained by leaving a partial vacuity, or by the chamber
not being completely filled by the gunpowder.             Now this
idea is directly in opposition to the received opinion of per
sons conversant with these operations; but not having made
any accurate experiments on the subject, I shall only state a
case that appears to be in point.       We  are frequently obliged
in very wet ground       to use gunpowder    in cartridges of thin
tinned plate    ; and   as  these  cannot be made to fill up the
diameter     of  the  chamber completely, we obtain, what he
Conceives    is desirable, a less concentrated explosion; but so
far is it from       being beneficial, that every miner will use
every other means before he employs gunpowder in this way,
because it is universally found to require a much greater
quantity for a given effect, and much more, I conceive, than
can be attributed to the small degree of resistance offered by
the material     of which the cartridge is formed.
   The    most   promising scheme for facilitating the operation
of blasting rock that I have heard of, has been suggested
very lately to me by a friend whbse mechanical skill and
ingenuity are well known, and who has lately applied with
surprising dexterity that powerful agent gunpowder at great
depths under water.
 •
   A    sort   of powder      is made   of double or     treble  the
strength of common cannon powder, and if this be applied
to the uses of mining, he thinks that holes of half the usual
capacity might contain- sufficient charges in equal lengths*
If so, it is certain that such holes, being considerably less in
                                                           diameter

 diameter than those now made, might be bored with much
 more ease and rapidity ; and those only who know the labour
 and tediousness of the operation, besides the great expense
 of tools in hard siliceous rocks, can justly appreciate the
value of such an improvement.                  I have not yet been fur
 nished with the means of making any trial of this plan, but
I  hope before long to have it in my power.
    I  have troubled you at some length on this subject j but
as   it is one with which is connected the safety of several
thousand men in this kingdom alone, and when it is con
sidered,    as I have heard from good authority, that the annual
expense     of gunpowder for the mines in Cornwall and Devon
amounts to more than 30,000/., it becomes an object worthy
discussion, if means therefrom should arise of lessening the
risk to the workmen or of cost to the mines, particularly
in the present distressing state to which they are reduced
from the very low price at which the metals are now sold.

XXIII.       Extract of a Memoir         upon the      Muriatic Ether,   as
    read at the French Institute,            \7th of February,        1807.
    By M. Thenard*.
A fter having        examined why the muriatic ether has hi
therto remained almost unknown among chemists, although
frequently the object of chemical experiments, the author
gives the method        of obtaining it.         For this purpose, as the
above ether is habitually        in the   state of gas, the following
apparatus must be employed :
   We put in a retort barely capable of containing the mix
ture, an equal part in volume of highly concentrated muriatic
acid and alcohol at 36° ; we shake them well, in order to
bring all their molecules in contact.               This being done, we
throw into the retort seven or eight grains of sand, in order
to avoid the       boiling up, which, without              this precaution,

might take place in             the    course         of the operation         ; we      then
place it in the naked           fire upon a common furnace, by means
of    a grating        of iron wire,
                                  adopt Welter's tube to it,
                                           and
which       enters      into  with three necks, double in
                                a flask
capacity to the retort employed, and half filled with water
at the temperature of 20 or 25°*, so that the tube penetrates
a considerable way into the water                     :   afterwards we introduce
into     second neck a straight tube of safety ; and into
        the
the third we introduce a crooked one, which is fixed into
an earthen vessel under flasks                 full of water,           at the same de
gree   of heat     former, and supported by a knob screwed
                   as the
into the middle of it. When the apparatus is thus arranged,
the retort must be gradually heated ; and in about 20 or 23
minutes we      bubbles arise from the lower part of the liquid,
                  see
and particularly from the surface of the grains of sand.
These bubbles soon increase, and abundance of etherized gas
is obtained ; acid, alcohol, and water, pass over at the same
time, but they remain in the first flask. From 500 gram
mes of air and an equal volume of alcohol, we may obtain
twenty litres and upwards of etherized gas perfectly pure.
                                                               it,
But    we shall extract much more from                         if,      when the extri
cation of the gas begins to slacken, we add    fresh quantity to   a
the residue, namely, the strongly acid liquor which remains in
the retort, and the volume of which      then nearly equivalent

pour from time to time warm alcohol into the latter, the ethe
rized gas would be formed in still greater abundance for we                        ;

                                           is   every
volatilized       than muriatic acid, and that we should thus re
establish between these two bodies the primitive proportions,
which are more proper than any other for the success of the
operation.         In   all cases the management                   of   the fire   is   of the
greatest importance        be too weak, no etherized gas

it   with muriatic       acid gas.     nor do we obtain ether more, sen*

therefore by preserving a just medium in the application of
the fire that we succeed completely. All this proceeds from
too small or too great an elasticity in the alcohol, and thp
muriatic  acid prevents their reaction upon each other.
One precaution we must also take, is to use the same water

the question which the author of the memoir afterwards en
deavours to resolve.
     If   the muriatic       acid be formed in the combustion                  of the
etherized gas, the radical of this acid must exist in the gas;
and this radical necessarily comes from the alcohol, or from
the muriatic acid decomposed                     by
                                the alcohol, or, what    not                   is
very probable, although not impossible, from both.    In the
first case, by distilling mixture of alcohol and muriatic
                                   a
acid, we ought to find after the distillation all the muriatic
acid employed, besides that which appeared in the com
bustion       of    the gas formed     ;    in the second case, on the con
trary,    a   greal   quantity of acid ought        to disappear in this di-
stilkticn   but
              ;     keeping an account of that which

veloped in  the  combustion of  the  gas formed, this quantitv
of acid precisely, and no more, ought to reappear entirely.
In the third caae, from this distillation loss of acid should

also result ; but this loss should be more than compensated
by the quantity of acid which the combustion of the gas
formed ought to produce. Now, on performing this distil
lation upon 450i)37 grammes of muriatic acid of a specific
gravity of 11•349,       at 5° temperature      (centigrade thermo
meter), and upon        a volume    of highly rectified alcohol equal
to that of the acid, there are formed 23 litres of etherized
gas at the temperature of 21° of the centigrade thermome
ter,   and   at the pressure      of 0m   745, and there     disappear
 122*298   grammes of acid.
   The first hypothesis is consequently false, since it is de
monstrated that, even should the radical of the muriatic acid
exist in the etherized gas, this radical would proceed not
merely from the alcohol, but rather either from the muriatic
acid alone, or from the muriatic acid and alcohol.
   Let   us inquire  if it  proceeds  from the muriatic acid alone,
as supposed     in the second      hypothesis : but here there are
two ways of considering the phenomenon : either the mu
riatic acid must have been decomposed by the alcohol, so
that its radical, without its other principle, is to be found in
the etherized gas; or this decomposition will have been
such, that all the principles of the muriatic acid will be found
in  the etherized gas,     not united,    and not forming muriatic
acid, but combined with the principles of the alcohol, and
in the   same state   in which hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and
azot exist in animal or vegetable matters. Now if the radi
cal of the muriatic acid exists alone in the other principle,
or without a portion of the other principle of the muriatic
acid in the etherized gas, we ought, by decomposing this
gas in a red-hot tube, and deprived of the contact of the air,
to obtain no acid at all, or else less of it than has disap
peared in the experiment which produced it : and if this gas
contains not only the radical of the muriatic acid, but also
all the constituent      principles  of  that acid ; as those   princi
ples, whatever they are, have a strong tendency to combine,
we should conceive that by destroying the etherized gas by
fire, without the contact of the air, we shall probably ob
tain the whole      quantity    of muriatic acid which      has disap
peared   in  the experiment by      which   we procured   it.    Jt was
                                                              therefore

  100                       On the Muriatic Etket.
 therefore    of the   greatest importance to produce this decom7
 position in close vessels.  The operation was performed on
 900  grammes   of concentrated muriatic acid, and upon an
 equal volume of well rectified alcohol. Between the red-hot
 glass tube, in which the gas  was decomposed, and the retort
 in which it was produced, there was a large tubulated flask
 containing water at about 1 5°or 1 6°, in order to catch the acid,
 the alcohol and the water, which might be volatilized along
 with this   gas ; the glass tube, besides,      communicated       with
 two other flasks, one containing potash and the other water,
 in order to absorb all the acid which might re-appear in the
 operation : finally, the gases were collected by means of
another tube.       To ensure     the success   of the operation,    the
glass tube should be well luted, and the fire also well ma
naged to prevent the tube from melting.  Although in this
experiment there ought to have been produced nearly 50
litres of etherized gas, and nearly 250 grammes of acid
ought to have disappeared in the first place, yet all the acid
except four grammes re-appeared in the red-hot tube, and
came to be dissolved in the two flasks of the apparatus.
Thus, of all the suppositions hitherto formed of the mu
riatic acid being a compound body, one only is admissible,
which infers that the elements of the muriatic acid exist in
the etherized gas combined with the elements of the alco
hol, in the same manner as the elements of water, carbonic
acid, ammonia, Sec, exist in vegetable and animal sub
stances.
  Now if we          the muriatic acid to be a simple body,
                  suppose
we must then necessarily regard etherized gas as formed of
muriatic     acid and alcohol,     or   of a body coming from the
decomposition of alcohol; for alcohol is perhaps decom
posed when we distil it with the muriatic acid.   In all
cases, the question is thus brought to a choice of the two
hypotheses. Let us now try their merits as well as we can.
  One,   namely that which we have last mentioned, pre
sents us with phaenomena of difficult explanation. In fact,
it must                            or the body which re
            be supposed that alcohol,
presents   acts upon the muriatic acid with much more
            it,
energy than the strongest alkali, since this alkali cannot
                                                      take

                            On the Muriatic Ether.                                      107
take it off from           it,   and since,
                                         be subsequently de
                                                     as    will
monstrated, the muriate of potash     contains less acid than
the etherized gas    and how can we conceive, on the other
                           ;
hand, that the nitrate of silver, which takes up all the mu
riatic acid from the muriate of potash, cannot take up from                    it
the etherized gas, which contains more than the muriate of
potash does      ?
  la the other hypothesis,  on the contrary, every thing                                 is
naturally explained.  We see the reason why the etherized
gas does not redden turnsole tincture, and the alkalis do not
alter   itwhy the nitrate of silver produces no precipitate
           ;
from it; and why, on taking fire, so large    quantity of mu           a
riatic acid  produced,
                is      that   appears     the air in the form
                                              it                  in
of vapours  — in short, we can reconcile every thing with
                :
the phenomena             of other bodies.
  M. Theeard, however,         far from admitting the one
                                              is
and rejecting the other    decided manner. Both deserve to

be investigated; and whatever happens, the results must be
»ery important.
        Note upon the Discovery          of the Muriatic Ether.
                                 By M. Thknard*.
     When read the foregoing memoir to the Institute, the
               I
whole   of the members, among whom were Messrs. Ber-
thollet,       Chaptal, "Devoux,              Fourcroy, Guyton, Vauquelin,
Gay-Lussac, &c,                  regarded          the results         it   contained    as
being extremely novel, and were struck with the conse
quences which might be drawn from it. M. Proust, who
was then in Paris, and before whom   repeated the experi         I
ment    of testing        the etherized       gas by the tincture of turn
sole and the nitrate           of   silver, before and after the combustion
of   the gas,       &c,   evinced the same surprise with the French
chemists.       A    few days afterwards, however, M. Gay-Lussac,
on perusing the German Journal of Gehlen, accidentally
discovered in  note that Gehlen himself had made experi
                     a
ments upon the muriatic ether, and published them in his
Journal for 1804.  M. Gay-Lussac did me the favour to

    translate   M.   Gehlen's    memoir   ; and as it has a great simi
    larity to mine,      I shall give the following extract :
        M. Gehlen made muriatic ether with the smoking muriate
   of tin  and alcohol,      by employing an equal part in weight of
   both.     He   also made it in Basse's method {a chemist of Ha-
   meln), by     a mixture    of sea-salt, concentrated sulphuric acid
   and alcohol,       from which it was never thought         that any
   thing   else than sulphuric ether could be extracted.       He ob
  tained none with the muriatic acid alone.         In short, M. Geh
  len recognised most of the properties which I did in the
  muriatic ether. Thus he saw that this ether is most fre
  quently in the state of gas, that it liquefies at about + 10° of
  Reaumur, that it is slightly soluble in water, that it has a
  saccharine taste, that it does not redden turnsole tincture,
  that it does not precipitate the nitrate of silver, and that
  when we burn it a great quantity of muriatic acid is de
 veloped.      M.  Gehlen made no experiment, however, to prove
 from whence this muriatic acid came, or to ascertain               the
 quantity      produced by the etherized gas ; neither did he
 attempt to establish the theory of this etherification.          It is
 in this respect only that my labours differ from his. We
 differ a little     also, hut not remarkably, as1 to the process     I
 employed       for   making the muriatic ether, and by means of
 which I obtained in an instant probably more ether than by
any other, and an ether purer also than M. Gehlen's, since
his weighed        645 only, and mine 874, a greater specific
gravity      in  the    present instance being a proof of greater
purity.
     Having no doubt, from the above, that the muriatic
ether had been made in Germany, and that its property of
producing muriatic acid when burning was also known ;
and convinced as I was on the . other hand, that in France
and Spain the fact was unknown, I endeavoured to ascer
tain if the English chemists knew any thing of the matter.
For this purpose I applied to M. Riffault, the superintendant
of    the gunpowder       manufactories,    and who was at that mo
ment translating the third edition of Thomson's System of
Chemistry, a work full of erudition, and begun long after
                                                        M.   Gehlen's

                 Memoirs      of Erasmus Darwin, M. D.                       lo§
M.      Gehlen's      memoir appeared.            M. Riffault read to me
every thing          respecting    the  muriatic     ether, but I found no
thing about Gehlen, or the singular properties he relates of
the muriatic ether. Mr. Thomson only speaks of the pro
cess of Basse, which consists in mixing melted sea-salt,
alcohol,      and sulphuric acid ; and          which, with the exception
of the fusion of the salt,           has    been pointed       out by several
chemists.          I  think myself therefore entitled to conclude,
that in Great Britain, as well as in France and Spain, the
muriatic ether was unknown, and that, being ignorant of
M. Gehlen's labours, I have at least the merit of publishing
it. How often does it happen that a discovery is made in
one country, which had been known in another long before !
 and this happens because all learned men do not speak one
 language, and their works are not always translated. This
is the case with        M.    Gehlen's discovery*.

 An Doctor Darwin's First Class, Ord. I. Gen.                     1, mentioning
 arterial haemorrhage, he suggests the breathing an air with
 less of oxygen.           In the hcemoptoe of arterial Hood, he pro
  poses, besides the reduced air, making the patient sick by
  whirling round in a chair suspended by a rope ; actual vo
  miting,      a practice we believe first introduced by the famous
  Dr. Willis ; bathing in cold water, or sudden immersion of
  some of the limbs, or sprinkling the whole body with cold
  water. For the hcemoptoe narium, bleeding of the nose, he
  advises plunging         the head     into cold water with powdered
  salt   hastily dissolved in it       : lint strewed with wheat flour
      * Since writing the above, M. Boullay, a respectable apothecary in Parti,
  informed me that he made the ether in question with the muriatic acid and
  alcohol long ago, although he never gave publicity to his experiments,
  because   he did not   think they were  so complete as they ought to have been.
   I am proud   to have an opportunity   of doing justice to M.  Boullay.

     Arriving      at Gen.     2,    mentioning sudor calidus, warm
 sweat, he has the following curious observations on the
 use of calico and flannel :
     " If an excess    of perspiration     is induced by warm or stimu
 lant clothing, as by wearing flannel in contact with the skin
 in the summer months, a perpetual febricula is excited;
 both by the preventing the access of cool air to the skin,
 and by perpetually goading it by the numerous and hard
 points of the ends of the wool ; which, when applied to the
 tender skins of young children, frequently produce the red
 gum,   as  it is called  ; and   in grown people, either an erysipelas,
 or  a miliary eruption,        attended    with fever.
     " Shirts made      of cotton or calico stimulate the skin too
 much by the points of the fibres, though less than flannel ;
 whence cotton handkerchiefs              make the nose sore by fre
quent use.         The fibres of      cotton are, I suppose, ten times
 shorter than those of flax, and the number of points in con
 sequence twenty times the number ; and though the manu
facturers singe their calicoes on a red-hot iron cylinder, yet
I  have more than once seen an erysipelas induced or increas
ed by the stimulus        of calico,    as   well as of flannel.
     " The    increase   of perspiration     by heat, either of clothes or
of fire, contributes much           to emaciate the body ; as is well
known      to jockeys, who, when they are a stone or two too
heavy   for    riding, find the quickest way to lessen their weight
is by sweating themselves between blankets in a warm room :
but this likewise is a practice by no means to be recom
mended, as it weakens the system by the excess of so gene
ral a stimulus, brings on a premature old age, and shortens
the span of life j as may be further deduced from the
quick maturity        and    shortness     of the lives of the inhabi
tants of Hindostan         and other tropical climates.
    " M.    Buffbn made       a  curious experiment to show this cir
cumstance.          He took    a  numerous brood of the butterflies of
silkworms, some hundreds of which left their eggs on the
same day and hour ; these he divided into two parcels ; and
placing one parcel in the south window, and the other in
                                                                      the

the north window           of his house,         he observed, that those              in
the colder situation lived many days longer than those                                in
the warmerone.             From
                          these observations it appears, that
the wearing of flannel clothing next the skin, which is now
So much         in fashion, however useful it may               be   in   the   wintet
to those who have cold extremities, bad digestions, or ha
bitual coughs, must greatly debilitate them, if worn in the
warm months,             producing       fevers,   eruptions,      and premature
old age."
     He   makes the       following ingenious         and    unfortunately too
true observations respecting the diarrhoea infantum, gripes
in infants :
     "
     Milk is found curdled in the stomachs of all animals, old
as well as young, and even of carnivorous ones, as of hawks
(Spallanzani). And it is the gastric juice of the calf which
is employed to curdle milk in the process of making cheese.
Milk      is    the natural food for children,            and must curdle              in
their stomachs previous to digestion ; and as this curdling
of the milk  destroys a part of the acid juices of the stomach,
there is no reason for discontinuing the use of        though         it,              it
is   occasionally        ejected       in   a   curdled   state.     A      child    of   a
week old, which had been taken from the breast of its dying
mother, and had by some uncommon error been suffered to
take no food but water gruel, became sick and griped in
twenty-four hours, and was convulsed on the second day,
and died on the third   When all young quadrupeds, as
                                  1
well as children,          have             of milk prepared
                                      this natural    food
for them, the analogy     so strong in favour of its salubrity,
                                   is
that person should have powerful testimony indeed of its
         a
.disagreeing, before he advises the discontinuance of the use
of    to young children in health, and much more so in
     it
sickness.  The farmers lose many of their calves, which are
brought up          by
                 gruel, or gruel and old milk and among              ;
the poor children of Derby, who are thus fed, hundreds are
starved into the scrophula, and either perish, or live in                              z
state of wretched debility.
   " When young children are brought up without breast,                      a
they should for the first two months have no food but new
milk     ;     since the addition           of any kind of bread or flour                 is
                                                                                    liable

 liable to ferment, and produce loo much acidity ,          as appear*
 by the consequent diarfhoea with green dejections and gripes ;
  the colour is owing to a mixture of acid with the natural
 quantity of bile, and the pain to its stimulus.            And they
 should never be fed as they lie upon their backs, as in that
 posture they are necessitated to swallow all that is put into
 their   mouths ; but when        they are fed    as  they are sitting
 up, or raised up, when they have had enough they can
 permit the rest to run out of their mouths.            This circum
 stance is of great importance to the health of those children
 who are reared by the spoon, since, if too much food is given
 them, iudigestion, and gripes, and diarrhoea, are the conse
 quence; and if too little, they become emaciated j and of
 this exact quantity their own palates judge the best."
    His observations are no less curious respecting perspiratio
faetida,   fetid perspiration :
    "  The uses of the perspirable matter are to keep the skiu
 soft and pliant, for the purposes of its easier flexibility du
 ring  the activity   of our limbs in locomotion, and for the
 preservation of    the accuracy   of the sense of touch, which is
 diffused under the whole surface of it to guard us against the
 injuries of external bodies ; in the same manner as the se
 cretion of tears is designed to preserve the cornea of the eye
 moist, and in consequence transparent : yet has this cu
 taneous mucus been believed by many to be an excrement ;
 and I know not how many fanciful theories have been built
 on its supposed obstruction. Such as the origin          of catarrhs,
 coughs, inflammations, erysipelas, and herpes.
    "  To all   these it may be sufficient to answer, that the     an-
 tient Grecians oiled themselves all over       ; that some nations
 have painted     themselves  all over,  as the  Picts of this island j
 that the Hottentots smear themselves all over with grease.
 And lastly, that many of our own heads at this day are co
 vered with the flour of wheat and the fat of hogs, according
 to the tyranny of a filthy and wasteful fashion, and all this
 without inconvenience.        To this must      be added    the strict
 analogy between the use of the perspirable matter and the
 mucous fluids, which are poured for similar purposes upon

    " In some constitutions the perspirable matter of the lungs
acquires a disagreeable odour; in others the axilla, and in
others the feet, emit disgustful effluvia ; like the secretions
of those glands, which have been called odoriferae ; as those
which contain the castor in the beaver,                             and    those within
the rectum of dogs, the mucus of which                             has been supposed
to guard them against the great costivencss which they are
liable to in hot summers ; and which has been thought to
occasion canine madness ; but which, like their white ex

     He makes the following judicious observations on the
  cure of the ascarides, or thread-worm :
      " Ascarides  are said to be weakened       by twenty grains of
 cinnabar and five of rhubarb taken every night, but not to
 be cured     by this process.       As these worms are found only
 in   the rectum,   variety of clysters have been recommended.
 I   was informed of a case, where solutions of mercurial oint
 ment were used      as a  clyster every night for a month without
 success.     Clysters of Harrowgatc water are recommended,
 either of the natural, or of the factitious, as described be
 low, which might have a greater proportion of liver of
 sulphur in it. As the cold air soon destroys them, after
 they are voided, could clysters of iced water be used with
 advantage    ? or  of spirit of wine and water     ? or of  ether and
 water   ?   Might not    a piece  of candle, about an inch long,
 or two such pieces, smeared with mercurial ointment, and
 introduced into the anus at night, or twice a day, be effec
 tual by compressing their nidus, as well as by the poison of
 the mercury ?
     "  The clysters should be large in quantity, that they may
 pass high in the rectum, as two drams of tobacco boiled s
minute in     a pint of water.     Or, perhaps, what might be still
more efficacious and         less inconvenient, the smoke of to
bacco injected by a proper apparatus every night, or alter
nate nights, for six or eight weeks. This was long since
recommended, I think, by Mr. Turner of LiverpooI ; and the
reason it has not succeeded,        I believe to have been owing to-
the imperfections of the joints of the common apparatus for
injecting the smoke of tobacco, so that it did not pass into
the intestine,     though it was supposed to do so, as I once-
observed. The smoke should be received from the appa
ratus into a large bladder ; and it may then be certainly in
                                                                jected

jceted like the common clyster with sufficient force ; other
 wise oiled leathers should he nicely put round the joints of
 the machine, and a wet cloth round the injecting pipe, to
prevent the return of the smoke by the sides            of it.    Clysters
of carbonated hydrogen gas, or of other                  factitious airs,,
 might be tried.
     " Harrowgate    water taken into the stomach, so        as to  induce
 six or seven stools every morning, for four or six weeks, is
 perhaps    the most efficacious method in common use.                    A
 factitious Harrowgate water may be made probably of greater
efficacy than the natural* by dissolving one ounce of marine
salt, (called bay salt,) and half an ounce of magnesia Glau
ber's salt, (called Epsom salt, or bitter purging salt,) in
 twenty-eight ounces of water.            A quarter or half a pint of
this is to be taken every hour or two hours in the morning,
 till it operates, with a tea-spoonful of a solution of liver of
 sulphur, which is to be made by putting an ounce of hepar
 sulphuris into half a pint     of water."

  When       two sets of rings    are viewed      which   are dependent
upon each other, the colour of their centres and of all the
rings in each set, may be made to undergo a sudden change
by the approach of the shadow of the point of a penknife or
other opake slender body.          To view this phaenomenon pro
perly, let a 16-inch double convex lens be laid upon a piece
of looking-glass,     and   when the contact between them has
been made to give the primary set with a black centre, that
of   the secondary    will  be white.       To keep the lens in this
                                  H   2                          contact,

    llo>               Experiments   for    investigating
    contact, a pretty heavy plate of lead with a circular hole in
   it of nearly the diameter of the lens should bo laid upon it.
   The margin of the hole must be tapering, that no obstruc
   tion may be made to either the incident or reflected light.
   When this. is properly arranged, bring the third shadow of
   the penknife      upon the primary set, which is that towards
   the   light.   The   real colours of this and the secondary set
   will then be seen to the greatest advantage.               When the
   third shadow is advanced till it covers the second set, the
   second    shadow will at the same          time . fall upon the first
  set,    and the   colour   of  the  centres,   and of all the rings in
  both sets, will undergo a sudden transformation from black
  to white and white to black.
       The alternation of the colour is accompanied with a
  change of size, for as the white rings before the change were
  of    a different   diameter from the black ones, these latter,
  having     now   assumed a black colour, will be of a different
  size from the former black ones.
       When    the weight is taken from the lens          the black con
 tact will    be changed into some          other.    In the present ex
 periment it happened that the primary set got an orange-
 coloured centre, and the secondary a green one. The same
 way of proceeding with the direction of the shadow being
 then pursued, the orange centre was instantly changed to a
 greerrone, while at the same moment the green centre was
 turned into orange. With a different contact I have had (he
 primary set with a blue centre and the secondary with a deep
 yellow one;       and by   bringing    the second   and third   shadows
 alternately over the primary set, the blue centre was changed
 to a yellow, and the yellow centre to a blue one ; and all
the rings of both sets had their share in the transformation
of colour and size.                   .
      If there  are three sets  of rings,    and the primary set has a
black centre, the other two will              have  a white   one  ;  and
-when the lowest shadow is made to fall on the third set, the
central colour of all the three sets will be suddenly changed,
the first from black to white, the other two from white to
black.
     A full   explanation of these changes, which at first sight
                                                                     have

XVI. Of the      Course   of  the Rays       ly which different Sets    of
                            Rings are seen.
    In order to determine the course of the rays, which give
the Hngs both by reflection and by transmission, we should
begin from the place whence the light proceeds that forms
them. In figure I, (PI. VI.) we have a plano-convex lens laid
upon three slips of glass, under which a metalline mirror is
placed.     An incident ray, 1,2, is transmitted through the
first and second surface of the lens, and comes to the point
of contact at 3. Here the rings are formed, and are both
reflected  and transmitted     :   they are reflected from the upper
surface of the first slip, and pass from 3 to the eye at 4 : they
are also transmitted through the first slip of glass from 3
to 5 ; and at 5 they are again both reflected and transmitted ;
reflected  from   5 to  6. and transmitted from          5 to 7 ;  from  7
they are reflected      to   8, and     transmitted to 9 ; and lastly
they are reflected      from 9 to      JO. And thus four complete
sets of rings will be seen at 4, 6, 8, and 10.
    The most convenient way of viewing the same rings by
transmission, is that which has been mentioned in the se
cond article of this paper, when light is conveyed upwards
by reflection.     In figure 2, consisting of the same arrange
ment of glasses     as before, the light by which the rings are to
be seen comes either from 1,2, or 3, or from all these places
together, and being reflected at 4, 5, and 6, rises up by
transmission to the point of contact at 7, where the rings
are formed.      Here they are both transmitted up to the eye
at 8, and reflected down to 9 ; from 9 they are reflected up
to 10, and     transmitted     down      to   11; from    11 they are re
flected to 12, and transmitted to 13; and lastly, from 13 they
are reflected   to 14 ; so that again four sets         of rings will   be
seen at 8, 10, 12, and 14.
    This being   a theoretical way        of conceiving how       the ravs
of light may produce       the effects,     it will be required   to show
 by experiments that this        13  the actual progress      of the rays,
                                    H  3                               aud

 lit                    Experiments      for      investigating
 and that all the sets           of rings   we perceive         are really reflected
 or transmitted in the manner                  pointed out 5
                                             that has been
but as we have so many reflections and transmissions before
us, it will be necessary to confine these expressions to one
particular signification when they are applied to a set of
rings.
   When the centre of the rings is seen                    at the point        of con-,
tact, it is a primary set ; and I call it                      reflected,    when the
rays which come to that point and form the rings nndergo
an immediate reflection. But I call it transmitted, when
the rays after having formed the rings                         about the point        of
contact are immediately transmitted.
     Thus in figure         3 and 4 the rays a b c,            d   ef,   give reflected
sets    of rings
               ; and  the rays g hi, k lm, in figure 5 and 6,
give  transmitted  sets.
   In" this denomi nation, no account is taken of the course
of the             they come to a, d, g, k; nor of what be
            rays before
comes of them after their arrival at c,    i, m : they may f,
either come to those places or go from them by one or more
transmissions or reflections,           may require; but our
                                        as the case
denomination          will         their course immediately
                             relate only     to
after the formation of the rings between the glasses.
   The secondary and other dependent sets will also be called
reflected or transmitted by the same definition : and as a set
of             formed originally by reflection may come to
     these rings
the eye by one or more subsequent transmissions ; or being
formed by transmission, may at last be seen by a reflection
from some interposed surface, these subsequent transmis
sions or reflections             are to be
                                regarded only as convenient
ways to get a good sight of them.
  With this definition in view, and with the assistance of a
principle which has already been proved by experiments, we
may explain some very intricate phaenomena; and the satis
factory manner of accounting for them will establish the
truth of the theory relating to the course of rays that has
been described.
  The principle to which I refer                   is,
                                     that when the pressure

 reflection,   the centre of the same set, with the             same  pres
 sure  of the  glasses,   seen by transmission,        will  be  whiU*.
    I  have only mentioned black          and white      ;  but any other
alternate colours,      which   the rings or centres        of the two  sets
 may assume, are included in the same predicament.
XVII.     Why two       connected    Sets   of Rings are of alternate
                                  Colours.
    It has already been shown, when two sets of rings are
seen, that their colours are alternate, and that the approach
of the shadow of         a penknife will cause a sudden change of
them to take place. I shall now prove that this is a very
obvious consequence of the course of rays that has been
proposed.       Let figure 7 and 8 represent the arrangement
given in a preceding article, where a 16-inch lens was laid
upon a looking-glass,        and gave two sets of rings with cen
tres of different colours : but let figure 7 give them by one
set  of rays, and figure     8  by another.       Then, if the incident
rays come in the direction which is represented in figure 7>
it is evident that we see the primary set with its centre at 2
by reflection, and the secondary one at 4 by transmission.
Hence it follows,       in consequence of the admitted principle,
that if the contact is such as to give us the primary set with
a black centre, the secondary set must have a white one ;
and thus the reason       of the alternation is explained.
   But if the rays come as represented in figure 8, we see
the primary set by transmission, and the secondary one by
reflection ; therefore, with an equal pressure of the glasses,
the primary centre must now be white, and the secondary
one black.
   Without being well acquainted with this double course of
rays, we shall be liable to frequent mistakes in our estima
tion of the colour of the centres of two sets of rings ; for by
a certain position of the light, or of the eye, we may see one
set by one light and the other set by the other.
XVIII. Of       the Cause    of  the sudden     Clvarige   of  the Colours.
   Having thus accounted for          the alternation       of  the central
                      *  S« Article XI. of this Paper.
                                    H4                             colours,

   120                Experiments   for investigating
  colours, we may easily conceive that the interposition of the
  penknife must have an instantaneous effect upon them.
  When it stops the rays of figure 7, which will happen when
  its second shadow fails upon the primary set, the rings will
  then be seen by the rays 1, 2, 3, 4, and 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, of
  figure 8. When it stops the rays of figure 8, which must
 happen when the third shadow falls upon the primary set,
  we then see both sets by the rays 1, 2, 3, and 1, 2, 4, 5, of
 figure 7.      When the penknife is quite removed both sets of
 rays   will   come to the point of contact, and in some respect3
 interfere with each other ; but the strongest of the two,
 which is generally the direct light of figure 7, will prevail.
 This affords a complete explanation of all the observed phae-
 nomena : by the rays of figure 7 the centres will be black
 and white ; by those of figure 8 they will be white and black ;
 and by both we shall not see the first set so well as when the
 third shadow being upon it has taken away the rays of
figure 8 : indeed we can hardly see the secondary set at all,
till  the    shadow   of the penknife     has covered  either the rays
of figure     7 or of figure 8.
     As soon as we are a little practised in the management of
the rays, by knowing their course, we may change the co
lour    so gradually as to have half the centre white while the
other half shall still remain black ; and the same may bo
done with green and orange, or blue and yellow centres.
The rings of both         sets  will also participate in   the gradual
change     ;  and thus what has been       said of the course  of  rays
in   the  1 0th  article will again be confirmed.

                                 he seen.
    By an application of the same course of the rays, we may
now also determine the situation of the place where the dif
ferent sets of rings are seen : for according to what has been
said in the foregoing article, the situation of the primary set
should be between the lens and the surface of the looking-
glass : and the place of the secondary one at the metalline
coating of the lowest surface. To try whether this be ac
tually as represented, let us substitute a metalline mirror
                                                                  with

               the Cause     of coloured concentric Rings.            121
with    a slip   of  glass  laid upon it in the room of the      piece  of
looking-glass       ; and let there       be interposed a short     bit of
 wood, one-tenth         of an inch thick, between      the slip of glass
 and the mirror, so       as to keep   up that end of the slip which is
 towards the light.           This arrangement is represented in fi
 gure 9, where both sets of rays are delineated. Then it we
 interpose a narrow tapering strip of card, discoloured with
japan ink, between the slip of glass and the mirror, so as to
 cover it at 7, we do not only still perceive the primary set,
 but see it better than before : which proves that, being situ
 ated above the slip       of glass, the    card below cannot cover     it.
 If  on the contrary we insert          the strip of card far enough,
 that it may at the same time cover the mirror both at 4 and
 at 7, we shall lose the secondary set ; which proves that its
 situation was on the face         of  the  mirror
    When      several sets    of rings are to be perceived by the-*ame
 eye-glass,    and     they  are  placed at different distances, a par
 ticular adjustment of it will be required for each set, in order
 to see it well defined.         This will   be very sensible when      we
 attempt to see three or four sets, each of them situated
 lower than the preceding ; for without a previous adjust
 ment to the distance of the set intended to be viewed we
  shall be seldom successful         : and this is therefore a corrobo
  rating proof of the situation that has been assigned to differ
  ent sets of rings.
    XX. Of the        Connection between different Sets of Rings.
     It  will now be easy to explain in what manner different
  sets  of rings    are connected,       and why they have been called
  primary and dependent. When the incident rays come to
  the point of contact and form a set of rings, I call it a pri
 mary one : when this is formed some of the same rays are
  continued by transmission or reflection, but modified so as
  to convey an image of the primary set with opposite colours
 forward through any number of successive transmissions or
  reflections   : whenever this image comes to the eye, a set
 of rings will again           be seen, which is a dependent one.
  Many proofs of the dependency of second, third, and fourth
                                                                       sets

 I St                         Experiments    for   investigating
 sets    of rings upon their primary one may                      be given j — I shall
 only mention a few.
    When two sets of rings are seen by a lens placed upon a
 looking-glass, the centre of the secondary set will always
 remain in the same plane with the incident and reflected
 rays passing through the centre                   of   the primary one.             If the
point of contact,               by  tilting is changed,           the    secondary set
will follow            the                          ; and if the look
                             motion of the primary set
ing-glass            is turned about, the secondary will be made to
describe         a   circle upon that part of the looking-glass which
surrounds the primary one                   as a   centre.        If   there is a defect
in the centre or in the rings               of   the primary set, there             will   be
exactly          the    same     defect   in the secondary one             ; and     if    the
rays that cause the primary set are eclipsed, both sets will
be lost together. If the colour of the primary one is changed,
that of the secondary will also undergo its alternate change,
and the same thing will hold good of all the dependent rings
when three or four sets of them are seen that have the same
primary one.
   The dependency of all the sets on their primary one may
also be perceived when we change the obliquity of the inci
dent light ; for the centres of the rings will recede from one
another when that is increased and draw together when we
lessen       it,   which may go           so far that     by   an incidence nearly
perpendicular we shall bring the dependent sets of rings
almost under the primary one.
XXI.         To account       for    the Appearance       of several     Sets   of  Rings
                         with    the same coloured        Centres.
  It       has     often happened          that the colour of the centres                  of
different sets was not what the theory of the alternation of
the central colours would have induced me to expect     have                    I
                                                                                ;
seen two,            three, and      even four     sets   of rings, all of which
had    a   white centre.             We   are however now sufficiently pre
pared to account for every appearance                     relating to the colour
of rings and their centres.
  Let an arrangement of                   glasses be as      in   figure 9.When
this    is   laid down so            as to receive      an   illumination of   day
                                                                             light,

                the Cause   of coloured   concentric  Rings.          1S5
  light, which should not        be strong,    nor should      it be very
  oblique,    the reflection from the mirror      will then exceed that
  from   the surface   of  glass ;  therefore  the   primary set will be
  seen by the rays 6, 7, coming to the mirror at 7, and going
  through the point of contact in the direction 7, 2, 3 ; which
  proves it to be a set that is seen by transmission, and it will
 therefore have a white centre.           The rays J, 2, 4, passing
 through the point of contact, will also form a transmitted
 set with a white centre, which will be seen when the reflec
 tion from 4 to     5 conveys it to the eye.         But these two sets
 have no connection with each other; and as primary sets
 are independent of all other sets, I have only to prove that
 this secondary set belongs not to the primary one which is
 seen,    but to another invisible one.         This may     be done as
 follows   :
     Introduce the black strip of card that has been mentioned
 before, till it covers the mirror at 7 ; this will take away the
 strong .reflection of light which overpowers the feeble illumi
 nation of the rays 1, 2, 3; and the real hitherto eclipsed
 primary set belonging to the secondary one with a white
 centre, will instantly make its appearance with a black one.
We may alternately withdraw and introduce again the strip
 of card, and the centre of         the primary set     will be as often
changed from one colour to its opposite, but the secondary
set, not being dependent on the rays 6, J, will not be in the
least affected by the change.                                 f
    If the   contact should have been       such   as to give both sets
with orange centres, the introduction of              the strip of card
will prove that the set which is primary to the other                has
really   a green   centre.
    Another way of destroying           the illusion is to expose the
same arrangement to a brighter light, and at the same time
to increase the obliquity of the angle of incidence : this will
give a sufficient reflection from the surface of the glass to
be no longer       subject to the former deceptive appearance \
for now      the centre    of the primary set will be black, as it
pught to be.
                                                             XXII. Of

 l-2i               Experiments    for   investigating
                 XXII. Of      th» reflecting Surfaces.
    The  rays    of light that form rings between          glasses   must
undergo      certain modifications        by  some    of   the   surfaces
through which they         pass,  or from which they are reflected ;
and to find out the nature of these modifications, it will be
necessary to examine which, surfaces are efficient.                As we
see rings by reflection and also by transmission,             I shall  be
gin with      the   most simple, and show experimentally the
situation    of  the surface that reflects, not only the primary,
but also the secondary sets        of rings.
    Upon a slip of glass, the lowest surface of which was de
prived of its polish by emery, I laid an object-glass of 21 feet
focal length, and saw a very complete set of rings.                I then
put the same glass upon a plain metalline mirror, and saw
likewise a set of them. They were consequently not reflect
ed from the lowest surface         of the subjacent    glass or metal.
    It will  easily be understood,      that were   we   to lay the same
object-glass upon a slip of glass emeried on both sides, or
upon an unpolished metal, no rings would be seen.                     It is
 therefore neither from the first surface        of the incumbent ob
ject-glass, nor from its lowest, that they are reflected ; for
 if they could be formed without the modification of reflec
 tion from the upper surface of a subjacent glass or metal,
 they would still be seen when laid on rough surfaces ; and
 consequently, the efficient reflecting surface, by which we
 see primary sets      of rings, is that which     is immediately un
 der the point     of contact.
    To  see a   secondary set    of rings by reflection, is only an
 inversion of the method         of seeing a primary one. For in
 stance, when      a  lens is laid upon a looking-glass, the course
 of the   rays represented     in figure 8, will show that the rays
  1, 9, 3, 5, 6, by which a secondary set is seen, are reflected
 about the point of contact at 3, and that the lowest surface
 of the incumbent         lens is therefore the efficient reflecting
 one ; and thus it is proved, that in either case of seeing re
 flected rings, one of the surfaces that are joined at the point
 of contact contributes to their formation by           a certain modi
 fication   of reflection.
                                                             XXIII. Of

                the Cause     of  coloured concentric       Rings.          IS*
                 XXITI. Of the         transmitting Surfaces.
      It would     seem to be almost self-evident,             that when a set
  of rings   is seen by transmission, the light which occasions
  them must come through all the four surfaces of the two
  glasses which are employed ; and yet it may be shown that
' this is not necessary.          We may, for instance, convey light
  into the body of the subjacent glass through its first surface,
  and let it be reflected within the glass at a proper angle, so
  that it may come up through the point of contact, and reach
  the eye, having been transmitted through no more than three
  surfaces.      To prove this I used a small box, blackened on
  the inside, and covered            with     a piece    of black pasteboard,
  which    had a hole      of about half an inch in the middle. Over
  this hole    I  laid a slip    of glass with a 56-inch lens upon it j
  and viewed a set          of rings given by this arrangement very
  obliquely,     that the reflection from the slip           of glass might be
   copious,      Then guarding the point of contact between the
  lens and the slip of glass from the direct incident light, I saw
   ihe rings, after the colour of their centre had been changed,
  by means of        an internal reflection from the lowest surface           of
   the slip  of    glass ; by which        it  rose up through the point      of
   contact,    and    formed the primary set of rings, without ha
   ving  been transmitted through the lowest surface                of the sub
  jacent glass. The number of transmitted surfaces is there
   fore by this experiment reduced to three ; but I shall soon
   have an opportunity of showing that so many are not re
    quired for the purpose of forming the rings.
               XXIV. Of the         Action of      the first Surface.
       We   have already shown that two sets              of rings may be seen
   by using      a   lens   laid   upon    a  slip  of  glass ; in which case,
    therefore, whether we see the rings by reflection or by trans
    mission, no more than four surfaces can be essential to their
    formation.       In   the  following experiments for investigating
    the action of these surfaces         I  have preferred     metalline reflec
    tion, when     glass was not required, that the apparatus             might
    be more simple.
       Upon    a plain metalline mirror          I kid a double convex     lens,
                                                                         having

      H6               Experiments        for  investigating
     having a strong emery scratch on its upper surface. When;
     I saw the rings through the scratch, they appearod to have
     a hlack mark across them.              By tilting the lens, I brought
    the centre of the rings upon the projection of the scratch,
    so that the incident       light was obliged to come through the
    scratch to the rings, and the black mark was again visible
    upon them, but much stronger than before.                   In neither of
    the situations were the rings disfigured.             The stronger mark
    was owing to the interception of the incident light ; but
   when the rings had received their full illumination the mark
   was weaker, because in the latter case the rings themselves
   were probably complete, but in the former deficient.
       I  placed a lens that had a very scabrous polish on one
   side, but was highly polished on the other, upon a metalline
   mirror. The defective side being uppermost, I did not find
   that its scabrousness       had any distorting effect upon the rings.
       I splintered off   the edge      of  a plain slip of glass ; it broke
  as   it usually does with a waving striated, curved slope com
  ing to an edge. The splintered part was placed upon a
  convex metalline mirror of 2-inch focus, as in figure 10.
  The irregularity of the striated surface through -which the
  incident     ray 1,2, was made to pass had very little effect
  upon the form of the rings ; the striae appearing only like
  fine dark lines, with hardly any visible distortion ; but when^
  by tilting, the returning ray, 2, 3, was also brought over -the
  striated surface, the rings were much disfigured.                 This ex
  periment     therefore   seems     to  prove  that  a very regular refrac
 tion of light by the first surface is not necessary j for though
 the rings were        much       disfigured when the returning light
 came through the splintered defect, this is no more than
 what must happen to the appearance of every object which
 is seen through a distorting medium.
      I laid the convex side of a plano-convex lens 2*8-inch
focus with a diameter of 1-5 upon a plain mirror, and when
I saw     a set  of rings   I tilted the lens so     as  to bring the point
of contact       to the very edge          of the lens, both towards the
light and from the light, which, on account of the large
diameter of the lens, gave a great variety in the angle of
incidence to the rays which formed the rings ; but no diffe
                                                                      rence

               the Cause      of coloured  concentric  Rings.           127
rence    in their size or appearance could be perceived. This
seems     to prove that no modification of the first surface in
which the angle of incidence is concerned, such as refrac
tion and dispersion, has any share in the production of the
rings, and that it acts merely by the intromission of light;
and though evenvthis is not without being influenced by a
change      of  the   angle, it can only produce a small difference
in    the brightness     of  the rings.
     A   more forcible      argument, that leads to the same ccm-
 vlusTbn, is as follows : Laying down three 54-inch double
 convex lenses, I placed upon the first the plain side of a
 plano-convex lens of             f inch focus ; upon the second, a
 plain slip of glass; and upon the third,             the   plain side of a
 plano-concave lens also £ inch focus.                 I  had   before tried
 the same experiment with glasses of a greater focal length,
 but selected these to strengthen the argument.                   Then, as
 nothing could be more different than               the   refraction of the
 upper surfaces of these glasses, I examined the three sets of
 rings that were formed by these three combinations, and
 found them so perfectly alike that it was not possible to per
  ceive any difference in their size and           colour.     This shows
 that the first surface        of the incumbent    glasses merely acts as
  an inlet to the rays that afterwards form the rings.
      To confirm       the    idea  that the mere     admission     of light
  would be sufficient,         T used a slip of glass    polished on one
  side but roughened with emery on the other: this being laid
  upon a 21 -feet object-glass, I saw a set of rings throuo-h the
  rough surface ;. and though they appeared hazy, they were
  otherwise complete in figure and colour.               The slip of glass
  when laid in the same manner upon the letters of a book
  made them appear              equally hazy; so that the rings were
  probablv     as  sharply formed as the letters.
       Having    now    already great reason to believe that no modi
   fication, that can be given by the first surface to the inci
   dent rays of light, is essential to the formation of the rings¦
   I made the following decisive experiment :
       Upon a small piece of looking-glass I laid half a double
   convex lens of 16-inches focus, with the fracture exposed
   to the                              in figure         Under the edce 3 of
           light,   as represented               11.
                                                                          the

    12§          Experiments     for   investigating,  &t.
   the perfect part     of the lens   was put a small     lump  of wax,
   soft enough to allow a gentle pressure to bring the           point of
   contact towards the fractured edge, and to keep it there.
   In this arrangement it has already been shown that there are
  two different ways of seeing two sets of rings : by the rays
   J, fi, 3, we see a primary set; and by 1, 2, 4, 5, the secon
  dary set belonging to it : by the rays 6, 7, 2, 3, we see a
  different primary set ; and by 6, 75 2, 4, 5, we see its secon
  dary one. That this theory is well founded has already been
  proved    ;  but  if we should have a doubt remaining, the in
  terposition    of  any small opaque object upon the looking-
  glass near the fracture will instantly stop the latter two sets
  of rings, and show the alternate colours of the two sets that
  will then be seen by the rays 1, 2, 3, and l, 2, 4, 5. Re
 move in the next place the stop from the looking-glass, and
 bring the second shadow of the penknife over the primary
 set, and there will then only remain the two sets of rings
 formed       by incident   rays   which    come from 6, and which
 have never passed through           the upper surface of the lens.
 Now,     as both sets of rings in this case are completely form
 ed by rays transmitted upwards from the coated part of the
 looking-glass without passing through             the first surface  of
 the incumbent lens, the proef that the modifying power of
that surface is not required to the formation of the rings is
established.
      It can hardly be supposed that the first surface of the
lens should have any concern in the formation of the rings
when the rays are reflected from the looking-glass towards
the eye; but the same experiment, that has proved that this
surface was not required to be used with incident rays, will
show that we may do without it when they are on their re
turn.      We   need only invert the fractured lens, as       in figure
J 2, when either the rays 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6, 7, 2, 4, 5, will
convey the image of the rings after their formation to the
eye without passing through any part of the lens.

   One of the most interesting facts he has discovered    that                         is,
all sulphurous waters contain     greater or less quantity of
                                                  a
hydro-sulphuret of lime.
  In order to ascertain                 it,     he boiled the mineral            water ex
cluded from the contact                  of     the air,   in order    to expel from          it
the sulphuretted hydrogen gas and the carbonic acid.
  He afterwards poured into the residue —
   1st, Sulphuric acid, which liberated sulphuretted hydro
gen gas from     and sulphat of lime was precipitated.

                      j
  2d, Smoking nitric a:id, which separated sulphur from it.
  3d, Oxalic acid, which liberated sulphuretted hydrogen
    gas from   it;    and oxalate           of lime     was formed.
,     4th, The water evaporated                       with the contact         of the air,
    precipitated sulphat of lime; and the sulphuretted hydrogen
    gas was liberated.
       In order to determine rigorously the quantity                           of     the    sul
    phuretted hydrogen gas and of the carbonic acid, M. West
    rumb proceeds in the following manner — He introduces          :
    sulphurous water into   matrass to
                                     a      certain point, putting
                                                           a                                   a

                                                                        is a

    to it, entering into   long   cylinder,
                                    a         which      at one time
    filled with lime-water,             and another time with acetate                  of lead,
    with excess      of   acetic acid.
      The apparatus being thus arranged                        and well luted, he boils
    the water, and continues                    the ebullition      until      there    is    no
    more gas liberated.
      In the first experiment     the carbonat of lime which
                                            it   is                                            is
    precipitated, 20  grains of which  correspond to ten cubic
    inches of carbonic acid and in the second case
                                        ;              oxidated             it   is
    hydro-sulphuret  of lead, 1Q grains of which indicate ten
    cubic inches of sulphuretted hydrogen gas.

 130     Olservatio7is upon Sulphurous Mineral Waters.
   Another observation equally remarkable concerns               the sul
phuretted hydrogen gas.
  M. Gimbernat, a Spanish chemist, has asserted, that the
hot springs of Aix-la-Chapelle contain sulphuretted azotic
gas. — M. Schaub attempted to extract it from the sulphu
rous waters of Nenndorf in Hesse.   The following charac-                  .
ters have been attributed to this gas : — 1st, A smell similar
to the sulphuretted hydrogen gas ; 2d, Being indecomposa
 ble by the carbonic acid gas ; 3d, Not being inflammable;
.4th, Being improper for supporting an inflamed body ; 5th,
 Being indecomposable by the nitrous gas ; 6th, Being de
composed by the concentrated nitric acid, which separates
sulphur from it ; 7th, Decomposing the metallic solutions,
and forming sulphurets; 8th, Having a great affinity for
water,   from which it cannot be separated, except by long
ebullition.
  But M. Westrumb has found that when we wash sul
phuretted hydrogen gas with lime-water, or when we pass a
current of this gas through slaked lime, it acquires all the
above properties.
   Whether the sulphuretted hydrogen gas be obtained from
sulphurous waters, or be prepared in any other way in use,
the same phenomena take place.
   On bringing back the lime-water by an acid, sulphuretted
hydrogen gas is liberated, which is inflammable, and which
possesses its ordinary properties.
   Sulphuretted azotic gas is therefore      a   product   of   the ope
ration.
  ,M. Westrumb      does not yet know   if       this new gas be pro
duced by the action of quick-lime upon sulphuretted hydro
gen gas, or if this substance does not contain sulphuretted
azote.
  Lastly,   third observation not less interesting is the pre
            a
sence of carbon and carbonated substances in the sulphu
rous mineral waters.
  M. Westrumb       has discovered a new principle in them —
zjgelid resin of sulphur. (Stinkendes schwefelharz.)
   In order to obtain  it,we must evaporate the sulphurous
water excluded from the contact   of the air,     and afterwards take
                                                                     up

          Observations upon Sulphurous        Mineral Waters.       131
up the residue by alcohol,       which dissolves this resin more
than the earthy muriates.        By the evaporation of the alco
holic liquid, the substance at first looks like a yellowish fat,
it is successively coloured brown, and becomes resinous.
    By repeated solutions in alcohol, and by evaporations, it
is decomposed- into sulphur, and into a resin of a blackish-
brown.
    It has a garlic smell, which becomes very strong,          and si
milar to assafcetida,    when we pour water into the alcoholic
solution.
    Its solution acts like an acid.
    Its resin is dissolved in ammonia,         and communicates        a
yellow    colour  to  it; the  liquor    acts  like that of Beguin.
With lime-water we obtain           a  hydro-sulplmret.      All these
 solutions act upon the metallic combinations like sulphuret
 ted hydrogen.
    As sulphurous mineral      waters have their origin in beds       of
 pit-coal, we might perhaps find the .source of this bitu
 minous principle in pit-coal itself.
    Around the baths of Eilsen, like those of St. Amand,
 there is accumulated     a kind   of crust, which gradually        be
 comes of a dark colour, and latterly black.
    By analysis, there have been extracted from it sulphuretted
 fetid resin, hydro-sulphuret of lime, sulphur, lime, alu-
 mine,    magnesia, charcoal, and sand, with some fibrous
 substances, a little sulphuretted hydrogen gas, and car
 bonic acid gas.
    Whatever     be the origin    of   the bituminous     principle in
 sulphurous waters, tyf. Westrumb succeeded             in producing
 charcoal and fetid resin, by employing sulphur perfectly
 pure.
     For this purpose    he  digested    sulphur precipitated by an
 acid in alcohol.     By distilling the alcoholic liquor, there is
 separated yellow crystalline        sulphur, or a yellowish gray
 powder : the fetid resin is then completely formed in the
 liquor floating above, and possessing all         the above proper
 ties.
     We might attribute its formation         to the presence    of  the
  alcohol, and a fortiori, because, after     its separation from the
                                   I  2                         residu

  residue  of  the evaporated    sulphurous water, the penetrating
  smell is manifested, when it is taken up by the alcohol.
  But several observations lead M. Wcstrumb to think that
  the alcohol does not contribute to the formation,             and that
  it rather derives its origin from the sulphur itself.
  Letter  of M. Roloff, of        Magdebourg,       upon the foregoing
                                Subject*.
     I have recently recognised in an unexpected manner the
  sulphuretted fetid resin of M. Westrumb.
     M. Michaelis, after having precipitated the golden sul-
 phat of the hydrogenated sulphuret of antimoniated potash,
 evaporated    the liquor floating    above coataining      the  sulphat
 of potash.
     When the ley began to concentrate,           a vapour was deve
 loped, which very much embarrassed              the   artist who    was
 stirring  the mass.     There was at the same time manifested
 an insupportable       smell,  analogous to that       of burnt assa-
foetida.
    The saline   mass evaporated     to dryness had      a gray colour,
and the remarkable smell we have mentioned.
    It was put in digestion      with alcohol,   which acquired      the
taste and smell    of garlic.
    The  alcoholic   liquor evaporated    spontaneously, yielded a
gray gluey mi..ss, possessing the same smell and taste.
    I am desirous that this experiment should be made pub
lic, not knowing if M. Westrumb is acquainted with the
formation of a large quantity of fetid resin which may be
easily procured by this process.
    As the smell is manifested before putting in the alcohol,
we may conclude, with M. Westrumb, that the alcohol does
not contribute to its formation.

                         By Mr. JOSEPH JEWEL.
IN   our last number, page 93, we mentioned that Messrs.
Howard and Co. had introduced an important improvement
in the preparation of this essential article of the pharmaco
poeia.  It is the discovery of Mr. Joseph Jewel, one of the
partners, who gives the following specification of his in
vention, for which he has taken out a patent :
     "
     Calomel, or mercurius dulcis, as usually prepared, is
at first a hard crystalline substance, and requires to be
pounded and triturated with water, either in a mortar or on
a slab with a nuillcr, or in a mill.    After having been
ground or triturated for a considerable time, more water
is added, and the whole well stirred up. The finer particles,
which remain suspended tor a short time, being poured off
with the water imo another vessel, and left to subside, the
water is then decanted, and the fine powder dried for use.
The coarser particles are again submitted to the operation of
grinding and washing over, until the whole be finished.
Now the nature of my invention is to produce the effect of
the grinding or tritnration above described, in a more per
fect manner, during the last sublimation of the calomel                              ;
which I do as follows :
     "   I take calomel,        or mercurius dulcis, broken into small
pieces,       put into an earthen crucible of the form of a
            and
long barrel, so as to fill about one half thereof. I place the
crucible on its side in a furnace provided with an opening,
through which the mouth of the crucible projects about an
inch.  I then join to the mouth of the crucible an earthen
ware receiver, having an opening at its side to receive the
open end of the crucible.  This receiver is about half filled
with water.         I    lute the joint       \viih   a   mixture    of   sand    and
pipe-clay.         The   receiver   has a cover, which cover has a side

of   the    crucible     into    the receiver    ;        where,    by

The calomel, when thus           prepared, is purer, whiter, and
more attenuated,        than that obtained by grinding. It is
proper to wash the product over with water, before it is

about the mouth of the crucible.

                           To  Mr. Tilloch.
       SIR,
 A    letter     from M. Tardy de la Brossy, dated Joyeuse,
 (Ardeche)    October    13th, 1805, addressed to Professor Pictet,
 of Geneva, has appeared in your Magazine [vol.xxiv. p. 322] .
 It contains observations on some experiments which I had the
 pleasure   of showing to the Philosophical Society here on the
 specific gravity of mercury in its frozen state, which experi
 ments    were   communicated       to the public    through   the me
 dium    of Mr. Nicholson's Journal for April 1805. The
 observations    of M, Tardy de la Brossy have induced me to
 look over the original papers, containing the results of
 those experiments, with some attention; and, with deference
 to the opinions of that gentleman (though I fear some in
 accuracy exists), I must, in defence of my experiments ge
 nerally, and the deductions made from them, request you
 to communicate a few experiments and observations through
 the channel    of your Magazine.
    M.   Tardy   de la Brossy,     after avowing the object of his
 communication       to be  "  the extension    of truth, and the re
moval of error," proceeds to describe the result of some of
 my former experiments, and to make his observations on
 my calculations from them, to which           I would refer j but    if
                                                                     he

                               at low Temperatures.                                  135
he had added experiment to his calculations, he would have
been convinced that the principles on which I proceeded are
just,       and    that one source    of difference in our opinions
arises from the         partial application of the mode of reasoning
which he uses.     For, admitting with him the specific gravi
ty of the alcohol employed to be -810 nearly, or -8141 where
water is 1-000, and that 1000 grains of mercury would exhibit
a loss of weight in alcohoi of the temperature stated, of 59'8,
when weighed by the hydrostatic balance, yet it does not ap
pear to me necessary to suppose, d priori, so long as each
of these substances remains in a fluid state, that the ratio of
their densities should differ when uniformly subjected to the
lower degrees of heat. As, however, my former experiments
were not made with a view to discover the contraction of
the          of the alcohol, I made no observation relating
        volume
to    it,
       and now think       right to investigate the subject by
                                       it
experiment.
  A. first distilled mercury as before, with great care,
          I
using only that 30 per cent, of the whole which first came
over in the        distillation, esteeming            it   the most pure.     I   found,
 by   the hydrostatic balance,              the specific gravity         of this   to be
13'6l3,       as 1000   grains lost         in   distilled water 73-4 at the tem
perature      50   of Fahrenheit's           scale.
     B.took alcohol from the same parcel which
        I                                          had used              I
in my former experiments, and filling    light glass bottle   a
formed with long narrow neck for the purpose,
                   a                             was found            it
to weigh -8141,    when water weighed 1-000 at the tempera
ture of -48° nearly.
   C. Having obtained mass of very pure silver, procured
                                   a
from lima cornea, 1000 gr. lost in distilled water 97'8, the
specific gravity       of which        was thereby found to be 10-225; but
by    hammering        it   into   a   form convenient for my purpose the
specific gravity increased               to 10-362, the loss of weight being
96-5 at 50° of temperature.    At the following tempera
tures the variations of loss of weight are expressed in the
second column, the consequent specific gravities the third,              in
according to the usual mode of calculation, and in the

  D. By the following experiments I then proceeded to
ascertain the specific gravity of mercury and silver at various
temperatures, from 100° above zero to more than 40° below
it,   with   a   wish to obtain     a   ratio of contraction between mer
cury and silver, and between each of these and alcohol.
For this purpose two hydrostatic balances were so placed
that the metals suspended from them might fall into glass                   a
vessel containing       alcohol.
I   then attached 1000 grains of silver to one balance, by
a wire 12 inches long, weighing only ^ of            grain;             a
and to the other 1000 grains of mercury, in     small glass        a
bucket weighing 101-fti. grains, suspended      wire nearly   by   a
4 inches long, weighing ^ grain.                      t

   138     On the Contraction which takes place in Mercury
  known, and      expose   it  to different   temperatures   from    100
  to 50 degrees, it will contract ; but whilst the fluid con
  tracts, the glass which contains it contracts also, and shows
  only  the difference  of   the contraction    between the fluid    and
 glass :— however, as we know that silver by heating cannot
 become specifically heavier, or by cooling specifically lighter,
 in these experiments which are evidently a comparison of
 densities, the alcohol must become more dense by depriva
 tion   of heat.
     The third column of this        table contains the temperatures.
     In  the 4th column the 1000 gr.        of mercury   and   the glass
 bucket containing it appear together to have varied at              the
 two extremes in loss of weight 4'3.
     By the   5th column it is shown that the glass bucket alone
 varied at the two extremes        in loss of weight 1-9.
     By the 6th column it appears that 2'4 only can be stated
 to belong indispensably to a variation of the respective den
 sities of the mercury and alcohol in the changes of tem
 perature from 100° to zero. The other variations, I presume,
 arise from some inaccuracy, such as making the observa
tions when the fluids were at different temperatures.
    By the 7th column are shown the different specific gravi
 ties of the mercury, by calculation from the loss of weight,
 supposing the density of the alcohol the same throughout :
from this it appears that the density of mercury is greatest
 at the     highest temperature, and least at the lowest ; but
 as this cannot be actually the case, it is obvious that the
 alcohol increases in density ; and this appears also from the
results of the 2d column relating to silver, at C.
    For the specific gravities of alcohol at various tempera
tures, I must refer to the calculations, at L, made from the
following experiments, and which are contained also in a
general     table of results.
    E. I procured the bladder of a rabbit, and washed it well
with     alcohol.   It weighed 7 grains in air; and having an
nealed a wire about 9 inches long, the weight of which was
-i(vths of a grain in air,
                               I found that the bladder and wire,

     We may observe in this experiment that some difference is
  occasioned by the direction in which the heat passes,
 whether from withont to the alcohol, and thence to the
 mercury, as in the first part of these observations from
 45° to 135°; or from within from the mercury to the al
 cohol, as from 135° to zero and 21° below : and it appears
 that the temperature was not the same in these two fluids
 when the observations were made ; for when I weighed the
 same mercury with a hole in the bladder to introduce the
 bulb of a thermometer, that I might observe the variation
 of loss of weight when      the alcohol  and mercury were at the
 same temperature exactly, it showed the mean of these va
 riations to be correct.      So that in comparing 5276 parts of
 mercury with alcohol, there is a variation in the contraction
of   these   two fluids expressed    by 22  of loss of weight in
passing through 156 degrees        of temperature. In comparing
 1000 parts    of mercury with alcohol, it follows that there is
a variation of loss of weight in 156 degrees of temperature
expressed by 4- 1 7, which shows -0267 is the loss of alcohol
in each degree greater than that of mercury.
    If  these two fluids were to contract by deprivation of heat
in the. ratio of their specific gravities, it is obvious that the
loss of weight shown by the hydrostatic balance would be the
same through all the changes of temperature, the changes
being the same     in- both fluids at the time of observation.
                                                                It

                       at low Temperatures.                        141
   It is therefore of material consequence to this inquiry to
know in what degree equal bulks of mercury and alcohol
increase together, without the hydrostatic balance denoting
the alteration by any change of loss of weight; for this
purpose we must look to D, and forward to the experiment
G, and the calculations from them at L and I, where we
shall find a rule for discovering the specific gravity          of  al
cohol.
   F. To find    the proportion  of contraction between mercury
and   water, I took 3024 grains of mercury in a bladder, as
before   ; and weighing it in distilled water by the hydrostatic
balance, the mercury and water heated to the temperature

 Thus,   at 200° of temperature mercury would appear of greater
 specific gravity than when at 50°, following the general
 mode of calculation; but if we suppose the water is more

    G. The following experiment        was made   before many of
 my philosophical friends with mercury, described before, of
 the specific gravity of 13-613, suspended by a very fine wire
 10 inches long,    weighing only tV of a grain ; — the baro
 meter standing at 29-8, the thermometer at 35.
    1000 grains of mercury with 750 grains of alcohol, as be
 fore described, were put into a thin glass vessel, made for
 the purpose, round at the bottom, and increasing in diameter
 gradually to near the top, so that the mercury might be
 easily suspended in the alcohol by a wire introduced into it
 whilst fluid.    These were placed in the centre of a mix
ture  of  4 pounds of snow and 4 pounds of muriate of lime,
at 12 o'clock at noon : at 5 minutes past a thermometer
 placed in the frigorific  mixture fell to 52° below zero, then to
54 and to 60.      The mercury in the     tube of  the thermome
ter appeared frozen : it was withdrawn, and when exposed
to the air a few seconds, suddenly fell to 140° on the scale,
in consequence of the mercury in the tube again becoming
fluid,  and occupying the vacuum which had been occasioned
by the contraction of the mercury in the bulb after that which
was in the tube had become solid : it was then immediately
returned to its place in the mixture of snow and muriate of
lime; it had remained at 140° for several minutes when taken out
and exposed to the air,so that the mercury still in the tube was
again made fluid; it instantaneously sunk into the bulb
much below 270°, the lowest point on the scale.             During
this time the mercury and alcohol, very much reduced in
temperature, were removed from the above mixture, and
placed   in  a second    mixture   of  3 pounds of snow and 3
pounds of muriate of lime        :  the whole was then placed in
the first mixture; and at the moment of the crystallization
of the mercury, the wire, already partly attached, was by

raising it gently, drawn from the side ta the centre of
the surface of the mercury. When it was fixed and the
whole was solid, it became necessary to withdraw the
glass, and expose it a moment to the air of the room, until
that part of the mercury attached to the glass was softened ;
then,         by keeping         one hand drawing     gently at the wire,
the whole            of   the mercury was   suspended, and, with the al
cohol,         immediately         returned to its place in the cooling
mixture         ;    the mercury was now suspended            from the hydro
static balance by the wire fixed in               it,   and weighed with great
accuracy — and the following observations were made from

may observe that at almost the next degree of temperature to
that in which the mercury loses its fluidity, whilst the alcohol
preserves its fluid form,      the mercury appears to become of
less specific gravity,    as  it loses 60 ; which gives, according
to calculation at    L,  only 14 ; but the fact appears to mc to
be, that alcohol      proceeds in the ratio of a fluid by decrease
of temperature, and that mercury, having obtained a solid
form, follows the ratio of contraction of a solid ;itherefore
their densities approach each other.            I should have ascribed
this greater loss of weight to the particles of the mercury at
the moment       of crystallization occupying, in consequence of
their new arrangement, more space than at the moment be
fore it became solid, as with some ot the metals is known
to be the case, had I not carefully observed the passage of this
metal in other experiments, where I had an opportunity of
seeing the contraction proceed very distinctly ; and had not the
mercury, also proceeding to still lower temperatures, lost
from   6()L
              60-1, 603,     607, 60-8, and 61, long after the
whole had become solid,         and   was   suspended     by the wire  :
thus,  61   is the greatest  diminution of weight       by the abstrac
tion of heat which I could obtain,      and   I  am of opinion that the
space described by these changes         of  loss  of weight  denotes  a
range of many degrees of temperature: how much greater the
density may then be than that stated at L, I cannot presume
to say ; but as it takes, with some probability, a proportion
of contraction approaching to that of silver, it certainly appears
irnprobable that it should reach the specific gravity which my
former calculation from a single observation led me to at
tribute to it. I am therefore inclined to believe there was
some inaccuracy in weighing the silver by the hydrostatic
balance, when by my former experiments I gave 88. 1, the
quantity of loss of 1000 gr. of silver : — from many observa
tions in this laborious train of inquiry, it seems hardly possible
that the former could have been correct ; for if the alcohol and
silvercontinuedto      contract in the same proportion from 56°be-
low zero,as they do from64°above zero to that temperature, it
would appear that an abstraction of heat must necessarily have
                                                                  taken

                                     at low Temperatures.                                           145

                         equal       to   120°
which I can hardly suppose, though the mercurial thermo
meter used in these experiments fell lower than 270°
below zero.  If my former statement be erroneous, it cer
tainly is not attributable to the mode of calculation, as ap
prehended by M. Tardy de la Brossy. As it does not appear
that he had made any experiment on the subject, he could
not have anticipated this inaccuracy in the weight of silver :
and as he says that only a few grains of the increased gra
vity of the mercury was attributable to the alcohol, he could
not be aware              of       the great increase          of     the specific gravity           of
alcohol shown                 at    I, by   the same mode                  of calculation       used
in my       essay, the subject of his animadversions.
     It   is still, however. obvious, that mercury would not be
of  the specific gravity which I attributed to    unless  had                    it,           it
followed the same rate of contraction alter    became solid as              it
it   did whilst fluid         :            the increased loss of weight
                                   the evidence        of
is   so much against me, that            cannot defend that experi
                                                 I
ment      ;   and  I     would now be understood to carry my observa
tions on the specific gravity of mercury, with accuracy, to
the point of congelation only    or to state that near 56° be
                                                      ;
low zero       its specific gravity              is   14•4(55,        as   by   calculation at       L.
Then,         if    we attribute          to mercury             in   a     solid state nearly
double the contraction                    of silver         as at   H, or '00100 in             each
degree,        as   it   is   near to its point             of fluidity,         we shall      arrive
only at the specific gravity 1-1-485, as shown at M.                  is
  To ascertain whether the silver at C, with which                                          I   pro

and provided an instrument for the purpose of measuring
accurately           the           expansion of the silver,

in the silver            by    the centre itself.            Then, on        the surface       of    the
 bar   of silver, heated to pale red, an arch was Jcseribed with

  T4<J     On ike Contraction which takes place in Mercury
 this instrument      ; and when again reduced to the temperatunr
 of 50    degrees,   another   arch was drawn : — the contraction of
 the har of silver between the two points appeared to equal
  i'yth part of its dimensions.
     The silver was        then heated to £09° of temperature of
 Fahrenheit's       scale, by boiling it in water, and gradually
 cooling j an arch of a circle was then struck on the surface
 of the silver: reducing it to 150° of temperature, another
 arch was struck with the same unvaried centre pins, which
 showed evident contraction in the bar of silver: again, at
  100°    of temperature another arch was described ; and a
 fourth, at 50°, showed that the silver had contracted in the
 deprivation of 150° of temperature xJ-t-th pari of its length*
     Then, similar parallelopipedons being to each other as the
 eubes     of their homologous      sides, the increased  specific gra
 vity    is shown     by multiplying the specific gravity at 50°,
 namely,       10-362, by the cube of 341; and dividing it by the
 cube of       310, which equals 10-4537; .0917i therefore, is-
 the difference     in  ISO0  of heat; or -0006114 is the contrac
 tion   of silver in   each degree;     which, from the way this exi-
 periment is      performed, I call its visible contraction.      From
 it   the specific    gravities at the several    temperatures below
 are calculated     :—
        $t    200° silver is   of  the specific gravity   10•2702

    I. Then, if      10-4268 be the specific gravity of silver at
56^    below zero, and weighed in alcohol at that temperature,
by calculation from its loss of weight at C, it will appear
to be 9-796, by taking •8141 as the supposed density of al
cohol,      dividing the quantity     1000 by the loss   83-1, multi
plving     the quotient 12/033 by -8141, and dividing by        l-000i
                                                                    the

 What   theu is the    specific gravity of the alcohol — if not 8141?
                     It is found by this rule :—
   Divide 1000, the quantity weighed, by the loss of weight,
and by the quotient divide the density of silver, according
to its visible contraction ; the quotient will be the specific
gravity of the alcohol, or fluid in which it is weighed.
   Thus, at the temperature 561 below zero, the loss of weight
is 83-1 ; by which, if -1000 (the quantity weighed) be di
vided, the quotient is 12-033, by which 10-4268 (the density
of silver according      to its visible contraction) is divided ; and
the quotient is -8065,        the specific gravity of the alcohol at
56D below zero.        Thus, -0524 is the sum of variation of the
specific gravity of alcohol in 106% orOOO49434 is the varia
tion in each degree of temperature : from it the specific
gravities at these several temperatures are calculated.
    At   135° the specific gravity      of alcohol   is -77208

   K. Then taking the specific gravity of the alcohol at any
certain temperature, and the loss expressed at C ; What will
be the specific gravity of the silver according to C ?
                    It is found by this rule : —
   Divide    1OOO (the    quantity weighed) by the loss      of weight,
and   multiply the quotient by the specific gravity of the al
cohol or fluid in which it is weighed.
   Thus,    at 563 below     zero the loss    of weight is 83-1, ac
cording to    C  ; by which     if  10OO be  divided, the quotient is
12-0337 ;     which, multiplied by -8665,        the density   of alco
hol,  as at  I, in that temperature the product         is 10-427, the
specific gravity of silver at 56° below zero.
   Then, having      ascertained    the specific gravity   of silver and
                                     Ka                                of

M8       On the Contraction which takes place in Mercury
of alcohol      at several      points of the scale     of temperature by
calculations at      I,  from experiments at       H, the calculation of
the specific   gravity of mercury is thus performed : —
       —
   L. Divide the quantity by the loss, and multiply the
quotient by the specific gravity of the alcohol at such tem
perature.
    Thus, mercury          at  G, in the temperature of          56°  below
zero, appears to be of the specific gravity 14*465. For divi
ding 1000 by 59*9, the least loss in the solid state, and mul
tiplying    the quotient       16*694 by •8665,       the specific gravity
of alcohol at that temperature, the product is 14-465.
     Then if mercury in 106°, from 503 above to 65° below
 zero, increases       in specific gravity from 13-613 to 14-465,
 namely    *852,    which      gives *00804 each degree; this sum,
 multiplied into the number of degrees from 50° above zero,
 gives the specific gravity of mercury at that degree, if de
 ducted when above 50 from 13-613, or added to the same
 when below 50°.
     Thus   at 135° above zero, which          from     50° is   85°,  if the
 sum *00S04        be multiplied       by 85, the product is *6834j
 which    subtracted      from 13-613, the specific gravity of mer
 cury at 50°, gives 12*9296,            the specific gravity     of mercury
 at 135°   of temperature.
       At  200° the specific gravity       of mercury      is 12-407

       weight of silver by experiments at H, and calculations
       at   I, it there appearing that -8665 is the specific gravity of
       the alcohol.
            M.   Supposing the mercury weighed by the hydrostatic
       balance at G in a solid form, during the variations in the
       Joss of weight from 59-9 to 61, to have passed through 203
       of temperature to 76° below zero, and to have increased
       -001 each degree,        then mercury in a solid state will have
      arrived at the specific gravity 14-485, and the alcohol in
       which it is weighed with a loss of weight of 61 will conse
       quently be of greater specific gravity.
           For if alcohol at 56° below zero was            of the specific gra
      vity -8665,      as at I,  the mercury losing 59-9, as at G, and at
      a lower temperature the same mercury weighed in the same
      alcohol lost 61, it will appear that the alcohol must have in
      creased in specific gravity ; for if 59'9 be -8665, 61 will be
      •88-12, the mercury remaining at 14*465, as at L: but as we
      have     reason    to state,   it  passes on to 14-485      at  76' below     '
      zero, then the specific gravity of            the alcohol must appear
      to be -8854 ; because if 14-485 increases              -001  each degree,
      •8S42     will increase -000061; which sum, multiplied by 20,
     equals -001220        ; this, added to -8842, equals -8854.
          N. We      observe at   F, 3024 of mercury lose 222- 1 at 50' of
     temperature; at 200° of temperature it loses 217•4; and by
   . calculations at L, the specific gravity of the mercury so
     weighed was shown to be 12•407 at that degree of heat.
                              Then by the rule     at I :—
          If  3024 be divided by 217'4, the quotient is 13-909, which
     sum dividing 12-407, the known gravity of mercury at L,
     the specific gravity of the water will consequently appear to
     be    -8920: this     deducted     from 1000,     the specific gravity   of
     water at 50°      of temperature,      leaves -1080, the sum     of differ

 of mercury being supposed 100?
     As the increased specific gravity of mercury is to the sup
 posed number, so is the increased specific gravity of either
 to the number required.

152     On the Contraction which takes place in Mercury
           To recapitulate the foregoing Experiments              —
                                     Observe,
At A, mercury         is   of  the specific gravity     13.6l3   at the tem
  perature     50.
At B, alcohol      is  of the specific gravity      '8141   at the tempera
  ture 50.
At C, silver    is  of    the specific gravity 10-362]at       the tempera
  ture 50.
At C    and D there is error shown to exist in estimating the
  specific gravity of bodies in the usual mode, without hav
  ing regard to a fixed point of temperature, at which the
  medium chosen to compare other bodies with should be
  estimated at 1-000; and without having regard to the ratio
  of contraction in           the body weighed,        and the medium        in
  which it is weighed.
At E, a variation of contraction between mercury and al
  cohol expressed by 22 in weighing 5276 of mercury.
At F,   the error     of common practice noted          at  D  is confirmed,
  the increased         loss   of weight showing         the contraction     of
  water to be greater than that of mercury of equal volume                     j
   it is expressed by 4.7 in 150° on the quantity "3024.
At G, mercury in its frozen                 state weighed by the hydro
   static balance lost 59.9 to 61 on the quantity of 100. For
   the calculations from these facts, see L and the annexed
   table.    The mercurial thermometer fell below                270° on the
   scale helow zero.
At H, silver, going down               150 degrees   of Fahrenheit's     scale,
   contracts    T^-ffth     part  of its dimensions,     which is called its
   visible contraction.
             The silver       at  1 17  above zero is 10-321
                                   50                   10-362
                                   56 below zero        10-426
   The    increase     of silver in its specific gravity is -0006114
   each degree.
At I,    the error   of general practice       observed at   D and F   is con
    firmed.     A rule     is given for finding the specific gravity          of
    the alcohol.      When       •8141 at 50 above zero it appears to be
                                •8665 at 56 below zero.
                                                                             At

                        at low Temperatures.                   153
At I,  the increased specific gravity of alcohol each degree
  is -0004934.
  For the further variations of gravity see the annexed table.
At K, a rule for finding the specific gravity of silver from
  loss of weight at C, and the specific gravity of alcohol at    I.
          If silver at 50 above zero be 10•362, it will be
                    at 56 below   zero     10-427 .
At L,   a  rule is shown for finding the specific gravity of mer
  cury. — At 200 above zero it is found to be 12-407
                  50                                 13-613
                   56 below         .                14-465
  The    increase each degree is -00804
  A   comparison of C and G as it relates to alcohol ; and by
  the rule at I it appeajs they accord in the number -8665,
  the specifiq gravity at 56 below zero.
At M, the contraction of mercury in its solid state, sup
  posed to be near twice that of silver, or -001 each degree,
  because near the point      of fluidity.
      Alcohol of the specific gravity -8854 at 76 below zero.
      Mercury in a solid form of the specific gravity 14-485
   at 76 below zero.
      The mode of calculating this is shown.
      The increase of specific gravity of alcohol in      each  de
   gree not shown by the hydrostatic balance, when mercury
   is weighed in it in a solid form, is -000061.
At N, rule for finding the increase of water of equal bulk
   to that of mercury. It appears from F to be -00072 each
   degree.
      Rule for finding the ratio of contraction of mercury,
   alcohol, water, and silver,    of equal volume ; mercury being
    supposed 100.
      A ratio of contraction also of water, mercury, alcohol,
    and silver ; water being supposed 1 -000.
      Rule also given to find the ratio     of contraction of alco
    hol, water, silver, and mercury, of equal weight.

     XXIX.    Essay   upon Machines in general.     By M, CHUKOT f
              Member    of   the  French Institute, &c. &c.
                            [Continued from p. 15.]
    V. -I   HE second principle upon which we purpose making
    Some observations,     is the celebrated law of equilibrium of
    Descartes.   It comes     to this, that two powers in equilibrium
    are always in reciprocal ratio to their velocity, estimated in
    the direction of these forces, when we suppose that one of
    the two comes to take it from the other in an infinitely small
   degree; so that a small movement arises from it.
,      But although this proposition be very beautiful, and we
   generally regard it as the fundamental principle of equili
   brium in machines,       it is nevertheless infinitely less general
   than that which has been quoted in the first place; because
   it is applied solely to the case where there are only two
   powers in the system : and besides, it is very easily deduced
   from what has been said upon the subject of the two weights
   A and B, since we evidently approximate the one case to the
   other by substituting,        by means of pulleys,      weights  in
   place of the forces which we wish to value.
      Moreover,    it is to be remarked, that this principle does
  not express the conditions of the equilibrium between two
   powers so completely as that which has been quoted in the
   first place ; for it only gives the account of the quantities of
   force composing equilibrium, at the place where the latter also
   gives, in some sort, the account of their directions : — for ex
   ample, in the case of equilibrium between two weights, the
   principle of Descartes solely teaches that the weights should
  be in the reciprocal ratio to their vertical velocities ; but it
   does not indicate,    like the first, that one    of  these bodies
   should necessarily ascend, while the other descends.            IQ
  order that an axle, for instance, to the wheel and cylinder
  of which weights are suspended by cords, should remain
  in equilibrium, it is not sufficient that the weight applied
  to the wheel be to that of the 'cylinder as the radius of the
                                                  —
  cylinder is to the radius of the wheel : it must also hap
  pen that these weights tend to make the machine turn in
  a contrary direction to each other; i. e. that they are placed

therefore evident that what renders the principle                             of Pes-
cartes incomplete        is,  determining the reference of the

                                                :    it   is

other solicits  now, this

the example of the axlttree; — But what      in general that   is   it
distinguishes soliciting from resisting forces   This in my          ?
opinion has not yet been determined.      We shall see in this
essay that the characteristic difference                  of   these forces consists
in the angle they form with the directions of their velocities,
to that the one form always acute angles with their veloci-
jies, while the others form obtuse ones with theirs.
   Lastly. One fault with which we may reproach the princi
ple of Descartes, as well as all those where we are discuss-
Jng the small movement which would arise in the system                                    if
the equilibrium was disturbed, is, that they do not indicate
jhe method of determining this small movement. Now,                                          if
 for this purpose we must hare recourse to some new me
 chanical principle,           the former       is   not sufficient       ;   and   if    we
                         is by
 pan determine       pure geometry, What
                    it                          the method of       is
 doing so  ?  This   what the principle docs not say and let                   :
 us not say that the proportion indicated     the principle     by                        al
 ways  takes place whatever  the movement        provided           is,                 it    is
 possible, i.e. compatible with the impenetrability of bodies;
 for this would      be     an      error:    and we       shall     by   and      by   show
 that these movements are subjected to certain conditions, in
 consequence of which   think    right to give them the name

   We may make the same remark upon all                          the principles
 upon     which we propose                   to consider      machine in two

 States infinitely near each other              ;    for, in order to determine
 what are those two states     e. what movement the machine
                                        ;i.
 should take in order to pass from the one to the other, we
 must either employ new mechanical                             principles, conjunctly
  with that proposed, which would render the latter insuffi

 is a defect in the principle, not to make known the geome
 trical conditions to which ibis movement is subjected.
      VI.     The two laws mentioned                  are confined to the case         of
 equilibrium.           We     pass easily from this case to that                of   the
 movement by    M. D'Alembcrt's principle in dynamics.                                But
 we have found several others which are immediately applied
 to the case of movement ; such as that of the preservation
 of living powers under             the shock of perfectly elastic bodies ;
 which is so much the              more general, as it extends even to the
 case of the movement passing rapidly from one                       state to the
other   but it would seem that people have little dreamed of
          :
the use that might be made of it in the theory of machines
properly so called.   It             is,
                             however, evident, that this law
should have its analogy in the shock of hard bodies and as \ve       :
generally take the latter to use    as   term of comparison,
                                                it         a
this principle, transferred to hard bodies with the modifi
cation which th6 difference of their nature requires, cannot
fail to be more useful than the preservation in question. We
shall show, in fact, that we may deduce from             several      it
capital truths with the greatest facility, and particularly the
preservation of living powers in system of hard bodies, the
                                                 a
movement            of which                    by

                                  changes             prin            ;      a
ciple of well-known utility in the theory of machines. We
shall thereby sec, at the same time, an intimate relation
between these two preservations of living powers; —we draw
from     also the principle of Descarte-s; and even,
         it                                           gene               by

above mentioned.    This principle,    short, after having given

to contain all the laws of equilibrium and of movement: and
we have not found            a   better for the basisof our theory.

                          General   Principles.
     When one body       acts upon another, it is always imme
diately,     or  by the agency of some intermediate body : This
intermediate body is generally what is called a machine : the
movement lost every instant by bodies applied to this ma
chine is partly absorbed by the machine itself, and partly re
 ceived by the other bodies in the system ; but as it may hap
 pen that the object of the question is simply to find the re
 ciprocal     action   of bodies applied      to   intermediate bodies,
 without having any occasion         to   know    the effect  of it upon
 the intermediate body itself, it has been thought, in order
 to simplify the question, to make an abstraction of the very
 mass of this body, preserving to it on the other hand all the
 other properties of matter. Hence the science of machines
'has become in some measure an isolated branch of me
  chanics,     in which it is required       to consider the reciprocal
  action    of the different  parts of    a system    of bodies ; among
  which     there are found things     which, when deprived of           the
  inertness common to all parts of matter such             as exists in na
  ture, have retained the name of machines.                              ,
      IX.   This abstraction may simplify          in certain particular
  cases,    where circumstances       indicate    those    of bodies, the
   mass   of which it is convenient     to neglect,   in order more easily
   to attain our object; but we conceive that the theory of ma
   chines in general has really become more complicated than
   formerly : for this theory was once contained in that of the
   movement       of bodies, such    as   nature presents them to us;
   but at present we must consider at once two kinds of bodies,
   the one as they really exist, and the other as deprived in part
   of their natural properties.     Now, it     is clear, that the first of
    these problems is a particular case      of the latter; therefore the
    latter is more complicated : further, although we easily suc
    ceed by similar hypotheses, in finding the laws of equili
    brium and of movement in each particular machine, such as
    the lever, the axle, and the vice, there results an assemblage
     of facts, the connection of which is perceived with diffi
     culty, and solely by a kind of analogy ; which should ne
                                                                    cessarily

  cessarily happen, as often as we have recourse to the partico-<

  common properties being those which we have in view in
 this essay, it is clear that we shall only succeed in finding
 them by the abstraction of particular forms.         Let us begin,
 therefore, by simplifying the state of the question, by ceas
 ing to consider under one and the same system, bodies dif
 fering in their nature.     Finally, let us restore to machine*
 their vis inertice.    It will be easy, after this, to neglect
 their mass in the result : we shall have the choice of doing
 so or not; and in setting out, the solution of the problem
 will be equally general, at the same time" that it will be
 simpler.

                          To  Mr. Tillocti.
     AVING been -induced to pay particular attention to com
 bustion for some time past, I have insensibly imbibed prin
 ciples different from the generally received theory.        I  veiy
 soon began to suspect caloric as a compound substance, and
six months      ago  had recognised two fluids    of electricity for
its component parts. The only demonstrative grounds then      I
had for my ideas was the production of light and heat, parti
cularly the latter, and for the purpose of measuring the quantitv
thereof   I had an apparatus constructed.     But when Mr.Davy'»
recent experiments were noticed in your Magazine, I im
mediately saw them as an additional support of my peculiar
principles, and prepared a lecture, which was delivered to a
Society in this town on the 29th of January, laying down
the whole system,     as  supported by facts deduced from elec
tricity  and the experiments    of Mr. Davy, which I intended
to publish when more matured         ;   but on looking over the
monthly publications      yesterday,    I found a communication
in Mr. Nicholson's     to a similar purport,    which has induced
                                                                 me

me to trouble you with my communication sooner than I
intended.       If you deem it worthy a place in your work, I
shall feel obliged by the insertion. You will see that I come
to similar conclusions to      Mr. Gibbes, from    a very different
investigation, and from different phenomena ; so that there
is no sameness in our productions. With respect to the me
rit of each (being somewhat different), I can say this, that I
have candidly considered what Mr. Gibbes has advanced,
but  I  shall not be disposed to admit without further informa
tion one of his deductions; viz. that water is a simple sub
stance, and the base      of both hydrogen   and oxygen.

March 4,  18O8.
                          ON CALORIC,    &C.
   A   theory to be just, ought to elucidate and exhibit the
cause of every phenomena with which it is connected : if
it will not do this, I shall       even be inclined to believe that
its principles are erroneous, or at least very imperfect.      It -is
an undoubted fact that there are many effects which the pre
sent doctrine of caloric does not pretend to explain at all ;
and again, there are many others which it explains only
upon principles inexplicable in themselves. And if we take
a view of the doctrine as applicable to combustion (which
is perhaps its forte), reflection cannot but produce dissatis
faction with it. The present doctrine of combustion is
founded upon this basis : first, (which is undoubtedly just,)
that oxygen in every case unites with the combustible ; se
condly, 'that the caloric and light is produced by a difference
in the capacity for heat of oxygen and the combustible, be
fore and after combustion.        But that this second part of the
doctrine is not so obvious, appears from the combustion of
gunpowder       in vacuo,   and many similar facts. Where, ac
cording    to   the present  theory, caloric ought to be absorbed
instead   of evolved, it is directly contrary to the system ; for
the products of combustion have considerably greater ca
pacities for caloric than the combustible and supporter of
combustion themselves.
                                                              Othe

  1 60  On Caloric, and the Heat evolved during Combustions
     Other phenomena might be adduced to the same purport?
 but ibis is the strongest proof, the best known, and suffi
 cient tor my purpose. It will, I presume, be seen, that though
 one part of Lavoisier's doctrine is probably just, yet the
 other is as likely to be erroneous ; and, from a retrospect
 of the  success   of various fallacious theories, from their being
 always     established   on sophistical reasoning from experi
 mental proof, which is as liable to deceive mankmd now as
 aforetime, we shall be justified in this conclusion ; that though
 Lavoisier's theory appears to coincide with experimental
 proof, yet it may not be just, and that, failing to account for
 many phenomena with which it is connected, it is at best
 imperfect, if not materially erroneous.         It indeed accounts
 for the emission of heat and light in common cases of com
 bustion plausibly enough, it must be admitted; — But where
 is the proof ? Plausible reasoning is often sophistical ; and
 I  cannot by any means think we have sufficient grounds for
believing that the caloric and light of common combustions
are produced agreeably to this doctrine. It appears to me that
 the evidence thereof is merely presumptive,        and in many in
 stances it is evident that the heat and light must be derived
from another source. That the state of combustible, &c, and
 product of combustion,         before and after the process, must
have material influence         in the quantity of heat and light.
given out, is not to be denied ; but in rapid combustions I
am disposed to think the effect is not great in proportion to
the quantity generated by the process.
    Since I perceived the deficiency of Lavoisier's        theory,  I
have been induced to pay particular attention to this subject.
 Reflection soon taught me that oxygen and caloric must have
 some remarkable relation to each other, as oxygen is the
only known supporter of combustion in nature : — what kind
of relation this      can  be,   does not appear so ready to deter
mine.       Yet  I am inclined to believe that it will be brought
to light before long, and that it will be discovered in the
 new field of investigation opened by the recent experiments
 of Mr. Davy;       at least   it is there I have looked for it.    I
just noted that there was a remarkable relation between oxy
 gen and caloric, or rather between oxygen and the genera-
          i                                                      tior.

       On Caloric, and the Heat evolved during Combustion*           lfti
  tion of caloric by combustion. According to my conception
 of   the experiments of Mr. Davy, they show that combusti
 bles on decombustion absorb the electric fluid          :  and   as  we
  know    that no quantity    of electric fluid is given out on com
 bustion,     it appears probable that this will lead us to the dis
 covery of this relation between oxygen and combustion. We
 cannot for a moment consider the electric fluid and caloric
 as synonymous        : we must therefore draw this conclusion ;
 That   the electric fluid is probably instrumental      in producing
 the caloric of combustion,        and that as it disappears therein,
 it must    disappear to form something else. The combustible
 unites with oxygen, and we fmd that a large quantity of ca
 loric appears as a large quantity of electric fluid disappears ; it
 is therefore extremely probable that the electric fluid which,
 disappears, forms the caloric which is generated. This is the
 result I infer from it; and the manner in which I conceive
 it is effected, I shall now lay down : viz. that there are two
electrical fluids in nature     ; and that the peculiar relation ox
ygen has to combustion consists in this —that oxygen is the
only substance with which one of them combines, and that
 the other unites with the atoms        of combustibles only    ; — that
caloric is generated during combustion by the union of these
two fluids; consequently, that caloric is not a simple sub
stance, but that its particles are composed of the two fluids
of electricity — this brings combustion           to be a double de
composition and combination, one of the products of which
is caloric ; that the electric fluids in some form or other are
blended with        the  atoms of matter, and like the atoms          of
alkali    and    acids  in salts veiling each other's properties;
that on the combination of oxygen with the atoms of the
combustible body, the electric fluids severally combined with
each, unite, and form caloric, which is disengaged as gas
is set at liberty in other decompositions.         As gas lighter than
atmospheric air is forced to rise up when at liberty to do so,
so caloric, when disengaged, is by some power dispersed on
all sides.
    It appears probable from a variety of circumstances, that it
is the vitreous fluid of electricity that unites with oxygen,
and the resinous with combustibles.            If we note, therefore,

1§2 On Caloric, and the Heat evolved during ComlitSliott,
that gunpowder,          containing one of these fluids in large
quantity    in  potash, and the other to a requisite extent in
sulphur, it will not be surprising, that gunpowder should
bum in vacuo, nor again that it should give out s0 much
heat   and    light    on   deflagration.      These    principles   not
only account for         every   phenomenon        of combustion      re
lative to gunpowder, and by applying them to combustion
by acids, &c, likewise, but at the same time for the heat
emitted during combustion in air. Whereas, to reconcile
Lavoisier's system, we are obliged to suppose an unnatural
chemical union of oxygen, different from its general pro
perties, for which there is no other ground, than the con
venience it is of, only to deceive ourselves, by regarding as
a property of nature, what is in reality only a property of
human imagination, and which, if persisted in, must effectu
ally put a stop to this branch of science.
    It must be obvious that these principles will in a most
simple and beautiful manner account for the light and heat
produced by electrical experiments and friction. To enter in
to particulars would exceed the limits of this paper. I shall
 therefore conclude with a view of the process of revifica-
 tion or decombustion.         Suppose the body acted upon is iron        j
 A quantity of resinous fluid unites with the metal, and the
 oxygen of the oxide of iron is separated in the process : it is
 therefore   as  strictly a chemical union     as that effected in com
 bustion.    If we examine the     process  for  therevification of ores,
 we find it peculiarly adapted to produce this decomposition.
 A layer of charcoal, then a layer of oxide, is alternately depo
 sited. The heat that is first produced by setting fire thereto,
 carries off the oxygen of the charcoal in carbonic acfd gas :
 the carbon thus heated has an affinity for, and combines
with, oxygen. When, therefore,            the oxygen    of  the charcoal
 is exhausted, it unites with, and        carries off" in gas, the oxy
gen   of  the   ore,  at  the   same  time  that the resinous electric
fluid   of the carbon unites with the atoms of the metal.
Thus it is that fire both burns and unburns substances. The
fire acts no otherwise than by placing the particles of carbon

                                                                    coal

 Oh the different apparent Magnitudes       of the same Objects.  1 63
coal supplies the heat requisite to this purpose, whilst the
dther literally undergoes no combustion at all, but is trans
ferred unaltered from the carbon to the iron, or whatever
substance is employed ; that is, part of the resinous fluid
which charcoal as a combustible contains,' is expended in the
production of heat and gas, whilst the other part unites with
the iron (if such was employed) of the oxide, and renders
it combustible.       The metal is rendered combustible at the
expense   of the combustibility of the charcoal; and the reason
that the iron does not undergo combustion when rendered
combustible, is owing to the well-known chemical tact, that
substances alter in their properties by different combinations.
In this case we find that the resinous fluid (the principle of
combustibility)      becomes more fixed in the fire by uniting
with the particles of iron, &c, than it was when united with
the particles    of carbon. It appears,' therefore, that the re
sinous fluid (the principle of combustibility)        is mdre or less
fixed in the fire, according to its combination with different
substances ; and that it is owing to this that to burn one
combustible one degree of heat is required, and another an
other.
XXXI.       On the Cause    of  the different apparent Magnitudes
   of  the   same   Objects   seen  under different Circumstances.
    By Ez.    Walker,      Esq.
                          To   Mr. Tilloch.
     SIH,
At     the   conclusion    of  a paper    which was printed in the
 Philosophical Magazine for last October, I mentioned that
the apparent magnitudes of all objects are variable, as well as
those   of the sun and moon.
    This, however, is not a new discovery, for            M.  le Cat
mentions      it in several parts of his Physical Essay on the
Senses, printed in the year 1739.            This philosopher says,
 p. 234,
           " I looked through the glass of a casement, at a
very remote country-seat, which appearqfd\to me sufficiently
large.    I afterwards fixed my eyes on the glass itself; and it
                                   L 2                       seemed

   seemed      to me    a  great deal smaller than when I looked        at it
   directly.      Since that time     I have made repeated experiments
   of this matter, and always found            the same circumstances."
   In another place he says :
      "   I  shall recount still something         more extraordinary on
  this variation      of    the magnitude     of  the visual angle, or    of
  the image of objects.
      "   Last winter I was in the country. In the night it froze
  hard, and there fell a little snow.               On going out of my
  chamber in the morning, all objects appeared to me sensibly
  smaller than they had done the evening before.
      "  Since I made this discovery, and have been                 guard
  ed against the      rule    of comparison,     I plainly   perceive   that
  a   very    illuminated      object   seems   smaller,   and  an    object
  feebly supplied with light appears larger. The reason of this
 is evident.        A strong light puts the whole globe of the eye
  on contracting itself, and a feeble one leaves it relaxed and
 dilated."
     This author       is very correct in his observations;        but his
 explanation is founded on a false theory.               The true reason
 is this : A strong light contracts the pupil of the eye, in
 which state it forms a small picture of an object upon the
 retina; but in       a    weak one the pupil is dilated, and all ob
jects      then appear larger.          This property of vision will,
 I  think,    appear    evident,   from   the following experiments. ,
     It  is difficult to enlarge the pupil of the eye to any parti
cular dimension,            but it may be contracted at pleasure, by
means of perforations made either in a thin plate or a slip
of    paper.-
     Now, if an object be viewed through an aperture, about
-y-J-5- of an inch        in diameter, it will appear much smaller
than to the naked eye, in consequence of the aperture of
the crystalline lens being contracted ; but if the perforation
be     removed from before the eye, the object will instantly
appear increased in magnitude : and as no change can take
place in any part of the eye instantaneously, it is therefore
evident, that the apparent magnitudes of all objects are in
creased by an increase in the aperture of the crystalline lens,
and consequently by an enlarged             pupil.
                                                                       The

     The            may also be proved by looking at an
            same thing
object though perforations of different dimensions ; for it
will appear smaller through a perforation of -^5- of an inch,
than through one that is tour times                        as   large;       and an object
viewed through a perforation as large                      as the       pupil, appears     of
the same magnitude as to the naked eye.
   Whence it is manifest, that all terrestrial objects appear
larger to the naked eye in the mornings and evenings,
when the pupil is large, than at noon when the pupil is less;
and for the same reason they appear larger in winter than in
summer.

                                 To    Mr. TMoch.
          SIR,
J.   o inculcate any science with success,                           there    is nothing so
essential        as a    simple and perspicuous display                  of its first prin
ciples ; and if there he any department in philosophy to
which this observation is more peculiarly applicable, it is
certainly the study of chemistry, than which there     pro                         is,
bably, none more useful to man.
   The present period            is,
                        of all others, the most opportune
for an improvement     chemical theory, as, from the very
                                in
brilliant discoveries of Professor Davy,                         it   is   obvious that    a
most material revolution               is   now dawning upon the modern
system       of chemistry, and, possibly,            an entirely new struc
ture      must eventually         prevail.      I     now        allude to the word
oxygen particularly,             which, in
                                    present limited sense,
                                                    its

                  a                       mere absurdity in      a
the nomenclature of the day, since   has been lately proved
                                                          it
to be at once the principle of acidity                         and    likewise     that    of
alkalescence.

  166           On the Identity   of Silex and Oxygen.
  elementary bodies is, I presume, too diffuse, in rcspeet
  to the number of subdivisions ; and many of the titles
  employed     might,    with    propriety, be expunged.         But,
 though     there are many other imperfections in chemical
  arrangement that require reform, T mean on this occasion
  to confine the following observations to one article only ;
 and shall endeavour to prove that, in this instance at least,
 w& should revise the list of simple substances, as far        as  tct
 gards silex ; which is still continued, I think, with          great
 impropriety, to rank as a species of earth.
    To include in any one genus bpth silex and the other
 earths, as they are now called, seems extremely improper
 and palpably erroneous ; nor can this classification be sup
 ported by any reasonable argument whatever. The definit-
 tions given from time to time, to distinguish an earth from
 any other elementary body, have never been sufficiently ex
plicit, for they do not precisely exclude the alkalis : they
make a useless division under the name of alkaline earths ;
 and, as salifiable bases, an earth, a metal, an alkali, and
silex, may be said to range as four distinct species of the same
genus.
    All  earths are declared    to be salifiable bases,   and  this  I
take to be the most essential clause        in every definition; for,
generally speaking, the earths have a ready affinity for every
acid, even from the weakest, particularly the carbonic acid,
to the most powerful that exists.         Indeed, as far as concerns
the combination with carbonic acid, with which the earths
form nearly insoluble compounds, this peculiar property
alone might have served to distinguish an earth from an al
kali. Here, however, the principal force of the definition
fails, the exception to silex is decisive} there is no carbonate
of silex; no nitrate, no sulphate, nor, in short, any other
salt, in which the acid is saturated by this simple element :
neither art nor nature ever produced a perfect neutro-saline
compound, in which silex • could fairly be considered as a
Teal and independent base.
    To constitute   a true salt, we know, there must not belesa
than    one   acid and   one base, reciprocally saturating each.
O^her; and when the number of either exceeds, and the

salt is not   binary compound, we may then fairly suspect
                 a
an imperfection ; for, one of the elements at least is fre
quently in the state of mere suspension, and not in chemical
union with either of the other ingredients.
  There are, indeed, numberless examples                             of   such   salts,
and,    I   am ready to allow,             some       in which silex is found,
whether            contingency or otherwise ; but it never
             as a mere
exists as a perfect base, that is, possessing the capability of
saturating the whole, or any part of the acid in such com
positions.
   If silex be, what I have long considered not only dis       it,
similar to every elementary ponderable material besides,
especially in generic characters, but, also, so vastly superior
in its importance and bulk, as to leave no room for compa
rison  ;surely   ought then to be instantly removed, and no
                      it
longer suffered to remain the list of earths, but should be
                                      in
placed in the most prominent station in the arrangement
of elements.           its consequence, that nothing in na
                      Such      is
ture    so predominant or so universally disseminated
       is                                                 no                     ;
compound solid substance of any magnitude       exempt from      is
it, but contains always some, not very large portion of

this insinuating, and            as   I   conjecture,      most essential of all
terrestrial matter.
   All organised bodies either contain silex, or, what shall                I
consider as    modification, oxygen.
                 a                     If there be any excep
tions to this conclusion, they are so few and of such trivial
import, that when they do occur they should be rated as
anomalies and;   may happen, that the apparent absence of
                       it
silex or oxygen    rather to be attributed to our want of
                           is
means, and the imperfection of science to discover it.
   In geological view of this subject, where can we turn
       a
our eyes or employ our thoughts, without meeting this grand
and multifarious cement — this bond of aggregation, that fixes
the solidity of all tangible nature The very outlines of our

planet are traced out with it; and all primitive matter, from
the most stupendous mountain or ragged precipice to the
deepest cavern, even             to   the    centre of gravitation,          we are
warranted        to
               say,         is   replete with silex.
                                               contemplate   If we
the nature, volume, and importance of this, and then recoi
                                          ls 4                                    lect

Ject the insignificance of zircon, glucine, and indeed the
whole of the species of earths, none of which exists without
an association of silex — all comparison vanishes, there is
no estimate;        these are as the mere spots to the brightest                     of
luminaries, and therefore, in all systematic classification,
should be separately arranged.
  Where then ought silex to be placed in the arrangement
of simple elements? — should it link with any other ponder
able body as a species of the same genus, or preserve a
station to itself       ?    Were     I     asked    for an answer to such a
question, I would say — that seeing nothing to which it has
the slightest resemblance but oxygen-gas, of which I con
ceive it to be the true base, here I would not only assign its
proper rank, but give it also a precedence to all other elemen
tary matters that had resisted decomposition.
   It is hardly necessary for me now to add, that I do not
consider oxygen in the state of gas to be a simple body ; for
whatever is susceptible              of spontaneous change should                   al
ways be deemed a compound                     of    at least two elementary sub
stances.       If one       instance of this can be adduced,                  we may
naturally      infer that others will be found; and, fortunately
for my      present  purpose, a most appropriate example has
lately occurred, which confirms this conclusion : I allude to                              ,
the experiments of Messrs. Allen and Pepys*, upon carbon
and carbonic acid, which appear to have been conducted
with uncommon      precision and genius,  From these gentle
men we learn, that oxygen-gas is subject to spontaneous
change, or, as they very properly express     deterioration     it,   a               ;
and that this will happen, though the gas be of the purest
kind, that obtained from oxy-muriate of potash                            ;   and even
when secured in glass vessels with glass-stoppers.
  Having assumed silex and the base of oxygen gas to be
synonymous and simple bodies, shall now proceed, as far as
                                                 I
my humble pretensions and knowledge of this subject will
permit, to substantiate this position, offering         by
                                                few only of               a
the numberless facts, which seem to confirm this identity.
It   is   a-task,   I   confess,   I      have     imposed upon myself          ;   for,

proof, and as the work * has now arrived at its second edi
tion, it   becomes  my duty to absolve its author from all          re
sponsibility ;   and, rather than any blame should attach            to
him, avow myself as the only person, who is accountable for
promulgating tenets, which to many philosophers must
have appeared to be visionary.
     It is scarcely necessary to explain what is here meant by
the word silex. But, that I may be clearly understood, I shall
define it to be, the very pure part of rock-crystal, and that
which constitutes by far     the greatest portion    of all sand, flint,
gravel, and other well described rocks, stones, and minerals :
a substance common in every spot of the globe, in every
 zone, and in every climate ; and an article so obvious and
familiar    to the meanest capacity, that any further descrip
 tion would be superfluous.         I shall just observe, that in
 rock-crystal, in quartz, and in hot-springs, silex is nearly in
 its pure and primitive state of perfection.
     There is no subject, in which analogical reasoning is more
 admissible or more conducive to arrive at the truth, than the
 one before us : and indeed, whenever the discussion has for
 its object the works of nature, as in chemistry and its sister-
 science, geology, I do not see it possible how this mode of
  argument can be well avoided.         It was analogy that led the
  penetrating mind of a Newton to some of the most brilliant
  of his discoveries ; and it was the same faithful guide that
  conducted this immortal philosopher to predict some of the
  most important truths, which have since been so completely
  established by the experiments of his successors.          The com
  bustible nature of the diamond, and         likewise that of water,
  are among these examples      :  they are facts that     will for ever
  bear testimony to the great advantages that may be derived
  from this method of searching into the secrets of Nature's
  unerring works, and the laws which these obey.
      Now, to apply this mode of reasoning to the present
  object of research, let us consider this our sublunary
  world under its three grand divisions.          The first, is the at
  mosphere,     which  surrounds    and   compresses     the whole of
   the others; and this may be called the aeriform division of
                         • « Chemical Catechism."
                                                                  nature

 nature.      Here,   it is allowed,     the principal element is ox
ygen ; but it is now in the gaseous state, that is, it is sa
turated with caloric.   I have said, the principal element,
because it is the most important of all others : — it is the
matrix of fire, it is the pabulum of life ; in short, such is
its consequence and value to the very being of all organized
matters, whether in the animal, vegetable, or mineral king
dom, that surely some more appropriate name might have
teen devised, than what it now bears. Though it is a di
gression, and remote from my plan, I shall take the liberty
to hint, that merely by modifying, that is in some measure
reversing, the theory which first employed the word phlo
giston, both this word and the theory itself might with the
greatest  propriety be revived : and the word phlogiston,
even in the theory of the present day, would more aptly suit
our comprehension of all the properties of pure air, than
that of oxygen, which implies merely the generator of vine
gar or sourness, a derivation of all others the most puny and
incomplete.
  The second grand division, is the ocean, sea, or                 water,
which we may name the aqueous portion of the                      whole.
Here we again recognise our oxygen, not only as the               princi
pal ingredient in magnitude, being about four-fifths              of the
whole,       but in all other respects claiming our first atten
tion.       In this water, the oxygen is further concentrated,
having lost a part of the caloric which it possessed in the
gaseous form, or in the atmospheric state ; so that, in this
case, we may now conceive it to be, in regard to density,
midsvay between earth and a;r ; and that, by an abstraction
of more of      its caloric, it must approach nearer to a state        of
solidity.
   If oxygen,           constitutes such a prominent and
                  therefore,
striking feature in two-thirds of the works of the Au
thor of all creation — which, in these cases, is a truth that
admits of no controversy.     Why, it may be aptly demanded,
should it not, also, form the most conspicuous ingredient in
the other third, that    the solid or real terrestrial portion of
                         is,

sumed, the identity of silex and oxygen.
  This theory seems to be supported by such a mass of evi
dence, that it is difficult to say where we should begin.
Geology        is,
             however,    source so prolific, that every spot of

the face of nature at once awful and magnificent, to the most
trifling      pebble       ;   nor   is   there      a   morsel      of any mineral com
pound, whether    be the brilliant gem or the mo&t unfruitful

alkali, or           any other salifiable or oxidable element, the
saturation      is    not always due either to silex alone or to some
acid, that           is,consequently, something containing oxygen.
Such         seems     to be their equivalence, that when silex ab                           h
sent     some acid must prevail                   ;      and    if   neither be found in the
association, then the earth, metal or alkali, whether potash
or soda, puts on its obvious and peculiar character, such as
taste, solubility, density, and the other generic qualities
proper to each species
  After silex, there   no substance so plentiful as lime, but
                                     is
this    is   never found pure;                  it    is   either saturated with an acid,
pr dwindles into       tasteless inert state of aggregation

silex   ;    so that, there           is   not    a   vestige remaining            of its primi
tive qualities, especially those of taste and solubility.
   That lime, even when pure,                                                                       little

duced at the expense, and through the means,                                       of   the degra
dation of silex, may probably deserve                                a   candid and minute
inquiry.

the metropolis but throughout the kingdom, reflects the
highest honour on the national character. This has long
been acknowledged; and it could not fail to be highly grati
fying     to the public, who contribute so largely towards their
support, to have a statement published annually of the re
ceipts and disbursements of each institution, with an account
of    the benefits derived from them to the diseased  poor.   I
<kinot think this desirable object is sufficiently attained, by
the committees of a few charities circulating a report of
the finances of the institutions over which they preside,
among their own members or subscribers.     The object in
view would, I conceive, be best attained by means of some
periodical work, where the reports should be recorded and
referred to ; by which the advantages of each charity to the
diseased poor would be made evident ; and a liberal public
would in          a   few years be enabled to form a correct judg
ment as to what kind of charitable             institutions was best
entitled to their munificence.
     The frequent,           and in some instances successful,
                                                       attempts
to depreciate the utility of dispensaries, have led to these re
marks : and when it is known that for an annual sum of
2,000/. upwards of y,000 of the diseased poor arc an
nually admitted and attended in three of these institutions
in London, (those persons being visited at their own houses
who are too    to go to the charity,)
                      ill               must be confessed   it
that dispensaries are somewhat more than   so many hot           "
beds calculated to rear and cherish their plants* for the
public service."
    It not my intention at present to analyse the motives
         is
-which probably gave rise to the above and many similar
observations,  being sufficient to record the fact; neither do
                      it
I  mean to advance any thing that should militate in                           the
least against the many truly valuable public hospitals                     ;   but
only to observe, that the great benefit derived     each             by        in
dividual inhabitant of these asylums prevents its being                        ex

being         of sufficient      magnitude to lodge and feed all the
diseased poor         :     nor would   be sound policy to extend their

        SIR,

 An   a letter    I sent   you, dated September            1 806*. I suggested
 the probability that oxygen was an                ingredient in the compo
 sition of potass.           This has been now confirmed by Mr.
I])avy : and although I was not right as to the quantity,                      I
 think I may claim some little merit. The rest, I said, was
lime and though here I must have been mistaken as to the
 quantity, it still remains to be disproved that it does not
 enter into the composition of potass. May not lime be an
 oxide of the same metal as potass j or may not that metal
 united with other substances form lime? 1 think the sub
ject worthy of investigation : and unless some one abler
 than myself takes it up, I shall trouble you with an account
 of the result of some experiments which                 I am   about to make

       SIR,
                               To     Mr. Tilloch.
 INothing         can be more distressing to human minds than
the accounts so frequently given in our public prints, of wo
 men and children being burnt to death                     by the accident of

If 4      Means       for preventing      the   fatal   Consequences
their clothes taking fire. Desirous of ascertaining how faf
persons in that horrible situation are likely to be relieved
by the judgment and exertions of those who might casually
be near them,  I have for some time past made a point of
turning  the conversation to this subject, among friends, ac
quaintance, and strangers ; and regularly inquired of the
men, how they would act, supposing themselves fete a fete
with a lady whose clothes had caught fire. I found them,
generally slow to reply ; — that not one of them appeared at
all prepared against such an event ; and that their resources
were few and shockingly defective*        Some thought they
must be guided by circumstances : forgetting that coolness
and decision, which are essentially requisite in such trying
predicaments, do not attend all men in the moment of
alarm and danger.   Others would pull off their coat to put
over the flames and smother them : — but the greater num
ber were for rolling her in a carpet.                 None   ever mentioned
any thing preferable : This last expedient appeared to be
thought the best that could be devised — the ne plus ultra.-"
It had not however occurred to them that the apartment
might not     be furnished with a carpet.               This sad experience
leads   me    to fear, that whoever will                take the trouble to
repeat the experiment among his fiiends and acquaintance,
will not obtain        any more satisfactory results.
   Although the insufficiency of these means must on a mo
ment's reflection be obvious to the humblest capacity, still a
kind of infatuation has made them be persevered in without
further thought — No rational plan is formed — All is in fact
left to chance ; the consequence of which must necessarily
prove fatal in nine instances out of ten.
   In circumstances of this nature, relief itself would be ex
treme torture, unless it be prompt : not an instant must be
lost : but while chairs, tables, and other incumbrances are to
be removed         off the carpet j    and before the sufferer can be laid
down in      it,   or that   it   can be drawn over her, the flames will
make rapid progress          ;    and until she  entirely wrapped up in
                                                 is
it,
  the flames are fanned and urged                by   the operation, which
moreover takes up too much time.
  Considering          the multitude      of valuable lives which have
                                                                   perished

       Arising from the Dresses           of Females  taking fire.     175

perished in this miserable way many of which it is proba
ble might have been saved, had better means been employed
— and that families of every rank, without exception, are
equally liable to this sudden and dreadful visitation, it might
naturally     be expected        that something more adequate, to
mitigate its effects,       would ere now have been made known
and adopted.
   In   the belief that nothing         of the kind has yet been done,
I  think it     a   duty incumbent on me to suggest, through
your medium, what will be found an infallible method in
stantly to extinguish the flames which have caught a female's
dress — which is as follows          : —
   The hands of any assistant must               be passed under all the
clothes, to the sufferer's         shift  ;  and then the whole clothes
are to be raised up all together,            and closed above   her head.
The   flames    will thus most certainly be extinguished.            This
may be done        in five or six seconds — in the time that        a per
son can stoop to the ground and rise up again, — and no
other method can be so ready, expeditious, and effectual.
   The sufferer will facilitate the business by folding her arms
closa before       her.     Should it happen that no person is at
hand to assist the sufferer, if she has presence of mind, she
may in most cases relieve herself by throwing her clothes
over her head and rolling or laying upon them.
   This method was always communicated to                     those   with
whom      I conversed      on   this subject, who all expressed the
greatest satisfaction        at   the probability, and confidence it
gave them, of being thereby, better than hitherto, enabled
to rescue fellow-creatures from agonizing              premature death ;
and    esteemed      it  a valuable addition to their small stock of
expedients.
   The extending this communication                to your  readers   may
be productive       of  the happiest     consequences to   them and the
community at large, and materially reduce the list              of human
afflictions,                   I am, sir,

 In   a note at the bottom of page 19 of your last number,           I
 preferred having the lower part of the tube only a twentieth
 of an inch in the bore, something on the principle of the
 marine barometer.         Upon a more minute investigation,         I
 do not find that this would answer the purpose so well as           I
 then thought, nor is it so good as the simple tube.        I  there
 fore beg your insertion of this for the information       of your
 numerous readers.       I  am, sir, 8cc.

    on the Dissection    of  the   Brain of a Person who died in
    sane.    By John     Taonton, Esq.
Xn the month of October          there were admitted on the books
 of the City   and  Finsbury Dispensaries    211 surgical patients.
                Cured or relieved         —     193

                                                211
    Since which time there have been admitted 969.
    A few days since, I was requested to examine the head          of
a person who had been insane for some months preceding
death, which took place suddenly, aetat. about 35.
    The general appearance of the body, which was robust,
indicated a high degree of health and strength.
    On removing the upper part of the scull, the dura mater
formed a considerable projection over the posterior arid su
perior part of the left hemisphere of the cerebrum, near the
course of the longitudinal sinus. On cutting through the ex

ternal lamina of that membrane,            a granulated substance ap
 peared, like a great number of small tumours adhering to the
dura mater, tunica arachnoidea, pia mater, and even to the
cortical substance of the brain, about two inches in length,
half  an inch in breadth, and nearly          half  an inch  thick.  The
other part of the dura mater was of the natural appearance*
   The arachnoid membrane was more opake than usual,
arising partly from lymph deposited on its under surface,
and partly from an effusion of a serous fluid between that
membrane and the pia mater.
   The cerebrum and cerebellum appeared natural, but the
lateral ventricles contained about four ounces of a straw-co-.
loured fluid   ; the   surface of these cavities was every where
covered with a layer      of coagulable lymph, having that aspe
rated   appearance peculiar to recent inflammation.                 Many
•mall hydatids were attached to different parts of the cho
roid plexus.
    Is it not highly probable that the symptoms of insanity
took place in consequence of the pressure produced by the
tumour     upon    the    brain  ? and also that       the inflammation,
was excited by the same cause?             If these positions be ad
mitted, Would not the antiphlogistic mode of treatment,
 carried to an extent agreeable to the apparent              stamina and
strength    of body, which         have been      rarely exceeded,   have
produced    a more favourable termination           ?
    Since I examined this case,          1 have heard from the medi
cal   gentlemen     who     dissected    the body of Simmons, the
murderer, that half an ounce of water was found in the la
teral ventricles   of  the head.       I believe it was never doubted
that this unhappy person laboured under a brutal and fero
cious insanity frbm bis infancy.

   1 78      Report upon a Memoir on the Nitrous Ether.
  2nd a specific smell, give to ethers a decided character,'
  which does not admit of their being confounded with other
  substances. We know but imperfectly, however, the differ
  ences which distinguish         them from each. other; and in par
  ticular, we have but an imperfect theory upon their produc
  tion. Messrs. Fourcroy and Vauquelin have indeed thrown
  a great     deal of light upon the production of the sulphuric
  ether ; but their explanation cannot be extended to that of
  some other ethers.           It was therefore important to resume
  the subject, in order to treat it in a general manner. This is
  whatM. Thenard undertook ; — In              the first memoir present
  ed to    the Institute,     he treats  of  the nitric ether.     He will
  afterwards proceed to the others ; and will examine why
  some 'acids have the property of producing ethers, while
  others are deprived of it.
      M.  Thenard      first brings under review the processes re
  commended by chemists for producing the. nitric ether.
 These are very discordant, and only have for their object the
 Etherized liquor, which we may obtain without any analysis
 of   the    gaseous products, nor       any   consideration    of  the cir
 cumstances        of  the operation,     unless we except the Dutch
 chemists, in a memoir which has particularly occupied                   M.
 Thenard's attention, at the end of his own.
      M.  Thenard beiran by distilling a mixture of equal weight
 of alcohol      and nitric acid, both being of a determinate con
 centration, in an apparatus          proper for separating the liquid
 products from the gaseous           ; a slight    heat is sufficient, and
 even    the action      becomes    so brisk that    it is soon necessary
 to check it.         He afterwards examined          the residue    of  the
 retort,     the liquid   produce, and the gases.         The residue was
 composed of nitrous acid, acetic acid, alcohol, water, and a
little of a matter the nature of which is not determined,
but which         chars easily.       The proportions       of these   sub
stances are established        by ingenious and precise means.          But
we are obliged to pass over the details necessary for a clear
idea of the numerous operations M. Thenard's experiments
require    ; — if we push the distillation       to dryness, the viscous
residue    contains    oxalic  acid,   and  probably malic acid.
     The liquor distilled, which has been regarded in laboratories
                                                                          as

fts   the       nitric ether,         is found to be composed                   of water, ni
trous acid, acetic acid, ether, and probably alcohol.
   The gaseous product has in particular required much pa
tience and dexterity, in order to separate it into different ele
ments; to assign to each of these elements the properties
which belong to it ; and to explain the differences which
result from the circumstances in which this gas is placed.
It was composed of the nitrous gas, azote, oxide of azote,
nitrous acid, carbonic acid, and of etherized gas, which it
was particularly necessary to detach from the rest, in order
to examine its properties. The author was led by these pre
liminary experiments                       following process, in order to
                                      to the
separate the pure                ether, and to examine                 it,
                                                          whether in its
liquid or gaseous state.
   He put into    retort   a              five hectogrammes                of alcohol, and
as much nitric acid. To                    the retort were successively adapted,
 by   means       of    glass tubes,        five long flasks        half- filled with wa
ter saturated with muriate                     of   soda.         The last had       tube,
                                                                                         a
which         opened        under      a     bell-glass,          filled   and destined            to
collect   the gaseous part.  All the flasks were surrounded
with      mixture of pounded glass and sea-salt, which was
          a
stirred from time to time. The operation began        means                          by
of    a   little fire  ;   but
                     soon became necessary to extinguish
                                 it                                                                ii,
and even to cool the retort.
  The liquid remaining in the retort was analogous to that
in the first-mentioned experiment.
   There- was found upon the surface in all the flasks yel                                 a
lowish liquid, and which, when collected, weighed 255
grammes.    That contained in the first flask was  mixture                           a
of alcohol, ether, acetic acid, and nitrous acid that con                        ;
tained      in   the other flasks was nitric ether, free from alcohol.
In this       state the      nitric ether  strong smell

nearly 48 parts- of water to dissolve                       it,   and yet the latter dis
solves     it   partly     as    we subsequently find.                     It   presents     in    a
strong degree the properties of combustible bodies. Never
theless, this ether strongly reddens turnsole tincture; and                                        it
owes this property to                 a   little    nitrous acid and acetic                  acid,

which it retains, and which we may separate from it by
means of lime.
  The volatility of the ether thus prepared is such, that the
tension it indicates is 0-73 metres, while that of the best
sulphuric ether in the same circumstances is no more than
0-46 metres, at 21° in the centigrade thermometer, and 0-76
metres of atmospheric pressure.     We see, therefore, that
at this temperature              and pressure     it   is at the limits   of   its ex
istence in the liquid state. .
   But if we can deprive the nitric ether of its acidity by
means of lime, it hastens to become acid again, whether we
distil   it,   leave   it   incontact with the air, or keep  in well      it
stopped        bottles.      This formation of acid also takes place
when we treat ether with        water, particularly   the tempe     if
rature    is   from 25° to 30° of Reaumur.    The author explains
the formation of the acid,      the reciprocal action of the
                                             by
principles which constitute ether, and which are there feebly
retained       by
            combination.
   M.  Thenard afterwards proceeds to the decomposition of
the nitric ether             by
                     heat, and he analyses the gases which
proceed from           it,
                  founding his calculations upon the most
exact data hitherto found               :   he obtains as       a   result, that 100
parts    of nitric      acid     is   composed        (laying aside fractions)      of

    From this he concludes what passes                     in
                                                       the reciprocal ac
tion of alcohol and nitric acid.            The oxygen of this acid                 is
combined      with   great part
                       a           of the  hydrogen of the alcohol, and
with very small quantity of its carbon.

gen, carbon, and oxygen.
   Supported by these results, M. Thenard discusses the pro
cesses which have been published for obtaining the nitric
ether ; and he shows that some          of them   are dangerous in the
execution                                          of the ether
              ; and that the whole furnish but a part
which may be obtained from the same quantity of ingre
dients, and only yield liquors more or less compound, in which
the nitric ether, the name they go by, in reality forms but a
part.
     The Dutch chemists      have made some interesting inquiries
respecting the nitric ether, or rather upon the gas obtained
by the action of the nitric acid upon alcohol.    They have,
however, resorted to an insufficient hypothesis, in order to
explain the curious facts they communicate. 1st, They have
regarded the gas in question as a combination of nitrous gas
and ether, while it is composed of gaseous ether, nitrous
gas, nitrous    acid, azotic gas,      gaseous oxide     of azot, carbo
nic acid, acetic acid, and, in short, of all substances
                                                   suscepti
ble of assuming the gaseous form in the variable circum
stances in which they exist. 2dly, They have supposed that
ether was an identical substance; so that they have entirely
neglected to analyse the nitric ether, and establish its distin
guishing characters. 3dly, A consequence of this opinion                 is,
that they have attributed to    pre-existing nitrous gas, phae-
                                   a
nomena which       arc owing to the decomposition            of   the   ni
tric ether.
  After having discussed the opinions r.nd experiments of
the Dutch chemists, M. Thenard concludes his memoir,
by remarking that he has only considered the products and
phenomena obtained in given proportion, and
                             a                        determiin
nate circumstances   the
                      ;  effects will be different under other
conditions which he purposes to introduce       but he has
                                                     :                  al
ready convinced himself,  that those he has used are most fa
vourable to the production of the nitric ether.
   M. Thenard.s memoir contains       great number of new
                                            a
facts, and very delicate analyses. He determines the nature
of   a substance very remarkable in its properties, and yet
he only presents     it   as the   beginning    of   a   laborious work

IVIarch        3, 10, and   1 7, (A.Marsden, esq., vice-president, in
the chair,) Dr. Richardson's geological observations on the
North of Ireland were read. The Doctor confined himselfto
what he conceived to be peculiar facts, or rather the local
features of the basaltic mountains in the counties of An
trim and Derry, dividing             the strata which appear in some     of
the most perfect columnar basaltes into sixteen divisions,
 of different depths. He traced the appearance and disap
 pearance, in several mountainous places, of those ridges
 called whin-dikes, and thence inferred that the whole basal
 tic  district, must have       originally    been one continuous mass,
 and that the separations or divisions, which now form ex
 tensive plains and valleys of several miles extent, must have
 been formed by some power in nature with which we are at
 present unacquainted.            Dr. Richardson thinks, neither the
 Neptunian nor Volcanic theory sufficient to explain the va
 ried phenomena of nature, which must be left to future ages
 and discoveries.

 by Dr. Herschel, commenced. The Doctor defined the
 terms of head, nucleus,            disk, coma, and tail j and directed
 his experiments       to   ascertain     the real dimensions of its nu
  cleus and disk.        These he performed by comparisons with
  wax-balls viewed in his ten feet reflector, the results of which
 he applied to the apparent magnitude of the comet's disk.

              Wernerian Natural History Society.            187
Royal Irish Academy ; and Professor Werner, of Freyberg,
were elected the first honorary members.       The following fo
reign members have been elected : — viz. Professor Karsten,
Berlin; Professor Klaproth, Berlin; M. Von Humboldt,
and   M. Von Buch, also of Berlin. M. F. Mohs, of Stiria j
M. Herden, M. Meuden,          and  M. Friesleben,  of Saxony.
    At   the last meeting   of the  Wernerian Natural    History
Society, Professor Jameson read a description of cotempo-
raneous or inclosed veins. He divided veins into two clas
ses.    The first class comprehend true veins, the second co-
temporaneous     or inclosed veins.  Some veins, he remarked,
excepting where the beds and strata are of very great thick
ness, traverse many different strata or beds ; and although
 we do not always observe them open at the surface of the
 earth, they invariably open at the surface of the fqrmation
 or series of formations they traverse : thus, the outgoing or
 opening of certain metalliferous veins that traverse clay-slate
 and mica-slate is sometimes covered by the second porphyry
 formation.     Cotemporaneous or inclosed veins are in general
 confined to individual beds or strata, and are fairly inclosed
 in them, or in other words wedge out in every direction in
 the bed or stratum in which they are contained.
     After detailing the various characters of true and cotem
  poraneous veins, the Professor next described the cotem
 poraneous veins that occur in the different great rock-for
 mations, beginning with granite, and ending with the new
  est flaetz trap formation.     He next explained the mode of
  formation of these veins. When describing the cotempo
  raneous veins that occur in gneiss, he remarked that cer
  tain varieties of venigenous gneiss bear a striking resem
  blance to granite, and hence have been frequently confound
  ed with that rock.       This led him to point out the cha
  racters   by which true granite veins are distinguished from
  veins of granitic gneiss. As connected with this part of the
  subject, he examined the facts on which theHuttonian theory
  of granite is founded; and proved by a detail of his examina
  tion of the appearances described by Dr. Hutton, Professor
   Playfair and others, that the supposed granite veins shooting
                                                             from

   from     subjacent granite into superincumbent                rocks, are
   merely veins of granitic gneiss accidentally in contact with
   granite.

   Mr. John Ayrton Paris, of Caius College, Cambridge,
and fellow of the Royal Medical Society, Edinburgh, has
now in the press, A Compendium of Modern Chemistry, in,
the Latin Language ; — a small work intended as \\\tjidus
Achates of the medical as well as chemical philosopher. It
treats not only of the principal subjects in chemistry, but
unfolds the processes by which the different compounds of
the London and Edinburgh pharmacopoeias               are prepared,
and the theories upon which such operations are founded.
The analyses also of animal and vegetable bodies are as fully
given as the prescribed limits of a compendium will allow. —
This work will also afford easy instructions for the disciple of
the Stahlean school to become the proselyte of Lavoisier. —
The language in which it is written, will, it is hoped, render
it no inconsiderable assistant to those desirous of writing or
speaking medical Latin.        And if it be remembered that no
such publication has appeared in the chemical department
subsequent to Boerhaave, the hope may not be presump
tuous.
           CULTIVATION       OF INDIGO       IN FRANCE.
   A proces-verlal   of the municipality of Lille, in the       de
partment    of Vaucluse,     has lately    stated the success of   a
plantation of indigo, executed on a large scale and in the
the open air at an estate belonging to M. Icard de Bataglini,
an agriculturalist.    It is stated in the Proces-verbal, that
after an attentive examination      of the indigo produced, the
 commissioners were of opinion that this precious plant may
be naturalized in the department, and become a principal
 source of its riches.
                         MISCELLANEOUS.
   New Method of taking Stains       out   of Linen. — Lemon-juice
 has generally been employed for this purpose: — but a German
journal devoted to subjects of rural ceconomy, and edited
by M. Schnee, gives another more ceconomical, but not
less certain, method, by means       of  aqua fortis.   One or two
 drops arc sufficient for taking out a large spot of ink with
out damaging the linen : it is only necessary previously to

      Remedies     against tlie Epidemy in Cattle. — It has been
   long known that nettles form an excellent food for cattle,
   and that they increase the milk of cows.            This plant is also
   an   excellent    remedy against     epidemical diseases, which
  are frequently the effect of        bad food in the stable.             In
  Sweden the salutary effects of nettles are particularly con
  spicuous, where they are administered to the horned cattle
  regularly every spring in great quantities.
      M. Scheidlin, botanist to the court of Wirtemberg, has
  proved by a multitude of experiments that Angelica (Ange
  lica   sativa   hortensis,   Linn.) is   an   excellent     preservative
  against cattle epidemies.      He bruized the roots of this plant,
  and gave a handful to each cow, morning, noon, and night,
 along with its ordinary food.           Cows ate it greedily, and
 were not attacked with the disease.           He   also mixed     it witb
 the water they drank.
     The   leaves   and roots   of Angelica dried     and reduced      into
 powder, and strewed over bread, or other food, have the
 same virtues.       This root grows spontaneously in shady and
 humid      places, and it may be planted with good effect               in
 case   of  need.
     Mastic    for resisting the Action of Fire and Water. — The
 following directions are given in the foreign journals, for
 preparing a composition of this description : — Take half a
pint of milk, mix with it an equal quantity of vinegar, so
as to coagulate the milk ; separate the curds from the whey,
mix    the latter with the whites   of four or  five eggs, after having
beat them well up.          The mixture of       these two substances
being complete,        add   quick-lime   to them     which     has been
passed through a sieve ; make the whole into a               thick   paste
to be    of  the consistency of putty, when you         use it.
     If this  mastic is carefully applied to broken bodies or to
fissures of any kind, and dried properly afterwards, it resists
water and fire. M. Skogo, a merchant of Carlskrona,

                     NAUTICAL INVENTION.
   A  gentleman has lately invented a very simp'e and inge
nious method by which a vessel without any person on board
can be directed with very considerable accuracy in a given
course.      The application of this invention to fire-ships
would be of vast utility: and that this may be judged of with
out (for obvious reasons) giving a public description of the
means by which it is effected, the model used in the first
experiments, which we understand were completely satisfac
tory, may be seen at Mr. Thomas Jones's, mathematical,

XLI.      gExperiments     on the Influence     of Time,     as a Chemical
   Agent, in depriving an Elastic Fluid of its Elasticity,
   In a Letter from M. Biot to M. Berthollet*.
X had lately occasion to converse with that excellent ob
server M. de Marty, upon the subject of several experiments,
with which       he has been a long time occupied, and I have
received    his permission to make them public.
   The experiments which I shall first mention, have for
their object the influence of time upon the exercise of che
mical actions, when they tend to deprive an elastic fluid of
its elasticity   :
    1.   Into   a  glass flask, closed with a ground stopper,
M. de Marty introduced a certain quantity of oxygen gas
and a certain quantity of rain water boiled or not boiled.
There may be any proportions of water and gas. Supposing
that there is but a small quantity of water ; by shaking this
mixture for some minutes the water will absorb a certain
quantity of gas, as may be ascertained upon opening the
flask into a tub full of water.           But after having shaked it
and opened      it several times, the water contained in the flask
will soon      <finish by being saturated,          and    will absorb no
more.
    Things being thus disposed, close up the flaskiand place
it out of the reach of the sun ; observe at the same time the
barometer and thermometer            : then after two or three days
of rest, shake the flask again and open it under the water,
and you will see the latter ascend a little : close the flask,
return it to its place and renew the shaking from time to
time ; you will find that it has every             time absorbed     a" new
quantity of gas.         This  effect will appear so much the more
 striking,   the longer     time it has been since you last opened
the flask, and       in this case the water of the tub will rise
much more than          if you had opened     it within     a few days.
    I  have witnessed these effects at        M.   Marty's house.        He
 uncorked     under water, in my presence, a flask which had
been closed upwards of a year and a half, and which con-

 Vol. 30. No.      119.   April 1808.                   N            tained

1 94    On the Influence   of Time,  as a Chemical   Agent, &fc.
tained oxygen gas with a small quantity of water. When
the flask was opened in the tub, the water of the latter rose
in a very remarkable manner, and the absorption appeared to
me to     be   equal to at least half the volume of the water
contained in the flask before we opened it ; the barometer
and thermometer were nearly at the same height as at the
moment      of introduction ; the temperature of the water of
the tub was also the same.
    It  seems    therefore from this experiment, that the same
mass of water which at first could only absorb a certain
volume of oxygen gas, absorbed a considerable volume of
it after   some    time ; whence it should seem, that in the first
case the air was but feebly combined,         and in some measure
interposed between the particles of the water. But the
prolonged action of the liquid, diminishing more and more
the elasticity of the gas, and contracting it as it were by
 degrees,    made    it enter further forward into the    sphere  of
 attraction    of its particles, which    has   rendered  the water
 susceptible of absorbing a new quantity of gas.
    2. The same thing takes place relative to hydrogen gas,
 which I also witnessed at M. Marty's. The absorption, in
 this case, was equally strong, and         M. Marty finds by his
 experiments that the volume absorbed         is more considerable,
 and the absorption more speedy,       with this gas than with oxy
 gen gas.       He found, also, that in two years the volume of
 gas absorbed was not equal to the volume of the water.
    3. Water already charged with oxygen is more proper for
 absorbing hydrogen, and vice versa : this is analogous to
 what was remarked by Messrs. Humboldt and Gay Lussac.
 M. Marty's experiments, however, have the advantage of
 having been made in close vessels.
    4. The absorption is the more considerable in proportion
 as the volume of water is greater.
    3. These effects do not take place with azotic gas : after
 once shaking the water for some time with this gas, it does
 not absorb an atom more, however long time we leave it in
 contact.
     6.  If  we put water charged with azotin contact with hy
 drogen     or  oxygen gas, it absorbs these gases without aban
                                                             doning

                       Experiments             for    investigating,       &c.
    doning the azot it contains.                          If   we think there has been a
    change, it is, in fact, because a little azot escapes at the
    commencement of the absorption of the hydrogen or oxy
    gen ; but shake the water and the gases together, the whole
    azot which was previously interposed in the water will en
    ter into it and interpose itself as formerly, independently of
    the hydrogen or oxygen gas, which it has beside absorbed.
       7- The preceding result is so correct that we may exactly
    analyse the atmospheric air by the simple absorbent action                                       of
    water.   For this purpose it is sufficient that the water has
    been previously impregnated with azot ; it then absorbs
    precisely 21 hundredths of the atmospheric air put in con
    tact with     as   sulphuret would do. M. Marty asserts
                       it,         a
    that the water thus employed in great quantities, in order
    that the operation may be more expeditious,   an excellent                   is
    eudiometer, and that he used    as such frequently. If we
                                                          it
    have no azot at hand, we may impregnate the water with
    this gas      by
                 shaking   with atmospheric air, and leaving
                                       it                        for                            it
    some time in contact with this air      this means     absorbs by
                                                                                      it it

    periment, from absorbing in time, that of the air we mean
    to analyse. M. Marty also uses this absorbent property of
    water to ascertain                          given oxygen gas does or does not
                                       it if

    with azot      does not absorb               it   completely.

              XXV. Of the                   Action      of     the second Surface.
    As   rings are formed when two glasses are laid upon each
    other,   it but reasonable to expect that the two surfaces at
                  is
    least which are placed together should have an immediate effect
                                                      N   2                                     upon

l9S               Experiments      for  investigating
upon them, and so much the more, as it has been ascer
tained that the first surface assists only by permitting light
to pass into the body of the glass. Some of the experi
ments that have been instituted for examining the action                 of
the first surface will equally serve for investigating that              of
the second.
   The lens already       used with a strong emery scratch being
again placed    on  the  mirror,    but with the injured side down
wards, I found that the rings, when brought under the
scratch, were not distorted j they had only a black mark of
the same shape as the scratch across them.
   The lens with a scabrous side was also          placed     again upon
the mirror, but with the highly polished            side upwards.        In
this position the scabrousness of the lowest surface occa
sioned great irregularity among the rings, which were in
dented and broken wherever the little polished holes that
make up a scabrous surface came near them ; and if by
gently lifting the lens a strong contact was prevented, the
colours of the rings were         likewise extremely disfigured and
changed.
   As we have now seen that a polished defect upon the
second surface will affect the figure of the rings that are
under them, it will        remain to be determined whether such
defects   do  really distort them by some modification they
give to the    rays of light in their passage through them, or
whether they only represent the rings as deformed, because
we  see them through a distorted medium.               For although the
scabrousness did not sensibly affect the figure of the rings
when it was on the first surface, we may suppose the little
polished holes     to have a much stronger effect           in distorting
the appearance     of the rings when they are close to them.
The following experiment will entirely clear up this point.
   Over the middle of a 22-inch double convex lens I drew
a strong line with a diamond, and gave it a polish after
wards that it might occasion an irregular             refraction.    .1 his
being prepared,      I laid a slip   of  glass upon   a  plain metalline
mirror,   and   placed    the lens with       the polished line down
wards upon the slip of glass.           This arrangement has been
shown    to  give   two    sets of   rings,     When I examined the
                                                                 primary

                the Cause     of coloured concentric Rings.          197
 primary sel,     a   strong disfiguring of the rings was visible ;
 they had the appearance of having been forced asunder, or
 swelled out, so as to be much broader one way than an
 other.    The rings of the secondary set had exactly the
 same defects, which being strongly marked, could not be
 mistaken.       The centres of the two sets, as usual, were of
 opposite colours, the first being black, the second white ;
 and all those defects that were of one colour in the first set,
were of the opposite colour in the second. When, by the
usual method, I changed the colours of the centres of the
 rings, making that of the primary white and of the secon
dary black, the defects in both sets were still exactly alike,
 and as before ; except that they bad also undergone the like
 transformation of colour, each having assumed its opposite.
It  remains now        only to show that this experiment is deci
sive; for by the established course of the rays we saw the
 secondary set of rings when it had a white centre by the
 transmitted rays marked 1, 2, 4, 5, in figure 13; and when
it had   a black      one, by the reflected rays 6, 7, 2, 4, 5, of
the same figure ; but in neither of these two cases did the
rays come       through the defective part        of the  lens in their
 return to the eye.
    This experiment proves more than             we might    at first be
aware    of; for it      does    not only establish that the second
 surface, when properly combined with a third surface, has
a  modifying power whereby it can interrupt the regularity
of the rings, but also one whereby it contributes to their
formation     ;  for,   if it can give an irregular figureito them by
transmitting       its irregularly modified rays, it follows, that
when these rays are regularly modified it will be the cause of
the regular figure of the rings.          Nay, iL proves more; for if
it modifies the figure of the rings by transmission, it modi
fies them no less by reflection ;         which may be seen by fol
lowing    the    course    of  the  rays 6, 7, 2, 4, 5 ; for as they do
not pass through the defective place of the rens, they can
only receive their modification from it by reflection.              This
opens a field of view to us that leads to the cause of all these
intricate phaenomena, of which in a second part of this
paper   I shall avail myself.

198                      Experiments      for    investigating
        XXVI. Of the Action of llie third Surface.
   When a double convex lens is laid upon a plain metalline
mirror that happens to have an emery scratch in its surface,
we see it as a black line under the rings that are formed over
them.    This shows, that when a defect from want of polish
has not a power to reflect light in an irregular manner, it
cannot distort the rings that are formed upon it.
   When I laid a good 21 -feet object glass upon a plain slip
that had some defects in its surface, the rings, in every part
of    the object glass that was brought over ihem, were always
disfigured ; which proves that a reflection from a defective
third surface has a power of forming distorted rings, and
that consequently a reflection from one that is perfect must
Lave a power of forming rings without distortion,                                when it
is combined with a proper second surface.
     When        the defective slip    of glass, with        a   perfect lens upon
it,   was placedupon          a    metalline mirror,      I    saw the secondary
set affected        by
                distortions of the rings that were                              perfectly
like those in the  primary set which proves that
                                             ;                              a   polished
defect   the third surface will give modifications
            in                                                              to the rays
that form the rings           by
                        transmission as well as                        by   reflection.
XXVII.           The Colour    of   the      refecting and transmitting             Sur
                          faces    is   ofno consequence.
 I      laid seven 54-inch double convexlenses upon seven
coloured pieces of plain glass. The colours of the glasses
were those which are given                       by
                                   prism, namely, violet,
                                                      a
indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red. The rings
reflected        from each    of   these      glasses were       in   every      respect
alike   ;   at least      so far that   I     could have   a     black,   a   white,   a
red, an orange,   yellow, a green, or  blue centre with
                                          a                a
every one of them, according to the degree of pressure                               I
used.       The                                may be admit
                   lenses being very transparent,                it
ted that the colours of the glasses seen ihrough them would
in some degree mix with the colours of the rings; but the
action      of the   cause that gives the             rings was not in the least
affected      by   that circumstance.
 I  saw the rings also by direct transmission through all
the coloured glasses except   dark red, which stopped so
                                             a
                                                   much

                   the Cause       of coloured concentric Rings.                        199
much          light    that    I    could     not        perceive    them.     The co
lour     of          in this way, coming directly to the eye,
              the glasses,
gave a strong tinge to the centres of the rings, so that in
stead of a pure white I had a blueish white, a greenish white,
and so of the rest ; but the form of the rings was no less
perfect on that account.
             XXVIII. Of the             Action of the fourth Surface.
   We         already seen that a set of rings may be com
             have
pletely formed   by reflection from a third surface, without
the introduction of a fourth : this, at all events, must prove
that such a surface is not essential togthe formation of rings ;
but     not only in direct transmission, but also when two.
        as
setsof rings are to be seen, one of which may be formed by
transmission, this fourth surface must be introduced, 1 have
ascertained by the           following experiments how far the                        same
has any share          in the formation of rings.
   In direct transmission, where the light comes from                                   be
low,            surface will take the part which is acted by
         the fourth
the first, when rings are seen reflected from a metalline
mirror. Its office therefore will be merely to afford an en
trance to the rays of light into the substance of the subja
cent glass ; but when that light is admitted through the
first, second, and third surfaces, the fourth takes the office
of a reflector, and sends it back towards the point of con
tact.        It will not required to examine this reflection,
                               be
since the light thus turned back again         with respect to      is,
the point of contact, in the same situation in which       was                     it
after its entrance through the first surface when   proceeded             it
to the same point    but when two sets of rings are to be
                          ;
formed        by
           rays, either coming through this point directly
towards the fourth surface, or                      by
                                   reflection from the same
point towards the place where the secondary rings are to be
seen,   will then be necessary to examine whether this sur
         it
                                     or whether these rings,
face has any share in their formation,
being already completely formed, are only reflected        to                    byit
the eye.   With view to this,
                         a       selected   certain polished
                                                  I                 a
defect       in   the surface      of   a   piece   of coach-glass,          and   when
                                              N   4                          a   26-inch

S0©                  Experiments        for   investigating
1 26-inch lens was laid upon                 it,
                                   the rings of the set pro                     it
duced were much distorted.     The lens was then put upon                              a
perfect slip of glass, and both together were laid upon the
defective place of the coach-glass.    The rings of the secon
dary set reflected       by
                         were nevertheless as perfect as those
                          It it
of the primary set.     occurred to me that these rings might
possibly be reflected from the lowest surface of the perfect
slip of glass, especially as   lifting  by
                                        up from the coach-
                                                      it
glass I    still continued         to see both sets.          To clear up this
point, therefore,    took away the slip, and turning the
                      I                                                              de
fective place of the coach -glass downwards, produced                             a   set
of perfect rings between the lens and the upper surface of
the coach-glass, and brought     into such situation that
                                             it               a                        a
secondary set must be reflected from the defective place of
the lowest surface.           This being obtained, the rings of this
set were again as well formed and as free from distortions as
those of the primary set.
   Upon    aplain metalline              mirror       I   laid down two lenses,
one   aplano-convex, the other      plano-concave, both of
                                                  a
2-9 inches focus, and having the plain side upwards. When
two 21 -inch double convex glasses were laid upon them,
the secondary sets of both the combinations were of equal
size, and perfectly like their primary sets    which proves       ;
that the refraction of the fourth surface   either not at allis
concerned,       or at least has so little an effect                  in   altering the
size of the rings that   cannot be perceived.
                              it
   The result of the foregoing experiments, relating to the
action of the several surfaces, is,
 I.   That only two of them are essential to the formation
of concentric rings.
   II. That these two must be of certain regular construc
                                               a
tion, and so     as to   form     a   central contact.
  III.    That   the rays from one side or the other, must either
pass through the point of contact, or through one of the sur
faces about the same point to the other to be reflected from it.
  IV. And        that in all these
                               cases    set of rings will be
                                                      a
formed, having  their common   centre in the place where the
two surfaces touch each other.
                                                                      XXIX.      Con-

XXIX.       Considerations that rel-ateto the Cause           of the Forma
                        tion of concentric Rings.
    It is perfectly evident that the phaenomena of concentric
rings    must     have    an    adequate      cause,    either in the very
nature or motion of the rays of light, or in the modifica
tions that are given to them by the two essential surfaces
that act upon them at the time of the formation of the rings.
    This   seems to     reduce     the cause we are        looking for  to an
alternative that may be determined ; for if it can be shown
that a disposition of the rays of light to be alternately re
flected and transmitted cannot account for the phenomena
which this hypothesis is             to explain, a proposition of ac
counting      for  them    by    modifications       that may be proved,
even on the very principles of Sir I. Newton to have an ex
istence, will find      a ready    admittance.        I  propose, therefore,
now     to give some arguments,             which will remove an obsta
 cle to the investigation of the          real cause of the formatien of
 the concentric rings ; for after             the very plausible supposi
 tion of the alternate fits, which agrees so wonderfully well
 with a number of facts that have been related, it will hardly
 be attempted,       if  these should be set aside, to ascribe           some
 other inherent property            to  the rays     of light, whereby we
 might account for them           ; and thus we shall be at liberty to
 turn our thoughts to a cause that may be found in the mo
 difications arising from the action of the surfaces which
 have been proved to be the only essential ones in the forma
 tion of rings.
  XXX.       Concentric Rings cannot le formed by an alternate
         Reflection and Transmission of the Rays of Light.
     One of      the  most simple methods of obtaining a set of
  concentric rings is to lay a convex lens on a plain metalline
  mirror; but in this           case   we can have no transmission          of
  rays, and therefore we cannot have an alternate reflection
  and transmission of them.                If to get over this objection it
  should     be said that, instead          of transmission, we ought to
  substitute absorption       ;  since those rays which in glass would
                                                                          have

  202                     Experiments      for investigating
  have      been    transmitted will be absorbed by the metal, we
  may admit the elusion             ; it ought however to have been made
  a part     of the hypothesis.
  XXXF. Alternate Fits of                 easy  Reflection and easy Trans
      mission,     if  tlwy exist, do not exert themselves according
      to various Thicknesses of thin Plates of Air.
      In   the   following experiment, I placed a plain well po
 lished piece of glass yd inches long, and 2-3 thick, upon a
 plain metalline mirror of the same length with the glass ;
 and in order to keep the mirror and glass at a distance from
 each      other,    I    laid between them, at one end,             a narrow
 strip     of such       paper     as we    commonly    put between prints.
 The thickness of that which I used was the 6-10th part of
 an inch ; for 128 folds of them laid together would hardly
 make up two-tenths.                   Upon the glass I put a 39-inch
 double convex lens              ;  and having exposed     this combination
 to a proper light, I saw two complete sets of coloured rings.
     In this arrangement, the rays which convey the secondary
 set of rings to the eye must pass through a thin wedge of
 air   ;  and  if   these     rays    are endowed    with permanent     fits of
 easy reflection,          and easy transmission,      or absorption,     their
exertion,       according to        Sir I. Newton, should be repeated at
every different thickness of the plate of air, which amounts
to the i,a^tt part of an inch, of which he says " Haec est
crassitudo aeris in primo annulo obscuro radiis ad perpendi-
culum incidentibus exhibito,                qua parte is annulus obscuris-
simus est."          The length of the thin wedge of air, reckoned
from the line of contact, to the beginning of the interposed
strip of paper,          is   5-2 inches, from which we calculate that
it will     have the above-mentioned            thickness at   -Jr of an inch
from the contact            ; and    therefore at   ^   -fr, -J,, <&, ^n ±±,
&c.      we shall     have the thickness        of air  between    the mirror
and glass, equal to             ,,B'oo6,   rrtW.     rrfonri" -rrtWi
                                                                           &c
of which the same author says that they give crassitudines
aeris in omnibus annulis Iucidis, qua parte illi lucidissiroi
sunt."        Hence        it follows that, according to the above hy
pothesis,       the   rings of the secondary set which extended
                                                                          over

                 the Cause       of coloured concentric Rings.            203
 over a space of • 14 of an inch, should suffer more than seven
 interruptions of shape and colour in the direction of the
 wedge of air.
     In order to ascertain whether such an effect                had any ex
 istence,     I  viewed      the secondary set of rings upon every part
 of  the glass-plate, by moving the convex lens from one end
 of   it gradually to the other ; and my attention being parti
 cularly directed to the 3d, 4th, and 5th rings, which were
 extremely distinct, I saw them retain their shape and colour
all the time without the smallest alteration.
    The     same experiment was             repeated  with  a piece  of plain
 glass instead        of   the metalline     mirror, in order  to give room
 for    the   fits   of   easy transmission, if they existed, to exert
 themselves;         but the result was still the same ; and the con
 stancy of the brightness and colours of the rings of the
secondary set, plainly proved that the rays of light were not
affected by the thickness of the plate of air through which

XXXII.         Alternate Fits of easy Reflection and            easy  Trans-
    mission,       if  tliey exist, do not exert themselves according
    to various Thicknesses of thin Plates of Glass.
    I  selected a well polished            plate of coach-glass J 7 inches
long,     and about 9 broad.             Its thickness at one end was 33,
and at the other 31             two-hundredths of an inch ; so that in
its whole length it differed -pj-^ of an inch in thickness. By
measuring many other parts of the plate I found that it was
very regularly tapering from one end to the other.                       This
plate, with         a  double convex lens of 55 inches laid upon it,4
being placed upon a small metalline mirror, and properly
exposed to the light, gave me the usual two sets of rings.
In   the secondary set, which was the object               of my attention,
I counted twelve rings, and estimated the centraJ space be
tween them to be about I? times as broad as the space taken
up by the 12 rings on either side; the whole of the space
taken up may therefore be reckoned equal to the breadth of 40
rings of a mean size : for the 12 rings, as usual, were gra
dually contracted in breadth              as they receded  from the centre;
and, by a m»asure               of   the   whole space    thus taken up,    I
                                                                       found

804                     Experiments      for   investigating
found that the breadth             of    a ring   of   a mean size was about
the 308th part of an inch.
   Now, according to Sir I. Newton's calculation of the ac
tion of the fits of easy reflection and easy transmission in
thick glass plates, an alternation from a reflecting to a trans
mitting fit requires a difference of , J      part of an inch
                                                                                     in in

                      calculation this difference took place
the glass plate that was used at every 80th part of an inch
of its whale length    the 12 rings, as well as the central
                            :
colour of the secondary set, should consequently have been
broken      the exertion of the fits at every 80th part of an
             by
inch and from
       ;                  the space over       which    these rings extended,
which was about           -13    inch,   we    find that there must have
been more than ten              such interruptions or breaks in           a    set   of
which      the 308th part was plainly to be distinguished. But
when   I    drew the glass plate gently over the small mirror,
keeping the secondary set of rings in view,     found             I             their
shape and colour always completely well formed.
   This experiment was also repeated with small plain glas3   a
instead of the metalline mirror put under the large plate. In
this manner   still gave the same result, with no other dif
                  it
ference but that only six rings could be distinctly seen in
the secondary set, on account of the inferior reflection of
the subjacent glass.

     orof Air.                                 ..
  The experiment           I     am now to relate was at first intended
to be reserved for the second part of this paper, because                            it
properly belongs to the subject of the flection of the rays                          of
light, which     not at present under consideration
                  is                                    but as        ;              it
particularly opposes   the admission  of alternate fits of easy
reflection and easy transmission of these rays in their pas
sage   through         plates   of air or glass,         by  proving that their
assistancein the formation of rings                is   not required, and also
throws light upon    subject that has
                            a                          at different times been

               the Came        of coloured concentric Rings.                 805
considered by some of our most acute experimentalists,                          I
have used it at present, though only in one of the various
arrangements, in which I shall have occasion to recur to it
hereafter.
    Sir  I. Newton        placed a concave glass         mirror    at double its
focal length from          a  chart, and observed that the reflection of
a beam of light admitted into a dark room, when thrown
upon this mirror, gave               "  four or five concentric irises or
rings of colours like rainbows *."                   He accounts for them
by   alternate    fits of    easy  reflection   and   easy transmission ex
erted   in their passage through the glass-plate of the con
cave    mirror f-
    The duke de Chaulnes concluded from his own experi
ments     of  the same phenomena,             " that    these coloured rings
depended       upon the first surface of              the mirror, and that
the second surface, or that which reflects                     them after they
had passed the first, only served to collect them and throw
them upon the pasteboard, in a quantity sufficient to make
them visiblej."
    Mr. Brougham, after having considered what the tw«
authors     I  have    mentioned had done, says, " that upon the
whole there appears every reason to believe that the rings are
formed by the first surface out of the light which, after re
 flection from the second surface, is scattered, and passes on
 to the chart §."
     My own experiment is as follows.                  I  placed a highly po
 lished 7-feet mirror, but of               metal instead       of glass, that I
 might not have two surfaces,              at the distance      of 14 feet from
 a white screen, and through a              hole   in  the middle of it one-
  tenth of an       inch in diameter        I  admitted     a beam    of  the sun
  into my dark room, directed so as to fall perpendicularly on
  the mirror.       In this arrangement the whole screen remained
  perfectly free from light, because the focus of all the rays
  which came to the mirror was by reflection thrown back
  into the hole through which they entered.                      When all was
  duly prepared,        I  made an assistant strew some hair-powdep
           * Newton.s Optics, p. 265.

    with a puff into the beam of light, while         I  kept my atten
   tion fixed upon the screen. As soon as               the hair-powder
   reached the beam       of light   the screen   was suddenly covered
   with   the   most beautiful      arrangement of concentric circles
   displaying all the brilliant colours, of the rainbow.         A great
  variety    in the  size of  the  rings  was  obtained by making the
   assistant strew the powder into the beam at a greater distance
   from the mirror ; for the rings contract by an increase of the
  distance and dilate on a nearer approach of the powder.
      This experiment is so simple, and points out the general
  causes    of the rings which    are here produced in so plain a man
  ner, that we may confidently say they arise from the flection of
  the rays of light on the particles of the floating powder, mo
  dified by the curvature of the reflecting surface of the mirror.
      Here     we have    no interposed plate of glass of a given
  thickness between one surface and another, that might pro
  duce the colours by reflecting some rays of light and trans
  mitting others ; and if we were inclined to look upon the
  distance or the particles of the floating powder from the
  mirror     as plates of air, it would not he possible to assign
  any certain thickness to them, since these particles may be
  spread in the beam       of light over a considerable space, and
  perhaps none of them will be exactly at the same distance
 from the mirror.
     I  shall not enter into     a  further analysis of this experi
 ment,     as the  only purpose    for  which it is given in this place
 is to show that the principle of thin or thick plates, either
 of air or glass, on which         the   rays might alternately exert
their fits of easy reflection and easy transmission, roust be
 given up, and that the fits themselves of course cannot be
 shown to have any exisistence.
•
                          XXXIV.       Conclusion.
     It  will hardly    be necessary   to say,  that all the theory re
lating to the size of the parts of natural bodies and their in
terstices, which Sir I. Newton has founded upon the exis
tence of fits of easy reflection and easy transmission, exerted
differently,     according to the different thickness of the thin
plates of which he supposes the parts of natural bodies to
                                                               consist,

consist, will     remain unsupported ; for if the above-men
tioned fits have no existence, the whole foundation on which
the theory of the size of such parts is placed, will be taken
away, and we shall consequently have to look out for a
more firm basis on which a similar edifice may be placed.
That there is such a one we cannot doubt, and what I have
aJready    said   will     lead     us   to look for it      in the   modifying
power which the two surfaces, that have been proved to be
essential to the formation of rings, exert upon the rays of
light.    The    second       part   of this paper, therefore, will enter
into an examination            of the various modifications            that light
receives    in  its    approach to, entrance into, or passage by,
differently disposed surfaces or bodies ; in order to discover,
if possible, which of them may be the immediate cause of
the coloured rings that are formed between glasses.

            Member        of   the French Institute,          &c. &c.
                             [Continued from p. 158.]
X.    -L he science       of machines in general is therefore                  re
duced to the following question                :
    "  Being acquainted with                the    virtual    movement    of  any
system of    bodies      (that is to say, that movement which each
                                       if
 of these bodies would take it were free) ,find the real move
ment which      will    take place the instant          following,    on account
 of  the reciprocal action           of   bodies,    by considering them such
 as they exist in nature,          i.e.   as endowed      with all  tke inertness
 common to     all   the particles        of matter."
    XI.   Now,      as   this question evidently contains the whole
 of mechanics, we must, in order to proceed with precision,
 go back to the first laws which nature observes in the com
 munication of movements.                 We may       reduce them in general
 to two, which are the following                 :
       FUNDAMENTAL LAWS 0F EQUILIBRIUM, AND MOTION.
    First Law. — Action               and Reaction are always equal and
 contrary.
                                                                             This

MS                          On Machines in General.
      This law consists in this, that              every   body which changes
its     state     of    repose    or    uniform         and rectilinear motion,
never does            so except by the influence or action                          of some
other body, upon which it impresses, at the same time, a
quantity of motion equal and directly opposite to that
which it receives from it ; that is to say, that the velocity
it assumes the instant afterwards is the force resulting from
that which this other body impresses upon       and from that      it,
which      would have had without this last force.
            it                                                Every
body  therefore resists its change  of state    and this resistance,
                                                             ;
which     called vis inertia,
            is                    always equal and directly op
                                             is
posite  to  the  quantity    of motion       receives,  it e. to the          i.
quantity of motion which combined with that which                                           it
had immediately before the change, produces, as the result,
the quantity of motion which       should really have im
                                                   it
mediately afterwards. This   also expressed  issaymg, that               by
in the reciprocal action of bodies,                        the quantity        of mo
tion lost        by
             the one   always gained
                                 is                          by   the    others, in the
same time and in the same ratio.
      Second Law. — When two hard lodies                                act        upon each
other,      ly   shock or pressure, e. in virtue
                                             i.   their inpene-     of
trabiUty,  tlieir relative velocity, immediately after the red'
procal action,      always null.
                       is
      In
       fact, we constantly observe, that      two hard bodies if
give     shock
           a    to each  other, their velocities, immediately
after the shock, estimated perpendicularly to their common
Surface at the point of contact, are equal, in the same wav
as    if   they were        drawn       by   inextensible         wires, or pushed
by incompressible             rods  j   their velocities, estimated                     in the
ratio      of this wire or rod, would necessarily                 be equal     :     whence
it    follows that their relative velocity,                  i.   e. that          by   which
they approach or recede from each other,                            is    in   every case
null at the first instant.
      From                         easy to draw the laws of
                these two principles         it   is
the shock of hard bodies, and consequently to conclude the
two other secondary principles, the use of which   continual                  is
in mechanics, viz.
     That the intensity of
      1
      .                                  the shock, or        of   the action which
                                                                                            is

  is exercised    between    two bodies which meet, does not de
  pend upon their absolute movements,           lut solely upon their
  relative movements.        2. That the force or quantity of move
  ment which they exercise upon         each  other, by the shock, is
  always directed perpendicularly         to tlieir common surface at
  the point of contact.
     XII. Of the two fundamental             laws,    ihejirst generally
  agrees    with all  the bodies    of nature,   as  well as the two se
  condary      laws which     we have seen ; and the second          solely
  regards hard bodies ; but as those which are not hard have
  different degrees of elasticity, we generally refer the laws of
  their movement to those of the hard bodies, which we take
  for  a term    of comparison, i.    e. we regard the elastic      bodies
  as composed      of an  infinity of hard corpuscles separated by
  small compressible rods, to which we attribute all the
  elastic virtue of these bodies ; so that, properly speaking, we
  do not consider in nature any other than bodies endowed
   with different moving forces. We shall follow this method
'
   as the    simplest : we shall therefore reduce the question to
   the investigation of the laws observed by hard bodies, and
   shall afterwards make some applications of them to cases
   in which bodies        are  endowed with        different degrees     of
   elasticity.
      XIII. This essay upon machines not being a treatise
   upon mechanics, my object is not to explain in detail, nor
   to prove the fundamental laws I have related ; these are
   truths which all the world          knows,    as   to   which they are
   generally agreed,     and which are most strongly manifested
   in all the phenomena        of nature. This      is sufficient  for my
   object, which is merely to draw from these laws a simple
   and exact method for finding the state of rest or of move
   ment which results from them in any given system of bo
   dies, i. e. to present the same laws under a form which
   may facilitate their application to each particular case.
      XIV. Let us suppose therefore any system of hard bo
   dies, the virtual given movement of which is changed by
   their reciprocal action into another which we wish to find ;
   and  in order   to embrace     the question   in all  its extent, let us
   suppose that the movement may either change suddenly, or

210                           On Machines in General.
                                             t
vary by insensible degrees : finally, as fixed points or some
obstacles may be met with, let us consider them as they
really are in fact, that is to say, as ordinary bodies of them
selves, making part of the system proposed, but firmly ar
rested in the spot where they are placed.
   XV. In order to attain the solution of this problem, let
us first observe, that, all the parts of the system being sup
posed perfectly  hard,  i. e. incompressible and inextensible,
we may visibly, whatever it may be, regard it as composed
of an infinity of hard corpuscles, separated from each other
either by small incompressible rods, or by small inextensible
wires; for when two bodies strike, push, or tend in gene
ral to approach each other without being able to do        on                  it,
account     of their impenetrability,                     we can conceive between
the two  small incompressible rod, and suppose that the
            a
movement    transmitted from the one to the other accord*
                    is
ing   to this rod        :   and   in   the same way,        if   two bodies tend to
separate,we may conceive                    attached to the
                                             that the one          is
other     by
          small inextensible wire, according to which the
               a
movement           is
             propagated    this being done, let us consider
                                         :
successively the action of each of these small corpuscles upon
all those which are adjacent to                  it,
                                      e. let us examine two by

small incompressible rod, or                     by
                                     small inextensible wire,

and we shall      what ought to result in the general system
                     see
of all these corpuscles. Let us name for this purpose,
  mf and m" The masses of the adjacent corpuscles.
  V and         V" The
                     velocities they ought to have the follow
        ing instant.
  I"   The action of m" upon m', that       to say, the force or
                                                             is
        quantity of movement which the first of these cor

               q"                 the directions      by                    of V and
          Fand     those of V" and F'.

velocity estimated in the direction of will be   cosine q<; F           V
in the same manner the velocity of m" estimated in the
direction of ¥' will be V" cosine q". Therefore, since by
                                                                                 the

                     On Machines in General.                          811
the second    fundamental       law bodies should go in company,
we    shall have   V   cosine q' +        V  cosine q" = 0 (A) : thus
by the first fundamental law,          we shall also have F.     V    co
sine q' +    P  V" cosine q" = 0 (B) : for if m' and m" are
both moveable, it is clear, by this law, that we have          P  =   P;
therefore on account of the equation (A) we shall also have
the equation (B) ; and if one of the two, m' for instance, be
fixed, or form part of an obstacle, we shall have                V    co
sine q" = 0 ; therefore on account of the equation (A) we
shall also have     V" cosine      q"    = 0 ; therefore  the  equation
(B) will still take place : therefore this equation (B) is
true for all the corpuscles of the system taken two by two.
Imagining therefore a similar equation for all these bodies
taken in fact two by two, and adding together all these equa
tions, or, what comes to the same thing, the integral equa
tion (B), we shall have for the whole system,
   5  PV    cosine q' +    s   F" V" cosine q" = 0 : that is to say,
the sum     of  the  products of the quantities of movement
which   are reciprocally impressed         by the corpuscles separated
by each of    the  small inextensible wires or incompressible
rods ; from these quantities, I say, each of them multiplied
by the velocity of the corpuscle on which it is impressed,
estimated in the direction of this force, is equal to zero.
   This being done, abandoning              the  preceding denomina

     We shall therefore      have for     the whole system       j F V co
  sine 9 = 0, or s V F           cosine q = 0 (C) : at present we
  must observe* that, the velocity of m before the reciprocal
  action being W, this velocity estimated in the direction
  of V will be W cosine X : therefore V — W cosine X is
  the velocity gained by m in the direction of V : therefore m
   (V —    W  cosine X) is the sum of the forces F which act
  upon m, estimated each in the direction of V : therefore m
  and V (V — W cosine               is the same sum multiplied by V.
                               X)
  Now    to each   molecule     a similar sum answers; and further,
  the sum total of all these particular sums is visibly for the
  whole system s V F cosine q ; therefore s mV (V — W
  cosine   X) =    s FV    cosine q : adding to this equation the
  equation (C),     there   comes sm V (V — W cosine X) = 0
  (D)  ;  but W     resulting from V and U, it is clear that we
  shall have  W    cosine X = V + U cosine Z : substituting
  therefore this value of W cosine X in the equation (D), it
 will be reduced to 5 m V U cosine Z = 0 (E) ; first funda
 mental equation.
     XVI. Let us imagine that at the moment when the shock
  is about to be given, the actual movement of the system is
 at once destroyed, and that we make it take instead of it
  successively two other arbitrary movements, hut equal and
 directly opposite to each other, i. e. let us make it set out
 successively from its actual position, with two movements,
 such that, in virtue of the second, each point of the system
 has at the first instant a velocity equal and directly opposed
 to that which it would have had in virtue of the first of these
 movements     :  this being done, it         is clear,   1st,   That    the
 figure of the. system being given, this may be done in an
 infinity of different ways, and by operations purely geome
 trical ; this is the reason why        I shall call these movements
geometrical movements         ;  \. e. that  if a system    of  bodies  sets
out  from   a given position luith an        arbitrary    movement,     hit
yd of such    a nature that it is possible to make it take another
in every respect     equal and directly         opposite,  each   of  these
                                                               movements

                          On Machines in General,                              213
 movements       willbe     named a geometrical movement*.                 2dly,   I
 say that     in virtue of this geometrical movement,                    the  adja
 cent corpuscles, which may be regarded as being pushed by
 a   rod, or drawn by a wire, will not approach nor recede
 from each other at the first instant, i. e. at the first in
 stant    of this geometrical movement the relative velocity
 of    these adjacent corpuscles           will   be nothing      :  in fact, it is
 clear, in the first place, that if m be separated from an ad
jacent corpuscle by an incompressible rod, it will not be
 able to approach it ; and that if it be separated from it by
 an inextensible wire, it will not be able to recede from it :
 secondly,       I   say that     if it   be separated      from it by an in
                                                                    compressible
     • In
 ,        order to distinguish by a very simple example those movements
 called geometrical from those which are not so, let us imagine two globes
 which push each other, but in other respects free and disengaged from every
 obstacle : let us impress upon these globes equal velocities, and moved in the
 same direction    according to the line of the centres; — this movement is geome
 trical, because the bodies could even be moved in a contrary direction with
 the same velocity, as is evident : but let us now suppose    that we impress upon
 these bodies movements equal, and directed in the        line of the centres, but
 which, in place of being,     as formerly, moved in the same direction, tend on
 the contrary to recede from each other ; these movements, although possible,
 are not what I mean by geometrical movements ; because if we wished to make
 each of these moveable powers to assume a velocity equal and contrary to
 that which it receives in this first movement, we should be hindered from
 doing so by the impenetrability of bodies.
    In the same way if two bodies are attached to- the extremities of an inex
tensible wire, and if we make the system assume an arbitrary movement, but
6O an that the distance   of the two bodies may be constantly equal to the length
of the wire, this movement will be geometrical, because the bodies may as
sume a similar movement in quite a contrary direction ; but if these moveable
bodies approach to each other, the movement is not geometrical, because they
could not take a movement equal and contrary without receding from each
other; which is impossible on account of the incxtensibility of the wire.
    In general it is evident, that whatever be the figure of the system and the
number of bodies, if we can make it assume a movement so as there should
result no change in the respective position of the bodies, this movement will
be geometrical ; but it does not follow from this that there is no other me
thod of satisfying this condition, as we shall show from several examples.
    Let us imagine an axle, to the wheel and cylinder of which are attached
weights suspended by cords: if we turn the machine in such a manner that
the weight attached to the wheel should descend from a height equal to its
circumference, while that of the cylinder will ascend from a height equal to
its circumference,    this movement will be geometrical,      because  it is equally
                                         O 3                                possible

  214                       On Machines in General.
  compressible rod, it cannot recede from it any more ;
  for, if it receded, it is clear that in virtue of the equal and
  directly opposite movement, which is also possible by hy
  pothesis, it would approach it ; which could not be on ac
  count of the incompressibility of the rod : for the same
  reason finally it is obvious,             that    if it be a wire which sepa
  rates to from the adjacent corpuscle, it will not approach,
 because then it would be possible to remove it by an equal
  and directly opposite movement : now this cannot be, on
 account of the inextensibility of the wire : therefore, what
 ever may be the geometrical movement impressed                          upon the
 possible to make the weight attached to the cylinder descend from a height
 equal to its circumference, while the weight attached to the wheel would
 mount from an equal height to its circumference; but if while we cause the
 weight attached to the wheel to descend from a height equal to its circumfe
 rence, we should cause the weight attached to the cylinder to ascend from a
 height greater than its circumference, the movement would not be geometrical,
 because   the equal and contrary    movement would be visibly impossible.
    If several  bodies be attached to the extremities of different wires united by
 the other extremities to one and the same knot, and if we make the system
 assume   such a movement as that each of the bodies remains constantly re
 moved from the knot of one and the same quantity at the length of the wire
to which      it is attached*  this movement will be geometrical,    even when the
different bodies approach to each other; but if some of them approach the
knot, the movement would not be geometrical, because, the wires being sup
 posed to be inextensible, the equal and contrary movement would be visibly
impossible.
    If two bodies are attached to the extremities of a wire into which is intro
duced a moveable particle, it will be sufficient, in order that the movement
be geometrical, that the sum of the distances from the moveable particle to
 each of the two other bodies is constantly equal to the length of the wire ; so
 that if these two bodies arc fixed, the moveable particle will not depart from
an elliptical curve.                                     ,
    If a body be moved by a curved surface, for instance, in the concavity of
a spherical hell, the movement will be geometrical, while the body will move <
in  a tangent form      to the surface;   but if it be separated the movement will
cease to be geometrical,      because   the  equal and contrary movement is visibly
impossible.
    From all this it is evident, that although on giving to a system ^geometrical
movement, the different bodies ot this system may be brought near to each
pther, yet we may say that the adjacent corpuscles, considered two by two,
do not lend at the first instant cither to approach or recede, as I shall prove
at length in the text. Bodies therefore exercise no action upon each other m
virtue of a similar movement : these movements are therefore absolutely in
dependent of the rules of dynamics, and it is for this reason that I have called
them geometrical.
                                                                          system,

                        On Machines in General.                    215
 system, the relative velocity of all these adjacent corpuscles
which act upon each other, taken two by two, will be no
thing at the tirst instant. This being granted, let us call u
the absolute     velocity which m will have in the first instant,
in virtue of this geometrical movement, and z the angle com
 prehended between the directions of u and U ; it is cleat
that the corpuscles m will not tend to approach or recede
 from each other in virtue of the velocities a, if we suppose
them animated at the same time with these velocities u and
velocities    U;    nor will they tend more to approach or recede
if   animated with the mere velocities          U : therefore the re
 ciprocal    action exercised among the different parts of the
system will be the same, whether each molecule be anima
ted with the single velocity U, or with the two velocities u
 and   U  : but  if each   molecule was animated with the single
velocity U,       it is plain that there would be equilibrium :
thus, if it was animated at once with the two velocities U
and u, or with a single velocity the result of both, U will
still be the velocity lost by m ; and u will be the real velocity
after the reciprocal action : thus, by the same reasoning by
which we had the fundamental equation (E) we shall also
have s m u     U   cosine z = 0 (F) ; second fundamental equa
 tion:
    It is very easy at present to resolve the problem       which we
propose for the preceding equation necessarily taking place,
whatever be the value of u and its direction, provided the
movement to which it refers be geometrical : it is clear that
by successively attributing to that indeterminate different
values and arbitrary directions, we shall obtain all the ne
cessary     equations     among the unknown quantities, upon
which depends the solution of the problem and of quantities
either given or taken at pleasure.
    XVII. In order      to place this solution  in the clearest light,
it will  be sufficient to give an example      of it.
    Let  us suppose' therefore 'that the whole system is reduced
to an assemblage of bodies united to each other by inflexible
rods, in such a manner that all the parts of the system
should be forced always to preserve           their same respective
                                  O4                       positions j

2I 6                   On Machines in General,
positions ; but that there is no fixed point or any obstacle ;
the equation (F) gives us the solution of this problem on
attributing successively to u different values and directions.
   1st. As the velocities u are not subjected to any condi
tion, unless the movement of the system in virtue of which
the corpuscles m have these velocities be geometrical, it is
evident that we can at first suppose all of them equal and pa
rallel to one given line : then u being constant, or the same
with respect to all the points of the system, the equation (F)
will be reduced to s TO U cosine x = 0; which informs us
that the sum of the forces lost by the reciprocal action of the
bodies in the arbitrary sense of u is null, and that conse
quently that which remains is the same as if each body had
been free ; this is a well-known principle.
   2dly. Let us now imagine that we make the whole system
turn round a given axis, so that each of the points will de
scribe a circumference round this axis, and in a plane which
shall be perpendicular to it ; this movement is visibly geo
metrical ; therefore the equation (F) takes place: hut then
on calling R the distance from m to the axis, it is clear that
we have u =   AR', A being the same for all the points ;
therefore the equation (F) is reduced to 5 m R U cosine
z = 0 ; that is to say, that the sum of the momenta of the
forces lost by the reciprocal action relatively to any axis is
null ; this is another well-known principle.
   3dly. We might also attribute to u other values ; but this
would be useless,   and might lead to equations already con
tained in  the preceding; for we know that the latter are
sufficient for resolving the question, or at least for reducing
it to a matter    of   pure geometry.
                             First Remark.
   XVIII.     The object     we   propose   by giving a geometrical
movement is to change the state of the system, without al
tering however the reciprocal action of the bodies which
compose     it,
             in order thereby to procure relations between
these exercised and unknown forces and the arbitrary velo
cities which bodies assume in virtue of these different geo
                                                           metrical

                    On Machines in General.                                 217
metrical movements         :   but it must be remarked that there is
a case where geometrical movements are not the only ones
which can answer the same purpose, and where some other
movements may be employed in the same way, in order to
extract from the general equation (F) determinate equations:
this happens when these other movements, without being
absolutely geometrical, become so, nevertheless, merely on
suppressing some of the small wires or rods we have sup
posed to be interposed between the adjacent particles of the
system, at the time, I say, when these rods or wires supposed
to transmit the movement from one corpuscle to another,
transmitted none at all in fact ; i. e. when the tension of
some of these wires, or the pressure of some of these rods,
is equal to zero ; for then by suppressing these wires or
rods, the tensions or pressures of which are null, we evi
dently change nothing at all of the reciprocal action of the
bodies, and nevertheless             it    is possible that we may thereby
render the system susceptible of some geometrical move
ments, which could not otherwise take place: there is nothing
therefore to prevent us from regarding these rods and wires
as annihilated, since they have no influence upon the state of
the system ; and as we consequently employ as geometrical
the movements which, without being so effectively, become
BO nevertheless by this suppression.
     Further, when two         bodies are contiguous to each           other,
it is evidently the same thing to suppress the small rod
which we have imagined to be interposed between two, to
hinder them from approaching, or to suppose that these
bodies are permeable to each other, i. e. that they may be
penetrated as easily as the empty space is penetrated by all
bodies; whence it evidently follows, that in general, in any
system   of   bodies acting upon each other, immediately or by
wires and rods,      i. e. by the intermedium of any machine,
ifthere be any wire, rod, or other part of the machine
which exercises no action upon bodies applied to  i. e.               it,

the reciprocal     action of these bodies, we shall be able to

in   the same way as those which would become so also, re
garding as freely permeable to each other, those of the
bodies among which no pressure is exercised, although they
are adjacent.             The following, however, shows the utility of
this observation             :
     If,                               of any problem, we
            when we undertake the solution
know beforehand that a certain part of the machine does
not exercise any action upon the other parts of the system,
we shall be able to suppose that this part of the machine is
totally annihilated, and ascertain the movement of the sy
stem according to this hypothesis,                            i.   e. by treating as geo
metrical all the movements which would really become so
by this supposition ; and in the same way, if one of the given
conditions           of the problem               is,
                              that certain adjacent bodies do

the system,            by
                   first supposing the one or the other at plea
sure   : we shall suppose therefore, for example, that this
pressure      real
                 is    then,:   on inquiring, according to this
                                             if
hypothesis, the value of this pressure, we find        real and                it
positive, we shall conclude that the hypothesis  legitimate,                  is
and the exact result   or else we shall be assured that the
                                   j
pressure in question                   is    null, and
                                          may consequent     that we
ly   treat   geometrical, motions which would become so
                as
in fact,   the two bodies in question were freely permeable

wire   null or real, we might make the calculation
           is                                         at                                 by

which will         be done by supposing             the wire annihilated,     t. e.
by treating         as  geometrical the motions which would be so
effectively if        the wire in question did not exist.
   From this it follows, that in order to extract in each par
ticular case from the general equation (F) all the determi
nate equations           which it can give,         we   must first make the
system          assume all the geometrical movements             of which it is
susceptible ; secondly,                             which
                                   to treat also as such all those
would become so by suppressing some machine or part of a
machine, the action of which ujpon the rest of the system
is null, or by regarding as permeable td each other, the
bodies among which, although adjacent, no pressure is ex
ercised. 3dly. In the last place, if we are in doubt whether
a certain wire, rod, or any part of the machine has or has
not    a real     action upon the other parts of the system, or that
there was         a real pressure between two adjacent bodies, we
must first clear up this doubt, by supposing the thing in
question as we have above explained       and            it,
                                                  treating as     by
geometrical the movements which these suppositions shall
have discovered as being capable of being taken for such.
  According to this remark,      seems proper therefore to

which, without being so effectively, become so on suppress
ing    some machine or part              of   a    machine which has no in
fluence upon the state of the system, and on regarding also
as perfectly permeable   to each other, bodies in contact,
without any pressure being exercised among them,     e.                      i.

  nicnts is to change the state of the system, without altering
  the reciprocal action of the bodies which compose it. To
 leave, however, some distinction between them, we may
  call the first absolute geometrical movements, and the others
 geometrical movements              by supposition:      but when      I  speak
 simply of geometrical movements, without otherwise                          de
 signing them,          I  shall imply both indifferently.
     This being done, — since            we have explained how we may
 determine,        without the assistance of any mechanical prin
 ciple,    all  the  geometrical movements of which a given sy
 stem is susceptible., it follows that the general problem which
 we proposed is entirely reduced by the general equation (F)
 to operations purely geometrical and analytical : we must,
 however, observe, that it is not sufficient to attribute to the
 arbitrages u different values, but we must also attribute to
 them different relations or directions               ; for, if we are con
 tented to attribute different values to them without changing
 any thing in the relations or directions, we should obtain'
 different equations, quite true and correct, but which would
 be evidently reduced to the same on multiplying them by
 different constants.
                                 Second Remark.
    XIX.       As   we are only speaking         of hard bodies here, it      is
clear that among the different values which we may attri
bute to u, the velocity V is itself comprehended ; i. c. that
the real movement of the system is itself one of the geome
trical movements of which it is susceptible : the first equa
tion (E) is therefore contained in the indeterminate equa
tion     (F),    and    consequently we may reduce to this single
equation (F)        all   the laws of equilibrium and of movement
in hard bodies.
    Now      we     have     seen,  that this equation is nothing else
than the first          (E),   to which we have succeeded in giving
system   be reduced to two adjacent globes, and pushing each other, it is clear,
that  if we force these bodies to separate or to move in a direction contrary to
each other,    this movement will not be impossible, but that at the same time
bodies cannot assume it without      ceasing to act upon each other. This move
ment, therefore, is not proper for attaining the object proposed, which is to
change nothing in the reciprocal action of bodies.
                                                                          more

more extension by means of the geometrical movements ;
but as we shall soon see (XXIV) the analogy of this equa
tion (E) with the principle of the preservation of the moving
powers in the shock of perfectly elastic bodies becomes
striking by      a slight  transformation ;       and      we   shall   see
(XXVI),       that in fact it is nothing else than this principle
itself transferred to hard bodies, with the modification re
quired by the different nature of these bodies : it is therefore
this preservation of moving powers which will serve, as we
have premised, as a basis to the whole of our theory of
machines, whether at rest or in motion.
    According to these remarks we shall briefly recapitulate
the solution of the preceding problem, in order to show at
one glance the course      of the operations indicated.

XLIV.     Processes    employed    for finishing      the Inside    of the
    Palaces   of the Native Princes     in some Parts        of  the Mast
    Indies *.
 JL he principal workman employed by colonel Close in re
pairing the palace in the Laid Baug, gave me the following
account of the processes used for finishing the inside of the,
palaces at Seringapatam.
    At first sight, one would imagine that much gilding is
used in the ornaments ; but, in truth, not a grain of gold is
employed.       The workmen use         a paper     covered    with   false
gilding.     This they cut into the      shape of flowers, and paste
these on the walls or columns.           The interstices are filled up
with oil colours, which are all of European preparation. —
The manner of making this false gilded paper is as follows :
    Take any quantity of lead, and beat it with a hammer
 into leaves, as thin as possible.         To twenty-four parts of
 these leaves add three parts of English glue, dissolved in
 water, and beat them together with a hammer, till they be

thoroughly united, which requires the labour of two persons
for a whole day. The mass is then cut into small cakes,
and dried in the shade.   These cakes can, at any time, be
dissolved in water, and spread thin with a hair brush on
common          writing   paper.      The (when dry) must be
                                                 paper
put on a smooth plank, and rubbed with a polished stone
till it acquire a complete metallic lustre. The edges of the
paper are then pasted down on the board, and the metallic
surface is rubbed with the palm of the hand, which is
smeared with an oil called gurna, and then exposed to the
sun.       On   the two       following     days the same operation is re
peated      j when the     paperacquires a metallic yellow colour,
which, however,           more resembles the hue of brass than
that   of gold.
     The gurna oil is          prepared    as    follows :— -Take three quar
ters of a maund (about 18 lib.) of linseed oil, half a maund
(12 lib.) of the size called chunderasu, and a quarter of a
maund (6 lib.) oimusambra, or aloes prepared in the country.
Boil the oil for two hours in a brass pot. Bruise the mu-
sambra ; and, having put it into the oil, boil them for four
hours more.    Another pot having been made red-hot, the
chunderasu is to be put into              it,
                               and will immediately melt.
Take    third pot, and, having tied

                it                                   :   these must be kept in
a gentle heat, and the chunderasu added to them gradually.
The oil must be strained again   and     then fit for use.

   In white-washing their walls, over the chunam, or lime

made    of   powdered balapum or pot - stone                   ;   and then finish

                                prepared
grindings, the finer particles being removed for use by wash
ing them from the grosser parts.
   The wall, when finished in this manner, shines like the
scales   of a    fish ; and when the room is lighted has a splendid
appearance  but in the day-time, the wall washed with the

powdered potstone alone, in my opinion, looks better than
when washed with either quick-lime or mica.

Annales     f,       the result of the analysis he made of the chro-
mate     of iron of Siberia, and this result             was      similar to that
obtained by M. Vauquelin, when examining the chromate
of iron discovered by M, Pontier in the department of
Var. M. Klaproth lately repeated the analysis of the same
substance upon a piece which came from Krieglach,                                  in

   brought from the Valais, which I recognised from its struc
  ture and physical properties to be a variety of the epidote,
  although it differed in its external characters from the cry
  stals of this species hitherto observed.                   M. Laugier found
  that the respective quantities and qualities of its component
  principles were the same as in the epidote of Arendal, and
  in that of France, analysed by M. Vauquelin and M. Des-
  costils.
     The     same      variety also exists in Carinthia and in some
  of the neighbouring countries ; and M. Werner has since
 given the name of zoysite to it in honour of baron Zoys.
 The distinction which               M. Werner      establishes   between this
 substance and our epidote is in some measure a consequence
 6f the nomenclature adopted by this celebrated naturalist ;
 for he gives to the epidote the name of Pistazite (Pistachio
.stone)     because      it   is generally   of  a more or less deep green.
Now      this name seems to exclude the zoysite, the colour of
 which     is gray, brown, or brownish              yellow, but never green ;
 at least    it is  so in those specimens we have seen.

    Buildings,   by Steam.         By R. Buchannan, Esq., Civil
    Engineer, Glasgow.
                              To  Mr. Tillock.
IVIanv      additional     facts   with   regard   to heating by steam
have lately been      ascertained     in this neighbourhood, and its
application to various processes in manufactures continues'
to increase.     Mr. Richard Gillespie is highly pleased with
its effects upon copper-plate callico-printing at his works,
as also for heating his calenders.           For this last purpose, and
to warm his warehouse and counting-house,                    the steam is
conveyed to a distance of above ninety-three yards.
    Steam was, I believe, tried many years ago at Leads,
for drying goods,      as a   substitute for stoves     ;  but for some
reason, of which        I   am    ignorant,     was   abandoned.      Mr.
Loutuls,    at Paisley, however, has for a considerable time
used it with great success in drying fine muslins.                Messrs.
Leys, Mason       and   Co. now       also   use  it at their bleaching
works,    at Aberdeen.
   Some kinds of muslins have for several years been dried
by being rolled round cylinders of tin plate filled with steam,
but   I do not here allude to that mode.
   For drying of      dyed     yarn   and   pullicates,   (a kind  of co
loured chequed cotton handkerchiefs,) a higher temperature
than for fine muslin is required.              I am glad, however, to
have it in my power to say, that Messrs. Muir, Brown,
and   Co., at their dyeing and bleaching works here, have
found steam to answer those purposes much better than the
usual mode      by stoves.        Mr. Muir informs me, that,          al
though they formerly gave out their pullicates to be bleached

cost of the apparatus. It is also well adapted to the pur

      Prunings of      Vines may le applied in this Country.
                           To  Mr. Tilloch.
     SIR,
JF rom experiments which I            have made, I fmd that, on
being   dried,   which   should  be done  in the shade, and infused
in a tea-pot, the leaves of the vine make an excellent sub
stitute for tea.     I have also found that, on being cut small,
bruised, and put into a vat, or mashing-tub, and boiling water
poured on them, in the same way as is done with malt, the
prunings of the vine produce a liquor of a fine vinous quali
ty; which, on being fermented, makes a very fine beve
rage, either strong or weak, as you please ; and, on being
distilled, produces an excellent spirit of the nature of brandy.
   In the course of my experiments I found that the fer
mented liquor from the prunings, particularly the tendrils,
when allowed to pass the vinous and to run into the acetous
fermentation, makes uncommonly fine vinegar.               If not in
tended to be distilled soon after they are lopped off, or if it
should not be convenient to do so at the time, they should
                                                                   be

  process    for distilling from grain.

 XLVIII.        Observations     on    the Nature       of the new celestial
     Body discovered by Dr. OLBERS ; and of the Comet which,
     was expected to appear last January in its Return from the
     Sun.      By WILLIAM HERSCHEL, L.L.D F.R.S. *
  JL HE   late discovery    of   an additional body belonging               to the
 solar system, by Dr. Olbers, having been communicated to
 me the 20th of April, an event of such consequence en
 gaged -my immediate attention.                In the evening of the same
 day   I tried to discover its situation by the information                  I had
 obtained     of its motion; but the brightness of the moon,
 which was near the full, and at no great distance from the
object for which I looked, would not permit a star of even
the 5th magnitude to be seen ; and it was not                      till  the 24th
that   a tolerable    view could be obtained of that space of the
heavens in which our new wanderer was pursuing its hither
to unknown path.
    As soon as I found that small stars might be perceived,                       I
made several delineations of certain telescopic constellations,
ihe first of which was as represented in figure 1, and I fixed
upon the star A, as most likely, from its expected situation,
and brightness,       to be the one       I   was  looking for.        The    stars
in this figure,     as  well  as   in all the other delineations            I  had
             • From                                  for

228          Observations     on the new celestial Body
made,      were   carefully examined with several magnifying
powere, that in case any one of them should hereafter ap
pear to have been the lately discovered object, I might not
Iose the opportunity of an early acquaintance with its con
dition.     An observation of         the    star   marked  A, in parti
cular,    was made       with a   very distinct magnifying power of
460, and says, that it had nothing in its appearance that
differed from what we see in other stars of the same size ;
indeed Dr. Olbers, by mentioning in the communication
which I received, that with such magnifying powers as he
could use it was not not to be distinguished from a fixed
star*, had already prepared me to expect the newly dis
covered heavenly body to be a valuable addition to our in
creasing catalogue of asteroids.
    The 25th of April I looked over my delineations of the
preceding evening, and found no material difference in the
situation of the stars I had marked for examination ; and in
addition to them new aslerisms were prepared, but on ac
count of the retarded motion of the new star, which was
drawing towards a period of its retrogradation, the small
change of its situation was not sufficiently marked to be
readily perceived the next day when these asterisms were
again examined, which it is well known can only be done
with night-glasses of a        very low magnifying power.
    A  long interruption of bad weather would not permit any
regular examination of the situation of small stars ; and it
was only when I had obtained a more precise                  information
from the astronomer royal, who, by means                    of fixed in
struments, was already in possession of the place and rate
of motion of the new star, that 1 could direct my telescope
with greater accuracy by an applcaition of higher magni
fying powers. My observations on the nature of this se
cond new star discovered by Dr. Olbers are as follow.
    April 24. This day, as we have already seen, the new
celestial object was examined with             a  high power j  and since

   a magnifier of 460 would not show it to be different from
_
   the stars of an equal apparent brightness, its diameter must
   be extremely small, and we may reasonably expect it to be
   an asteroid.
      May    21.    With    a double eye-piece magnifying            only   75
   times the supposed asteroid A makes a right-angled triangle
   with two small stars a b. See fig. 2.
      With     a  very distinct     magnifier of 460 there is no ap
   pearance of any planetary disk.
      May 22. The new star has moved away from a b, and is
   now situated as in fig. 3. The star A of figure 1 is no
   longer in the place where I observed it the 24th of April,
   and was therefore the asteroid.             I examined it now with
   gradually increased magnifying powers, and the air being
   remarkably clear, I saw it very distinctly with 460, 577,
   and 636. On comparing its appearance with these powers
   alternately to that of equal stars, among which was the
  463d of Bode's catalogue of the stars in the Lion of the
   7th magnitude, I could not find any difference in the visible
   size of their disks.
      By the estimations of the distances of double stars, con
   tained in the first and second classes of the catalogues I have
  given of them, it will be:seen that I have always considered
  every    star  as   having    a visible,   though     spurious,     disk or
   diameter    : and in a late      paper I have entered        at large  into
  the method       of detecting real disks from spurious ones              : it
  may    therefore   be supposed that I proceeded now with Vesta
   (which name I understand Dr. Olbers has given the aste
  roid),   as I did before in the investigation         of  the magnitudes
  of Ceres, Pallas,       and Juno.
      The same telescopes, the same comparative views, by
  which the smallness of the latter three had been proved,
  convinced      me    now that     I  had   before me     a  similar fourth
  celestial body. .
      The disk of the asteroid which          I  saw was clear, well de
  fined, and     free   from nebulosity.        At the first view I was
  inclined to believe it a real one;           and the Georgian planet
  being conveniently        situated,  so  that  a telescope might with
                                      P3                                   out

out loss of time be turned alternately either to this or to the
asteroid, I found that the disk of the latter, if it were real,
would he about one-sixth of the former, when viewed with
a magnifying   power of 460. The spurious nature of the
asteroidal disk, however, was soon manifested by an in-?
crease of the magnifying power, which would not propor
tionally      increase       its    diameter    as   it    increased   that     of the
planet;       and a     real disk of the asteroid still remains unseen
with            of 636.
           a power
   May   23.   The new star has advanced, and its motion is
direct ; its situation with respect to the two small stars a b,
js given in figure 4.
     Its   apparent      disk with   magnifier of 460 is about 5- or
                                          a
6-tenths of       a   second ; but this is evidently a spurious ap
pearance, because    higher powers destroy the proportion it
bears to a real disk when equally magnified.      The air is not
sufficiently pure this evening to use large telescopes.
   May 24. With a magnifying power of 577 I compared
the appearance of the Georgian planet to that of the asteroid,
and with this power the diameter of the visible disk of the
latter was about one 9th or 10th part of the former. The
apparent disk of the small star near f2 Leonis, which hag
been  mentioned before, had an equal comparative magni
tude, and probably the disks of the asteroid and of the star
it   resembles    are equally spurious.
     The 20      feet      reflector,     with many different magnifying
powers, gave still the same result; and being already con
vinced of the impossibility, in the present situation of the
asteroid, which is above two months past the opposition, to
obtain a better view of its diameter, I used this instrument
chieflv to ascertain whether auy nebulosity or atmosphere
mi^ht be seen about it. For this purpose the valuable quan
tity of light collected by an aperture of 18| inches directly
received by an eye-glass                of the front-view         without   a   second
reflection,      proved      of eminent       use,   and gave me the diameter
of   this asteroid entirely free from all nebulous or atmospheric
appearances.
     The result       of    these    observations         is,   that we now are in
                                                                        possession,

possession of a formerly unknown species of celestial bodies,
which, by their smallness and considerable deviation from
the path in which the planets move, are in no danger of
disturbing, or being disturbed by them ; and the great suc
cess that has already    attended        the pursuit   of   the celebrated
discoverers    of Ceres, Pallas, Juno,         and Vesta,      will induce
us to hope that some further light may soon be thrown upon
this new and most interesting branch of astronomy.
               Olservations     of the    expected Comet.
  The comet which         has    been seen descending to the sun,
and from the motion of which it was concluded that we
should probably see it again on its return from the perihelion,
was expected to make its reappearance about the middle of
last January, near the southern parts of the constellation of
the Whale.
   January 27. Towards the evening, on my return from
Bath, where I had been a few days, I gave my sister Ca
rolina the place where this comet might be looked for, and
between flying clouds, the same evening about 6h 49' she
saw it just long enough to make a short sketch of its situa
tion.
   January 31. Clouds having obscured the sky till this time,
I obtained a transitory view of the comet, and perceived
that it was within a few degrees of the place which had been
assigned to it; the unfavourable state of the atmosphere,
however, would not permit the use of any instrument pro
per for examining it minutely.
   There will be no occasion for my giving a more particular
account of its place, than that it was very near the elec
trometer of the constellation, which in Mr. Bode's maps is
ca'led machina electrica ; the only intention I had in look
ing for   being to make few observations upon its physi
         it,                    a
cal condition.
   February 1. The comet had moved but very little from
the place where     was last night
                    it               and as the air was pretty
                                           ;
clear,  I used    a10-feet reflector with   low power to ex

 nucleus, but did not deserve the name of a disk.

        An Account of a Shower of Meteoric          Stones.        tSS
   The meteor which       has so recently excited alarm in many,
and   astonishment in all, first made its appearance in Wes
ton, about     a quarter or half past six o'clock,       A. M., on
Monday     the 14th instant      (Dec. 1807).    The morning       was
somewhat cloudy ;        the clouds were dispersed       in unequal
masses, being      in  some    places thick  and opaque, in others
light, fleecy, and partially transparent ; while spots of un
clouded sky appeared here and there among them.                 Along
the northern      part  of the horizon,     a space  of 10  or  15 de
grees was perfectly clear.       The day had merely dawned, and
there was little or no     light, except from the moon, which
was  just setting.    Judge Wheeler, to whose intelligence and
observation, apparently uninfluenced by fear or imagination,
we arc indebted for the substance of this part of our account,
was passing through the enclosure adjoining his house,
with his face to the north, and his eyes on the ground,
when a sudden flash, occasioned by the transition of a lu
minous body across the northern margin of clear sky, illu
minated every object, and caused him to look up.               He im
mediately discovered a globe of fire, just then passing be
 hind the first cloud, which        was very dark,    and   obscured,
 although it did not entirely hide the meteor.
    In this situation its appearance was distinct,           and well
 defined, like that    of  the sun seen through a mist.         It  rose
 from the north,      and   proceeded   in  a direction   nearly per
 pendicular to the horizon, but inclining, by a very small
 angle, to the west, and deviating a little from the plane of a
 great circle, but in pretty large curves, sometimes on one
 side of the plane, and sometimes on the other, but never
 making an angle with it of more than 4 or 5 degrees.                  It
 appeared   about   one  half   or  two  thirds  the diameter of the
 full moon. This description of its apparent magnitude is
 vague, but it was impossible to ascertain what angle it sub
 tended. Its progress was not so rapid as that of common
 meteors and shooting stars. When it passed behind the
 thinner clouds, it appeared brighter than before : and when
 it passed the spots of clear sky it flashed with a vivid light,
 yet not  so  intense' as the lightning in a thunder-storm,          but
                                                                 rather

               An, Account

    rather like what is commonly                   called heat           liglitning.     Its
    surface was apparently convex.
      Where it       was not too much obscured by                        thick clouds,       a
 conical train of paler light was                 seen       to attend       it,    waving,
 and in length about 10 or 12                     diameters         of    the body.      la
 the clear sky       a   brisk scintillation            was     observed      about the
 body of       the meteor, like         that of    a    burning firebrand carried
 against the wind.
     It   disappeared    about      15 degrees         short of the zenith,             and
 about the same number of degrees west of the meridian.     It
 did  not  vanish  instantaneously, but grew,  pretty rapidly,
 fainter and fainter, as    red-hot cannon ball would do,
                                  a                                                      if
 cooling in the dark, only with much more rapidity.
   There was no peculiar smell in the atmosphere, nor were
 any luminous masses seen to separate from the body.  The
 whole  period between its first appearance and total extinc
 tion was estimated at about 30 seconds.                                            .
    About 3O or 40 seconds after this, three loud and distinct
reports, like those        of   a     four-pounder, near at hand, were
heard.        They   succeeded        each  other with as much rapidity
as was consistent          with     distinctness,            and, all together, did
not occupy three seconds. Then followed    rapid succession     a
of reports less loud, and running into each other, so as to
produce    continued rumbling, like that of
              a                                  cannon ball             a
rolling over     floor, sometimes louder and at other times
                  a
fainter  some
          ;   compared     to the noise of waggon, running
                                  it                           a
rapidly down    long and stony hill
                  a                    or to volley of mus-
                                                   ;            a
quetry, protracted into what   called, in military language,
                                             is
a  running fire. This noise continued about as long as the
body was in rising, and died away, apparently in the direc
tion from which the meteor came.
   The accounts of others corresponded substantially with
this. Time was differently estimated     different people,     by
but the variation was not material.  Some augmented the
number of loud reports, and terror and imagination seem,
in various instances,        to have          magnified every circumstance
ef the phenomenon.
    The only thing which            seemed        of   any    importance beyond
                                                                                      this

           An Account of a Shower of Meteoric Stones.                  235
this statement, was derived from Mr. Elihu Staples, who
said, that         when the meteor disappeared, there were appa
rently three successive efforts or leaps of the fire-hall, which
grew more dim at every throe, and disappeared with the
last.
     Such were the sensible pheenomena which attended this
meteor.          We purposely avoid describing the appearances
which       it assumed      in other places,   leaving this task to others
who       have     the means      of performing      it more accurately ;
while we         proceed to detail the consequences which followed
the explosions and apparent extinction of this luminary.
     We allude to the fall of a number of masses of stone in
 several places,        principally within the town of Weston. The
 places which         had been well ascertained at the period of our
 investigation, were six. The most remote were about 9 or
  10 miles distant from each other, in a line differing little
 from the course of the meteor. It is therefore probable that
 the successive         masses    fell in this order, the most northerly
 first,    and the most        southerly last. We think we are able
 to point out three principal places where stones have fallen,
  corresponding with the three loud cannon-like reports, and
  with the three leaps of the meteor observed by Mr. Staples.
  There were some circumstances               common      to  all the cases.
  There was in every instance, immediately after the explo
  sions had ceased, a loud whizzing or roaring noise in the
  air, observed at all the places, and, so far as was ascertained,
  at the moment          of the fall. It excited in some the idea of       a
  tornado      ;  in others, of a large cannon-shot in rapid motion         j
  and it filled all with astonishment and apprehension of some
  impending catastrophe. In every instance immediately after
  this was         heard   a sudden      and  abrupt noise, like that of a
   ponderous body striking             the ground   in its fall.  Excepting
   one, the stones were more or less broken.                 The most im
   portant circumstances of              the particular  cases were as fol
   low:
       1.   The most northerly fall was within the limits of Hunt
   ington, on the border of Weston, about 40 or 50 rods east
   of the great road from Bridgeport to Newtown, in across
    road, and contiguous to the house of Mr. Merwin Burr.
                                                                    Mr. Burp

   836        An Account of a Shower of Meteoric       Stones.
   Mr. Burr     was standing in the road,   in front of his house,
   when    the stone fell.     The noise produced by its collision
   with  a  rock of granite, on which it struck,      was very   loud.
   Mr. Burr     was within 50 feet, and immediately. learched for
   the body, but, it being still dark, he did not find it till half
   an hour after. By the fall, some of it was reduced to powder,
   and the rest of it was broken into very small fragments,
  which were thrown around to the distance of 20 or 30 feet.
  The granite rock was stained at the place of contact with a
  deep lead colour.       The largest fragment which remained
  did not exceed the size of a goose-egg, and this Mr. Burr
  found    to be still warm to his hand.       There was reason to
  conclude     from  all the circumstances,     that this stone must
  have weighed about twenty or twenty-five pounds.
      Mr. Burr had a strong impression that another stone fell
 in   an adjoining   field, and it was confidently believed that      a
 large mass had fallen into a neighbouring         swamp,    but nei
 ther of these had been found.        It is probable that the stone
 whose fall has now been described, together with any other
 masses which may have fallen at the same time, was thrown
 from the meteor at the first explosion.
     2. The masses projected at the. second explosion         seem to
 have fallen principally    at and in the vicinity of Mr. William
 Prince's, in Weston, distant about five miles, in a southerly
 direction, from Mr. Burr's.        Mr. Prince and family were
 still in bed, when     they heard a noise   like the fall of a  very
hearry body, immediately after the explosions.         They formed
various unsatisfactory conjectures concerning the cause—
nor did even a fresh hole made through the turf in the door-
yard, about twenty-five feet from the house, lead to any
conception of the cause, or induce any other inquiry than
why a new post-hole should have been dug where there was
no use for it. So far were this family from conceiving of
the possibility of such an event as stones falling from the
clouds.      They had indeed formed a vague conjecture that
the hole might have been made by lightning, but would
probably have paid no further attention to the circumstance,
had they not heard, in the course of the day, that stones
had fallen that morning in other parts of the town.             This
                                                            induced

         An Account of a Shower of Meteoric         Stones.       237
induced them, towards evening, to search the hole in the
yard, where they found a stone buried in the loose earth
which    had fallen in upon it.      It w as two feet from the sur
face — the hole     was about twelve inches in diameter;       and as
the earth was soft and nearly free from stones, the mass had
sustained    little   injury, only  a few small fragments     having
been detached       by the shock.    The weight of this stone was
 about thirty-five pounds.        From the descriptions which we
have heard, it must have been         a  noble specimen, and men
of science will not        cease  to deplore that so rare a treasure
should have been         immediately broken in pieces. All that
remained unbroken of this noble mass, was a piece of twelve
pounds weight, since purchased by Isaac Bronson, esq., of
Greenfield, with the liberal view of presenting it to some
 public institution.
    Six days after, another mass was discovered, half a mile
north-west from Mr. Prince's.           The search was induced by
the confident persuasion of the neighbours that they heard
it fall near the spot where it was actually found buried in
the earth, weighing from seven to ten pounds.                 It was
found by Gideon Hall         and Isaac  Fairchild.   It was in small
fragments, having fallen on a globular detached mass of
gneiss rock, which it split in two, and by which it was it
self shivered to pieces.
    The same men informed us that they supected another
Stone had fallen in the vicinity, as the report had been di
stinctly heard and could be referred to a particular region
 somewhat to the east.          Returning to the place after an ex
 cursion of a few      hours to another part of the town, we were
gratified to find the conjecture verified, by the actual dis
 covery of a mass of thirteen pounds weight, which had
 fallen half a mile to the north-east of Mr. Prince's. Having
 fallen in a ploughed field, without coming into contact with
 a rock,  it was broken only into two principal pieces, one of
 which, possessing all the characters of the stone in a re
markable degree, we purchased ; for it had now become an
 article of sale. — It was urged that it had pleased Heaven to
 rain down this treasure upon them, and they would bring
                                                                 their

  their thunderbolts to the best market they could. This wasy
  it must    be confessed, a wiser mode of managing the business
  than that which had been adopted by some others at an
 earlier period of these discoveries.           Strongly impressed with
 the idea that these stones contained gold and silver, they
 subjected them to all the tortures of ancient alchemy, and
 the goldsmith's crucible, the forge, and the blacksmith's
 anvil, were employed in vain to elicit riches which existed
 only in the imagination.
      Two miles south-east from Mr. Prince's, at the foot of
 Tashowa hill, a fifth mass fell. Its fall was distinctly heard
 by Mr. Ephraim Porter and his family, who live within 4O
 rods of the place, and in full view. They saw a smoke rise
 from the spot, as they did also from the hill, where they
are positive that another stone struck, as they heard it di
stinctly. At the time of the fall, having never heard of any
 such thing, they supposed that lightning had struck the
ground ; but after three or four days, hearing of the stones
which had been found in their vicinity, they were induced
to search,      and the result was the discovery of a mass of
stone     in the road, at the place where they supposed the
lightning had struck. It penetrated the ground to the depth
of two     feet in the deepest place ; the hole was about twenty
inches in diameter, and its margin was coloured blue from
the powder of the stone struck offiu its fall.
     It \vas broken into fragments of moderate size, and from
the best calculations might have weighed 20 or 25 pounds.
     The hole exhibited marks of much violence,                    the turf
being very much torn, and thrown about to some distance.
     It is probable that the       four stones last described      were   all
projected at the second explosion, and should one be dis
covered     on the neighbouring hill *, we must without doubt
refer it to the same avulsion.
     3. Last    of all, we hasten to what appears to have been
the catastrophe of this wonderful phaenomenon.

          An Account of a Shower of Meteoric           Stones.      230
which     we   have hitherto described, fell in a field belonging
to  Mr. Elijah Seely,        and  within   30 rods of his house.
    A circumstance       attended   the fall  of this which seems to
have been peculiar.       — Mr. Elihu Staples,     a man of integrity,
lives on the hill at the bottom of which this body fell, and
witnessed the first appearance, progress, and explosion of
the meteor.        After the last explosion, a rending noise like
that of a whirlwind passed along to the east of his house and
immediately over his orchard, which is on the declivity of
the hill.     At the same instant a streak of light passed over
the orchard in     a large   curve, and seemed to pierce the ground.
A   shock was felt, and         a report heard like that of a heavy
body falling      to the earth ; but no conception being enter
tained of the real cause,          (for no one in this vicinity, with
whom we conversed,            appeared to have ever heard of the fall
of   stones from the skies,) it was supposed that lightning
had struck the ground.           Three or four hours after the event
Mr. Secley went into his field to look after his cattle. — He
found that some of them had leaped into the adjoining en
closure, and all exhibited strong indications of terror. Pass
ing on, he was struck with surprise at seeing a spot of
ground which he knew to have been recently turfed over,
all torn up, and the earth looking fresh, as if from recent
 violence.      Coming to the place, he found a great mass of
 fragments     of a strange-looking stone, and immediately called
 for his wife,     who was second on the ground.
    Here were exhibited the most striking proofs              of violent
 collision. —A       ridge of micaceous schistus lying nearly even
 with the ground, and somewhat inclining like the hill to
 the south-east,        was shivered    to pieces,  to a certain extent,
 by the impulses of the stone, which thus received a still
 more oblique direction, and forced itself into the earth to the
 depth   of  three feet,    tearing a hole of five feet in length and
 four feet and     a  half in breadth, and throwing large masses of
 turf and fragments of stone and earth to the distance.of 50
 and 100 feet. Had there been no meteor, no explosions, and
 no witnesses of the light and shock, it would have been im
 possible for any person contemplating the scene to doubt
                                                                    that

 340       An Account of a Shower of Meteoric Stonei.
 that a large and heavy body had really fallen from the skies
 with tremendous momentum.
    This  stone was all in fragments,     none  of which  exceeded
 the size of   a man's fist, and was rapidly dispersed by nume
 rous visitors     who carried it away at pleasure. Indeed we
 found it very difficult to obtain a sufficient supply of speci
mens    of the various stones, an object which was at length
 accomplished principally by importunity            and purchase.
 From   the   best information which we could obtain of the
 quantity  of fragments of this last stone, compared with its
specific gravity, we concluded that its weight could not have
fallen much short of 200 pounds.            All the stones, when
first found, were friable, being easily broken between the
fingers ; this was especially the case where they had been
buried in the moist earth, but by exposure to the air they
gradually hardened.        Such were the circumstances attend
ing  the fall   of these singular masses.   We   have named  living
witnesses    ; the list of these may be augmented, but we con
sider the proof as sufficient to satisfy any rational mind.
Further confirmation will be derived from the mineralogical
description and chemical examination of these stones.
   The specimens obtained from all the different places are
perfectly similar.      The most careless observer would in
stantly pronounce them portions of a common mass, and
different from any of the stones commonly seen on this
globe.
   Of their form nothing        very certain can be said, because
only comparatively small fragments of the great body of the
meteor have been obtained.         Few of the specimens weigh
one pound    —   most of them less than half a pound, and from
that to the fraction of an ounce.          Mr. Branson's piece is
the largest with which we are acquainted ; we possess the
next, which weighs six pounds, and is very perfect in its
characteristic marks, and we have a good collection of
smaller specimens, many of which are very instructive.
They   possess every irregular variety    of form which might    be
supposed    to arise from accidental fracture with violent force.
On many of them, however, and chiefly on the large          speci

  mens, may be distinctly           perceived   portions of the external
  part of the meteor.
      It is every where covered with a thin black crust, desti
  tute of splendour, and bounded by portions of the large irre
  gular curve which seems to have enclosed the meteoric mass.
  This curve is far from being uniform.               It  is sometimes de
  pressed    with    concavities     such   as might      be produced by
  pressing a soft and        yielding   substance.     The surface of the
  crust feels harsh like the prepared fish skin or shagreen. It
  gives sparks with steel.            There are certain portions of
  the stones covered with the black crust, which appear not
  to have formed        a part   of  the outside   of the meteor, but to
  have received       this coating in the interior parts, in conse
  quence of      fissures or cracks,     produced probably by the in
 tense heat     to which the body seems to have been subjected.
 The specific gravity of the stone is 3"6, water being I. The
 colour of the mass of the stone is principally a dark ash, or
 more properly a leaden colour.               It is interspersed with di
 stinct masses, from the size of a pin's head to the diameter
 of one or two inches, which are almost white, resembling
 in many instances         the crystals  of feldtspar in     some   varieties
 of granite,    and    in that species of porphyry          known by the
 name of verd antique.
    The    texture   of   the stone is granular      and    coarse, resem
 bling some pieces        of grit-stone.    It cannot    be broken by the
 fingers, but gives         a rough    and irregular fracture with the
hammer.
    On inspecting        the   mass, four distinct       kinds   of matter
may be perceived         by the eye.
     1. The    stone is thickly interspersed with black globular
masses,      most of them spherical, some are oblong and irre
gular.      The largest are of the size of a pigeon-shot, but
generally they are much smaller.                They can be detached
with    any pointed iron instrument          and   leave a concavity      in
the stone.       They   are not attractable by the magnet, and can
be broken with the hammer.
    2. Masses of yellow pyrites may be observed.                  Some of
them are of         a brilliant golden colour, and are readily di
stinguished with the eye.

      3. The whole stone is thickly interspersed with metallic
  points, many of them evident to the eye, and they appear
  numerous and distinct with a lens. Their colour is whitish,
  and was mistaken by the discoverers of the stone for silver.
  They appear to be chiefly malleable iron alloyed with
  nickel.
      4. The lead-coloured mass which cements these things
  together, has been described already, and constitutes by far
  the greater part of the stone.      After being wet and exposed
  to the air, the stone becomes covered with numerous red
 dish spots, which do not appear in a fresh fracture, and arise
 manifestly from the rusting of the iron.
      Finally, the stone has been analysed in the laboratory of
 this College according to the excellent instructions              of
 Howard,        Vauquelin,     and Fourcroy.    The analysis was
 hasty, and intended only for the purpose of general informa
 tion. The exact proportions, and the steps of the analysis,
 are reserved for more leisure, and may be given to the phi
 losophical world hereafter. It is sufficient at present to ob
serve that the stone appears to consist of the following in
gredients : — silex, iron, magnesia, nickel, sulphur.
     The two first constitute by far the greater part of the
stone— the third        is in considerable proportion,    but much
less    than the others — the fourth    is probably still less ; and
the sulphur exists in a small but indeterminate quantity.
    Most of the iron is in a perfectly metallic state ; the
whole stone attracts the magnet, and this instrument takes
up a large proportion of it when pulverized. Portions of me
tallic    iron   may be separated,     so large that they can be
readily extended under the hammer.             Some of the iron is
in combination with sulphur in the pyrites, and probably-
most     of  the iron is alloyed by nickel.
     It remains to be observed that this account of the appear
ance     of the stone accords very exactly with the descriptions,
now become considerably numerous, of similar bodies which
have fallen in other countries at various periods ; and with
specimens which one of us has inspected, of stones that
have fallen in India, France, and Scotland.          The chemical
analysis also proves that their composition is the same       :  and
                                                                   it

          An Account of a Shower of Meteoric         Stones.      243
 it is well known     to mineralogists and chemists that no such
 stones have been found among the productions          of this globe.
These considerations,      together with    the  facts  that are im
mediately to be mentioned,         must, in connection with the
testimony, place the credibility of the facts asserted to have
recently occurred in Weston, beyond all controversy.
    The falling of stones from the clouds is an event which
has frequently happened in Europe, in Asia, and in South
America.       The accounts of     such  phaenomena      were, for a
longtime,     rejected by philosophers, as the offspring of igno
rance and superstition.       Several facts of this kind, how
ever, within a few years, have been proved bv evidence so
unexceptionable, as to overcome the most obstinate incre
dulity. It is now admitted not only that such phaenomena
have existed in modern times, but        that the accounts of si
milar events in former ages are in a high degree probable.
As this   is the first time that stones are known to have fallen
in this part of America, it may not      be uninteresting to those
who have paid little attention to this subject, or who still
hesitate to admit that such things have happened, to see a
statement of several similar events in other countries, and
some of the evidence by which they are supported.
    In  1492,   on the 7th of November,      at Ensishcim    in  Up
per Alsace, a stone fell from the atmosphere which weighed
860 pounds.        Contemporary writers agree in slating, that
on this day, between 1 1 and 12 o'clock in the morning, a
loud explosion was heard at Ensishcim, and that this stone
was soon after seen to fall in a field at no great distance
from the town.        This stone, till within    a few years, was
preserved in the parish of Ensisheim.
    In 1762, two stones fell at Verona, one       of which weighed
800 and the other 300 pounds.            Three    or four hundred
persons were witnesses of the event.
    In  1790,   on the 24th of  July, a shower of stones fell near
Agenin, Guienne.         About nine or     ten  o'clock   at night a
meteor was seen moving through the atmosphere with very
great velocity.      A loud explosion was soon heard, which
was followed after a short interval by a shower of stones
over a considerable extent of country*

244     An Account of a Shower of Meteoric Stones:
   In April 1802, the same thing happened at L'Aiglei
Biot,   member of the French National Institute, who visited
         a
the place to ascertain the fact, writes to this effect. Persons
of all professions, manners         and opinions,             —ecclesiastics, sol
diers and labourers, men, women,                        and   children, — agree in
referring the event to the same day, the sam&-hour, and the
same minute.          They say they saw the stones descending
along the        roofs of the houses, break the branches of the
trees,   and rebound after they fell upon the pavement.                        They
say they saw             smoke around the largest of them,
                    the earth
and that the stones were still hot after they had taken them
in their hands. The mineralogical collections formed on
the spot with the greatest care contained nothing of the
kind. On a sudden, and only since the time of the meteor,
these stones have been found,                and    within     a    certain extent.
   Within fifteen       years past       the      falling of similar bodies*
under similar        circumstances,           has       happened       in Portugal,
Bohemia, France, Great Britain, India, and                          South America.
   To account for the existence of                        these stones, various
theories       been formed by philosophers.
             have                                Some have
supposed  them  to be only common stones  struck  with light
ning and partly melted. But this theory has now no advo
cates. A less fanciful hypothesis                 is,
                                    that they are masses of
matter thrown from volcanoes. But to this there are serious
objections.  No such bodies are found near the craters of
volcanoes, or are known to be projected from them. ^And
in many instances these bodies have fallen several hundred
and even several thousand miles from any known volcano.
Mr. Edward King has varied this theory, and supposes that
these substances  are thrown from volcanoes not in solid
masses,      but in the state of ashes or dust.
                                           He supposes that
these    ashes descending in cloud become condensed, take
                                    a
fire, and produce numerous explosionsg.   According to him,
the pyritical, metallic, and argillaceous particles melt, are
suddenly crystallized        and    consolidated,             and    fall in masses
to the ground.     This explanation evidently involves as great
difficulties as those which       intended to obviate. Some
                                   it   is
philosophers    have  supposed  that  these stones are thrown
from terrestrial comets.           Not       to    mention any other objec

tiop to this hypothesis, it will by no means account for
such a phenomenon as appeared at Sienna in 1794, when
stones descended, not from a moving meteor, but from a lu
minous cloud.            Other philosophers, ascribing to these stones
an origin still more extraordinary,         suppose them to be pro
jected from the moon.               Admitting that bodies can be pro
jected beyond the sphere            of the moon's attraction, they must
move round the earth              in one of the conic sections, and all
the difficulties         attending      the   preceding         hypothesis            em
barrass this.        The subject must         be acknowledged to be in
volved in much            obscurity, and the phaenomenon, till we
are possessed       of   more facts and better observations, must be
considered inexplicable.

Une       of the
             phaenomena  most worthy the attention of na
         is the profound sleep called lethargy, to which a
turalists,
great number of cold-blooded animals are subject during
winter, and several warm-blooded animals also, such as
monkeys,       bats,      dormice,     hedgehogs, &c.
      Several authors, both antient and modern, have treated on
this subject    ;   but    as they have not made proptr observations
and   experiments,          their writings leave us in much uncer
tainty.   The JJational Institute of France has therefore in
vited the learned of Europe to examine carefully, 1st, the
phaenomena presented in winter by the lethargy of animals ;
2dly, the cause of this lethargy ; 3dly, why it is peculiar to
these animals.
  Without pretending to give a complete solution of a
problem, which, as it is announced, appears to me to be
attended with difficulty, and particularly the latter part                              of
it,
  I  shall detail what   have remarked respecting several
                                I                                                       of

 246      On the Torpidity   of Monkeys and oilier Animals.
     I flatter myself that the results of my observations will
 communicate to the learned the principal phenomena which
 attend the lethargy of these mammiferous animals, the order
 pursued by their principal organic functions, and the nature
 of the action of a high or low temperature upon their in
 ternal (Economy.
    I shall say nothing of the habits of these animals in the
 natural state, and in the state of slavery ; I shall perhaps
have occasion to speak of this at another time : — at present
I  mean     to confine myself to an account        of what    I have ob
served     hi monkeys, which are the most remarkable among
 the animals subject to periodical lethargy.
    The principal object of my observations has been to ex-
amine the various phenomena presented by monkeys during
their lethargy, far different from the mortal lethargy, which
may take place in all animals from the effects of cold.                  I
have particularly     studied the progress of their principal         or-*
ganic functions,     because physiologists      are generally     at va-
xiance upon this subject ; some pretending that these func
tions are entirely suspendedj and others that they continue,
although in a languishing manner, scarcely sufficient to evince;
the existence of the vital principle.
    A   celebrated  naturalist  of  the last century expresses     him
self in the following manner:—
    " When sleep commences, the respiration then becomes
less ; it ceases when the lethargy is complete.             The eyes of
the monkey are then closed, its body is bent in the form of
a bow, it is immoveable and entirely cold.              We may roll it
about, throw it up      into  the  air, and use  it ill  without giving
the smallest signs of life."         The same author asserts that a
sharper degree of cold, in place of awakening monkeys, ren
ders their lethargy much more profound.
    I shall not quote what other authors have since written
upon the subject, as it is evident they have not -made the
observations necessary to enable them to decide upon the
cause.
   On the first of December 1 803, there         were brought to me
at  Milan three male monkeys, taken in            the   Alps which   se
                                                                  parate

        On the Torpidity    of Monkeys and         other Animals.     247
parate the territory    of Chiavenne from that of the Grisons.
One     of  the  three  was a little awake : I preserved it two
years, in order to study its habits.            The other two    were in
the lethargic state.
   The same day I weighed the latter, in order to ascertain
how much of their weight they lost in a given time of con
stant lethargy ; the one weighed 25 Milanese ounces, and
the second 22 ounces       3 deniers    *. At first sight   they seemed
as  if totally deprived of life    ;  they were rolled up like a ball,
with    the   nose  applied to      the  anus, their eyes closed, the
teeth locked,     and  they felt perfectly cold when taken into
the hands.
    When pinched, however, or shaken, they gave unequi
vocal signs of irritability ; and sometimes, although rarely,
I perceived a feeble dilatation and a successive sinking in
the flanks, or other signs of a languishing respiration.
    The two monkeys remainfed in the most profound lethargy
until January 3d, 1804. Reaumur's thermometer, placed
in the room where they were, having varied from five to
nine degrees above       zero, on the evening of this day the
largest awoke and        removed      from its companion, in order
to find a place where it might be more secure from the cold.
    As soon as I saw that it was awake, I weighed both ; and
I  found that the largest       had lost 18 deniers      of its primitive
weight, and the other         1 7{,     At  the end    of 24 hours, the
monkey which had awoke, again fell into a lethargy, and
remained in this state until the 1 1th ; the temperature of
the room being from 5 to 8 degrees.
    On the 11th in the evening, the external temperature
being about 4 degrees, I exposed the same animal to the
free air on the sole of my window.                   A short time after
wards it began to tremble and give signs of pain.                  I also
remarked a small indication of breathing ; and fearing lest a
greater cold should waken it entirely, I replaced it in its bed
in about     an hour.   In spite of my precaution its respiration
became      more frequent.        In fact, two hours afterwards          I
found     it almost entirely awake ; but it had not removed
                 • The denier is the 24th part of an ounce.
                                      Q  4                          from

from its place, and it soon fell asleep again. Other experi
ments awoke it again some days afterwards, and it returned
for the fourth time to its lethargic state in ahout 24 hours.
   I    have said that more than once                       I   saw unequivocal signs
of a very slow respiration.   I was anxious to ascertain by
experiments and repeated observations if this respiration was
regularly periodical. Consequently, on the 4th of February,
at nine o'clock in the evening, I placed the smallest monkey
under     a   bell-glass,       the edges         of which        were   in some      very
clear lime-water.               In     the midst       of   the bell-glass was a pe
destal, on which was                 concave piece of wood where the
                                       a
monkey lay           as   in a nest.    I took care that the water was
exactly of a level              within and without the bell-glass at the
moment of immersion                    ;    and on the 5th        of February,    at nine
o'clock in  the morning, I found that it had risen about three
lines in the inside of the bell-glass, and that a pellicle was
formed at its surface. It now remained to examine the
state    of   the air contained under the bell-glass,                     and the na
ture    of    the pellicle.
   I    tried the air with             Volta's      celebrated     eudiometer, and          I
found that it had         part of its oxygen ; some drops of
                                lost   a
nitric acid, poured upon the pellicle, produced a very brisk
effervescence and liberating carbonic acid.   These two ex
periments convinced me that during the lethargic sleep
respiration is not suspended : whence it may be presumed
that circulation also continues, but with a languor propor
tioned        to   that   of    the respiration.            I   have since been       con
vinced   of this by examining with a good microscope the
wings  of  bats in the lethargic state ; and I shall have occa
sion to speak of this in a subsequent memoir.
   The smallest of the two monkeys in my experiments
continuing in the most profound lethargy, I fixed my eyes
upon     it,   and examining               it   with attention,   I   perceived   a   very
feeble alternate          depression and rising in its flanks.                   I    took
my watch, and             I    ascertained        that these unequivocal signs          of
respiration were renewed at intervals of four minutes or four
minutes and     half, and that there were 14 m an hour;
                     a
and whereas           when perfectly awake there were about 1500.
  Such        is   the law to which these animals are subject in one
                                                                                       of

of  the principal organic functions in their natural, which             I
call their preservative, lethargy, in orde& to distinguish it
from that produced by an excessive cold : this part is gene
rally followed by gangrene and death, and on that account
I  think it should be called mortal lethargy.
    If it excite surprise that I placed the monkeys in a tem
perature of six or nine degrees, I answer, that in general
the mammiferae subject to periodical lethargy hide them
selves in holes where the temperature is mild         :   without this
precaution they would be awakened by the            pain which the
cold would occasion ; and       if  they were not able to avoid it
they would be seized by the mortal lethargy, when gangrene
 and death would succeed.
     Indeed, having frequently during the winter visited a
 famous grotto in this department, in which were several
 hundred torpid bats, I ascertained with a good Reaumur's
 thermometer,      that the temperature of this grotto was con
 stantly above    nine degrees.      We may be convinced that
 the temperature of the holes they dig is the same, when we
 reflect upon their depth, upon the care with which they
 close up the entrance, and upon their strewing their beds
 with hay. We must also observe, that their fat contributes
 much to preserve them from cold.           It is true they inhabit
  places covered with snow for several months ; but this snow
 is useful, as it hinders the frost from penetrating to them.
      A moderate temperature is necessary for the continuation
  of the preservative lethargy : animals subject to it feel pain,
  and are awakened by an increased cold; they tremble, and
  show the most ardent desire to find a place where they can
  get rid of it; — of this I have been frequently convinced.
      At the end of December 1799, some spiders in my apart
  ment were awakened by the sharpness of the cold, and they
  turned to all corners where they might avoid it.
      On  the morning    of the  4th   of February,     1 803,   I  found
  upon the sole of my window a common bat, dead.                      This
  poor   animal  had   been   torpid  for some   months    in  a  hole  of
  an adjoining wall, and had been, no doubt, awakened
  by the intense cold of the preceding night, which was
   i1  degrees.   It  had flown    to my chamber window            in the
                                                                     hope

     250    On the Torpidity  of Monkeys and      other Animals.
     hope  of getting in ; but its wings having been too torpid to
    enable it to fly further, on being disappointed, it was at
    tacked with the mortal lethargy, and died.
       To return to my observations an the monkeys :— •
       Oh the 5th of February,       having again weighed them, I
    found the smallest weighed      21 ounces, and the second 22
    ounces and 21 deniers.
       The small one, from the first time I had weighed it un
   til the 5 th of February, had only awoke once, on the 4th of
   January, and continued awake for 24 hours. From this it
   results, that since the 1st of January the loss of its weight
   was reduced to about 9 deniers, while the largest, which had
   awoke several times, had lost 33 deniers in the same in
   terval.
      This difference of weight     proves  evidently that the fat of
  these animals is very useful    :  not only do they consume a
  part of it during their lethargic state, but they are also fed
  by it in the intervals of being awake from a lowered or in
  creased temperature.      In fact, we    are perfectly certain that
  they pass these waking periods       without food, and that this
  fasting causes no inconvenience.
      On the same day, the 5th of February,         having placed the
 largest of the monkeys on a pedestal, and covered it with a
 bell-glass, the edges of which rested on a receiver filled with
 lime-water, I fixed my eyes upon it for an hour, in order
 to have a better view of the phaenomena of respiration; and
 I   was convinced beyond a doubt, that during this time the
motions of inspiration and expiration were repeated 15 times
 in   a distinct manner,   and at three     intervals  of four or  five
 minutes each.
      On the  same day, at nine   o'clock in   the evening,   I placed
the small monkey upon the         outside of my window in        a bed
of hay. It remained for some time immoveable,                  simply
giving those signs of a languishing respiration which always
continues during lethargy ; but in an hour I perceived that
its respiration became more frequent, and that it appeared
rather asleep than torpid ; so that the external temperature,
which was three degrees and a half above zero, in place of
diminishing the respiration, had considerably increased it.
                                                             I  would

        On   the   Torpidity of Monkeys and other Animals.        25 I
I   would have left it an hour longer in the same situation ;
but observing that its respiration continued to increase, and
perceiving upon touching it that the heat of its body was
greatly increased, I withdrew it and returned it to its usual
place in the room.             I flattered myself that it would not
waken entirely ; hut having visited it about ten o'clock, I
not only found it awake, but saw that it had resumed its
natural heat and vivacity : it leapt suddenly from its nest
and hid itself among the hay as if to avoid the cold, or any
other accident which might take it from its gentle lethargy.
     Hence it follows, that less time is      required to bring mon
keys out of torpidity than to plunge          them into it.
     The other monkey, which I had            placed  under the bell-
glass, assumed in its little cradle            a position  to preserve
 itself from the cold, and continued to give signs of respi
ration 14 or        15 times in an hour.     I also observed that the
 water had risen in the bell-glass, and that a pellicle of car
bonate       of lime   was formed.
      On    the   6th of February, the thermometer in the room
 being at 6'      or  7°, at one o'clock P. M., the external tem
 perature having risen to 7{°, I resolved to expose the
 torpid monkey, which bad been below the bell-glass, upon
  the sole of my window. My object was to ascertain it the
  action of cold, when it increased insensibly, would produce
  upon the animal the same effects which a sudden transition
  caused, although there was never any difference between
  the temperature of the room and that of the external atmo
  sphere.
      For two hours and a half the monkey exhibited no in
  creased signs of life ; but about six o'clock I perceived some
  indications of a strong respiration.         The night approaching,
  the thermometer gradually fell, so that on the outside of
  the window the thermometer was at 4° only. At this mo
  ment     I  saw the monkey agitated      by convulsive movements
   as  if from    pain  : it afterwards stretched itself in its cradle,
   its respiration increased gradually until it appeared no longer
   to be torpid, but rather asleep.        At seven o'clock it respired
    16 times per minute, whereas while in a torpid state it re
   spired only 15 tunes an hour.            The heat of its body, as
                                                                   tried

   252    On the Torpidity    of Monkeys and    other Animals.
  tried by the thermometer, increased with the frequency of
  respiration,   so that by half-past nine o'clock it was perfect
  ly awake.
     Convinced by this      experiment that the action of cold,
  although it increases almost insensibly, occasions pain to
  animals in a state of torpidity, I returned the monkey to its
  bed  of hay. I tried to make it walk upon the carpet, but it
  could not use its hind legs, which were torpid from having
  been so far from the chest.
     On the 20th of February, at seven o'clock in the morn
 ing, I tried another experiment with the largest torpid mon
 key : I placed it outside my window in a vessel surrounded
 by ice and muriate of lime.          This mixture produced so in
 tense  a  cold in  the  receiver,   that the thermometer I placed
 in it fell to 7° below zero.
     This sudden transition did not excite any sudden convul
 sive movements in the monkey : in half an hour I observed
 it to give signs of pain. I observed increasing signs of re
 spiration and expiration, which must have fatigued it much.
 It was eleven o'clock, however, before it was completely
 awake.      The cold continued very sharp, and it         tried   to
 escape   from it several times, by moving from side        to   side
in great pain throughout       the night.   .
    I visited it several times, and found it always trembling :
its eyes were half closed.        It did not sleep, however, al
though I left it exposed to the same cold till nine o'clock
next morning.        I am convinced that a sharper cold would
in a short time have plunged it into that lethargy which is
followed by death, when no assistance is given to prevent it.
    I have here detailed only the general outlines of my ob
servations upon monkeys.           In a subsequent memoir I shall
publish my experiments upon bats, hedgehogs, &c. : and
I flatter myself that their result will be an accurate know-
lege   of the causes which plunge animals into a torpid sleep.

        I. Filices.     IT. Musci.          III. Algae.     IV. Fungi.
                                  REMARKS.
     I. — The   Class   IV. Tetrandria,              being a numerous one,
  Linnaeus    chose   to  separate      it into  two,   and an opportunity
  presented itself from the consideration of the differences
  which occur in plants having four stamina, from the pro
  portion of these. Didynamia expresses this ifference; and
  the flowers are either ringent or personate, a natural tribe.
  But as all the ringent flowers are not included in the class
  Didynamia,       some coming under class II. Diandria, there
  can be no good reason for not making this real division of a
  class into an order.         The system hence becomes more easy
  and regular,    and in fact, frequently, more natural.*
     II. — The Class VI. Hexandria,                   also readily separates
  into  two   parts, from    the    like    consideration of the proportion
  in  the stamina, and      Tetradynamia              contains   the natural
  tribe  of cruciform plants.
                                                                   III.-The

            The reformed Sexual System          of hinnceus.       255
    III. — The    Class  XIII. Polyandria, also readily divides
into two parts,      from    the consideration of the insertion of
the stamina ; and one of these, the Icosandria of Linnaeus,
possesses many edible fruits ; but as it is not altogether a
natural class, therefore no one can          regret   seeing  this part
distinguished     as an   order.
    IV .—In    theMoNADELPHiA of Linnaeus, many of the nu
merical names, which had been used to characterize the
classes,   are   employed to distinguish the orders, or subdi
visions,   as  Pentandria, Decandria, &c, and hence arises
a confusion     unavoidably perplexing to the young student,
and which our method, as is evident, completely removes.
The same observation applies to the classes Diadelphia,
 Polyadelphia,      Gynandria, Moncecia,         Dicecia,    where the
same            I
         (may call it so) impropriety occurs.             This class in
Linnaeus is not natural, hut, being made into orders, many
of them then become natural             as  ordert, as the    Colum-
 nifer^e.
    V. — The Papilionaceous         Flowers, as they are generally
termed, form the order Decandria in the class Diadelphia
 of Linnaeus ; but the author, unwilling, as it would seem,
 to make any breach in so natural an assemblage of plants,
 has so far deviated from the principles of his system, as to
 refer to that class       several genera, which strictly belong to
 the preceding     class,  being in fact Mojiadelpkious.       This in
 convenience is entirely obviated in the present scheme,
 where Monadelphia and Diodclphia constitute two successive
 orders in our class      X. Decandria.
    VI. — Polyadelphia           is a small,   and, as Doctor Smith
 observes,    "  rather an unnatural     class."     Most persons are
 shocked to see Citrus, the orange, in this class, and not
 in the Icosandria class; for Linnaeus describes it of the
 class XVIII. Polyadelphia, order III. Icosandria.                 Now
 in our Reformed Sexual System, it comes under class XIII.
  Polyandria, order Icosandria, in juxta-position with other
 edible fruits,    in the subdivision   Polyadelphia.
     VII. — Class V. Pentandria,           a very numerous class,     is
  subdivided by Syngenesia, and so formed into two classes
 by Linnaeus, the latter of which, however, as containing
                                                                     an

   256          The reformed Sexual System           of Lmneeus.
   an order Monogamia,           is not therefore altogether a natural
   class.    We obviate this by making Syngenesia an order,
   and the subdivision Polygamia to contain the natural tribe
   of  compound      flowers   ;   whilst,   under    another    subdivision,
   Monogamia, many plants, not having compound                         Sowers,
   arrange themselves.
      VIII.    Against GYNANDRIA, which Doctor Smith calls
   " an   odd and miscellaneous class," there lies the same ob
  jection,    as   we observed      above,    as  against     the class  DIA-
   DELPHTA,      the numerical names         of Classes being applied to
   Orders.     In our scheme, class II. DIANDRIA, has an order
   Gynandria, which contains the natural tribe of ORCHISES ;
  and thus the mind is delighted to see a natural assemblage
  embraced in an order, if not in a class.                The separation of
  the remainder cannot be regretted,           as not possessing amongst
  each other the smallest affinity.
     IX.    MoNfficiA     is a miscellaneous class, and borrows the
 names     of its secondary divisions from most of                 the other
 classes,    as    Monandria,       Diandria,      &c.,    nay even from
 Monadelpkia, Syngenesia,              and    Gynandria ; for all these
 become, in Linnaeus'* Sexual System, orders. In our
 scheme, class TRIANDRIA, order Monoecia, contains mostly
 grasses   : hence we retain this natural assemblage in the same
 class at least, if not in the same order.
     X. DIOSCIA. The same remarks apply here, as in Mo-
 NCECIA.
    XI.     POLYGAMIA subdivides the classes Moncecia and
Dicecia; therefore in the logic of science it is in reality an
order.
                 " Pascitur in vivis livor, post fata quiescit,
                    Tum suis ex meritis cuique tuctur honos."       LINK.
    SOME apology is certainly necessary, after any endeavour
to   reform so celebrated and established                a system as the
Sexual System of the illustrious Linnaeus.                    Many altera
tions in this system have been attempted. The enlight
ened -pupil of Linnaeus, Thunberg,                 abolished the classes
XX.     Gynandria,        XXI.      Moncecin,      XXII.      Dioecia,   and
                                                                XXIII.   Po-

              Tiie reformed Sexual System bfLinncbus.                    257
XXfll.     Polygamia.         Gmelirii professor at Gottingeu, to
the alterations introduced by Thunberg, in publishing a new
edition of Linnoeus's Systema Naturae, added the abolition
of class XII. Icosundria 5 aiid the no less celebrated Doctor
Smith, preserving the rest of the system entire, has abo
lished order      V. Monogamia,         in class    IX. Syngenesis and
class   XIII. Polygamia.           " To   his   class   Polygamia," says
Doctor Smith, " many students of tropical plants justly
objected in his lifetime, and he, as well as his son, listened!
to   their   observations."        Dr. Withering, in his Arrange
ment of British Plants, has followed the system of Gmelin*
Professor Martyn, speaking of the changes introduced by
Schreber, in his new edition of Linnaeus's Genera Plan-
t.arum,    says,  that his reduction         of   class   XX* Gynandria,
appears
            "  reasonable," yet the       singularity of the order Di-
andria surely demanded a separate place to itself. But when
he comes to mention the incorporation by Gmelin of the
class Icosandria into the Polyandria, he declares this change
to be   " abominable."
    I an> aware, that venturing to reform in such a degree
the Sexual System, as I have done, will bring upon me,
with some, much severe reproach. I am conscious, in
deed, as well as others, that the credit of the Sexual System
of Linnaeus,       as an    invention, surpasses       all power  of praise,
and hence has found enthusiastic admirers;                 and  with timid
hands I have ventured to take to pieces the superstructure
he raised, and build up from the old materials, which I have
Carefully and religiously preserved, a new edifice, suited
to modern improvement and convenience ; hoping, how
ever, that those who may, hereafter, publish the works of
Linnaeus,      will  edite the Sexual System as delivered          by him
self, and not bring forward, in the works said to be those
of Linnaeus, what he never either thought or wrote. For a
full  defence   of the Reformed Sexual System, vide my "Prac
tical Botany, being a New Illustration of the Genera of
Plants, with Dissections of each Genus," where this subject
has been particularly considered and discussed.

this is contrived to accomplish the proposed end, the better
such a system will be accounted ; and I have endeavoured
so to contrive this, thai I hope no longer any very great
obstacles can arise in the way of the student, and that this
will plead my excuse with a discerning and indulgent public
for venturing to step out of the beaten path, to attempt the
reformation of a system which has conferred immortal ho
nour upon the inventor, and received the general plaudits
and admiration of the learned throughout Europe.       It ap
peared  to me  more   advisable to reform the whole, than  to
make any partial amendments             ;    either to adopt the system
as delivered     to us by Linnaeus,         or to have the present sy
stem, as erected out of the materials                  of   the old ; a system
which I hope may not moulder, like the other systems*,
into the sand of which they were composed, but resemble
the youthful Phoenix arising from the ashes of its parent;
ut , as a rock in the midst of the ocean, may remain until
"   the wreck     of matter   and the crush        of worlds."
    It   is certainly a great satisfaction for me            to rind,    that al
though the learned and venerable           Professor Martyn has long
openly disapproved of         the    changes made in the Sexual Sy
stem by the several reformers,              yet he writes to me —

   Similar    are the flattering         opinions also of several other
distinguished     botanists,    who have expressed their approval

-Danoalore,          or Bangalura, was founded by Hyder, and
during the judicious government of that prince became a
place of importance.            Its trade was then great, and its
manufactures numerous.               Tip poo began its misfortunes by
prohibiting    the trade with the dominions of Arcot and Hy
derabad, because        he detested        the powers governing             both

                                     large
he forced the merchants to take at a high rate.    These op
pressions had greatly injured the place ; but it was still po
pulous, and many individuals were rich, when lord Corn-
Wallis arrived before with his army in great distress from

                                      reduced
giving the assault immediately, and the town was of course
plundered.   The rich inhabitants had previously removed
their most valuable effects into the fort  but these too fell

prey to the invaders, when that citadel also was taken
storm.   After the English left the place, Tippoo encouraged
the inhabitants to come back, and                        by
                                             promises allured
them to collect together the wrecks of their fortifnes, from
the different places to which these had been conveyed.    No
sooner had he effected this, than, under pretence of their
having been friendly to the English, he surrounded the place
with troops, and fleeced the inhabitants, till even the wo
men were obliged to part with their most trifling ornaments.
He then kept them shut up within         hedge, which sur
                                                    a
rounded the town at the distance               of   a   coss,   till the advance
of   the army under general          Harris   made the guard withdraw.
The inhabitants,      not knowing whom to trust, immediately
dispersed, and      for some months the place continued de
serted.      The people, however,            are now  flocking to   from
                                                                       it

trade and manufactures increase apace               ;   and the imports and
exports are estimated already to amount to one fourth of
what they were in its most flourishing state.         The manu
facturers and petty traders are still very distrustful and timid;
but the merchants,  many of whom have been at Madras,
and are acquainted with British policy, seem to have the
utmost confidence in the protection of our government.
  The trade of the country not having been yet opened                         a
year since the inhabitants had deserted the place, no proper
estimate can be formed of the quantity of exports and im
ports but         on the increase every month, and      now

       and the Processes used in Dyeing Silk and Cotton.              261
 house states      the following particulars of the trade at that
 period.    In  one  year there were imported 1500 bullock-loads
 of cotton wool ; 50 bullock-loads of cotton thread ; 230
bullock-loads of raw silk ; 7000 bullock-loads of salt ; fo
 reign goods from Madras 300 bullock-loads.               At the same
 time were exported of betel-nut 4000 bullock-loads, and of
 pepper 400 bullock-loads.
    From the quantity of the raw materials some estimate
 maybe formed of the extent of the manufactures : 1500
bullock-loads      of cotton wool, and 50 of cotton thread, make
rather more than 5100 hundred weight, worth about 81 Co/.,
 and 230 bullock-loads of raw silk make 4 7,437 ; lbs., worth
about 27,000/.
    The cloths     here being entirely for country use,       and never
having been exported         to Europe,   are made   of different sizes,
 to adapt them to the dress of the natives ; and the Hindus
 seldom use tailors, but wrap round their bodies the cloth,
as it comes from the weaver.
     1. The cloth which the women wrap round their haunches,
and     then throw over their heads       and shoulders like     a   veil,
is from     14  to 17 cubits long,   and from    2 to  S[ cubits wide.
 It  is called shiraij.                                               •
    2. If these cloths are for the use      of girls, they are called
 kirigay ; and are from 9 to 12 cubits long, and from              If   to
 If   cubit broad.
    3. The little jacket which the women at this place wear,
is made up in pieces containing 1 2 jackets, and called cu*
pissa tan.        These are 14f cubits long, and two cubits or
two cubits and a nail broad.
    4. Men wrap round them a cloth called dotra, which if
from 10 to 12 cubits long, and from 2J- to 2f cubits broad.
    5. The wrappers of boys, called Imcha knana, are 6 or
7 cubits long, and
 -
                         If  or  If cubit broad.
    0. Cloth for wrapping round the head and shoulders of
men, like shawls, is named shalnama ; and is 6 cubits long,
and 24 broad.         Smaller ones are made for children.
    7. Paggoo,      or turban pieces, are from        30 to 60 cubits
long, and      f  of a cubit broad.
    Having assembled       the different kinds    of weavers,    I  took
                                   K 3                             from

?62     On the Manufactures carried on at Bangahtre,
from   them the following account of their various manu
factures :
   The puttuegars, or silk-weavers, make cloth of a very
rich stro- t fabric. The patterns for the first five kinds of
dresses are similar to each other, but are very much varied by
the different colours employed, and the different figures
woven in the cloth j for they rarely consist of plain work-
Each pattern has an appropriate name, and, for the com
mon sale, is wrought of three different degrees of fineness.
If any person chooses to commission them, whatever parts
of the pattern he likes may be wrought in gold thread ; but,
as this greatly enhances the value, such cloths are never
wrought except when commissioned               The fabric of the
sixth kind   of  dress is also strong and rich ; but     the figures
resemble those on the shawls of Cashemire.
   The turbans are made of a thin fabric of cotton and silk.
   The puttuegars make also, in a variety of figured pat
terns, the first three kinds of dresses of silk and cotton.
   They also make sada putaynshina, or thin white muslins
with silk borders. These are either plain, or dotted in the
loom with silk or cotton thread ; and are frequently orna
mented with gold and silver.         This is an elegant manufac
ture, and is fitted for the first five kinds of dresses.
   Plain green muslin with silk borders for the first three
kinds  of  dresses   is also made by the puttuegars;         but not
of so fine a quality as that made by the devangas,        as  will be
afterwards mentioned,
   The same may be said of the coloured striped muslin
with silk borders, called dutari huvina, which is used also
entirely for female dresses, and is wrought of various pat
terns.
   The puttuegars dye much of their own silk ; and they
gave me the following account of their processes :
   The silk is thus prepared for dyeing, the operation being
performed sometimes on the raw material, and sometimes
on the thread, Take 5 seers [3-fy^\b.) of silk, 3 seers
OtWitIu0 Pf       sou^u  Qr impure    soda,  and 14. (o-rV^lb.) of
quick-lime   ;  mix the    soda  and lime with 4 or     5 seers,   or
about 808 cubical inches,       of water,   and boil them,  for half
 1                                                                 m

        and the Processes used for Dyeing Silk and Cotton. 863
 an hour.       One half of the boiling ley is poured into a wide-
mouthed pot, and one half of the silk is immediately put
into it suspended on a stick.            If it be not sufficiently wet,
it will not     take the colour ; and if it be allowed to remain
any length of time, the silk is destroyed. The rest of the
silk is now dipt into the remaining ley, then washed in cold
water, and dried in the sun.
    If a  white silk be wanted, take three                seers (l-rWs-'M o^
prepared      silk,   3 seers    of soulu or impure soda, I dudu
weight (oWsV drachms avoirdupois) of indigo, and 18 seers
(about 1835 cubical inches) of water ; boil them for about
two hours. Then wash the boiled silk in some hot water,
and dry it.       In this operation much          care is necessary, as by
too much of the soda the silk is apt to be spoiled ; and if
it be boiled too short a time it will not be sufficiently white.
The workmen judge of             the time by taking up a few threads
on    a stick, and putting on them a drop of cold water :
whenever they appear of a proper colour, the silk must be
immediately washed in clean water.
    To give    the red dye with lac, lake          l\maund        {SK+faWi.)   of
lac,     Icartd from      the   sticks,    l\   seer      (0-pfflv\\i.)  of lodu
bark,     1|  seer  of suja cara, or       soda,      and two dudus weight
 (,2-r"0Vir  drachms) of turmeric.            Put them into a narrow-
mouthed        pot, capable     of   holding 80 seers (5492 cubical
inches),     with 40 seers (2746- cubical inches) of water, and
boil them four hours; then              decant the liquor, which is
impregnated with the dye ; and having to the same ma
terials added 20 seers (1373 cubical inches) more of water,
boil them again for three hours ; decant this liquor into
the former, and then, for three                hours, boil        the materials
a   third    time,     with    10 seers      (G86i       cubical     inches) of
water.      Decant     this   also   into    the two former, and pre
serve,    in a covered      pot, the whole liquor for eight days.
At the end of this period the workman judges how much
silk his materials will dye. If the lac has been good, it
will   dye 5 seers (3-fWvIbO- but           if it  be poor, it     will not dye
more than       3\ seers (2-rVoVn)-         For     5   seers  °f silk   take 20
seers (12-fWlb.) of        tamarinds,     and for two days infuse them
in 18 seers (1235 cubical inches) of waser.                   Then strain the
                                      R4                                infusion

864        On the Manufactures          carried on at Bangalore,
infusion through a thick cloth, till about 5 ieers (343 cu»
bical inches) of clear infusion are procured.   Put this into
a large open pot with the silk, and warm them until they
be rather too hot for the hand.   Take out the silk, and pour
jnto the warm infusion of tamarinds three quarters of the
decoction of lac, strained through a cloth. Then return the
silk, and boil it for three hours. After this, examine the
silk. If it have received a proper colour, nothing more is
added ; but  if the colour be not deep enough, the remaining
decoction is strained, and added by degrees till the colour
is completed.    The pot must then be taken from the fire,
and from time to time this silk must be examined with a
stick.  If the colour be blackish, some tamarind infusion
must be added.  If too light, it must be again boiled with
some more of the decoction of lac: when cool, the silk
must be washed in cold tank water, and dried in the shade.
This is the finest red dye in use here : in some places cochi
neal is used ; but it is much more expensive. The lac dye
is not discharged by washing.
   The puttuegars dye their silk of a pale orange colour,
with the capili podi, or dust collected from the fruit of the
rotleria iinctoria. For 5 seers of silk (3-rV^B-lb.) prepared
for dyeing, take three seers (1-rVgVlb.) of capili reduced
to a fine powder, and sifted through a cloth ; 4 dudus
OtVitV055.) weight of sesamum oil; \\ seer (l2-r^y0Z.)

0-r¥tfVozO of alum ; — and put              them in a pot.         Then take
2^-                 of soulu, and boil it in about 3+ seers
      seers (l-ifti^-lb.)
(240  cubical inches) of water, till it be dissolved.  With
this solution moisten the powders that are in the pot, and
form them into a paste, which is to be divided in three
equal parts.  Put one of these portions in the remaining sor
Jution of soulu, and heat          it,   but not so   as   to boil.        Then
put in the silk, prepared          as   before, and wet      it   thoroughly.
Take    it   out, and add   a   little water, and   a   second portion       of
the paste.    This being dissolved, soak in     the silk as be

  The niligaru dye all the other colours such as light and       ;
dark blue, sky blue, and purple.   The silk  never dyed in              is
the piece.
  The red and orange-coloured silks are mostly in demand.
     Some        called cuttery, who pretend'to be of the
                weavers
Kshatriya cast, manufacture exactly the same kinds of goods
as theputtuegars.
  The whole of the demand for these goods, according to
the account of the manufacturers, in.the country formerly
                                                     is

of the price of the goods which he commissions   but when                       ;
the demand     small, the manufacturers borrow money from

  466     On ike Manufactures          carried on at Bangalore,
    The master      weavers keep from two to five         servants, who
 are paid    by the piece. Workmen that are employed on
 cotton   cloth   with silk borders make daily about a fanam,
 or nearly &d. Those who work in cloth consisting of silk
 entirely, make rather less, or from -J-J (6f pence) to £ (6 pence)
 of a fanam, according to the fineness of the work. It is
 not usual for weavers of any kind in this country, except
 those of the Whallia.ru cast, to employ part of their time in
 agriculture ; but many persons of casts that ought to be
 weavers are in fact farmers.           The cuttery are more affluent
 than the pu.Untga.rs, and these again are more wealthy than
 any other kind of weavers.
    Another kind of manufacture is coloured cotton cloths of
 a thin texture, and with silk borders.            It resembles     one of
the manufactures of the puttuegars, called dutari kuvina,
 but is coarser.      It is entirely fitted for the different kinds of
female dress; and is made of various lengths, from eight to
 sixteen cubits, according to the age and size of the wearers.
In   this way three different kinds of weavers are employed ;
the skaynagaru, the canara devangas, and the teliga de-
vangas.      These people buy the thread at the public markets.
The red thread comes mostly from Advany, Balahari, and
other places near tne Krishna river: the various shades of
blue are dyed by the niligaru.
    The   weavers    themselves    dye part   of  the  red  thread with
the muddi root, which is that of two species ofmorinda ; the
citrifolia of Linnaeus, and the ternifolia described in my
manuscripts.        The colour is dark, but stands washing in
cold water.       In boiling, it    fades.   The following   is the pro
cess used    : — The    thread  must be divided into parcels each
weighing     one seer    (lO-fl^oz.).       For each parcel take    | seer
 (Z^ifooz.) of powdered soulu, and dissolve it in 4 seers
 (274-^ cubical inches) of water.               Put into the solution
%
   seer  of sheep's dung,      and   \ seer  (5-^^ oz.) of      sesamum
oil,  and with the hand mix          the whole well.     Wet the par
cel of thread in this mixture thoroughly, and let it hang up
in the house all night to dry. Next day expose it on a rock
to the sun ; and during the four or five following days it
must be dipped nine times in a solution of J- seer (         I •£•££§ oz.)
                                                                        of

ofsoulu, in one         seer (a little more than €8 cubical inches)
of water.          Between each immersion it must be dried in the
sun.         After this,      the thread remains         in the house           ten days ;
it is then taken            and well washed by beating it on
                            to a tank,
a stone, as is the usual practice of this country.  When it
has been dried, soak each parcel in a solution of two pago
das weight ( I rV^F drachm) of alum in one seer of water, and
then dry it again.   Infuse one seer measure (74-fr cubical
inches) of powdered bark of muddi root, in 4 seers of cold
waier, and in this soak one parcel of thread ; then throw
into a large pot the whole of the parcels that have been
treated in a similar manner. Next day take them to a tank,
beat them as usual,  so as to wash them clean, and then dry
them again in fresh infusions of muddi powder.      This must
be daily repeated,   till the colour is sufficiently strong ;
which, if the bark be from the roots of an old tree, will re
quire six infusions            ;   but nine infusions        of bark from          a young
plant will be requisite.
   These weavers dye cotton thread   green in the following
manner : They send it to the niligaru, who dye it mavi, or
a kind of sky blue. The weavers then wash         and put                 it,             it
into two seers (137^- cubical inches) of water, containing
.J-   seer    (Ws2? oz0            0I- powdered turmeric,

powdered, and the juice of ten limes.     Here the thread                                 is
kept four hours, and the operation   finished.    The colour

      a                                    said that the nili
                                                         It   is

profound secret.
      The     devangas       dye cotton cloth           of   a    fine    red colour re
sembling that            of    the pomegranate flower, and called gule-
nari.         This     is    done with the cossumba, or flowers of the
carthamus tinclorius.   The same gives another red colour,
called simply cossumba.   Neither of the colours are well
fixed. The demand for the cossumba dye being much greater
than the country can supply, much of       imported.    This it   is
is  always done in the form of powder, which powder                                       is
adulterated with the flowers of the yecada, or asclepias gi-
 gantea       ;   on which         account   it   is   cheaper         than the flowers
 produced         in   the    neighbourhood.            The powder            is   made   by
                                                                                    drying

    drying the flowers in the sun, and beating them in a mor
    tar, and will not keep longer than one year ; the flowers,
    if carefully packed in sacks and well pressed, may be pre
   served for five years.
        The cossumba colour is given in the following manner :
   —Take 15 sultany seers (9-rVlb.) °f Pure cossumba powder,
  and put it on a cloth strainer.             Clean it by pouring on wa
  ter, and rubbing it with the hand, till the water runs through
  clear.       The cossumba is then to be spread on a blanket, and
  mixed with 15 dudus weight (&rV^oz.) of suja cara, and
  an equal weight of soulu, both powdered. They are gather
  ed together in the centre of the blanket, and trodden for an
 hour by a workman's feet. They are then put upon a cloth
  strainer,      supported    as   usual   by sticks at the corners      ; and
 water is poured on them until it passes through the strainer
  without colour.           This water is divided into three portions :
 that which came first, that which came in the middle of the
 operation, and that which came last ; the first being of the
 strongest quality.           Then take 60 good limes, or 100 bad
 ones, cut each into two pieces, beat them in a mortar, and
 strain their juiee, through a cloth, into the pot containing
 the dye        of  the first quality.      Then   put a  little water  to the
 skins,      beat them again, and strain           off the water into the
 pot containing           the  second     quality of the dye. Then add
 more water to the lime-skins, and having beat them, strain
 it into the dye of the worst quality.               The cloth to be dyed,
having been well washed, is put into this last pot, and boil
ed for an hour and a half.               It is then dried in the sun, and
dipped       into   the  second    quality of dye, but not boiled.        It is
then dried again, and afterwards kept half an hour in the
dye of the first quality.              At the end of this time, should
the colour not be sufficiently strong, the cloth must be
boiled in the dye. It is then dried, and the operation is
finished.         The cloth commonly dyed is for turbans ; and a
turban 60 cubits long requires 15 seers of cossumba.
      The only difference, in the process for dyeing the gulenari,
is, that       to the pot   of   the  first quality,   as prepared  for dye
ing      cossumba,     is added half     a seer  (34-^ cubical inches) of a
decoction         of tundu flowers .(cedrella toona Roxb. MSS.)^
  .   .                                                             prepared

                           : —Take

 dried tundu flowers, beat them in            a  mortar, and boil them
 for half an hour in 2 seers (l37f cubical inches) of water.
 Then strain the decoction through a cloth for use.
    The devangas frequently make a very dark blue, which
 they call black, by means of the bark of the swamy, or
 Sweitenia fclrifugu Roxb. MSS.                 This colour is cheap;
 but its intensity leaves it on the first washing ; whereas the
 very deep blue imparted by repeated immersions in indigo,
 and approaching near to black, is very high-priced, and
 durable-.      Ir is the colour most esteemed by the natives,
 who call it black.            The devangas take cotton thread or
 cloth    that has been dyed blue by the niligaru with indigo,
 and sprinkle it with a decoction of swamy bark.                    This is
 made by powdering the dry bark, and boiling it for an hour
 and    a half.    While     the cloth or thread is sprinkled,     it must
 be moved       with  the hand,     so as to imbibe the colour equally
 in   every part.
    These weavers say, that they obtain advances from the
 merchants, and borrow money from the bankers, exactly
 on the same terms as the puttuegaru.              They sell their goods
 to merchants, or to private customers, and never carry
 them to the public markets.               None of them follow any
 other business than that          of weaving,    and many are    in good
 circumstances.         The shaynagartt arc the richest.         The ser
 vants are paid by the piece, and make about 20 fanamt
-(135. b\d.) a month.
     A kind of weavers         called bily mugga by the Mussulmans,
 but in    Fact  consistingof    the ensts called Shaynagartt, Padtna-
 shalay, and        Samay-shalay,> weave         many    kinds  of white
  muslins.
     I. Dutary,      striped and chequered muslins, called in Ben
  gal  durias.     They   are from 28 to 32 cubits long, and from
  9 to 1% broad; and, if commissioned, flowers of cotton, or
  gold thread, are frequently woven in them.
     II. Soda shifla, or plain muslin, like the mulmuls o£
  Bengal.       These are from 26 to 32 cubits in length, and            i\
  to 2 cubits in breadth.
      III.  Asto cumbi, a cloth like the cossahs        of Bengal. They
                                                                      have

570          On tke Manufactures         carried on at Bangalore,
have sometimes striped or silver borders, and are always
ornamented with silver at the ends. They are used by men
to wrap round their shoulders.
     IV.
       Turbans from 30 to 100 cubits in length, and from
\ to 1 cubit in width, and ornamented with silver and gold
thread at the ends.
     Each kind        of cloth   has several patterns, and each pattern
is   of three      of fineness, which, in the technical lan
                 degrees
guage of European merchants in India, are marked by the
letters A. B. and C.
  These people say, that they receive advances from the
merchants, and borrow money from the bankers, in the
same manner as the puttnegars do.    Where the cloth is
made on the weaver's own account,    it is sold partly to mer
chants and partly in the weekly markets.     When a weaver
receives advances, he cannot sell any cloth till his contract
be fulfilled.         AmongPadma shalay there are few ser
                                 the
vants employed ; but all the males of a family live together,
and work in the same house, very seldom engaging them
selves to work out for hire.             The Samay shalay               keep more
servants.        The people of         these tw6 classes live better than
those employed   in agriculture. A man at fine work can
gain a fanam (rather more than 8d.) a day. At coarse work
a man cannot make above 3d. a day.     The servants live in
their own houses ; but, although paid by the piece, they
are generally in debt to their masters, and are consequently
bound in the same manner                as   the servants     of the farmers.
This circumstance is applicable to journeymen                      weavers of
every kind.
   The togotaru are a class of weavers that make a coarse,
thick, white cotton cloth with red borders, which among
the poorer class of inhabitants is used as the common waist-
cloths of all ages and sexes. This kind of cloth goes by the
name       of   the   manufacturers      who weave          it,   and    is   also   of
three degrees of fineness.
   The same people make romals, or handkerchiefs                         <with red
borders, from three to five cubits square, that are commonly
used    by
         the poor as     head-dress. The pieces are about
                                 a
twenty cubits long, and are divided into              a   greater or smaller
                                                                          number

     and the Processes used for Dyeing Silk and Cotton.          271
number of handkerchiefs,           according to their width.    They
are also  of three degrees      of fineness.
   The weavers of this class are poor, and say that they can
not afford to make the cloth on their own account.              They
in general     receive    the   thread    from  the  women     in the
neighbourhood,       and     work it up into cloth for hire.      For
weaving    a piece     that is worth Bfanams, or 55. 4±d., they
get Q\fanams,       or  is. 8d. This occupies a workman four or
five days; so that his daily gains are from four to five pence.
They never cultivate the ground.
   The wkuttlaru make a coarse, white, strong cloth called
parcalla.     It serves the poorer male inhabitants, throughout
the country, as a covering for the upper parts of their bodies.
The pieces are from 24 to 28 cubits long, and from 1-J- to
 1} broad, and as usual of three different degrees of fineness.
Weavers of this kind live scattered in the villages, and fre
quently hire themselves out as day-labourers to farmers, or
other persons who will give them employment.
    At the weekly markets the cotton wool is bought up, in
 small quantities, by the poor women of all casts, except the
 Brahmans ; for these never spin, nor do their husbands ever
 plough the soil.       The women of all other casts spin, and at
 the weekly markets sell to the weavers the thread that is not
 wanted for family use.          The thread that is brought from
 Balahari, and other places toward the Krishna, is much
 coarser than that which the women here spin.
    Such is the account          given me by the various weavers ;
 but the cloth agents, who are all of a cast called Nagarit,
 say, that it is not customary to make advances for goods of
 an ordinary kind, unless the demand from a distance be very
 great.   When this        is the case,   or when goods of an un
 commonly high price arc wanted, in order to enable the
 manufacturer to purchase the raw materials, one half of the
 value is advanced. The credit is for three months, and for
 this time there is no interest paid ; but if the goods are not

 On confronting       some of the richer Shaynagaru with               thtf
 Nagarit, they acknowledged          that  this   statement   was  true.
    The places from whence agents are at present employed
 to purchase cloths are, Nagara,           Chatrakal,     Seringapatam,

 A   small quantity of cotton and            silk   cloth  for women's
jackets goes to the lower Carnatic.            This   is the   account of
 the Nagarit;     but  I  have good reason        to think, that a very
large quantity of goods, especially of            the silk manufacture
 called combawutties, are sent to that country,            and are mucb
m request among the women of the rich Brahmans. The
 Nagarit say, that the merchants, who import cotton, take
away silk cloths for the dress of the Brahmans of both sexes,
and also blue and red cotton stuffs ; but not in a quantity
sufficient   to repay    the  whole     cotton.      During the former
government of the Raja's family, much cloth went from this
neighbourhood to Tanjore, Negapatam, and other parts of
the southern Carnatic : but since to that period, this com*
merce has been entirely at a stop.
    The Mangalore merchants send hither for every kind of
cloth. The dress of that country requires cloth only eight
cubits    long.    The pieces intended for that market have
therefore a blank left in their middle.                In Hyder's time
there was a great exportation of cloth to Calicut : but the
troubles in Malabar have put an entire stop to this branch              of
commerce.

information,     to be expected       from an academician, he has
only   given    us  antiquated and superfluous objections, and

                          [Continued from p. 171.]
                               To  Mr. Tilloch.
       SIB,
-L/ime, in        its general attractions, and in its capacity to
neutralize acids, possesses a very superior energy to clay,
and, therefore, is a more decided salifiable base : hence, I
shall give it the preference in any example, in which an
earth,    as belonging to      a distinct genus, is to be contrasted
with silex, whose habitudes           and character are so totally dis
similar.
    Nothing is so frequent in nature as an association of two
or more contending elements to form one homogeneous
compound, or to effect some material purpose : thus, an acid
with   an alkali, sulphur with a metal, and metals with earths,
may be adduced as instances, in which this coexistence of
opposites is, perhaps, as essential as two contrary poles to
the same magnet, or the negative and positive wires of the
Voltaic pile. This proximity is no where more obvious and
frequent than in substances composed of silex and lime, in
which the caustic pungency and other inherent distinctions
of  the lime are coerced into such a state         of neutrality,  as to
evade every mode        of detection, unless    the purity of  the com
pound be destroyed         and the lime eliminated.
   Silex is not only        found alone with lime, but follows         it
throughout,        and in nearly all   its modifications;   and, gene
rally speaking, this seems the primary cause of the saturated
condition of lime in all the native carbonates, such as in
                                                                  chalk,

 chalk, marble, lime-stone,       and other fossil bodies,     of which
 carbonate   of lime forms an extensive portion, so much so,
 as to render    this class of minerals extremely important in all
geological discussions.
    This singular coincidence has not escaped notice, and
many very respectable men have advanced opinions upon the
subject.     It has, indeed, been supposed, that there is a
transmutation of one of these elements into the other, or a
graduation of lime into silex ; and it is asserted that the
recent formation of flmt had been perceived, near the sur
face, in a calcareous mountain, in which, also, animal and
vegetable     substances     were   found    petrified by the silex ;
and that rhomboidal crystals were likewise present, passing
from the state of carbonate of lime to nearly pure silex.
    It is evident, such a theory as this is not tenable, but
must be involved in difficulty, since it assumes a case, of all
others, the most improbable; for, according to these pre
mises, we are compelled to admit, that the diamond, the
oxygen and the lime, that is to say, the real ingredients of
the chalk, all contribute to the formation of silex, which is,
avowedly, one of the most perfectly indecomposable of ele
mentary bodies, and, certainly, much more so than lime.
This conversion of lime into silex is, I presume, quite in
consistent with general facts, and contrary to every object
in nature which contains these t\i* ingredients among its
constituent principles.
   In chalk particularly,      which is one of the most plentiful
of nature's productions, as well as in all the other carbonates
of lime, there is, usually, a very copious assortment of silex,
under one shape or another ; and this is either so intimately
blended   as to be    hardly perceptible to the sight, and, often,
can only be extracted by analysis ; or it occurs in the form
of sand, gravel, or what, in common terms, are caller)/?Ml-
stones.    It   is  necessary   to observe, that     these  stones   are
chiefly of  an obtuse and rounded figure, and           never   pointed
and   angular;     they are frequently found alone, and, from
their appearance and other circumstances,               seem to have
suffered a diminution       of their original bulk, by yielding up
                                 S3                          a portion,

a portion,     from their             surfaces, to the surrounding medium
in which they are imbedded.
   The degradation of these flint-stones is, likewise, strongly
marked by a peculiar opacity, not unlike white glass-enamel
or the superior kinds of porcelain ; and this forms a well-
defined stratum, which covers entirely the whole surface of
the stone, penetrating it to a greater or less depth. It cannot
be considered as a very forced explanation, to say, thai this
may, probably, be the very point of contact, where this de
clension of silex is the commencement of a new modifica
tion  and that this terminates eventually in the perfection of
       ;
a carbonate, or even of the lime itself, of which silex would
then be considered               as the    independent progenitor.
   That    the blunted and                nodular shape of the generality            of
siliceous stones,           is a mark       of    loss in the primitive mass         it
self, may be explained by many examples.       Thus, even in
common experiments,     a sharp  or crystal-formed piece of
any substance, capable of solution in an acid, soon loses its
projecting corners, and, as the action of the acid proceeds,
gradually becomes less indented, and more smooth or globu
lar.  It is rather a gratuitous conclusion, when the convex
shape of pebbles, gravel, and all other siliceous stones, is
ascribed to attrition             :   in some instances this argument may
appear     just, but in           the more important    cases it      con     is,
                                                                                I
ceive, extremely fallacious.
   The true nature of clay, or,                    as   it   now generally called,
                                                             is
alumine, when considered                     as   a   primitive earth and simple
element,       seems         very questionable
                                           notwithstanding
                                                         ;        for,
various methods have been employed to obtain    in state of              it    a
purity, stilt this doubt remains. Even, in  one of the most
 celebrated       systems         of chemistry, after detailing the                 best
 mode to    accomplish                the end,          the author adds, that the
 alumine      " will
                 then be nearly pure." One of the specific
 characters, peculiar to clay, tends very much to confirm
 this suspicion         that particular odour, constantly evol
                        ;   it   is
 ving  from       it,
                perceptible on all occasions, such as ploughing
 or stirring upland or garden-ground, and which       familiarly          is
 known       by   the term earthy smell.
                                                                                      It

call      " odeur
             quartzeuse ;" but this arises                      only when the flint
is employed in the act of collision with steel, or against some
kind of stone containing this scintillating ingredient, the
silex; and, on such occasions, I have reason to believe,
some new compound is the result, in which the presence of
oxygen may be traced to this origin and to no other. The
effect        of flint upon          is attended with this singular cir
                                  steel
cumstance,            that the particles which            fly
                                                   off are obedient to
the       loadstone,  consequently must be metallic
                            and                           but,                     ;
the metal    now deprived of its lustre and malleability,
                 is                                                                    it   is
a compound, having imbibed        certain established dose of
                                                 a
oxygen, at the expense of the silex, and the necessary caloric
from the atmosphere.
   If an ore consist chiefly              of lime, silex        and metal,         and,     if
this metal be saturated with oxygen, the lime and, indeed,
the whole compound be tastless and quite insoluble in water,
what other inference can be drawn than this — that the silex
alone   the ostensible and primary cause, both of the insi
           is
pidity of the lime and the oxidized condition of the metal?
Cases of this nature occur very frequently    the ore, which     :
produces the new metal titanium,    precisely of that species
                                                     is                                     j
for   itcomposed
           is      of nearly equal parts of these three in

  The quantity of silex in some ores, and                         in    mineral        sub
stances  containing acids and metallic oxides,     often very           is
great   in others there
          ;                  scarcely any but we may occa
                                     is                    :

from the condition of the ingredients left in the ore., Inthe^
following example, the quantity of silex remaining in the
compound seems to be inversely as that of the oxygen, as
if nearly the whole had been expended, and converted into
the oxygen, which     now blended with the metals.

the most obvious source from whence the oxygen could hare
been derived, but, were there any objection, it must be also
noticed that the ore itself had been originally enveloped in
silex (gangue quartzeuse), so much so, that what was su
perfluous and extraneous adhered so closely, that it was

lime are sufficiently degraded to be deprived of all external
peculiarities, and to shun the usual tests   for, though nearly      ;

they are more than counterbalanced      the other element.      by
  Potash and soda, which exist in so many situations, and are
found to be more abundant than had formerly been suspected,
appear to constitute one of the principal ingredients in va
rious mineral bodies, particularly in the more huge masses of
matter, in the primitive rocks and mountains, and, probably,
in other substances, in which     has hitherto escaped our at
                                                    it
tention.           These are to be considered, not only to be in the
same      predicament       as the earths, but, being possessed of
higher                more considerable energy as salifiable
              powers and
bases, they furnish more conclusive examples for elucidating
this subject, and more openly evince the oxgyenating efficacy
of   silex.        In all   substances          in which these are found,                there
is   no appearance of an alkali  they have, till very lately,

most horrid   causticity, and other qualities, which charac
terize these alkalis, are totally suppressed and softened into
perfect inactivity.
  Here, the same agency continues its operations ; for, not
merely the earths, the lime, or alumine, and metals, when
they occur, but    considerable portion of alkali, amounting
                        a
in  some instances to more than one fifth of the whole, are
all reduced into one mass of tasteless inoffensive stone. The
leucite, which was analysed by M. Klaproth, contains about
0-22 of potash. 0-23 of alumine, and, 54 of silex ; and from
this,   I   confess,        I can draw    no other inference than, —
that the two salifiable bases are deprived           of their primitive
characters, entirely by the oilier ingredient.
  The proximity of all the earths to silex, and the constant
association of this with one or more of the former, is                 a   cir
cumstance too notorious to dwell upon ; and, considering
the public utility of your pages, it were intrusive to multi
ply these examples, by bringing forward every case that may
be suitable. We might really confide in almost a random
selection  for all scientific books are fraught with proofs
            ;
and analyses, in which silex, oxidized metals, neutral salts,
or saturated substances, or, in short, where some modifica
tion of oxygen is indelibly impressed.
   Even substances that apparently are independent of our
globe are chiefly formed of silex ; and the meteoric stones,
which, in a highly ignited state, have occasionally been
projected from the atmosphere upon various and distant
places in the world, particularly in Yorkshire, and at Be
nares in the East Indies,           even these conta'ufcabout     half their
weight of       silex ; it has also been universally remarked,             that
these wonderful productions are always made up               of   the samp
elements    — of silex,
                      iron, nickel, magnesia, and a small
quantity of sulphur ; and nearly in the same uniform pro
portions in all the specimens that have been analysed by
other chemists since Mr. Howard, who first published the
exact history      of   the composition.

deed,   I see nothing very romantic in this opinion ; and, in
all cases, I think, when we are at a loss to explain, we may
take the liberty to conjecture.        One of the most celebrated
chemists of the age, and whose correct knowledge of this
and every other subject        of science is indisputable, thus ex
presses   himself   upon    this  subject :
                                                " The opinion," says
M. Vauquelin,      "  that these stones came from the moon,
however extraordinary it may appear, is still, perhaps, the
least unreasonable ; and if it be true that no direct proofs
 can be given, it is no less true that no well-founded rea
soning can be opposed to it : the wiser way, therefore, is
 to own frankly, that we are totally ignorant of the origin of
these stones, and of the causes which produce them."

  J. he  meetings of this learned body, on the 14th and 2 1st
 of  April, were occupied in reading an account of a shower
 of meteoric    stones   at   Weston in North America.             This
 account we have been enabled to lay before              our readers in
 the present Number, by the kindness of the honourable
 Mr. Greville.     It is by far the best authenticated and pre
 cise account  of  so singular a phenomenon          that has yet been
 published in any country.
                        LINNJEAN SOCIETY.
    April 5. The right reverend the bishop of Carlisle, V. P.
 in the chair.     A communication from Doctor Smith, the
 president, was read, entitled
                                     "  Characters of a new Genus
 of Mosses called Hookeria, containing eight Species, &c."
 Some of these species are new, and others have heretofore
 ranked in the genus Hypnum ; from which, however, the
learned President pronounces them to be clearly distinguished
by their reticulated capsules. These constitute an essential
character for this new genus, all the species of which, how
ever, accord in other characteristics.          Dr. Smith    has named
                                                                   this

     April    19.  The chair    was filled this evening by the Presi
dent, who read         a  communication       of his own, on A new
Genus of Liliaceous          Plants, which      he has called Brodsea,
in honour of Mr. Brodie ; whose numerous and valuable
illustrations of the botany of Scotland give him a just
claim     to    this distinction.      This   paper contained some ad
mirable remarks upon the difficulty which some plants, and
especially the Liliacea?, present, of distinguishing between
 the calyx and corolla, and upon the doctrine of Jussieu on
 this subject. Dr. Smith conjectures that both these organs
 may be united where one of them seems to be wanted ; the
 external surface performing the functions of the calyx,
 and the internal those of the corolla.
     Some interesting letters from Peter Collinson to Linnaeus
 were also read by the President,           which, he stated, wore in
 tended for some future publication.               One of them related a
 remarkable instance of hybrid fruit on an apple-tree, pro
  duced by the proximity          of a tree bearing another kind. The
  President mentioned a similar fact which had come under
  his own observation near Norwich. A peach- and nectarine-
  tree grew close together, and bore sometimes peaches, some
  times nectarines, and sometimes a fruit partly resembling
  each.
               WERNERIAN NATURAL HISTORY SOCIETY.
      At   the last meeting       of  the   Wernerian Natural History
  Society, Professor Jameson           read an account    of  a  method   of
  constructing       and colouring mineralogical         maps.     We can
   not give a satisfactory account of this paper without draw
   ings; we shall therefore only observe, that maps executed ac
   cording to this plan show distinctly the figure of the cliffs,
   terraces, acclivities and summits of single mountains, and
   also   the     characters    of mountain-ranges         and mountain-
   groups    :  and the   colouring     affords  a  true  and   harmonious

  11th of June, at Seven o'clock in the Morning, at the
 Theatre of Anatomy, Blenheim-Street,            Great Marlborough-
  Street.
     In  these  Lectures the Structure      of the Human Body will
  be demonstrated on recent subjects,         and   further illustrated
  by preparations,      and the function of the different organs
  will be explained.
     The surgical operations are so performed, and every part
  of surgery so elucidated, as may best tend to complete the
  operating surgeon.
     The art of injecting, and of making          anatomical prepara
  tions, will be taught practically.
      Gentlemen zealous in the pursuit         of zoology, will meet
  Avith uncommon opportunities         of prosecuting their researches
  in comparative anatomy.
      Surgeons in the army and navy may be assisted m renew
   ing their anatomical kowledge, and every possible attention
   will be paid to their accommodation as well as instruction.
      Anatomical conversaziones will        be held weekly, when the
   different subjects treated   of will  be discussed   familiarly, and
                                                                     the

gations are counteracted by an antiseptic process,             the result
of experiments made by Mr. Brookes on human subjects at
Paris, in the year 1782; the account of which was delivered
to the Royal Society, and         read on the    1 7th  of June     1784.
This method        has since been so far improved, that the         florid
colour     of  the   muscles is preserved and even heightened.
Pupils may be accommodated in the house. — Gentlemen
established in practice, desirous of renewing their anatomical
knowledge, may be accommodated with                   an apartment to
dissect in privately.

 LVIF.      Reduction  of the Observation   of  the Transit of Mer
     cury over tlie Sun, observed at the         Royal Observatory,
     Greenwich, on the 8th of November,             1802.   Commu
     nicated by  T. FIRMINGER, Esq.
  I.  HE particulars respecting this observation are detailed in
 the annual sheets published by the .Royal Society ; but as
 these sheets contain nothing more than a mere register of
 the astronomical observations made in the Royal Observatory
 at Greenwich,      they are in general so little interesting,  as to
 be found in the hands      of but few astronomical or mathema
 tical persons. It was therefore thought advisable, previous
 to giving a reduction of this transit, to transcribe the obser
 vation, as given in the account of the Greenwich, observa
 tions of that year.
 Transit     of Mercury   over  the  Sun on the 8tli   of November,
                                 1802.
    " I fitted  the divided achromatic object-glass micrometer
to the    46-inch achromatic telescope, and adapted the tele
scope to distinct vision, by trying it upon a large spot near
the western limb of the Sun ; which I had no occasion to
alter during the whole period of the observation, as I con
tinued to see Mercury perfectly distinct and well defined to
the end of the transit. After having made this arrangement,
I  began measuring the distance       of Mercury from the Sun's
nearest    limb, by bringing the     exterior limb of Mercury to
touch the interior limb of the Sun, and obtained the follow
ing   set of distances.

   * To this gentleman, who is extremely fond of astronomy, I was greatly
indebted for the assistance he afforded me during the whole time of the transit :
his readiness   in reading off the scale of the micrometer enabled me to pro
cure at least double the number of measures I could otherwise have done.
Throughout the whole of the             measures, every possible care was taken in
making the exterior circular limb of Mercury to touch the nearest interior
limb of the Sun ; but in the middle of the observation, and at a time when
these distances    were most wanted, I was prevented from proceeding with so
much accuracy, or acquiring so great a number as I could have wished, in
consequence of a part of the micrometer coming up against one of the sup
porting pieces of the object end of the telescope ; a circumstance I was un
 prepared to meet* having never used the micrometer before, or understood
 that such a defect existed.       I mentioned this to Dr. Maskelyne when he re
 turned,   (he being in   Wiltshire at the time of the observation,) who said he
 had often met with the same circumstance when observing the lucid parts
 of the Sun in   a solar eclipse.     This defect was soou after remedied by Mr,
 George Dollond, by a very simple plan I suggested to him of making the sup
 port of the object end of the telescope to, shift, by connecting it to a move
 able collar.

horizontal   parallax of Mercury from the Sun on the day of
the transit is 4"- 1221 3, and at21h 14m 40*-5, the parallax in
longitude will be — 2"-6*775, and the parallax in latitude
+ 2".9923 to be applied to the apparent place : therefore the
geocentric nearest distance of their centres was 62"- 71 at
gih i4m j0s apparent time.
     From         the above data several theorems have been given for
computing the effect of parallax in accelerating or retarding
the time of the beginning or end of a transit.   The follow
ing method, which is here employed, is as simple as any,
and  will be found sufficiently accurate. ¦
   Let O (Fig. 4.) represent the centre of the Sun, M D the
relative path of Mercury, M its geocentric place at egress,
and D at the nearest approach to the Sun's centre : join O D,
O M, and in D O take D ?, equal to the parallax at the egress
perpendicular to the path ; draw tip, meeting the Sun's limb
in    /x   parallel to D M, and ^ p perpendicular to D M,
            and
and take p m in D M produced equal to the parallax at the
egress in the path ; then will ^ be the apparent place of
Mercury at the egress, and m its place seen from the
Earth's centre, as \* manifest from the construction. Now
the        egress     is   accelerated       or retarded by the time Mercury
takes to describe             M m, which         is t=    mp + p         M;          and as the

 -In    1780,    Messrs. de Saussure and Pictet visited the moun
 tain Madona della Guardia, elevated 422 toises above the
 level of the       sea, and   of which mount Ramazzo                forms a
 part. After having given an excellent lithological descrip
 tion of the first mountain, Saussure thus expresses himself                f:
 ^   On ascending       and descending the mountain della Guardia,
 we had      a  view to the westward of        a  mountain,     from which
 we were separated by a very deep ravine, and                 from which
  we were informed that martial vitriol had been extracted                    ;
 but    I  had   no knowledge of the substance in which it was
  found.       At the distance from which we saw this mountain,
  it seemed mixed with slate and ferruginous earths."
      It  was   this mountain,       (known by the name of Mount
  Ramazzo,) thus neglected by Saussure, which principally
  occupied my attention for two reasons : in the first place,
  because     I  had been   told that trenches were dug at the sum
  mit of this mountain,         and that a manufacture of sulphate
  of magnesia had been established there : secondly, because,
  the steatitic and serpentine rocks of this mountain being
  united to lime in certain points, I was anxious to visit this
  curiosity so seldom discovered.

                     in   the Appenmes          ofLigurla.                     297
  M. Maximilian   Spinola of Genoa, who is skilled in seve
ral branches of natural history, M. Viviani a botanist, and
my friend M. Marozari of Vicenza, an excellent minera
logist, were anxious to accompany me. We took our depar
ture at six o'clock in the morning from Genoa : we went
in a carriage to Cornigliani, where we visited M. Durazzo's
rich collection in natural history : from theuce we proceeded
to Sestri, where M. Alberto Anseldo conducts a manufac
tory of sulphate of magnesia with great spirit. This gentle*-
man acted as our guide in the arduous excursion we were
about to make   : our route lay through   narrow by-ways,
profound  ravines,  and we were obliged to climb from rock
to rock, which were so flinty and slippery, that they re
quired some experience in alpine travelling to surmount
them.     We   left our carriages at Sestri,           and immediately en
tered the bed       of   the river Charavagna on foot.             We   ascended
this torrent for about an hour. Its bed is broad, and wholly
covered with blocks of serpentine and other round stones;
which   shows that it is subject to dreadful torrents ; but
there is scarcely any water in it in dry seasons. The follow
ing    are the remarks        I   made     on ascending to         a   lime-kiln,
 which    I shall   speak    of by   and by.
   Notice upon the Stones in the Torrent                   of Charavagna.
    1. Various pieces, larger or smaller, of a grayish steatitic
 rock, of a drier grain than that of the other steatites, of
 which I shall soon take notice.     This rock has fissures or
 cracks filltd with greenish crystallized epidote, similar to
 that of the alps at Oisan in the ci-devant Dauphine.     I am
 surprised how this rock escaped the attentive and vigilant
 eye of Saussure. It is probable, since he has not mentioned
 it, that the torrent of Charavagna was not then passable,                           or
 at least when he visited the mountain della Guardia.
      2. Tender      serpentine      of    a    blackish   green   shaded      with
 light green,       and shining as        if   varnished, soft and even unc
 tuous to the touch, radiating into white streaks, with                              a
 striated and undulous fracture, having talcky appearance, a
 and strongly obedient to the magnet.
       3. Serpentine. soft, and analogous to that              of No.     2,   as to
                                                                                 the

 the constituent parts; but its colour is of a clearer green :
 its surface is much more glossy than that of the preceding,
 and its fracture more generally undulated : but what parti
 cularly distinguishes this beautiful specimen, which is seven
 inches long by five broad,   that          is,
                                        not only very attract
                                                           it   is
 able     by
          the magnet, but endowed with         strong polarity            a
 throughout its whole length     and   attracts keenly at one
                                              ;             it
 end, while   even repels with the other.
                 it
     4. Serpentine of   deep green, with some shades of
                                    a                                                          a
 clearer green, soft tothe touch, but harder than the pre
 ceding, having one of its facets striated, and something like
 asbestos.
     5.Another serpentine somewhat hard, of            greenish                  a
 black, with  small spots of     greenish  white
                                             a    near to each
 other, and which seem to have      tendency to the parallelo-
                                                       a
 pipedon form, which gives to this variety of serpentine false                            a
 aspect of black and white antique porphyry.        But what
renders the latter remarkable,       that          is,
                                            contains in its sub  it
stance, as well as upon its external facets, multitude of very        a
brilliant small silvery scales of metalloidal appearance (dial-
laga), the brilliancy of which     the more lively, as
                                                  is      shines                     it
upon      a   black ground.             This serpentine
                                           strongly attracted        is
by the magnet.
   6. Semi-hard serpentine, attractable, of    deep greenish              a
black, with some lamina of metalloidal appearance like silver,
and small layers more or less thin, but some of them      line                            a
in thickness,         of   a   substance     of    the unctuous               appearance      of
steatite and its colour being olive-green, shining, and of an
          ;
equal and rich tint' seems to be owing to chrome,
      Semi-hard serpentine of
     7.                           blneish-gray, with longi
                                                  a
tudinal compressed streaks, covered with    slight and trans         a
parent couch, or rather with      kind of varnish of clear
                                                  a                                  a
azure blue.   We also discover in the fractures of this beau
tiful serpentine, some scales of                         metalloid diallage, and              of
                                                  by a
a  silvery hue    ; attractable
                      it   is                            the magnet.
   8. Serpentine of  deep greenish-gray, semi-hard, feebly
                                a
attractable, with small round globules, sometimes oblong,
of compact white or greenish substance, harder and more
    a
homogeneous than that of the stone which                                  contains them,
                                                                                              of

                        in   the Appenints          of Ligitria.                        299
of    a stcatitic aspect,       and    presenting, when we look at it
through the microscope,               very fine lineaments which unite
about the centre of each globule.   Here we have a true va
riolite, which ought not to be confounded with an amygda
loid.       The specimen I       have described, and which was con
founded with the other stones I have mentioned in the bed
of   the Charavagna,    is more remarkable from the globules
being distinct, a little projectingand distinct from each other,
as in the variolitcs of Durance, occupying; one-third of the
size of the specimen ; they are also much nearer together,
and seem to touch,             and    they      are confounded afterwards                    ;
forming         at   the extremity    of thesingle couch
                                                      piece but     a
where the globules have disappeared, and where the same
substance of which they are composed no longer affects the
regular form.
     This   stone fixed my attention, since it gave me reason                               to
                 analogous to that of Durance, in a place
expect a variolite
where no person had met with                    it,
                                 or even suspected      to                             it
exist.                    .
     As    the globules,      however,         of   the true variolite belong to
a substance very like feldspar and fusible like  and as                     it,             I
have  neither met with compact feldspar, (petro-silex of
the Germans,) nor feldspar under other forms    think the               I
                                                                        ;
round variolite          which  I     found,          was   one    of   those      stones
transported in great            revolutions of the earth, and                      out of
its proper place.
 I              reflections when advancing up the bed of
       made these
the torrent; but     suddenly discovered
                         I                stony mass of       a                             a
white or greenish hue, weighing more than thirty pounds,
which, at first sight, awakened in my mind the idea of feld
spar:      it   may be described      as   follows     :
  9. Compact stone, with fine paste, translucid upon the
edges, soft to the touch, of white slightly tinged with as
                                           a
paragus      green, having the appearance of jade, breaking into
scales      rather lamellous' than conchoidal, scratching glass
strongly, and emitting some sparks when struck with steel                                   ;
but   it not so hard as the jade.

      300           Geological Journey to Mount Ramazxo
     stone, we perceived some parts of a lively apple-green, ar
     ranged in small elongated lamina;, flat and of a silky lustre,
     owing    to the diallage*
        I consider this stone as           a  true compact feldspar, mixed
     with    a   little     steatitic   serpentine, and with iridescence
     (diallage): it is this mixture which contributes, perhaps, to
     its great fusibility.          I found another piece of it weighing
     more than twelve pounds.
        With    the      blow-pipe     I  made    a comparative   trial of the
    greenish-white globules of the variolite No. 8, which I
/   found in the bed of the torrent, and they bubbled up and
    melted    with the same facility as the stone I have described.
    Now, as the latter was of a large volume, and did not ap
    pear to come from any distance, for its angles were scarcely
    abraded, I presumed that it should abound in some parts of
    the neighbouring          mountains,      in the direction  of the torrent
    which    had received        these fragments, and that it was perhaps
    found in    a   furrow, or mixed into the paste itself of some of
    the serpentines, which I thought I should find in its proper
   place.      In fact, it was natural to think that the junction
   of   the molecules        of feldspar in globules,      at the time of the
   formation of these mountains,                might have given rise to va-
   riolites analogous to those known by the name of variolites
   of Durance; and thence I did not lose hopes of finding this
   kind     of  stone      in  the   same    rock which contributed to it*
   formation.
        10.  Finally,      the bed   of  the torrent, in proportion as    I ad
   vanced, presented me with various fragments of a compact
   calcareous stone, hard and of a fine paste, susceptible of
  being polished, with some veins of calcareous spar which
   traversed    it  ;  I  saw also some      of  the same spar adhering to a
  vein of white quartz.
       These calcareous stones            found in a considerable number,
  beside the serpentine, magnesian, and feldsparry stones               f have
  mentioned, left me also some hope of being able to observa
  the points of contact of the magnesian with the calcareous
  rock in     a   country quite free of wood, and lorn up by tor
  rents, presenting great hills and deep ravines. Reflecting
  in this manner, I advanced a little further, and in a deep
                                                                        recess

                 m the Appeninet     of Liguria.              301
recess formed by the    torrent of the river, I  perceived   upon
an eminence on the right bank       of the Charavagna, a rustic
habitation,  and a large  lime-kiln at work.
Of the  Calcareous Stone proper for being converted into Lime;
                 of its Bed beside Serpentines.
   The lime-kiln    used  for calcining the stone, the singular
situation  of which I shall soon describe, is of so peculiar
and unusual a construction, that it is worthy of our atten
tion. In consequence of the extreme scarcity of wood, the
saving of fuel has been their principal object : heath
and   broom only of a large size are used for this pur
pose ; these give a brisk but not a durable lire, and it be
comes necessary    to endeavour to preserve the heat as much
as possible.    For this purpose, they have constructed of
strong and good masonry, a kind of square tower, sur
mounted with a pyramid-formed capital of solid stone, which
serves as a kind of roof, and forces the heat to reverberate
upon the calcareous stone divided into fragments and in
tended to be calcined.     A simple straight aperture towards
the top of the vault serves for letting out the smoke, and
the humidity which exhales from the calcareous stone and
combustible ; and it establishes a current of air necessary for
keeping up the fire, which being concentrated in a great
measure by the obstacles opposed to its wasting, acquires a
greater and steadier intensity.    If, in some peculiar  circum
stances, they require a greater current of air, it       may be
easily obtained by opening a small door placed in          one of
the faces of the pyramidal wall, which serves as a        roof to
the furnace.    The lime-stone is introduced by a door made
behind the fumade, and it is withdrawn by the same aper
ture when it is calcined : the combustibles are placed below
upon a grating.
   The quarry of lime-stone is not far off, and is to be seen
in the kind of ravine which serves for the bed of the torrent.
As my intention was to follow it in several points, so as to
become well acquainted with its situation, 1 continued to
ascend the torrent of Charavagna, by a route which becomes
more rapid   as we  advance. The soil was every where loaded
                                                              with

 302            Geological Journey lo Mount Ramazzo
 with serpentines of various kinds similar to those I have
 mentioned : but there were also found considerable blocks
 of amass composed of fragments of the serpentines above de
 scribed, and of the same lime I have mentioned, and similar
 in every respect to that of which the lime is made: this
 mass is strongly united by a calcareous sparry cement.
   A second          kind   of mass,   also arranged in large blocks,         is to
 be found in the neighbourhood                of   the first   :   both have been
 detached  from the neighbouring mountains, and do not
 seem to have  been brought from any distance : the one in
question is composed only of larger or smaller fragments of
different kinds of serpentine, which have entered into the
composition of the neighbouring mountains ; but we find
no lime in it as in the first mass, and the cement which has
united       theseserpentines has lime in                 it,
                                                being entirely
steatitic.      We soon met with these two varieties of masse*
again upon the edges of one of the ravines of the torrent,
on the one edge beside some serpentines, and on the
other adhering to lime.      seemed at first sight as
                                       It                                       if
these masses served as intermedia, and were passing from
one genus to another  but in examining them again, and
                               :
reflecting that they must have been formed at the ex
pense    of   the calcareous and           steatitic rock, both        of which
must have had at this period the same consistency and the
same hardness as at present, we could only attribute this
formation to an accidental revolution,   long subsequent
without       doubt      to events     of another order,             which   have
given birth to these mountains of serpentines, and to the
calcareous beds adhering to them, and which have furnished
the materials for these two masses.   But let us now cast a
glance upon the lime           in
                         its bed, and see               if
                                              be cotemporary

                                   be subsequent.

from      hamlet of Serra, placed in an amphitheatre near

vagna, we may observe in       very distinct manner

nesian rock.      give the preference
                     I                   to this spot over that
which   is   nearer the     lime-kiln,     because we see more distinctly
                                                                             the

    the   junction of both           substances          ;   and the doubts we   might
    raise as to the
                  lime-stone placed against it secondarily, and
    afterwards against the serpentine rock, disappear entirely
    upon examining the facts T have mentioned.
      In short, when the torrent in its various overflowings,
    and     when after storms              its       waters are       precipitated from
    precipice to precipice with                 a   violence     and impetuosity    car
    rying every thing before              it,    and     laying bare the calcareous
    and serpentine           beds, so as to present           the whole at full view    ;
    we then remark the gray, hard, and compact lime-stone,
    which     modified into white calcareous spar, and forms
                 is
    large strings or lineaments,                 which are joined and interlaced
    with    very small layers or lineaments              of steatitic serpentine.
    These lineaments sometimes increase,                             and are developed
    longitudinally, and like stripes of gray or greenish colour
                                                             a
    around longitudinal or circular lamina; of calcareous spar of
a     white colour.           In other     parts adjacent, the two substances
    form    a    kind   of net-work. In             a   word, we think we can per
    ceive in the union            and in the play          of these two substances,
                                           of the movement of
    so different in their nature, the results

    time   and we only know the waters of the sea, and their
            ;
    long continuance upon these regions, at very remote periods,
    as having acted upon masses which constitute chains of
    mountains.
.     Every thing, therefore, inclines                       us to  think, that  inthis
    c»se the      lime-stone        has been attached, or rather            joined, to
    the magnesian rock, not      an             by           after process, but in one
    and the same operation, when great accumulations of dis
    solved calcareous matters being in the neighbourhood of
    substances  which have given. birth to the serpentine rock,
    their molecules floated in the same fluid, which gave rise to
    points of meeting, contact, union, and mixture, similar
    to those we observe here. Nothing proves more completely
    that this mixture   made simultaneously than the chemical
                               is

   304          Geological Journey to Mount Ramazzo
     Saussurc had remarked upon the mountain della Guardia,
  an alternation     of calcareous and serpentine layers ; which
  is perfectly analogous to     what   I have  here described.     But
  as such an operation could not be performed at a single          jet,
  we cannot refrain from remarking here also that nature
  never takes into her account the operations of time.
   Of the true   Variolite (Variolites viridis verus) in    the same
                 Rock in which it has been produced.
     As our object    was to visit the quarrying   of   the materials
  used   in the manufacture        of sulphate of magnesia upon
  the highest part of Mount Ramazzo, M. Alberto Ansaldo,
  who guided us, informed us that we must leave the bed of
  the Charavagna, pass to the hamlet of Serra, and ascend
  over shelving precipices into a direction opposite to that
  of the torrent. The road, or rather the pass, was strait,
  rapid, and slippery ; we were surrounded on all sides by ser
  pentine rocks more or less green ; some were hard, others
 soft : the grain of them also varied ; in some places it was
 dry, and in others greasy and unctuous : enormous masses,
  placed upon still huger masses, spread spontaneously, some
 into irregular leaves more or less turned, and others into
 striated pieces imitating asbestos : the diallage was distinct
 in  some    fractures, and exhibited a silvery lustre ; in others
 this was not to be seen      ; and in this case the heart of the
stone, being of a deep blackish green, presented shades of a
 clearer green.                                                   "^
    We     had   ascended   at   least six hundred    feet in height
from the hamlet       of Serra ; when being at this height, not
far from    a  small stream    of water which runs through the
pass, and might serve        as  a point for  reconnoitring,   I  per
ceived a detached piece      of serpentine, the surface of which
Was covered      with small globules of a whitish green, a little
projecting,     and harder than the paste     of the stone.     I saw
"with   pleasure    that it was a variolite not rolled nor trans
ported from its place, .but detached spontaneously by the
effect of moisture, or the alternation of heat and cold, from
an    enormous mass       of serpentine which was contiguous.
                                                                 This

                   in the Appenines    ofLiguria.               305
This fine specimen is      five inches long  by three broad ; one
of its facets presents the whcle characters of a fine green
variolite, with small grains projecting a little, and of a green
much clearer than the heart of the stone, while the opposite
part is a true serpentine of a dark sjreen, without globules
or variolitic spots. We could not doubt, after looking at
this specimen, that the substance which was joined in glo
bules in order to form this variolite,     was the result of an  as
semblage    of a certain quantity of feldsparry substance,       the
elements of which had been mixed in the serpentine rock at the
time of its formation. This kind of separation may be con
sidered as the result   of  a globulous imperfect crystallization,
determined by the attractive force of the feldsparry mole
cules, which had more affinity for each other than for the
rhagnesian earth ; and if these variolitic globules are only
superficial as it were, (for the bed in which we remark them
is little more than three lines thick,) it is because the sub
stance    of the feldspar was not abundant. In short, the
identity of the globulous substance is absolutely the same
with that which I found, separated and in voluminous pieces,
in the bed of the Charavagna, and which I have mentioned
in No. IX of the description of stones found in this torrent.
In fact, having attacked with the blowpipe some globules
of the variolite in question, they swelled upon the first at
tack of the tire, emitted some air bubbles, and formed a
yellowish transparent glass, like the feldsparry stone above
mentioned.
    A variolite equally well characterized, in the neighbour
hood of the rock of which it had once formed a part, gave
me good hopes of meeting with some more of them. These
hopes were soon realised ; for after we had ascended 300 feet
higher, we found beneath our feet several flat piece?, but
angular, and of hard serpentine of a lighter or darker green
filled with variolitic globules, the grains of which were
much thicker, and penetrated into the whole mass of the
serpentine. I gathered several fi.e specimens,. some of which
are six or eight inches long by an inch in thickness, and of
go decided a character that we can easily distinguish with
    Vol. 30. No.  120.  May     1808.           tJ              the

the microscope           the commencement       of the kind of    radiated
crystallization which is peculiar to each globule.
     The higher we ascended, the more of these specimens
did \\e friid at the foot of the rocks of serpentine.                I ob
served with interest the general tendency these rocks natu
rally    have      to  divide   into splinters, or into large flat and
 scaly fragments ; (this I attributed to a peculiar alteration
 of the iron so abundant in this kind of stone;) when                      I
 suddenly        perceived    upon the right of the pass, a mass of
 serpentine in its bed more than eighteen feet high, with a.
 base of 40 feel broad, and which seemed as it were iso-
•lated,     either by natural and spontaneous decomposition of
 the most tender parts of the rock, or by some other cause.
 I perceived upon this large mass some parts much greener
 than others, penetrating deeply into the heart of this enor
 mous block,          which was     of a very dull blackish green.
     I approached very -close, and I ascertained that most of
 tUe spots were produced by parts abounding in true variolite
 of a grass green colour, and white spots or grains, shaded
 from      an    extremely clear green. All these parts formed
 itl Variolites seemed extremtly hard : I had soon some
 proofs of this, when I struck them with a hammer, and it
 was with great difficulty I obtained some good specimens.
     Several of these pieces had a multitude of globules ana
 logous and similar in every respect to the variolite of Du
 rance    :   sometimes, however, the variolitic         spots  only   en
 tered to the depth         of an inch and a   half into  the stone, and
 the rest seemed to be nothing else than a pure serpentinous
 rock ; at other places the variolite entered deeper into the
 mass   :    in some places the granulous surface was not much
 larger than the palm          of the hand ; in others it was double
 this size     :  in short, by continuing to observe more vario-
 lites in other blocks,           I was convinced that this singular
 stone is not in a vein in the masses of serpentines, but that
 it exists indifferently,        sometimes in one      place   and some
 times in another,           without    order or regularity.     It is the
 same with the arrangement of the globules : we see them
huddled together upon some pieces, and as it were arranged
                                                                         in

                 r       in the Appenines      of Llguria.                 307
 in   an equal       and     distinct   manner,      while  they are thinly
 scattered upon others, or sometimes so close "together that
  they are confounded, and form merely a large whitish
 spot.
     I shall finish        these   details by observing, that I possess
 among my numerous specimens a remarkable piece, which
 will demonstrate to those acquainted with the composition,
 of rock        that the varioiite of Mount Rainazzo took its rise
 in  a true    scrpeutinous rock.           I shall now describe this rare
 and curious specimen in few words.
     Its colour is the same with            that of the other serpentines
 I  have mentioned          ;  but the    rock from which-      1 detached   it
 with   the hammer was very hard,               its texture very close   : but
 striated   .a   the    same time in a scaly manner;           and  its scales
 frequently interposed between the streaks, and intersecting
 them transversely, render this rock difficult to break: it is
 torn in some measure rather than broken, and requires
 heavy blows with the trammer.                Jn this   way  I procured this
 fine specimen with a fracture a little undulous, but pure and
clean, and which admits of our seeing upon the two large
faces of the stone its texture. as well as upon the rock it
self.      We    see   perfectly upon a part which forms almost the
half of the piece, and not only upon the faces but through
out its whole thickness, a multitude of variolitic globules
of almost      equal size,      of  a clear green, issuing      every where
from the streaks and scaly parts of the stone, as if they were
sown      in it: these globules become smaller afterwards in
proportion as they approach that part of the specimen
which has none of them ; and this last part is then nothing
but pure serpentine mixed with some irregular and thin
lineaments of        a  white colour, not belonging to the varioiite,
and some of them slightly effervesce with the nitrid acid.
    From the above            facts we see that the true varioiite     exists
in Mount          Kamazzo,        and   that it is cotemporary with thft
serpen>ines in which            we   find it at the height of more than
1500 feet above the level of the sea.                 It is to be presumed
we    shall  find   it at   a  greater   elevation,   and perhaps in still
greater     abundance, in other parts              of the  Ligurian Appe-
ttines.

Of the Mine of Magnesia                  upon the highest Part                    of Mount
                                        Ramazzo.
   The route becomes more and more difficult  we approach                as
the rugged summit, where the quarries and establishment
of M. Alberto Ansaldo are situated, nor do we lose sight of
serpentine rocks the whole way : these are more or less
compact, lamellous, streaked, gjossy, unctuous, or dry and
friable. We pass several ravines, and mount from precipice
to precipice, until we come to about 1800 feet above the
level    of    the sea, being            the    summit         of Mount Ramazzo,
where we find a small fiat piece of ground, upon which
arebuilt some penthouses for preparing the mineral, and ap
paratus for stamping, roasting, leying, &c; — in a word,
for extracting the sulphate of magnesia in a simple and in
teresting manner.
   This operation consists in carefully collecting                                avery py-
ritous steatite, which is found rather in heaps                                   and large
fragments          than in regular seams : they afterwards roast                           it,
after reducing          to pieces, in order to evaporate
                         it                              little of the        a

disposed to quit its base, and attaches itself to the magnesian
earth    of the serpentine, in order       the sulphate of
                                                      to   form
magnesia. They pound this roasted pyrites in rough man                   a

dant sulphate of magnesia                 is    obtained, which                 purified and
refined in another establishment belonging                               to     M. Alberto
Ansaldo, at Sestri.
      After having examined               the      first preparation          of the ferru
ginous and arsenical pyrites of Mount Ramazzo, we entered
the galleries of the mine, which are close to the penthouses                               :
they are large, but the working of them    not regulated            is                     :
they follow the pyrites and the pyritous steatite wherever
they meet          it,   sometimes in          a straight line and sometimes
laterally, just          as   it   presents itself. The excavations are made
                                                                                           in

in   an irregular manner,      and without any precautions for the
 safety   of the workmen        :   the   pickaxe, however, alone is
used. The explosion by gunpowder would certainly bring
down the root's of the quarries, which are no where supported
by props or bulwarks.            The various specimens I collected
here were     :
   •
     1st. A  greenish steatite, the surface of which, as well as
its interior texture, is penetrated with a kind of pyritous
varnish    of   a bronze colour, but so light and so efflorescent
 (if I may use the expression) that it seems as if the heart of
the steatite, which is black, was shown through this kind of
varnish.      Tnis pyritous       steatite is very heavy i it blackens
 paper,   and moves      the  magnetic needle strongly.           It con*
tains a small proportion of copper, but scarcely percep
tible.
     Sd. The same steatite, still richer in           pyrites, with the
 slight yellowish    or   brouze    varniih  I have  mentioned,     which
seems to gild the black serpentine rock, is soft to the touch,
blackening the fingers, and forcibly obedient to the magnet.
We find in the same rock arsenical magnetic pyrites, very
heavy, and with a metallic fracture of a grayish white.
     3d. This is a rare and superb specimen, being five inches
nine lines long by four inches broad : the base of it is a ser
pentine of a deep black, a little glossy, blackening paper,
without a pyritous appearance ; but very heavy, and strongly
attractable by the magnet, remarkable from needles of trans
 parent   white arragoniie,      one crystal of which is two inches
three lines long and four lines           in diameter, of a hexagonal
 figure, but always without a pyramid.              Other crystals of a
still greater diameter arc to be seen, sometimes in kinds of
cavities in the specimen, sometimes in the mass itself of
the pyrito'vi     serpentine, and seem to have been formed si
 multaneously with the pyritqus and magneoian elements                  of
 which this ruck is composed.
     4th.  We find     a few   yards    from the quarries, and a little
 lower down, some old excavations, but not so deep : here
 there is a striated and silky-like pyritei, with heautiful
 green efflorescences      of carbonated copper.         This  steatite is
                                       U3                             soft

rently proceeding from grains of altered cupreous and fer
ruginous pyrites.   M. Ansaldo informed me, that this py
rites was formerly wrought for the sake of its sulphate of
copper, but abandoned on account                                     of its poverty.

   When we decompose the velocity which a body would
assume if it were tree, into two, one of which is the velocity
it actually assumes,      and the other the velocity it loses ;                   and
reciprocally if we decompose the velocity                        it loses, into two,
one of them being that which it would have taken if it had
b«.t:i free, the other will be the velocity it gains : whence it
visibly follows, that what we understand byShe velocity
gained by a body, and what we understand by its velocity
lost, are two quantities equal and directly opposite : this
being done, the momentum of the quantity of movement
lost by m, with respect to the geometrical velocity u, lieing,
according to the preceding definition, m u U cosine z, the
momentum of the quantity of movement gained by the
same body      will   be —    m, u   \J   cosine »         ;   for there is no    dif
ference   between     these two quantities, except                  in this, thai the
angle comprehended between                u and the velocity gained is the
supplement of that comprehended between it and U ; so that
one of these angles being sharp, the other will be obtuse, and
its cosine equal to the cosj.ne of the other, taken negatively.
  Hence it follows, that the momentum of the quantity of
movement lost by the general system, with respect to any
geometrical movement, (which is null, as we have seen
above,) is the same thing as the difference between the mo
mentum of the quantity of movement lost by any part of
the bodies which compose                  it,
                                and the momentum of the
quantity of movement gained by the other bodies of the
same system   thus this difference
                :                   equal to zero, and thu»
                                                     is
the one of these two quantities                 is   equal to the other    ;    that    is
to say, the momentum          of the quantity             of   movement lost in the
shock    ly
          any part       of   the lydies         vf   the system,      with    respect
to any geometrical movement,               is    equal to the momentum                 of
the quantity     of   movement       gained;         ly   the other bodies      of the
same system.
   We may, therefore, from                the
                                    preceding definition,                         col
lect the three propositions contained    the following    in
                                                                        THEOREM.

                                Theorem.
     XXII. In    the shock    of hard   bodies,   whether this shock       he
immediate, or whether it          be made    by means     of  any machine
without spring,       it is clear that in respect to any geometrical
movement,     —
     1st.  The momentum        of  the quantity     of  movement     lost by
the whole system is equal to zero.
     2d. The momentum          of the quantity of movement lost by
any pait of the bodies of t lie system, if equal to the momen
tum of the quantity of movement gained by the other part.
     3d. The momentum of the quantity of real movement of
the general system, immediately after the shock, is equal to
the momentum of the quantity of movement of the same stf-
ftem,     immediately before the shock.
     It ii clear, from the preceding definition, that these three
propositions are radically the same, and are nothing else
than the same          fundamental equation         (F)  expressed    in dif
ferent ways.
     We may      also remark that these propositions            bear a great
relation to those we extract from the consideration of the
momenta relatively to different axes ; but the latter are less
 general,     and    are   easily   inferred   from    those     established
in XVII.
     There is, therefore,      as we see by the third proposition           of
 this theorem,       in   even-   percussion or communication               of
 movement, whether immediate, or caused by the intermedium
 of a machine, a quantity which is not altered by the shock :
 this quantity is not, as Descartes thought, the sum of the
 quantities of movement ; nor is it the sum of the active
 forces, because the latter is only preserved in the case where
 the movement changes by insensible degrees, as we shall
 see lower     down,     and it always diminishes           when there is
 percussion,      as   will  be   proved in      the   second     corollary.
 When      the system is free, the quantity       of movement estimated
 in any ratio, is in truth the same before and after the per
 cussion ; but this preservation does not take place if there
 are obstacles, any more than that of the momenta of quan
  tity pf movements referred to different axes            : all these quan
                                                                        tities

 tities are therefore altered by the shock, or at least arc only-
 preserved    in some particular cases. But there is another
 quantity, which neither the various obstacles opposed to the
 movement, nor the machines which transmit            nor the                         it,
 intensity of the different percussions can change   the                               ;   it   is
 momentum of the quantity of movement of the general sy-*
 stem,    ".vitli     respect to        each      of ths geometrical movements
 of which      it    is   susceptible      ;    and this principle contains in                       it
 self alone         all the laws      of equilibrium                 and    of movement               in
 hard bodies         :    we shall even see            in   corollary IV, that this law
 equally extends to other kinds                       of    bodies, whatever be tbeir
nature and degree               of elasticity.
  If the shock destroyed all the movements, we should have
V =       therefore the equation would be reduced to
          0
          :                                                m                                      s
W u  cosine x =      which shows us that this case happens
                              0 ;                                                                     ;
namely, that all the movements are reciprocally destroyed
 by   the shock,           in   the case        where,          immediately           before this
shock,        the     momentum             of   the quantity           of   movement         of      the
general       system       it isnull, relatively       to all the geometrical move
ments of which             is        susceptible.
                                  Fiust Corollary.
  XXIII. Among all the movements        which any system of       of
hard bodies acting upon each other   susceptible, wlieiher  is                                        by
an immediate shock, or                    by
                           any machines without spring, that
movement which shall really take place the instant after
wards     will be the geometrical movement,  which  suck that                      is
the sum       tke products
              of              each of the masses,

of    the velocity which   will lose, it   minimum,    e. less

  Here    must be remarked, that,

of its velocity lost,understand solely that

rential   of this sum                is    null   ;   i.   e.    that its difference from
what   it     would he          if   the    system         had    a    geometrical          move
ment infmitely little different from the first,                            is   equal to zero         :
                                                                                                thus

                        On Machines in General.                          315
thus this sum may be sometimes              a  maximum,        or even nei
ther a maximum nor a minimum ; and                I have   only to establish
     Demonstration.      —It   is at first evident that the true move
ment of the system after the shock should be geometrical ;
for geometrical movements being those which do not alter
the action which is exercised among bodies, it is clear that
the first in order is the same movement as assumed by the
system     :  it is therefore required to      know, which, among all
possible geometrical         movements,      is the one that should take
 place. Now, Wpposing that it should take another infinitely
 little different from       that  which we are seeking, the velocity
 of   each molecule m would then have been               V  ; let us decora-
 pose   V    into two, one     of which shall be V, i. e. the real ve
 locity, and      the other  V" : this being done, it is evident that if
 the bodies had         not oihcr velocities than these last V", the
 movement would he still geometrical, for V" is visibly the
 rrsult of V' and of a velocity equal and directly opposite to V:
 now, by hypothesis, the molecules taken two by two do not
  tend, either in virtue of V, or in virtue of —V, to approach
  or recede,     since in these two cases         the    movement is geo
  metrical : thus, by supposing thai the molecules m have at
  once the velocities        V    and — V, or their result V", they
  will neither tend to approach nor to recede ; and therefore
  the movement. will then be geometrical : thus, if we
  call k" the angle comprehended between the directions of V*
  and U, we shall have by means of the fundamental equation
   (H) s m U V" cosine x
                                 == 0 : on the other side, let us
                                                                          call
   U' the velocity which        wi would lose       if  its effective velocity
   were V", so       that W    would     be   the    result of V' and U\ it
   would necessarily follow that            U would be composed of U
   and of a velocity cq.ial and directly opposite to V"; whence
   it evidently follow*, that 17 — U or d U =s —                     V  cosine
   x" ; therefore the equation s m U V" cosine z" = o, found
   above, becomes s m U d U = 0, or d s m U > = 0.
       Suppose, for example, two globes A and B striking each
   other obliquely,         I demand their movements after the
    shock.
                                                                      Suppose

316          •                      On Machines in General.
   Suppose that the velocity of A, estimated according to
the line of the centres, was before the shock a, and after the
shock V ; that the velocity of B, also estimated according
to the line of the centres, was before the shock b, and after
the shock u    that the velocity of A, estimated perpendicu
                      ;
larly to the same line, was before the shock a, and after the
shock V'; finally, that the velocity of B, also estimated per
pendicularly to this line of the centres, was before the shock
V,   and after the shock u ; this being done, by our proposi
tion, the movement being necessarily geometrical, we must at
first have V=m; thus the velocity lost by A, according to the
line   of     the centres,             will   be a — a, and that lost by                B, in the
same direction,                 will    be b   — u   :   besides, in the direction per
pendicular to the line                   of the centres, the velocity lost by                          A
will     be a' —          V,     and      that lost by B will be b'— u' ; there
fore     \/ (a       —

lost by A, and that lost by B will be \/ (b — a)* -f   — u')1''                        {b'

therefore, according to the proposition,       we should have
                     (a' -V)1 +

therefore the co-efficient of each                        of    these    differentials must

whether the shock be immediate, or given by means of any
machine without spring, the sum of the active forces be/ore
the shock is always equal to the sum of the active forces
after the shock, plus the sum of the active forces which would
take place if the velocity which remains to each moveable
body were equal to that which it lias lost in the shock.
    That is      to say, we must
                            prove the following equation
iirW     =                   Now it is easily deduced from
                 s m V> + s m U1.
the fundamental equation (E) ; for W being the result of V
and U, it is clear that W V and U are proportional to the
three        of a certain triangle : thus by trigonometry we
         sides
have W»   =       V
                 + U* + 2 V U cosine * : therefore s m W1
= jmV' + imU' + JimVU cosine Z : now by the
equation (E) we have imVU cosine Z = 0 ; therefore
the preceding equation is reduced to s m W1 = rbiV +
s ml]1, o. K. D.
   We «ee, therefore, as has been said (XXT), that by this
transformation the analogy of the equation (E) with the pre
servation of the active forces becomes striking : we may also
easily demonstrate the one by the other,               as   we shall see in
xxvr.
    The analogy of this      same equation          with    the preservation
of the    active forces in a system of hard bodies the move
ment     of which changes by insensible degrees, is still more
evident, since it then regards a case peculiar from that we
have examined ; it is in fact visibly' the particular case where
U  is infinitely small, and theieforc U1 is infinitely small of
the second order ; this reduces the equation toswW' ssm
V* : but this preservation will          be explained       more at length

                        Third Corollary.
  XXV. IV hen any system             of hard todies     changes its move

ment by insensible degrees ;             for   a   moment, we call m the
mass   of   each
               of               its velocity,

                                                                        y    the

  y the angle formed    ly V and u,   d t the element   of the time ;     we
  shall liave these Iwu equations:
              smVpd f cosine R—       smV      d  V=0:
              s m up dt   cosine r —  s m u d    (V cos y.)   =0.
     Demonstration.   — In   the first place, p d t cos    R   is   visibly
  the velocity which the vis motrix p would have impressed
 upon m in the direction of V, if this body had been free:
 besides, d V is the velocity which it would in reality receive
 in the same direction ; therefore p d t cosine R — d V is
 the velocity lost by TO in the direction of V, in virtue of the
 reciprocal action of the bodies : it is therefore this quantity
 that we must put for U cos. Z in the fundamental equation
  (E), which becomes by this substitution s m Vp d t cosine
 R — s mV dV = 0', being the first of the two equations
 which    we had to demonstrate.
    Secondly, p d t cosine r is the velocity which the vis mo
 trix p would have impressed upon in in the direction of K,
if this body had been free ; besides, V cosine y being the
velocity    of  m in   the direction   of u,   d  (V cosine y)     is the
quantity which this velocity estimated in the same direction
 augments : therefore p d t cosine r — d (V cosine y) is the
velocity lost by m in the direction of a, in virtue of the re
ciprocal action of the bodies : it is therefore this quantity
which we must put for U cosine z in the second equation (F),
which becomes by this substitinion s m u p d t cosine r —
s m u   d (V cosine y) = 0, which         is the   second   of   the two
equations we had to demonstrate.
    These equations are therefore nothing else than the fun
damental equations (E) and (F) applied to the case where
the movement changes by insensible degrees, and therefore
they contain all the laws of this movement: we may re
mark also, that the first of these two equations is only a par
ticular case of the second, for the same reason that the
equation (E), whence it is extracted, is contained in that
(F) whence the second is extracted. But this first equation
s m V p d t cosine R — 4 m V d V = 0 deserves particular
attention;    because it contains the famous        principle of       the
preservation of active forces in     a system    of hard bodies       the
movement      of which   changes by insensible degrees      : thus    :
                                                                     Let

     Let   us first call d s the element                              of
                                                                      the curve described by
the corpuscle m during d t                               ;   this being done, we shall have
V    d t   = ds
             and therefore the preceding equation assumes
                        ;
this form smpds cosine R — s mV          =' 0. Now let us                   dV
suppose for a moment that the curve described by m is an
inflexible line, ihat m is a moveable grain interwoven with
this curve, that it traverses it freely, i. e. without being
pressed by the re-actions                            of      the other
                                                         system,             parts    of    the
that it experiences at each point of this curve the same
vis motiix as that with which it was animated in the first
case ; and that, finally, in this first case the initial velocity
of   m is      K, while in                     the second it
                                                         first        will     be    null   at the
instant,        and         V           after an indeterminate
                                          time / : this being
done, by integrating the preceding equation, in order to
have the state of the system at the end of the time t, we
shall have for the first case s' s m p d s cosine R — s' s m

motrix which it there really experiences, and that its velocity
at the first instant had been null.
   It is this proposition which we call the principle of the
preservation of active forces j and whence we may conclude
that,
     In a   system       of hard   bodiesthe movement of which changes
by insensible degrees,             and which are not animated with any
vis motrix, the sum of the active forces is a constant quan

     LX.        On Chemical Nomenclature.                   By   a   Correspondent a
                                 To     Mr. Tilloch.
J. he importance of              an accurate and scientific nomenclature
being now admitted      every lover of chemistry,
                                   by               shall                      I
make no apology for suggesting what consider an improve   I
ment.  The metalline salts are named after plan which                  a
isextremely defective.   proceeds upon the supposion that
                                      It
no more than two oxides of any metal can combine with
the same acid.  The salt whose base     the first of these    is
oxides      is   named      as   if   there     were no oxide present          a
                                                                                    thus^
the protoxide of iron and sulphuric acid form what   called                    is
sulphate of iron.   On the other hand, the salt which con
tains the second of these oxides     known by oxy beingis
prefixed, in the as
                 oxy-sulphate  of iron.
  This mode of nomenclature       objectionable on several
                                                  is
accounts.
     1st.   It   is   extremely deficient in the extent               of application,

                      On Chemical Nomenclature.                    321
  as it makes    not the least provision for those metals which
 combine with three and four proportions of oxygen ; conse
 quently there are no names for those salts which contain
 oxides intermediate between the minimum and the maxi
 mum.       For instance, late experiments have shown that no
 less than three oxides     of iron combine with        the sulphuric
 acid.    The first of these combinations is called sulphate of
 iron,   the last is called oxy-sulphate ; and for the second
 there is no chemical name.
     2dly. It is evident that great confusion        must arise from
 the want of some distinction between               a  superfluity   of
 oxygen in the acid, and          a maximum      in the base.    Am   I
 to   suppose   that   the  oxy-prussiate of iron is the peroxide
 combined with prussic acid ; — or must I conclude that it is
 the metal in an inferior degree      of oxidation    combined with
 oxy-prussic acid?       Indeed, by pursuing .the present nomen
clature, we may soon expect to hear of oxy-oxy-prussiates
and oxy-hyper-oxy-muriates,          when there are at the same
 time an excess of oxygen in the acid and a maximum in
the base.
    3dly. When any metal has more oxides than two, the
present nomenclature leaves us totally unable to distinguish
the particular oxide united to the acid. Thus any one would
suppose that the nitrate, sulphate and hyperoxymuriate of
lead, each contained the same oxide base ; yet we find these
salts severally   containing the prot-, deut-, and per-oxides.
    In short,  to these capital defects in nomenclature      I ascribe
the slow progress        which   has  hitherto   been made in our
knowledge of       the   metallic salts, and   I conclude that some
improvement is absolutely necessary.            That which    I would
suggest has at least the advantage      of clearness and simplicity.
I would carry into the nomenclature of these salts, Doctor
Thomson's mode of designating the metallic oxides. For
nitrate of lead, I would say nitrated protoxide of lead ; and
for oxy-nitrate, I would say (if such salts can be formed)
nitrated deutoxide, tritoxide, or peroxide, according to the
degree in which the metal may happen to be oxided.                 By
this change every possible variety of these salts is provided
with a name, clearly distinguishing the degree to which the

method now in use.                       Yours,               E. B.
    P. S. As Mr. Davy's      late  experiments hold out to us the
prospect of decomposing several substances hitherto ranked
with simple bodies, I would beg leave to suggest the pro
priety of adopting names for them as nearly as possible allied
to the nomenclature in use.         I would call the base of the
muriatic acid, muria ; that of the boracic, borax ; and that
of the fluoric, fluor. We should not object to these words,
that they will be unmeaning in their new application, and
that some of them have been used           before   to   signify other
substances.     We should recollect that words            are only the
signs of things, and possess no other relation to them than
that which is derived from custom : we should also remem
ber, that the words borax and fluor, though formerly used,
are no longer chemical terms, and may therefore without
impropriety be applied to any new substance. Upon this
principle, I have always lamented that the base of nitric
acid was not called nitre, instead of azote or nitrogen ; for,
if the acid were named regularly after either of these, it
would be the azotic or nitrogenic, and not the nitric, acid.           .
 LXI.    Account  of the Manufactures carried        on at Bangalore,
     and the Processes employed by the Natives in Dyeing Silk
     and Cotton.
                        [Concluded from p. 272.3
  J.  HE weavers   of Bangalore seem        to me to be a very in
 genious   class  of  men, and, with         encouragement, to be
 capable of making very rich, fine,          elegant   cloths of any-
 kind that may be in demand : but,          having    been  chiefly ac
 customed to work goods for the use of the court at Seringa-
 patam, they must now labour under great disadvantages ;
 for it never can be expected that the court of Mysore should
 equal that of Seringapatam, nor will the English officers
 ever demand the native goods so much            as the    Mussulman
 sirdars did.    The manufacturers of this         place    can never,
 therefore, be expected     to equal what they were        in Hyder's
                                                                  reign,

 reign, unless some foreign market can he found for the
 goods.     Purnea, very desirous of the re-establishment of
this city, has forwarded by me the musters of cotton and
 silk cloth  that accompany this account,         with a request that
 they may     be   presented    in his name to the marquis Wel-
lesley  :  and  I  beg leave to recommend,       that the attention of
the board of trade may be directed to them, with a view of
 forming some commercial arrangements that may assist in
 restoring a country which has suffered so much.
    The silk manufacture seems especially favourable for a
country so far from the sea and from navigable rivers ; as
long carriage, on such a valuable article, is of little import
ance.     At   present   all the raw material     is imported   : but   I
see no reason why it might not be raised in Mysore to great
 advantage.      Tippoo     had commenced a trial ; but his        arbi
trary measures were little calculated to ensure success. Some
of  the mulberry-trees, however, that remain in his gardens
show how well the plant agrees with this climate.                   It is
true, that the experiments hitherto tried below the Ghauts
have not been favourable : but much resolution and patience
are always required to introduce any new article            of cultiva
tion ; and I suspect that the climate here, owing to its being
more temperate, will be found more favourable than that of
the lower Carnatic.
    There is a small duty levied here on every loom ; and it
is judiciously    diminished to those who keep many, in order
to encourage      men of wealth to employ their capital in that
way.      A  man who has one loom pays, annually,           3$fanams
 (2s. 6\d.)  ;  two looms pay bfanams (3s. 4|d.) ; and a man
who keeps more than two looms pays only for each two
fanams, or 15. 4d. All shopkeepers               pay similar trifling
duties.
    There is here    a set   of people called Rungaru,      who act as
tailors, cloth -printers, and dyers.        Their printed cloths are
very coarse, and the art among them is in            a very  imperfect
state.    The only two colours that       they can give in     printing
are red    and black.      Their process  is as follows  :
    The cloth    that is to be printed is kept all night    in  a  mix-

lime.  Next morning it is washed again, and then put into
a cold infusion of arulay myrobalans, (terminalia arula,
fiuch. MSS.) mixed with some gum of the dinduga tree,
(Andersonia Panchmoum, Roxb. MSS.)          The quantity of
myrobalans for 12 cubits of cloth is 6 dudus weight (2 x%%%-
ounces), and of gum two dudus weight (12-fV^ drachms).
The cloth, after being thoroughly wet in this, is taken out,
and dried in the sun. It is then folded, placed on a smooth
plank, and well beaten with a stick,               which      serves       instead
of mangling.
     The mordant for         the red dye is as follows        :     Dissolve in
one seer (68 cubical inches) of hot water, 6 dudus weight
(2tVoV ounces) of alum, and 12 dudus weight (4WA ounces)
of dinduga gum.     This mordant is poured into a cavity that
is made in a block of timber, and covered with four folds
of country blanket well moistened with the dinduga muci
lage. The wooden blocks for printing are moistened with
the mordant, by applying their surfaces to the blankets. The
cloth to be printed is laid on a table covered with four folds
of old cloth,      and the blocks are applied, and pressed down
by the hand.        It is then kept for eight or ten days.
     If
      the printer wishes to add black to the pattern, the
cloth must be again printed with the following mordant.
Take 5 seers (3-fViftrlbs.)   of iron dross, and 5 seers of old
iron, put them  into a pot containing rather more than two ale
quarts    (2-J- seers)   of hot kanji, or decoction of rice             ; then add
half a seer (\-££fc ounces) of sugar-jagory, and keep it six
or seven days. Next add half a seer of dinduga gum rubbed
up with a little ghee (boiled butter), and allow it all night
to dissolve : the mordant is then fit for use, and is applied
in   the same manner as the other.           After this           the    cloth   re
quires only four days to dry.
                                                     by it,
  After the mordants have been dried on                       the cloth must
be taken to the tank, washed very well,                       beating      it   on   a
                                                                            stone

         and the Processes used for Dyeing Silk and Cotton. 325
  stone for an hour, and          then dried.    In order  to give it the
 colour,     put a piece, that hasireceived the mordants, into a
  pot, with 20 seers (about five gallons) of water of the kind
 called here salt, one half seer of popli bark, and one dudu
 weight (6-iWo drachms) of castor oil ; then boil it for two
 hours, all the while carefully stirring the whole.            The cloth
 is then     taken out, and dried in the sun. At night it is
 soaked in a mixture of sheep's dung and water, next morn
 ing washed, and then bleached all day. At night it is again
 put into the mixture of sheep's dung and water, and next
 day is again bleached.           The operation is then finished by
 starching it with kanji.         The black is a fixed colour, but the
 red is perishable.
     With the patunga wood these           Rungaru dye cotton cloth
 of  a red   colour,   which    is bright, but does not stand wash
 ing.     It  is said   that  the people   of Madras    have the art    of
 fixing it.     The   process   used by the Rungaru      is as follows :
 Prepare the cloth by soaking each piece in a seer of water,
 containing six dudus weight of powdered myrobalans. Then
 dip it into two or three seers (about two quarts) of a decoc
 tion  of patunga wood, in which            have   been   dissolved two
 dudus weight      of alum. Then dry the cloth in the sun. The
 operation     must   be repeated four or five times, until the co
lour be deep enough. The decoction of patunga is made as
follows    :   Beat two seers (l-ft^^-Ibs.) of patunga wood, put it
into   a pot with 20 seers (about 5 gallons) of water, and boil
for six hours.
    The Niligaru are another class of dyers, of the same cast
with the potmakers, and derive their name from their dyeing
with the nila or indigo.           The whole of this dye that is used
here comes from the lower Carnatic, or northern Circars. In
order to make a vat, the Niligaru take ten seers (6-r^^lbs.)
of indigo, ground with a little water to a fine powder j put it
into   a  pot capable of containing 50 seers measure (or a little
more than 12 ale gallons) ; and add a decoction of lagashay
iija, or seed of the cassia lora, which is made as follows :
Take 4 seers measure (-iVito Winchester gallon) of the seed,
and boil it for 6 hours in four or five seers of water (about an
ale gallon).     The boiled    seed, as well as the decoction,     must
                                       X3                              be

be put        inlo   the vat ; and            then there must be added                         10 seers
(G-rVriVlb. )    Powdered soulu, or impure soda, 12 seers
                      °^
(7tVitl0.) of quicklime, and two seers of the ley of pot-ash
(137 cubical inches).    The whole is then stirred with a
stick,                of the pot is covered up. Every even
              and the mouth
ing                for four days, three seers (206 cubical
        and morning,
inches) more of the ley must be added ; and in the last por
tion must be put about the size of an apple of quicklime.
The vat now rests for three days ; when four or five seers of
boiling water must be added to         and the vat     it,
                                                      then ready                     is
for dyeing.     The ley of potash    prepared as follows
                                                      is    Burn                              :
to ashes the branches of the calli (enpliorbium tirucaUi), or
of the utrayena (achyrantkes rnuricata) of these ashes put           :
2 seers (1-JLiJj-lb.l into   pot, in the bottom of which there
                                         a
is small hole. The hole
    a                             covered with  is small inverted            a

                           rice  husks  or  chaff.  Above these
are     put the ashes,  on them are poured
                                       and       degrees 25                          hy

                           6    ale gallons
the hole in the bottom of the pot, and forms the ley.     It
must be observed,                  that the water used               by   the    Niligaru           is   al
ways either that called here salt, or that which                                         is   found      in*
places abounding with calcareous tuffa.
   The indigo vat having been prepared, an estimate                                                      is
formed of the number of seers weight of cotton that    will                                     it
dye. For every seer weight of cotton thread pass       seer                                    a
measure of water through the pot containing the ashes, and
in this weak            ley dip the           seer   of cotton       j    wash       it   well, and
then wring out the water. The solution of indigo       then                                    is
divided, into five equal parts.  The thread      dipped,                         is                      by

     From the weavers the Niligaru receive          cotton, and silk

 a green colour,     which it obtains by a dip in a weak pot.
     At Bangalore, as well as in all the neighbouring country,
 goni is a considerable article of manufacture. It is a coarse
 but very strong sack-cloth, from 18 to S2 cubits in length,
 and from £ to     %  of  a cubit broad ; and is made from the
janupa, or crotalaria juncea.       It is divided into three kinds,
 which differ in value according to their strength and to the
 closeness   of the fabric. The same people, who are a par
 ticular cast of men, cultivate the plant, and carry on the
 manufacture, until the goni be fit for sale ; the price of the
 hemp cannot therefore be ascertained, as it is not sold in
 that state. The goni-maker hires from some farmer as much
 high ground as he thinks will raise a quantity of janupa suf
 ficient to employ his family to manufacture in one year.
 The soil ought to be red or black, like the best kinds used
 for the cultivation of ragy.      It is allowed no manure ; and
 the seed is sown broad-cast         on the ground, without any
 previous cultivation, at the season when the rains become
 what the natives call male, that is to say, when they be
 come heavy. After being sown, the field is ploughed twice,
 once lengthwise, and once across ; but receives no further
 cultivation.   At other times the janupa is cultivated on rioe-
 ground in the dry season ; but it must then be watered from
 a canal, or reservoir.       It requires four months to ripen,
 which is known by the seeds having come to full maturity.
 After being cut down, it is spread out       to the sun, and dried.
 The seed is then beaten out by striking      the pods  with a stick.
 After this the stems are tied up in          large  bundles, about
 two fathoms in circumference,        and are preserved in stacks,
 or under sheds.         The bundles are taken out as wanted,
 and put in the water, at which time their bands are cut, and
 the stems being opened out are kept down to the bottom
 by stones or mud.          According to circumstances, they re
 quire to be kept in the water from six to eight days.         They
 are  known to    be ready,   when the bark separates easily from

taking   it up by handfuls, beats them on the ground, oc
casionally washes them until they be clean ; and at the same
time picks out tvith his hand the remainder of the pith, un
til nothing except the bark be left. This is then dried, and,
being taken up by handfuls, is beaten with a stick to sepa
rate and clean the fibres.  The hemp is then completely
ready, and is spun into thread on a spindle, both by the
men and women.    The men alone weave          and perform                  it,

which immediately become black.
  These skins may be dyed red                               by   the   following       process   :

after it has been freed from the hair as before mentioned,
with this decoction; and then put it into the pot with the
myrolalans and water for three days. This is a good co
lour, and for many purposes the skins are well dressed.
      The hides of oxen and buffaloes are dressed as follows :
Jor      each skin take 2 seers (1-iVirV'M of quick -lime, and S
or 6 seers measure (about l ', ale gallon) of water ; and in
 this mixture keep the skins for eight days, and rub off the
hair.       Then for each skin take ten seers, by weight, (about
 6 lb.) of the unpceled sticks of the tayngadu (cassia auricu-
 lata), and 10 seers measure of water (about 2£ ale gallons),
 and in this infusion keep the skins for four days.                       For an
 equal length of time, add the same quantity of tayngadu and
 water. 1'hen wash, and dry the skins in the sun, sti etching
 them out with pegs.             This leather is very bad.
      The oil-makers        at Bangalore are a very        considerable class
 of people, and are of the kind that use two bullocks in their
 mill, of which a drawing is given (Plate VIII *). The mortar
 is a block      of granite. This      class  of people   are called    Jotypha-
 nada, or Jotynagarada Ganagaru. They express                       the follow
  ing kinds of oil : wull'-eltu, huts' -ellu, harulu, cobri, ipay,
  and hoingay.
      The wull'-ellu oil is expressed from two varieties or
  species of sesamum seed, called here surugana and cari ellus.
  They      are the same with the          wullay   and phidagana         ellus    of
  Seringapatam.           The first gives the least oil ; but for the
  table it is esteemed the best of any in the country: the
  price, however, of the two kinds is the same. The mill re
  ceives at one time about seventy seers measure                   (2-r,(5V Win
   chester bushels) of sesamum seed; and, in the                        course of
  grinding, ten Cucha seers measure of water (2-^ ale quarts)
   are gradually added.           The grinding continues lor six hours,

when the farinaceous parts of the seed, and the water, form
a cake ; and this having been removed, the oil is found
clean and pure in the bottom of the mortar, from whence
it is taken by a cup. Seventy Pucka seers (Z-pfa Win
chester bushels) of surugana, or 65 seers of cari-ellu seed
(2-rVoV Winchester bushels), gives Cucha mounds (rather
more than 5i ale gallons) of oil.  The mill requires the la
bour of two men and four oxen, and grinds twice a day.
The oxen are fed entirely on straw, and are allowed none of
the cake ; which is sometimes dressed with greens and fruits
into curry, and at others given to milch cattle.
   The huts' -ellu is managed exactly in the same manner as
the sesamum.     The seventy seers measure require a little
more water than the other ellu, and give 65 seers of oil (or
a little more than 4$ gallons).  This also is used for the
table.         The    cake is never used for curry,              but is commonly
given to milch cattle.
   The harulu, or castor oil,              indifferently from
                                                   is made
either the large or small varieties of the ricinus.    It is the
common lamp oil of the country, and is also used in medi
cine.          The oil    made by boiling is only for family use; all
that is made            for sale is expressed in the mill. To form
the cake, seventy seers of the seed require only five seers,
Cucha measure (\-fgy ale quarts), of water, and give 60
seers      (4-^       ale gallons)        of oil   ;  which, after being taken
out       of    the   mill, must          be    boiled for half an hour, and
then       strained       through         a    cloth.   The cake is used as
fuel.
     Coin oil is that        made from the dried kernel              of the coco
nut, which            is called coin'.           This oil is chiefly used for
anointing        the hair and skin.              Cakes are also fried in  andit,
it    sometimes used for the lamp.
     is                                The mill receives                           6

produces three maunds (about 7-1*0- ale gallons) of oil. The
natives eat the cake dressed in various ways.
  The ipay oil, made from the fruit of the bassia longifolia,
is   used for the lamps burned before the gods, being esteemed
of   a better quality than, that of the ricinus. The mill takes

which     2 seers of tamarinds   have been infused.        The produce
is  70 seers (4-r10%V ale gallons)     of oil. The cake is          used as
soap to wash oil out      of the hair  of those who anoint           them
selves.
    The hoingay oil, produced from the seed of the roblnia
 mitis, is used for the lamp ; but it consumes very quickly.
 It is also used externally     in many diseases.        Take 70 seers,

 and, having kept it for two or three days, dry it in the sun¦
 It is then put into the mill with one Cucha seer (19-^ cubi
 cal inches)   of water. It produces 40 seers (2f a!e gallons)
 of oil. For fuel, the cake is mixed with cow-dung.
    The English weight, to which all the native weights are
 reduced, is the pound avoirdupois.
 LXII.     Description of the Bermuda Islands, and particularly
    the  Island of St. George. Addressed to the Directors of
    the  French Museum of Natural History, by M.A. F. Mif

    ministration of Woods and Forests in North America*.
 X embarked         at Bourdeaux on the 5th of February, 1806,
 for the United States ; my voyage having for its object to
 collect and transmit to the administration in the department
  of woods and forests, a great quantity of seeds and plants
  of such forest   trees as might    be   naturalized in France,          or
  succeed   in those uncultivated districts where our           own indi
  genous trees refuse to grow.          On the 23d of March the
  American vessel, on board of which I was, fell in with the
  Leander, an English man-of-war, commanded by captain
  Whitby, who, suspecting our cargo to belong to French
  merchants,     sent  the  ship to Halifax, in Nova Scotia.                I

   was the only one      of all    the passengers     who was ordered on
   board the Leander,        where    I  remained for 43 days, during
   which time the cruize          lasted.    This  disagreeable   event re
  moved me more than 600 leagues from Charlestown ; but it
  gave me an opportunity of visiting the Bermuda Islands,
   vhere the Leander anchored on the 7th of April, to take in
  water.     We remained there eight days, and I obtained per
  mission from captain Whitby (who always treated me with
  the utmost       politeness) to go on shore frequently: upon
  these visits I made the observations I am about to com
  municate *.
      The number of islands composing             the Archipelago     of  the
  Bermudas is        so considerable,       that the inhabitants say they
  are equal to the days       of the   year.    The largest are only from
  12 to 13 miles long.         The smallest look like lime rocks just
  rising abcve the surface of the sea. The whole occupies an
  extent of ibout 35 miles in length by 20 or 25 broad. To
  wards the north immense strata             of rocks   extend from 30 to
  40 miles, rendering the approach of vessels dangerous.
      These islands, although much lower than the Azores,
  present    nearly   the   same     appearance    at a distance, and re
 semble long and high ridges of hillocks covered with a
 darkish verdure.        They are not surrounded by a flat and
 sandy beach like lhe Floridas, but skirted by high rocks,
 against which theg waves are continually breaking.
     The island near which the English ships of war generallv
 anchor is called St. George's, which is also the name of the
 chief town.        The town of Hamilton            is in another   island,
 fifteen miles    off;   these two are the only towns in the Ber
mudas.       Theie are no houses so close together in any other
place as to entitle them even to the name of villages.
     St. George's island is situated at the north end of the
Archipelago, and it was the only one on which I landed.
It   is of the second     class in point of size, being nine miles
long by three      broad    in some places, and only a quarter of a
mile in others.        The straights, which separate its southern
shores from the islands of St. David, form the harbour, and

and proceeded to New

                                                                         its

             and particularly the Island    of St. George.          333
its entrance is strongly barricadoed by the projecting point
of another island.       It is edged round with blackish rocks,
varying in height from 5 to 25 feet.              When viewed at a
distance, these rocks      resemble   a long  hillock,   the inequali
ties in which constitute so many small valleys.             Upon the
heights the soil is dry and sandy, and frequently the bare
rock is seen : in the low grounds, on the contrary, the earth
is a brown clay slightly moistened, and its vigorous vegeta
tion announces its extreme fertility.
    Three fourths of the island are covered          with wood    ;  the
rest is partly cultivated,     or so barren that it is not suscepti
ble  of cultivation.
    The plants peculiar     to the island are few in number     :   and
although       my journeys through the island were very rapid,
I  think    I may safely affirm that the number of species does
not exceed 140 or 150.          Among     these plants we find seve
ral belonging to the antient continent,         which    do  not seem
to have been      of a nature  to occasion them to be transplanted
here  :   these are, the verbascum     thapsus, anagallis arvensis,
mercurialis annua, leontodon taraxacum, plantago major,
urticaurens, gentiana nana, oxalis acetosella, &c. We
also find here the great cabbage palm tree, chamcerops pal-
meto, and the rhus toxkodendrum of North America.                    As
to other plants, I could only ascertain a small number of
them    ;  bat   I collected   seeds  of all  those which had been
preserved     the year before, among others a strawberry plant,
the   aromatic flowers of which resemble sage, and it is on
this account called sage-bush by the inhabitants ; a beautiful
species of verbena, and a small medicago, each foot of which
scarcely occupies an inch of ground ; this is the most com
mon plant in the country, forming almost the whole of the
verdure every where ; the surface of the ground not-beinir, as
in Europe and the United States, covered chiefly with the
grasses, of which last there are very few kinds in the Ber
mudas.
    Thejuniperus Bermudiana, called by the inhabitants               ce
dar,   is the only forest tree in these islands     : the whole are
nearly covered with them ; and it is this tree which, when
seen in clumps at a distance, gives a dull and sombre ap

834              Description     of the Bermuda Islands,
pearance to the islands.             It grows throughout the whole
island, in every kind of exposure ; but in the valleys its ve
getation is more vigorous than upon the summit of the
hills, and the primordial branches attain to a great height.
Its elevation does not exceed 40 or 50 feet, and its diameter
is from    a  foot to    15  inches.    Although   the branches have a
tendency to expand from the trunk,             those of  the  full-grown
trees touch each other ; which may give an idea                of the di
stance at which they are placed.             Upon the heights, and in
places which having been recently laid bare are               replenished
with young trees from the seeds of the old, one fourth of
the young trees forms a thicket ; the branches shoot out
very close to the earth, and extend eight or ten feet around
the parent tree
   These cedar         trees are not felled at any regular season :
they   cut   down    a  tree whenever they think it of a sufficient
size for their purpose, leaving it to nature to fill up the va
cancies made by these occasional removals ; and to this im
providence may in a great measure be ascribed                    the high
price to which the wood of these trees has risen.
    It was the flourishing season when          I was at the Bermudas.
The female       trees    were discernible at the distance of 15 or
SO paces by the darker colour              of their foliage : the seeds
are ripe about the end          of October, but they fall during win
ter  ; so that    I could find only a very few upon the trees.
I  am very      anxious to see them cultivated, and have no
doubt that this tree would be a valuable acquisition, either
for the island of Corsica, or for some parts of our de
partments of the South near the Mediterranean. They make
a syrup of these seeds, said to be extremely useful in cer
tain pulmonary complaints.
    The jnniperus Bermudiana is very much esteemed, on ac
count of the quality of its wood * ; it is fine grained, com
pact, and more resinous than the juniperus Virginiana. As
in   the former species the sap is only five or six lines thick in
a tree   of   12  or   14  inches diameter,    this wood is employed
   * We may judge of its colour and smell from the black-lead pencils called
English crayons : the juniper tree of the Bermudas and that of Virginia are
equally employed in their fabrication.
                                                                          in

            and particularly the Island    of St. George.         335
in building sloops, which has been the principal branch of
the industry of the Bermudians for a long period.               These
vessels    are  remarkable for their      quick sailing, and last
for a long time. It is said, however, that they are more
liable to go to pieces than oak vessels when they strike.
Six luggers, or cutters, from 120 to 140 tons, and copper-
bottomed, have been built at the Bermudas by order of the
English government.
    The cedar tree is the sole riches of the inhabitants ; and
the fortune of every individual is estimated by the number
of   trees he possesses.   They   are sold on the ground at a gui
 nea each.
    I  was told there were no quadrupeds natural to the coun
 try. The only birds I saw in the woods were, the cardinal,
 loxia cardinalis, and the blue bird, motacilla sialh, which
 they say belongs to the continent of North America.
    Every year, in the months of March and April, the Ca
 chalot whales approach very near the shores, where some of
 the inhabitants,   but particularly the men      of colour, fish for
 them.
     The shell-fish which      are most common        belong to the
 genera of turbo, donax,       and    mytilla.   The latter   are very
 abundant,     and are only 5 or 6 lines long.
     Agriculture, which     is now entirely neglected     in the Ber
 mudas, once flourished there,        as is proved    by the records
 of   the custom-house,    which mention the quantity of sugar
 and wines annually exported from the colony.            The present
  inhabitants employ    the  small  number   of negroes they possess
  in cultivating pot-herbs and maize, and in feeding poultry.
 They have very few cattle or horses, and I saw only about
  a dozen cows on the island,        which were deriving a scanty
  maintenance from the medicago 1 have mentioned* In the
  country there are enclosures yhich might form a better sort
  of pasturage, but they are all planted with cedar trees. Pro
  visions of every kind are so rare, and so dear, thai the ships
  of war which are constantly arriving at the Bermudas can
  only procure potatoes and onions.
     There is but one kind of stone in the island, which is
  found    in great  abundance     a  few feet below the surface.
                                                                 Upon

   Upon coming out of         the quarry    it is very white, and so  ten
  der that it may be reduced         to powder between the fingers;
  when exposed to the air it becomes of a deep gray and in
  durates. When seen through the microscope it appeared
  to me as composed of a very fine sand and of shells. Two
  quarries are wrought near the town, in each of which eight
  or ten negroes or mulattoes are employed, who earn from a
  piaster to a piaster and a half daily.           Their labour is easy :
  the stones when detached from the mass are sawn into             pieces
 of ahout   one or two feet broad by six or eight inches thick.
     Neither   at St. George's        island nor at any other of the
 Bermudas are there any springs or rivulets, and experience
 has shown that wells cannot be dug ; rain water, therefore,
 is alone made use of, which, from the precautions used, is
 not only sufficient for the inhabitants, but also for supply
 ing the ships of war which put in there for the purpose.
     About 100 yards from the sea, there are constructed
 upon an inclined plane two immense terraces of a triangular
 form, destined to receive the rain water, which flows into
 cisterns, around which the empty casks are rolled, and filled
by means of hand pumps.
    The walls of these terraces           are of mason work ; and al
though each occupies a space            of 450 or 500 fathoms, they
are not always         sufficient for the supply of the shipping.
The distance of         these government cisterns from the town is
about    a mile.     The    road to them is eight or ten feet broad,
and is shaded by cedar trees.            Ships of war of the first   and
second rate cannot enter the harbour, but are anchored               one
or two miles     off-.
    The town of St. George's has only 250 or 300 houses. It
is intersected by a dozen of narrow streets not paved, and
one of which only admits of a carriage to pass : the houses,
which mostly consist of only one story above the ground,
are generally coloured yellow.            The whole are of stone, and
covered with tiles, with a gutter round the roof to receive
the rain water     :   this roof, which is painted white, reflect*
the rays of the sun so strongly as to be very injurious to the
eyesight.
    Several  houses       have small gardens, the walls       of which
                                                                     are

 are covered      with   the   cactus opuntia.        The most common
 pot-herbs,      however, are alone cultivated in them.              In some
 I  have seen the carica papaya,          the melia azedarach, the ba-
 nanier,     and the geranium roseum          and zonale.
     We    meet with very few people in the streets,              and the in
 habitants seem to be extremely indolent.                    There are only
 live or six shops in the town, where spices, trinkets, and
 cloths, are sold at a very high price. The Americans im
 port into the place planks, maize, flour, butter, and some
 other provisions, for which they receive ready money. The
 money     of the country    is the heavy piaster.
    They estimate the population of the Bermudas at eight or
 nine thousand souls.           I do not know the proportion of
 whites to negroes, but the latter are said to be more nume
 rous.     The lower classes are accused of misleading ships in
 stormy weather, in order to pillage those who have the mis-                  *
 fortune to be thrown on their shores ; and the Bermudian
 pirates   have always been proverbial for their barbarity.
    These islands are said to be very healthy ; which cannot
 be doubted from their situation.

after the separation of the water and carbonic acid, from

very pure, we must charge the retorts as full as possible, and
heat them gradually.  Without these precautions, we ob
tain an oxide mixed with oxide at the maximum, which, in
this case, gives oxygenated gas with the muriatic acid, while
that which is pure does not give an atom of it.
   The gray oxide is dissolved with effervescence in the nitric
acid, without giving nitrous gas : when heated in the open
air, it becomes black immediately.     We easily discover an
oxide, some parts of which are raised to the maximum by

  The weak acids, vinegar for instance, dissolve the first
                                                                     precipitate

   precipitate totally : applied to the other two, they separate
  black oxide from them.            Lastly, the blue oxide does not
  give any gas with the muriatic acid, while the green does.
      From this we must conclude, that the blue oxide is oxy
  genated at the expense        of  the air contained in cold liquids,
  and that the green oxide is a mixture         of blue oxide and black
  oxide.     M.    Proust thinks nevertheless, that there is some
  thing more than a simple mixture ; for the blue and black
  colours would not give this shade of grass green, , which
  distinguishes it from every other oxide.             Nothing but a
  true combination          can Jyield  a colour foreign to that of
                                                        O
 its components, and hinder the action of the air from
 elevating to the maximum the portion of blue oxide which
 forms part of the green precipitate.          In order to oxidize this
 precipitate completely, we must dry it by means of heat, as
 Thenard has shown.
     The reddish gray precipitate, in the third experiment, is a
 mixture of hydrate and black oxide.
     It is only the minimum oxide that can he combined with
 the acids : the green oxide is never obtained from any so
 lution, and cannot become           the base of any saline combina
 tion.
     Ammonia and Oxide          of Cobalt. —The gray oxide put into
 a   well-closed      flask, along with ammonia,. communicates
 to it  a  slight   red colour,    which does not become higher,
 however long the flask is kept : this oxide is therefore but
 very difficultly soluble in ammonia. But if the flask remain
 uncorked the ammonia is very quickly coloured, because it
 attracts   carbonic acid from the air. We may operate this
 solution     in a   very   short time, by placing the flask in a
large bason, in which we put a salt of carbonic acid.
    If we only saturate the ammonia with acid, the solution
is that    of the oxide in the carbonate of ammonia. If we
continue to make the carbonic acid pass, we obtain a solution
of carbonate of cobalt in the carbonate of ammonia. This
solution, when kept in a flask full and corked, deposits cry
stals of metallic carbonate ; it abandons a part of them by
the addition of water: an excess of volatile alkali redissolves
this precipitate.        We may make this solution very speedily,
by throwing carbonate of cobalt into carbonate            of ammonia.

310             Facts upon which to found a History
    If we   put pure ammonia upon carbonate of cobalt in ex
cess,   this  alters the case completely.      The carbonate of co
balt is divided into two parts : the one yields its acid to the
ammonia and becomes hydrate, which is precipitated to the
bottom of the vessel, while the portion not decomposed is
dissolved into alkaline carbonate.
    Here   we hare already two kinds        of ammoniacal solutions
of cobalt. There is a third discovered by Tassaert, but in .
general very little remarked hitherto.          We obtain it by put
ting hydrate well washed, or blue oxide, into a flask full of
ammonia         and well closed.      The solution    is made     in  24'
hours.       It  is red  like the former  ; but differs from them      in
this respect, that if we pour a drop of it imo boiling water,
blue oxide is immediately precipitated : when we operate
 with cold water we obtain green oxide. If ammonia dis
solves the hydrate of cobalt, or the fresh blue oxide, more
 easily than the gray oxide, it is because the two former are
 in  very minute      division.
     Distillation of the ammoniacal Solution.       —When       we distil
 the solution        of carbonated cobalt, carbonate of ammonia
 passes over ; the       liquor in the end deposits an oxide at first
 of  a dirty green, but      which afterwards becomes black. This
 is a mixture of gray oxide and black oxide.
     How happens this hyper-oxidation ? M. Proust merely
 states the fact, and abstains from explanation where data
 are wanting.
     Hydrate of Cobalt. —The crystals of sulphate, or of ni
  trate, thrown into a flask full of liquid potash, and im
  mediately closed, are there decomposed : a blue precipitate
  is formed, which passes to the violet, afterwards to the red,
  by becoming hydrate.
     If we boil hydrate with potash, the latter dissolves oxide,
  and is tinged with a fine blue colour.        This solution is de
  composed upon the addition of water.           In the air the oxide
  becomes black,        and is deposited.
     The hydrate is dissolved cold in the carbonate           of potash,
  and tinges it red. The oxide is not dissolved.
     The hydrate of cobalt is of the colour of       a dead rose    leaf :
  the acids dissolve it with heat, and without         effervescence.
     The hydrate is not decomposed by ebullition,               either  in
                                                                     pure

 pure water or in alkalized water.            It loses from 20 to 21 of
 water by heat, and is reduced to very pure gray oxide.
    It keeps very badly under water : when it is in contact
 with   the air it becomes     black.     The dry hydrate is better
 preserved,    but  attracts carbonic     acid.
    When we throw cr)stals of sulphate into a flask full of
 ammonia and immediately closed, they give a blue precipi
 tate, which does not become red as in the potash.              M.  Proust
 asserts that the hydrate is formed,          but that it is dissolved
 in some proportion         in ammonia      ; so    that it is the hydrate
 which colours the solution,        and not the simple oxide.
   Valuation    of the Oxygen in     the minor Oxide.       — 100  parts of
 gray oxide, reduced with proper precautions in a closed
 crucible, give 83i of metallic grains. The quintal of cobalt
 seems therefore to absorb       19  of oxygen, in order to become
 minor oxide.
    Major    oxide.  — If  we distil    a  nitric solution      of cobalt,
 black crusts are deposited upon the sides of the retort, ni
 trous gas is disengaged, and we obtain from 1 25 to 1 26 of
 black oxide    as the residue.      Hence we may conclude, that
 the maximum       of the oxidation    of the cobalt exists about 25
 or 26 in 100.
    This oxide is not dissolved in             the   nitric and sulphuric
.acids, except by losing the portion         of oxygen which consti
 tuted its maximum.
    It gives oxygen gas with the muriatic acid.
    It is insoluble in ammonia and potash.
    The black oxide, heated for half an hour at the bottom
of a crucible, again     becomes gray oxide by losing its oxygen:
we may then tinge the vitrescible matters blue.
    Messrs. Proust and TUalaker found the black                   oxide at
Pavias, in    a journey   to Valeutia.       It  is also found in cobalt
ores, which have been called vitreous or black ores.
    The carbonate     and hydrate     of cobalt    is changed into black
oxide, by the contact of the oxy-muriatic acid.
   The nitrous and sulphurous acids dissolve the black oxide,
and form with it nitrate and sulphate at the minimum.

   The muriatic acid at 15° yields a great deal of gas with
black oxide. This solution is green while it retains the gas ;

because the salt still contains muriate of nickel,      which
tinges   it   yellow, and forms green with the blue.

The latter is not dissolved in ammonia; it gives water and sul

    The oxides when heated with sulphur become sulphuret.
 Cobalt absorbs 40 per cent, of sulphur. The author has still
 some doubts upon this subject.

 acid cannot make this oxide pass to the maximum.
     In order to ascertain the purity of the oxide of nicke*,
 we must dissolve it in the muriatic acid and heat it.              If it
 contains a little oxide      of cobalt, there will be an extrication
 of oxygenated muriatic gas : if it be pure, none will be dis
 engaged.

    When     the sulphuretted     hydrogen occasions no more pre
cipitate, we reduce the liquor in order to crystallize it. The
 potashed sulphate of nickel, less soluble than the potashed
sulphate of cobalt, is the first to crystallize.         On repeating
the crystallizations,     we succeed in separating the two salts :
as to the last portions      of the salt of nickel, washing them
in  cold   water  takes  off  the sulphate of cobalt they contain.
    AH these crystallizations require a bason of fine silver, if
 we wish to proceed smoothly.
    We ascertain that a salt of nickel is pure, when the preci
 pitate dissolved in ammonia" abandons this solvent with
out our finding any cobalt in it.
   .When     we precipitate a sulphate of nickel, we must not
 be   too sparing of the potash : without this precaution we
-might run the risk. of precipitating sulphate with excess of
 base ; which would alter the purity         of the precipitate.
     Carbonate   of Nickel. — 100     -parts heated in ^ retort give
 from 54 to 65 of greenish gray oxide at the minimum.
 When we heat it in contact with the air, the oxide is
 black.
    The minor oxide becomes carbonate when                 exposed   to
 the air.
    Hydrate of Nickel. — All the salts of nickel when thrown
 into boiling potash are changed into green hydrate ; boiling
 does not alter the shade      of them.     Potash neither dissolves
 the hydrate nor the oxide of nickel.
    The hydrate heated is reduced to gray oxide.
    The oxide is in the state of hydrate in the saline com
 binations.     The alkalis precipitate it in this state.
    Major Oxide of Nickel. — The carbonate and hydrate rise
 to the maximum, when we put them in contact with the
 oxygenated muriatic acid.        It is more difficult  to oxidize the
 gray oxide.
                                                                   The

    The dry major oxide of mckel is black          ; when   in a mass
its fracture is vitreous.
    This oxide,    preserved   in ammonia,   gives out bubbles, re
turns to the state of gray oxide, and is dissolved in the alkali.
    It gives  a considerable quantity of oxygenated acid, with
a muriatic acid at 15°.         The solution is greenish yellow:
crystals are formed upon cooling.
    The oxides of nickel are reduced         like those    of cobalt.
They    are melted in the same way, with this difference         only,
that the cobalt gives a larger globule.
    This metal has taken a surcharge of sulphur from 46 to
100 ; but the author has still his doubts on this subject.
    Arsenite and Arseniate. — They arc formed like those of
cobalt, and are     of   a fine  apple-grccn colour.     The arsenite
heated    in the tube loses its colour with water, sets at liberty
some white oxide, and passes to the olive-green.             Charcoal
is necessary in order to take away all the arsenic.
    When     heated    in a platina spoon, the arsenic is speedily
dissipated.      An   oxide at the minimum remains.
    The   arseniate  heated in a gun-barrel     loses its colour  with
water j becoming of a hyacinth and transparent appearance :
but at a red heat it passes to the clear yellow, and remains
unalterable.
    In  the spoon the arseniate becomes white, reddens with
out melting, or emitting the smallest arsenical fumes : we
must avoid flame in order to decompose it.
                          Recapitulation.
    M. Proust concludes from the foregoing facts, and from
 those he has published in other memoirs, that cobalt, nickel,
 and most of the other known metals, have only two degrees
 of oxidation distinctly marked : he has not asserted, how
 ever, that  a metal   can only absorb two proportions of oxygen :
 he only says that it is not yet time to admit all the oxides
 hitherto spoken of, and in which we have neither seen the
 quantity of oxygen ascertained, nor the combinations which
 they are susceptible of forming with the acids ; and he adds
 that colour is not a sufficient character by which         to distin
 guish them.
                                                                 There

         The mean Motions          of the Sun and Moon, &c.              347
    There    are only two metals        which    have     as  yet  presented
to   the author more than two oxidations              :  these   are tin and
lead : notwithstanding            this, the quantity of oxygen in the
oxide of tin (the base oi'aurum musivum) is not yet known,
nor that of the oxide in the nitrate of lead which has been,
 boiled with plates of this metal.
    It seem* that the different oxides of one and the same me
tal may be intermediately dissolved, and form true combina
 tions.     Thus    the green oxide      of cobalt   is a combination        of
 blue and black oxide.
    May not minium           be a combination       of brown oxide and
 of oxide     at 9 in 100, and analogous to the foregoing?
     Finally   : all the magnetic ores of iron and the attractable
 sands are mixtures or combinations of this order : if this were
 not the case, what could prevent the minor oxide from rising
 to the maximum ?             The oxide of    the gun-barrel       which   has
 served to decompose the water is also             in   the same case ;   it is
 formed of the two oxides.

LXV.       Minerahgical Account of            the Island of Corsica ;         con
    tained in a Letter from        M.   Ram passe, formerly an Officer
    in llie Corsican Light Infantry,              to    M. Faujas de St.
    Fond*.
JL  shall     now endeavour to gratify your desire, communi
cated to me on my leaving Paris, of having some details of
my mineralogical inquiries in Corsica, and particularly
upon the orbicular granite of that island, of which a single
isolated block only has yet been recognised.
     In order to make myself master of the subject, it was ne
cessary to visit the interior        of  the Pieve     d'Orezza, and I first
 proceeded to reconnoitre the high mountain called                    Santo-Pie-
 tro-de-Rostino, from which            proceed the enormous masses               of
 quartz mixed with green diallage, with which the bed of the
 rivulet of the village of Stazzona is encumbered. I shall not
 at present enter upon a detail of the reasons which should
 incline    us to reject the improper denomination of verde
 antico di arezza, which was at first given to this stone.
 After this visit,      I  wished to direct          my steps to Liamone
 by the Pieve de Caccia       ; but    the   extremely warm temperature
 which then reigned hindered me, and it was not until the
 end of August following that I undertook this journey.
     Before entering into the details of my excursion to Lia
 mone, allow me to mention a new rock which I disco
  vered in the Niolo : it is of a peculiar texture and composi

 tion, andI never met with it before. The following is the
 route     I
        took to the place where I found this beautiful rock.
   By moving in ihe direction which I traced out to myself
 when leaving Bastia, I not only followed some chains of
 mountains from          N.W.         to S. and from     E. to W. but I also tra
 versed several valleys, and turned considerable gulfs                        which se
 parate them       in various directions.            When       I   was     in the Pieve
 d'Ostriconi,where the chain commences which divides the
island through its whole length to its southern extremity,                                  I
traversed        the highest mountains which presented                      themselves
to me, and among others that   of Niolo, called in the language
to the country Monte-Pertusaio, because it is pierced at its
summit.     Its base seemed to be intersected by some de
tached masses, and others adhering to                    it,
                                           of jaspers and por
phyries of great variety.    followed  the
                                         I valley which leads
to the place called Santa- Maria-la- Stella. Between these
two points, south-east from the former and south from the
latter, and at an equal distance from both, there    high                    is   a
mountain covered with wood, upon the western brow of
which discovered block of stone, almost square, about
       I                     a
four feet and   half long.
                   a            was sunk into the ground, and
                                         It
exhibited globular bodies on one of its sides, remarkable
from their disposition and colour, and fixed in the stony
mass   :some were about an inch in diameter, while others
were larger or smaller      all of them presented
                                     :                peculiar              a
character which     had never seen in any stone.
                         I                         Not more
than six inches of this rock was exhibited above ground; and
in order to ascertain its dimensions      took away the earth
                                                     I
which surrounded it.       then found that
                                 I            was two feet and
                                                           it
some inches in thickness.        also observed that its angles
                                             I
were entire and acute     which made me think that
                                 ;                         had                    it
never been removed since placed there, and particularly be
cause the part of the slope of the mountain where    was                    it         is
bare   ;   and because,       among the various blocks and masses
                         it,
which surround           it     the only one which
                                 is                   covered with  is
vegetable       earth.   I   could only bring away             a    piece    weighing
about 24 pounds          ;   the rest was too large and heavy.
   When the specimen was detached and exposed to view,                                 it
seemed to me so beautiful and so extraordinary an appendage

to the magnificent            orbicular granite of Corsica, the celebrity
of which is so well known.
  You may perhaps think I                  am exaggerating,             but the fol
lowing        is the accurate description          of   the stone taken upon the
spot     :
   The rock,           the heart   of which    seems to be porphyroidal, has
its paste composed             of stony elements of              a    petro- siliceous
                           in small grains, in points and in
.nature, irregularly disposed
lineaments more or less rounded off, tying as it were with
each other, and varving in colour                   in proportion        to    the    va
rious degrees of alteration the                ferruginous principle, which
is very abundant in this rock, has undergone,: nevertheless
its general aspect, when seen at a certain distance, is the
reddish brown mixed with white spots shaded with red.
   It    is in the midst       of this     paste    that we     observe regular
spheroidal bodies,            from     one to three         inches in diameter,
scattered here and there at unequal distances, and                            imbedded
in the mass        :    the system    of   the formation         of   these   kinds    of
balls can only be considered as the result of a globulous cry
stallization, which must have taken place rapidly; and not
like geodites, which would have been formed apart, and en
veloped subsequently in a porphyritical substance.
   The method of crystallization in question is so far remark
able, that we can form no idea of it except by representing a
circle into which a multitude of small stony bodies, oblong
and compressed, of- a petro- siliceous nature,                        very close to
each other, must have been directed in radii, and                         a* it were
from end to end, from the circumference towards the centre
of the circle, which gives them the appearance of divergent
radii; and there has resulted from it a globulous solid,
which with the hammer we may drive out from the place it
occupies, leaving a hole of its own form behind it. The
tendency of tl« crystallization has been                    such,       that we       see
around the spherical bodies in question,                    in the paste of the
stone, and round the spheres* the matter                    of    the paste      itself,
which, according to the tendency it had                      to approach        it,   has
formed       a   kind of aureolus, or zones, which surround several
of the bowls, which may                be more easily remarked than de-

seeing the stone itself.
   The dimensions of my specimen are as follows : It is
17 inches broad, 12 high, and seven inches thick at its
base   :    the side which     I  have got cut and        polished presents
15   or    ! 6 of these   globules, among          which   we may remark
several that are enchased as it were into each other.
   After spending         a considerable       time on the spot where I
found this specimen,           I  proceeded      towards Liamone on the
gulf of Valinco.
   Having arrived        at the village      of Olmetto   on this  gulf, the
place pointed out to         me ;is    containing the orbicular granite,
I proceeded to Taravo.              1  dug up the mains covering a pan
of the hillock on which Stazzona is situated, and minutely
examined every corner.                I sounded the small lake in the
neighbourhood:           I visited the sea - shore : I also sounded
the river, and explored it in various points by means of
divers : I even followed its course upon the two banks
for more than a league and a half: and finding nothing by
these means,        I formed the resolution of exploring 45             miles
of ground beyond Stazzona.
    I endeavoured to assure myself of the composition                 of  the
granites lying upon the heights surrounding the great valley
of Taravo : I attacked every rock I saw, and found some
specimens the composition                of which    resembled   the granite
jn question.
    After having pursued my researches still further, I entered
 the bed of the Taravo, and traversed the two banks for
 more than two leagues : at the moment when I was re
doubling        piy   efforts    to    finish  my investigation,      I was
obliged to desist on account of the rain and snow, it being
now December.
   f collected the various specimens of rocks which I pro
cured at Vali.nco : and after having made a comparative ex
amination of them with the orbicular granite, I ascertained
that in some of these specimens there were hornblend and
feldspar, but not in the same order, nor in the same arrange

mens,     that by finishing the object of the visit I paid to the
two banks of the torrent, we shall perhaps succeed in dis
covering the primordial masses of the beautiful orbicular
granite of which a small partial mass only has been hitherto
dicovered : the angles of it were rounded, and it was found
isolated upon the beach of Taravo, half       a league  from the sea,
in   the gulf of Valinco.
    From the information        I  procured on this occasion,       I
think I proved to a certainty that the small mass of this gra
 nite, already known, comes from no place except Corsica;
for you know that several naturalists have formed             various
conjectures upon the subject.
    In  the course   of this tedious journey, I had also an op
portunity     of discovering     an ore of iron, the stratum of
which is half a     league in length.
    After having     passed the river Oposata,    in order to arrive
 at  Calvy, in   a plain above the village of Calenzana, to the
eastward of Galeria, I found a stratum of iron ore, placed
horizontally in a yellow eartlr, which at times disappears
throughout the whqle length of the ore, and the mineral of
 which is presented in three different views. At first it ap
 pears under the      charader-of    scaly iron,   arranged  in thin
layers, mixed .with      a yellowish ochrey earth; afterwards it
 appears as a heavy blackish iron, compact, and almost en
tirely disengaged from every heterogeneous substance ; and
 under a third aspect, in elongated spheroids from four to
 five inches in diameter, exfoliating at its surface, and com
 pressed at the two sides : this gives it angles at intervals ; and
 the eandy character and composition of it made me deno
 minate it arenaceous iron : and I procured the necessary
 specimens for the experiments I intended to try upon it.
     Having   ascertained   from these trials that this ore was very
 productive,    I  transmitted to the council of mines several
 specimens of the above stratum, begging them to publish the
 result of their assays.

AMONG             promiscuous observations, it would be un
                these
pardonable to omit iron, which is one of the more constant
associates of silex.  These two ingredients seem to be al
most inseparable companions, especially in every thing of a
primeval nature; for, in all original districts, mountains,
rocks, and soils, and in every native compound of any con
sequence and extent, whatever the aspect, situation and
contents may be, these two elementary bodies are sure to
present themselves, and, I may add, are always united ;
for, though the silex maybe elicited from the mineral in its
simple form, the metal, on the contrary, is always oxidized.
   So universally is this metal dispersed through the works
of nature, that very few instances occur in which it is to
tally absent;       its ubiquity is truly proverbial,     and is exceeded
by nothing, if we except silex or oxygen ; indeed it pervades
almost every solid substance, and even animal and vegetable
bodies are seldom exempt from its influence, hut often exhibit
iron evidently as a constituent in their system.  Hence, the
history       of iron    becomes   amost interesting subject to the
physiologist, and, if         we add its wonderful property of mag
netism, it seems to be one             of   the most fertile for the ima
gination of every philosopher     As this metal is never dis
covered in the pure state, but is more frequently conjoined
with oxygen than any other body ; and as this process seems
to have been effected in the immediate vicinity                  of silex, I
see no particular or unreasonable objection,               if,   in all such
.instances, we assign the genuine cause of the oxidizement
 of iron, solely to this prototype of oxygen. feel less diffi

dered, that the more cogent examples are deducible from
originally formed matter, from the real primordial rock,
coeval    with     the    globe itself, and made tangible, probably,
                                                                       soon

 was without form and                void."
  •The intimacy between silex and iron, and the consecutive
oxidizement of the latter, need not be further urged ; it oc
curs in such numberless cases, that whoever is at all conver
sant in mineralogy,              and   will   take the trouble to search with
candour, can be at no loss for evidence, sufficient to establish
this singular concomitance. Thus, let us take, as an instance,
that substance, familiarlv known by the name of emery.
Here, the iron is truly united to the silex in a very close man
ner, and not       as a mere         mixture, for the metal is oxidized and
imbedded in this surplus of oxygen. " This," says M. Haiiy,
speaking of emery, " is a true comlination of quartz and
iron, in which the two substances contract a stronger ad
herence      than a mere interposition                 of their molecules."
  Though iron is considered as a pure metal and a simple

                 when divested,     the usual methods, of

pears that some of these very impurities are required to render
the metal  more perfect, to add to its splendour, ductility,
and other properties, which the arts demand. Thus, to make
good steel there must be an addition of carbon as well as
silex and,
      j        brilliancy, hardness, and
                  if                     susceptibility of        a
higher polish are to be considered as improvements, the
carbon and the silex, in this case, seem to render the metal
still more metallic,   such   term may be allowed.

  In      an analysis         of four different specimens of                  steel,      by
M. Vauquelin,          the result was this, taking  on an average     it
to avoid fractions        :that one hundred thousand parts of these
samples      of   metal       consist of 9S17 of iron, 723 of carbon,
870   of phosphorus,           and rather more than 288 of silex. That

       very difficult to deprive iron
be readily conjectured from this philosopher's labours, and
the following observation confirms this truth, that iron                                  is
never pure.        "   The analysis of            the varieties        of steel,"       says
this very     accurate chemist,               "   is   one of those parts       of      the

 science the leasl advanced and the most difficult, especially
 when our object of research is the exact estimation of the
 principles which they contain : — it is thus, for example, that,
in dissolving       steel  in dilute sulphuric acid, the hydrogen
which     is evolved, dissolves and carries off a part of the
carbon,      the quantity    of which   varies according     to a multi
tude   of circumstances."
    From this and other authorities,          and  from     a prejudice,
which,     T  acknowledge, I have long been disposed to che
rish, it may be inferred, that whatever emits smell cannot
be considered as       a  simple body, and hence, the purity of
hydrogen as       an element must be doubted ; that species,
however, which we obtain from the decomposition of water
by the metals, is certainly very objectionable, if there be
any truth iu this observation ; for the gas is never free from
a very perceptible odour, whether it has been procured by
means of zinc or iron.
    It is certainly not always prudent to generalize too freely
upon these subjects, yet it is difficult on some occasions to
avoid it entirely. The hydrogen gas, alluded to by M. Vau-
quelin, in these analyses, was undoubtedly impure', as
it contained a certain portion of carbon from the metal,
though not the whole ; for, finding this mode of operating
inconclusive, he at last had recourse to the sulphurous acid,
with which he apparently succeeded in separating the whole.
    Fluoric acid, from its peculiar effects upon the siliceous
compounds, deserves a particular notice in the present in
quiry, especially      as its whole history remains still clouded
with inconsistency and         ambiguity ; for, either the tables of
affinity respecting its habitudes are erroneous, or the acid
itself must be considered as a monstrous anomaly in the
doctrine of chemical attractions.            These tables begin with
lime, and go on progressively with some of the earths and
alkalies to silex, the very last in the enumeration, with
which, by       the   way, it has never yet been united so as to
produce     a true  salt.   From Bergman's-experiment, we learn,
that he dissolved silex in fluoric acid, and that after the so
lution had remained undisturbed for two              years,    a number
of crystals had formed at the bottom of             the   liquor in the
                                                                  vessel.

aml had deserted this very acid, which, in all other cases,
would have seized on it and dragged it into even aeriform
existence. The native filiate of lime U so very generally con
taminated with silex, if this expression may be allowed,
that it is probable no fluoric acid exists without some of this
ingredient; it may indeed owe its origin to this body, so
uniformly are they associated.
   But, that singular influence of fluoric acid upon silex,
the corrosion of glass, is what has been chiefly noticed by
most authors, for it does not appear that a direct application
to the mere silex has yet been attempted, at least, with that
precision which might have obtained a satisfactory result.
That this acid should prefer the silex to the alkali, and in
a case     of single     attraction too, is contrary to every
                            elective
 table Jthat has yet been published, and hence, in this ex
 ample at least, it forms an exception to the general rule.
But   if,     insimilar experiments, the acid selects the silex from
 lime,    a   substance which    placed at the top of the list, in all
                                       is

splendid discoveries, which now, and probably will ever
continue to, engross the attention of the scientific world,
the decomposition of glass and consequent disposal of all
its ingredients, form       a   question,       to ine ai least,     of the ut
most interest; since,        as far   as   I   can   judge of

mena, which have already been described, there appear cir
cumstances more likely to confirm, than invalidate, my
opinion of the nature of silex.
  There is a remarkable similitude in the effects                   of oxygen
and silex on the metals, particularly. in              that   process     called
vitrification,      which   is,
                       in every meaning of the word, a
complete saturation.  By means of these, particularly the
silex, all the metals, perhaps, with no exception, from
being the most opaque bodies in the universe, may be ren
dered quite pellucid, affording an endless variety of the most
charming tints, as useful as they are elegant, since    chief      it
                                                                   is
ly from metals and metallic substances that the most durable
and valuable colours are obtained for staining glass andmak-
ing artificial gems. The best opike colours, such asare most
suitable for enamel, water, oil, crayon, and all other descrip
tions of painting, are derived also from the metals, combined
with one or both of these substances; and though alumine
and other bodies are occasionally present, they are as often
absent.   Even the precious stones and the less valuable peb
bles, spars, and an infinite list of fossil productions, seem
to derive   their intrinsic value, beauty and other excellen
cies, entirely from the power of silex on the metals. Thus,
the dull opacity of lead    as effectually chanced
                                is                  the sand,      by
used in the composition   of flint-glass, and the whole com
pound appears  not less diaphanous, than the very same metal
is, when,     means of oxygen,

   The near connection between potash and silex,     not less       is

potash    of commerce contains silex, and retains it with some
degree    of force, not as an adventitious ingredient, but ra
ther   as the   superabundance      of  that  primitive store, from
whence it had derived that portion which is essential. to its
existence as potash.       Now, that the constitution of potash
no longer remains in doubt, and that oxygen has been proved
to be as essential to the formation of potash as it is to that of
sulphuric acid, I see no explanation more congenial and satis
factory than what I have here ventured to suggest, especially
when it is proved that the primitive seat of potash is in rocks
and stones,    and in the very centre     of such bodies, where the
atmosphere can have had no influence ; for, as far as regards
its vegetable and animal existence, all is merely secondary,
and, consequently, does not apply so forcibly in this theory,
though, even here also, we need he at no loss for proofs.
    The power which silex exercises over potash, soda, and
a  variety of other substances which enter into the compo
sition of glass, is a notorious instance of its neutralizing
efficacy ; for no acid more complete'y obtunds the acrimony
of alkaline bodies and disarms them of their corrosive cha
racter. The effervescence, which results when silex and
the alkali enter into fusion, and form this insipid compound,
is not observable till the materials are on the point of per
fect combination : hence, as something is apparently evolved,
neither oxygen nor any other aeriform fluid can be supposed
to enter ; so that the acidity, i? the term may be applied, to
coerce the alkaline      matter, is alone    due to the sand   which
is usually employed in the making          of this beautiful and use
ful compound. Indeed, vitrification, in all instances, seems
to be accomplished by silex or by oxygen ; and the glass
of lead, of antimony, of phosphorus, borax, or of any other
body,    is due to one, as much as the glass         in common use,
is to the other    of these oxygenating agents*
    In many very trite     and familiar experiments, upon bodies
containing     either  silex,   an acid, or oxygen in some con
 dition or other, the phenomena which succee3 may be
 traced to the same cause.        Thus, scintillation of hard   bodies

 two siliceous stones, which emit not only light but the pe-

  other vegetables which contain silex j and, in short, all other
  analogous examples may be adduced as additional illustra
  tions on this subject.
      If  I  were to select a case,    in which silex seems to be de
  posited     as it were, and deprived of the caloric which had
  suspended        it in the state of gaseous oxygen, it would be
  that   of a natural hot-spring, such        as the  Bath-waters,   which
  are confessedly impregnated with sand or silex, not merely
  in suspension       as an accidental      rriaterial, but perfectly dis
  solved so as to be imperceptible to our sight.             Besides  these
  waters, all other hot springs contain silex in solution ; that
  of Carlsbad; the Geyser, and Rykum, in Iceland ; and many
  others, which, it is said, issue, for the most part, from
  granitic and other siliceous rocks. If these waters were cold
  the argument might fail, but while the temperature of the
  ambient medium can be taken into the account, I should
  not be willing to retract this opinion, as far as it concerns
  the nature of all hot-springs.          It is stated from good autho
  rity, that in the kingdom of Portugal alone, there are up
  wards of 200 of these springs, the greater number of which,
  And the hottest, originate where silex is most abundant.
      The    presence    of nitrogen in the Bath-waters, and, pro
  bably, in      all other  hot-springs, is a curious occurrence, and
   furnishes a proper theme for speculation.                Whether it be
   the remainder of decomposed atmospheric                 air, which has
   been     bereft   of its oxygen,      and that this is disposed of
   in  the water, in the way         I   have   supposed, is a question
   I shall not urge.         The late Doctor Black analysed the hot-
   springs of Iceland,        but the analysis, I believe, was not
   performed upon          the spot,   and, consequently, no notice
   could be taken of nitrogen gas.             In the- gallon of Geyser
   water,     he found   upwards   of   31  grains of silex ; and in the
   other, that of the Rykum spring, the proportion was 82
   grains of the same ingredient in the English gallon.

  The    effect    of silex in various                cases is the same as an acid,
and    in some  situations, where an acid or acid properties
really exist, no other cause is present. All acids we know
are not sour, some on the contrary, are insipid, and, there
fore, it would be too much to expect silex to possess this
property.   It         is,

   and his evacuations regular : but his head increased in size
   beyond the proportion it ought to have borne to the other
   parts   of  the body.      He was naturally of a lively turn, and
   reasoned    with great acuteness for his years, — observing, that
   it would be very difficult to regain his present lime, which
   was lost, in point     of education.
      About two      years before his death     he   wore  a  quicksilver
   girdle, and took some very stimulating snuff, from           which   he
   appeared    to be relieved for some time.
      About six months preceding death, he fell, and struck the
  back part of his head; from which he complained of great
  pain, which brought on violent vomiting, fits, and sometimes
  a loss   of all sensation;   as  in a kind of lethargy.
      About    ten weeks before death, a blister       was   applied be
  tween the shoulders,          from which he appeared         to receive
  considerable relief; the head was shaved, and some stimulat
  ing oils rubbed in, as ol. origan, &c. : after one of these
  rubbings he lost his speech entirely, and remained insensible
  till his death.
     The child was of a spare habit of body ; but independent of
 the head, which was greatly enlarged, had a healthy appear
 ance, and was moderately tall.
     The bones of the scull were unusually thin, to which the
 dura mater did not adhere with the common degree of
 firmness ; the vessels were turgid ; otherwise the membrane
 and its sinuses were natural.
     On raising the dura mater, the brain presented an uni
 form smooth surface, without the least convoluted appear
 ance ; the tunica arachnoidea and pia mater were healthy,
 the vessels lying upon the surface of the latter membrane.
     The cerebrum      was flaccid, and the undulation     of  the water
could be distinctly perceived         : on removing the upper part of
the right hemisphere, although the incision was made more
than two inches above the corpus callosum, it opened the
lateral ventricle    :  the two laminae forming       the septum   luci-
dum were         separated   from each     other more than half an
inch.
    The   lateral ventricles were greatly enlarged, and contained
thirty-two ounces of        a  straw-coloured   fluid ;  but there was     ,
                                                                    nut

not any appearance         of inflammation on    the membranes   lining
these cavities.
    On exposing the cerebellum, the righf lobe appeared
somewhat flaccid, in which a cist was placed containing
eightouncesof a brown straw-coloured fluid, not having any
communication          with the fourth ventricle or other outlet.
    The optic nerves were small, soft, and of a brown colour.
    The other parts of the brain and nerves were natural.
We perceive that the reasoning faculty was more complete
than could have been expected.               From such extensive de
rangement of parts, is*it not probable that the early and slow
formation       of   the fluid,   and consequent distension of the
lateral ventricles before the bones of the scull were com
 pletely ossified, or capable of affording that resistance which
 they are in the adult state, prevented in a great degree the
effects of pressure, by allowing the bones to enlarge from
 the gradual pressure from within during their more membra
 nous state ? as we see a comparatively trifling pressure on the
 brain in the adult, when the bones are incapable of exten
 sion, whether it be in consequence of external violence or
 of inflammation, by which           a fluid is effused into the  lateral
 ventricles, productive in         a short time of the most serious

 JVIr.      Parkes has for some time been engaged in revising
 and correcting the Chemical Catechism, in order to accom
  modate every part of that work to the new discoveries of
  Davy and others. A new edition thus amended, and with
  other very considerable additions, is in the press, and will
  be ready for delivery some time in          June.

   Mr. Carmichael           proposes       to publish in the course            of   the
ensuing summer, the second edition of his Essay upon the
Effects of the Salts of Iron upon Cancer, with many addi
tional cases, and          several    interesting        practical   observations
upon that disease.
  Mr. Carmichael has received some communications                               from
practitioners,      concerning their experience of those prepara
tions, for which       he begs to return his warmest thanks ; and
he at the same time takes  this opportunity of earnestly re
questing such of the profession as have deemed the remedy
he recommended worthy of a trial, to inform him (addressed
to No. 3, Gardener's Place, Dublin,) of their experience of
its effects,     before    the end        of June next, in order that               he
may insert their observations in his Essay, and that thus the
merits of the remedy may be justly appreciated.

April      28.   — This society met               after the Easter recess,
                                                        the
president in the chair. A mathematical paper, by Doctor
Young, was read, on the motion of fluids in flexible tubes,
and the resistance         of angular      tubes to such fluids.           A    num
ber of hydraulic experiments were performed ; but the re
sult was not of a nature to be stated here. This paper was
merely designed as prefatory and introductory to this author's
next Croonian lecture on muscular motion.
  May 5. — A letter from Mr. Cadell, at Paris, to H. Davy,
Esq.,   secretary    of    the Royal Society, was read.              In this letter
Mr. Cadell       states,    that the French          chemists have success
fully   repeated    Mr. Davy's experiments upon                   the decompo
sition of the fixed alkalies          ;   and     that   they have      found   a re
markable       confirmation          of his discovery in          the     action     of
heated iron upon potash              and soda.
  This chemical result           obtained by Messrs. Gay
                                 has been
Lussac and Thenard.   These gentlemen introduced potash
into the bottom of a gun-barrel bent in the form of an S :
iron filings filled the middle of           it,   which was strongly heated.
                                                                                    By

By the action of the potash upon the heated iron, it is de
composed, and the metallic base partly distils over, and is
partly found in a state of alloy with the iron. — The same
letter states,   that Mr.    Berthollet   jun.  has  read a paper to
the Institute, in which he endeavours to confirm his father's
analysis of ammonia.
    May 12 and 19. —The president in the chair.             These two
evenings were occupied in reading an interesting and able
paper containing the results of an analysis of numerous spe
cimens of different calculi,      by  Mr. Brand.e.     The object of
the   inquiiy    was   to ascertain   the relative quantities    of uric
acid, and phosphats of magnesia and lime ; and to determine
the effects of the usual solvents, alkali and acids, for calculi
in the bladder and kidneys.          It appeared that out of 150
stones, Go     were  found  composed of phosphoric acid and ani
 mal matter, and that only 12 were found of pure uric acid ;
 the phosphats     of magnesia    and   of lime, with     a slight por
 tion of uric acid and animal matter, were the most common.
 Some of the stones had pieces of bougies, hazel-nuts, and
 peas for nuclei.      To Mr. Brande.s experiments Mr. Home
 added some practical observations, tending to prove that, if
 alkaline solvents were used, they might dissolve the uric
 acid ; but that the phosphoric, which is always the most
 plentiful, would thereby be increased, and the virulence of
 the   disease,   however mitigated for the moment, would
 eventually become       much more dangerous.           The same ad
 verse effects were ascribed to the use of acids as solvents : so
that we have yet to discover a safe and efficient remedy for
 calculous diseases.
    May 26. — The president in the chair.           The reading of a
 paper, bv Messrs. Allen and Pepys, on the          effects ofrespira-
 tion on the atmosphere commenced. The authors took a ge
 neral view of what the principal philosophers have written on
 this subject, as an introduction to their observations ; and
 expressed    a hope of ascertaining with more accuracy than
 preceding experimenters, by means of their eudiometer, the
 quantity of oxygen consumed* and carbonic gas emitted,
 by the lungs in     a given period.

       We congratulale the lovers of science, as well as the pub
    lic in general, on the splendid acquisition which this Uni
   versity has just now made by the magnificent collection of
   minerals bequeathed        by the late  Dr. Thomson of Naples.
       This celebrated mineralogist, during a long residence in a
   country extremely fertile in the most interesting products of
   the mineral kingdom, has lost no opportunity of forming a
  most splendid collection, which, having fortunately escaped
  every danger, has arrived in Edinburgh untouched.                  Go
  vernment       not    only indulgently remitted the duties, but
  allowed the whole to pass unsearched.
      The liberal endowment (with which Dr. Thomson has ac
  companied       this bequest) of \bOOl., the interest of which
  he has destined      for the payment of a lecturer on mineralogy,
  and the support       of the cabinet, we hope,    will be the means
  of handing it down         to posterity in its present  high state of
  preservation — It is contained in forty very large boxes,
  which are deposited in the museum of the University; and,
 we understand, proper cases are making for the reception of
 the specimens.
      The interesting and valuable collection of the late inge
 nious Dr. Hutton, of this place, has also been deposited in
 the museum.

      At  the last meeting     of  the  Wernerian Natural History
 Society (14th May), Mr. P. Walker read an account of the
Birds that frequent the neighbourhood of Edinburgh.                  He
enumerated 178 species ; of which 1 1 belonged to the genus
Falco ; 4 to the genus Strix; 1 to Lanius ; 8 to Corvus ;

was accompanied with interesting observations on the di
stinctions of several of the species, their changes of plumage
a* different ages and times of the year, and their kind of
food ; and specimens of some of the dubious species were
exhibited.
   Mr. Jameson,      at the same    meeting,   read the  following
mineralogical queries,     and   stated  the reasons that induced
him to consider the objects pointed out by them as deserving
the particular attention of mineralogists.
                    i

     The Royal College of Surgeons           have adjudged the Jack-
 sonian prize for the     best   dissertation on " Diseases of the
 Eye and its Appendages, and the Treatment of them," to

                               M. CARNOT.
   W ith     our present number we have given a head of the
  above celebrated French author, whose excellent Treatises
  on the Infinitesimal     Calculus,      and  on Machines,     have ap
  peared in this work.      Of a character so well known among
  men of science, it is unnecessary that we should say more
  than merely that he has been successively a member of the
  first Legislative Assembly, the National Convention,                  the
  Directory, and the National Institute of France. In                 1800
  he was the French minister        of war.     Besides   the works      al
  ready enumerated,      M. Carnot      is the author   of  an Eulogium
  on Marshal Vauban,      a discourse which gained the prize of the
                                                                    Dijon

  and  of several Reports to the Convention, and Speeches          made
 while President of the Directory ; all of which have              been
 printed and      extensively circulated.       M.   Carnot   was  born
  the 13th   of May,     1753.
                                 COTTON.
     M. Louis Dupoy, a colonist of St. Domingo, lately ar
 rived in France with a variety of seeds and specimens of
 the cotton plant. The seeds have been distributed among the
 members of the agricultural society of Paris; and at a late
meeting,      several reports were     read from    members who had
 attempted     the  cultivation   of this commodity in France       :  all
 these reports concur in       giving  a most    flattering account of
 the success    of the experiment. In Provence and Languedoc
 in particular, the crop of cotton was very abundant, and
equalled in quality the production of the West Indies, as has
been certified to the French legislature by several colonists.
                                TRAVELS.
    M. Michaux, the author of Travels through North Ame
rica, has been recently sent by the French government, a
second time, to explore the forests of that vast continent.
He    is now actively engaged       in fulfilling the object of his
mission,     and has    transmitted to the professors of natural
history in the French Institute, several specimens of seeds,
with a view to the cultivation in France of the American
oak and other useful trees.
                     PYROSOMA ATLANTICUM.
    M.   Peron, in his late voyage, observed this animal, not
described before by naturalists, in between the 3d and 4th
degrees     of N. latitude.      Its luminous      property renders it
one    of the most' splendid of all known zoophites. The
darkness was intense when it was first discovered, the wind
blew with violence, and the progress of the vessel was rapid.
All at once there appeared, at some distance,              a vast sheet
of phosphorus floating upon the waves before the           vessel. The
ship having passed through this brilliant part, the crew disco
vered that the light was occasioned by an immense number

of small animals, which swam               at different depths, and as
sumed various forms.              Those which       were  deepest  looked
like red-hot shot, and those on the surface resembled tubes
of red-hot iron. Some were soon caught, and they were
found to vary in size from three to seven inches.                  All the
exterior surface was bristled with thick oblong tubercles,
shining like so many" diamonds, and these seemed to be the
principal seat of phosphorescence.                In the inside there ap
peared     a  multitude      of   oblong    narrow   glands, which pos
sessed the phosphoric property in a high degree.                  The co
lour, when        at rest, is an opal yellow mixed with green ; but
on the slightest motion, or spontaneous contraction, the
animal instantly becomes luminous.                 As it loses its phos
phorescence it passes successively through a number of tints,
such    as  red, orange, green, and azure blue.
                             CHINESE RADISH.
    Experiments lately made at Venice show that the. oil of
 the Chinese radish is preferable to any other kind known,
not only for culinary purposes, and giving light, but also
 as a medicine.        From the experiments lately made by Dr.
 Oliviero, it    is found to be extremely useful in rheumatic and
 pulmonary affections, and has been employed with much
 success in convulsive coughs.             It is not liable to spoil by
 keeping,     like   other   oils,  nor   is  the plant injured by the
 strongest frosts.        The seed, which is very abundant, is
 gathered in May and June.

                                  LECTURES.
    Dr. Satterby      and   Dr. Young propose        to give two Courses
 of Medical Lectures next winter at the Middlesex Hospital.
 Dr. Satterby's will         be Clinical Lectures, and any of the
 pupils of the hospital attending them will have the privilege
 of seeing the patient.s whose cases are discussed. He will be
 assisted in the department of morbiJ anatomy by Mr. Cart-
wright. Dr. Young's Course will be on the Elements of
the Medical Sciences in general, and on the Practice of
Physic in particular.           It has been erroneously stated in se
veral    periodical     publications,    that   Dr. Young     had a large
                                                                  medical

                           METEOROLOGY.
   Meteorological observations in a tabular form compress so
much information in a small compass, and facilitate com
 parisons in such a manner as to render them highly useful.
 In both of these views the following tables cannot but prove
 acceptable to many       of our   readers.   The  estimate  of rain
 has been given to the public for several years      : Dr. Clarke's
 meteorological table       did not commence till last June, but
 we understand that gentleman means steadily to pursue the
 same plan.
    To facilitate pursuits of this kind, it is of importance that
 such   a rain gauge. should be provided as may collect all the
 snow    as  well as rain that may fall, and so arranged that the
 danger of bursting in a time of frost may be averted.             A
 correspondent suggests that this object may be gained by ad
 mitting    the common gauge into a hot-house kept at the tem
 perature of 60° of Fahrenheit's thermometer, placing the
 large end of the cone at the top, in one of the squares now
 occupied by a pane of glass.        Should any better method for
 obtaining such a desideratum present itself to any of our
 readers, we shall be happy in being enabled to communicate
it  to the public.
