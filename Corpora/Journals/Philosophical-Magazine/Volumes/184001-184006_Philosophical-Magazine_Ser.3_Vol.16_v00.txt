You        will perhaps permit me to return once more to M.
     Dumas's theory of substitutions, especially after the
new development that this skilful chemist has lately given                                                      it,
a development which, according                him, threatens      toover                              to
turn the theory              of
                       chemistry      general, and especially electro
                                                     in
chemical notions.        You remember that             preceding letter,    in   a
I declared my opinion, that the application which has been
made         of
            the theory          substitutions,

2   M.   Berzelius on the Theory          of Substitutions of M. Dumas.
    This assertion of M. Dumas is                in perfect harmony with
my way of thinking; what has led                  to a misstatement of his
opinion is probably the improper                denomination of theory of
substitutions, for an empirical law               is not a theory, and the
word ‘substitution’ has          long    since been used in chemistry to
signify the replacing [remplacement]" of one body by another
which acts the same part as this body, and M. Dumas has lately
changed this word for another, which is very well chosen,
metalepsie, signifying replacement [remplacement]*.
    In the Comptes Rendus of 1839, (1* semestre, p. 909), M.
Dumas has more lately given a new explanation of this the
ory, but quite opposed to that just mentioned. He made
the beautiful discovery that crystallizable acetic acid C*H"
 O'H, exposed         to the light of the sun in an atmosphere of dry
chlorine, is gradually decomposed, and that an equal volume
of chlorine completely takes the place of the hydrogen.                        A
 new acid composed of C*H" O’,
                                              H, is the result of this ac
tion, some of whose properties he has described.
    The conclusions which M. Dumas draws from this fact are
the following: the chlorine in taking the place of the hydro
gen atom for atom, acts the same part as the hydrogen; an
acetic acid is the result of this, which differs only from the
other in containing six atoms of chlorine instead of six atoms
 of hydrogen, and on this account he gives it the name of
chloracetic acid.          It possesses the same properties as the
ordinary acid, so that if we know the properties of the latter,
 we equally know those of chloracetic acid. This is caused
by the properties of a body depending rather on the type of
 the composition than on the particular characters of the ele
 ment which has been exchanged. In organic chemistry, says
 he, there exist certain types, which are preserved even when
 equal volumes of chlorine, bromine, or iodine have taken
 the place of the hydrogen which they contain.                       He infers
 from this that there are two            great   leading    principles  in che
 mistry, which are isomorphism in mineral chemistry, and sub
 stitution in organic chemistry.             He supposes that these prin
 ciples originate from the same cause, and that in due time
 they may be generalised under one common expression.
     M. Dumas adds that neither isomorphism nor the theory
    * As  precision in the use of terms is very important in this subject, is
 not  metalepsy   objectionable as signifying either participation or succession?
    With regard to the practice of rendering the French remplacer, remplace
 ment, by the English “replace’, ‘replacement’, which answer to the French
 replacer, &c., and have an entirely different meaning, it is a slovenly shift,
 which ought always to have been resisted, as causing constant ambiguity and
confusion. Can chemists find any authority for such a perversion of both
languages?–R.      T.

   M. Berzelius    on the Theory    of Substitutions of M. Dumas. 3
of substitution harmonizes with electro-chemical opinions, and
as these latter have not, according to him, the property of
yielding to facts or of explaining or predicting them, he dis
patches the electro-chemical theory by saying,           “It  must be
admitted there is nothing in it.”
   This is certainly a complete revolution in the state of che
mistry.
    When questions of such importance to science are treated
of the love of truth should ensure a mature examination of
the propositions of the author of such a revolution, for the
purpose of engaging us on his side if he is right, and of op
posing him if he is wrong.
    One of the great advantages of the theory of substitutions
over electro-chemical opinions seems to be, that the type of
composition preserves the same properties after the exchange
of hydrogen for chlorine.
    Let us then examine the few properties of chloracetic acid
which M. Dumas has described, and compare them with those
of acetic acid. It will be seen that these two acids differ, infi
nitely more from each other than do formic acid and acetic acid.
           ACETIC ACID,                       CHLOROACETIC ACID.
Smell strong and pungent.              Scarcely any smell.

    boils at about 212°.               Boils at about 392°.
Specific    gravity 1-06.              Specific gravity 1-617.
Potash salt deliquescent.              Potash salt unalterable in
AEther very fluid, odour aethe            the air.
    real ; floats on water.            AEther oleaginous, odour like
                                          mint; sinks in water.
    These two acids, therefore, have no other resemblance than
that which belongs to acids in general, and it might be stated
that chloracetic acid resembles sulphuric acid as much as it
does acetic acid.      Thus the type does not lead to an antici
pation of the particular properties of an acid in which hy
drogen is replaced by" chlorine.
    With respect to the composition of chloracetic acid, M.
Dumas is of opinion that it is formed of three atoms of oxy
gen and of one atom of a radical composed of four atoms of
carbon and of six atoms of chlorine.                In examining into
 this  composition,   it is natural to  inquire  if other bodies which
 have an analogous composition are not known, and whether
 M. Dumas's opinion is not equally applicable to them, for
                                  ;
 it is evident that any explanation not applicable to similar
 cases ought to be rejected.

4 M. Berzelius on the Theory of Substitutions of M. Dumas.
   Chloracetic acid is composed of carbon combined with
chlorine and oxygen. There exists a numerous class of similar
combinations; it is divided into three subdivisions according
to the radicals combined with the chlorine and with the oxy
                                               –
gen; these shall be considered in rotation.                    -
   1. Simple electro-positive radicals.           This subdivision is
very numerous and well known: it consists of the basic mu
riates of the ancient theory of the nature of hydrochloric acid.
The general opinion, which has not been contested, is that
these bodies are composed of a chloride and an oxide. They
are readily decomposed and recomposed.
   In applying the new theory of M. Dumas to the compound
Pb Cl +     3  Pb, it should be expressed by Pb'CP + 3 O, in
which Pb" Cl* is a radical composed of lead and chlorine.
   I am persuaded that M. Dumas would protest against this
extension of his views; but if they are true, however, it is re
quisite to do so, and to be consistent, we must go still further,
and consider the salts of the oxacids as oxides of a radical
composed of that of the acid and also of the base, sulphate
of potash, for example, as KS + 4 O.
   2. Simple electro-negative radicals.—The number of com
binations known of this class is very limited.            They are to be
considered under two different points of view.                M. Henry
Rose, who discovered the combination of chromium belong
ing to this class, considers it as composed of Cr Cl* + 2Cr,
and this manner of viewing it has been generally adopted.
It has since been proposed to consider it as chromic acid in
which an equivalent of chlorine is substituted for an equiva
lent of oxygen.       This manner of viewing it is more simple,
but it is easy    to prove   that it is not correct, for the chloride
of chromium       may be replaced by other chlorides”, and we
have several examples of salts formed of an atom of a chloride
and of two atoms of chromic acid; but the preceding hypo
thesis admits only a single relative number of atoms of chlo
rine and of oxygen, although several are known to exist.
Consequently, the only admissible explanation in this class of
bodies, is that of considering them as composed of a chloride
and of an oxide.

        to determining the magnitude    of material particles.   11
was attained, since it served to point to a method of entry
upon a new and interesting field of inquiry.
    The phaenomena of exosmose which science has of late
years made known to us, especially through the valuable ex
periments of Professor Graham, differ from that of the expe
riment under consideration in being of an elective character;
the transmission varying indeed with the density of gaseous
fluid, but yet taking place spontaneously, or in a manner that
scarcely admits of a mechanical explanation.           Whereas in
the case under consideration the fluids were in a state of so
great compression within the vessels, that those which passed
through their pores were forced out chiefly in a mechanical
Waw.
     ¥he material of the  vessels was an aluminous     composition
of considerable density made into bottles of a spheroidal shape,
 and into these the substances experimented on were con
 densed.
     The means for the experiments offered themselves in a
 manufactory of factitious mineral waters I was led to establish
 in the East Indies, at the suggestion of friends, by which a
 course of experimental pursuits, commenced from the time of
 my entry into that country, were diverted from a philosophical
 into a commercial channel. Works, however, were thereby
 established, as in the case of many of our manufactures here,
 yielding apparatus which might be employed in scientific ex
 periments, and which for the sake of philosophy alone never
  would have been constructed.
     Earthy minerals may be compounded in a great variety of
  mixtures, both as to proportion and to mechanical division,
  which upon being exposed to heat shall undergo various kinds
  of hardening and condensation; and there are many which
  pass into different degrees of vitrification, though few can be
  turned to any useful purpose, for reasons curious in their
  kind, but which it would be out of place to detail here.
      Of the few useful vitrifiable earthy combinations, some in
  which silica predominates, with a lime or gypsum flux, un
  dergo little condensation up to a certain temperature, when
  a partial fusion suddenly takes place, and a vitrified and
   sometimes beautiful texture is obtained where the heat is
  nicely under command.       Of such compounds I had several
   varieties, but they are not of a nature suited to the objects of
   the experiment; and    I refer to them only that in any repeti
   tions of it compositions of this nature might be avoided.
      Another class of vitrifiable mixtures may have a body
   chiefly aluminous, and one of these combined with a felspatic
   earth and a small proportion of iron oxide produced the ware

14      Mr. J. Jeffreys's          Erperiments on Erosmose with reference
the water and to the gas, the density was still sufficient to de
tain the water during the time the gas kept extricating itself,
and constantly occupying the pores of the ware to the exclu
sion from them of the water. Though the chief force, the
mechanical one, acted upon both fluids, a little might turn
the scale in favour of the relief taking place by a departure of
the one and not of the other.      Now quite enough to decide
the point in favour of the exit of the gas might be found in
the well-established diffusive tendency of gases shown in the
phaenomena of electric exosmose, by which the gas on the
one hand would seek a departure into the atmosphere through
the ware, while on the other hand the cohesion of the liquid
particles would favour their remaining together within                                        it.
This process went                on
                        until the gas was nearly      discharged,          byall
the small   remaining  quantity  being  detained      the affinity

explain themselves      once.    Here there was not closeness                                 of
texture sufficient for even such     detention of the contents as
                                                       a

took to discuss, their observations do not call for any further
notice in this place.           With Professor Forbes, however,                                       I
have a much        graver    controversy.
    In regard to Professor Forbes's ‘Memorandum,’ we must
strive to find his meaning in some curious passages.                         In
speaking of Fresnel's formulae for the intensity of reflected
light, he says “scarcely any attempt has been made towards
  itsverification              by
                          direct experiment.”         Before we assent,                              or
dissent from the Professor's assertion, we should know what
  he means               by   an
                        attempt               at
                                     verification.     Attempts, and suc
cessful ones too, have been made                find the quantity
                                                        by                light                of
reflected          at
                  various incidences                      to
                                             transparent bodies,            the                 by
celebrated      Bouguer”,        century a ago,  and       myself        by
                                                                    latterly                         t,
in    series
      a              of
                   experiments which occupied me several months.
    As Fresnel's formula will not give either Bouguer's quan
tities         mine, our labours must
              or                                                 be
                                                      very unsatisfactory,
having done nothing towards that desirable verification.
Professor Forbes's paper will probably supply this desidera
tum.          little further
              A                       says,  on   heoccurred “It    me, about       to
the end          of
                1837,  that the anomalies                     of
                                                   photometrical     observa
tions being nearly            unsatisfactory
                                    as             ever, some light might

    measuring.”
    With respect           his actual experiments
                                   to                         says,       havehe          “I

     It appears        from the above that              Dr. Faraday's experiments,
making every allowance for different kinds of glass being used
in the different experiments, do not yield that desirable veri
fication which             Professor Forbes found amongst his results.
However it will be seen that we are not to seek for experi
menta crucis at the above angles of incidence, or at any rate,
with such low refracting substances. Dr. Faraday's experi
ments with the heavy optical glasses would have furnished
them if we had had the refractive indices of those glasses; for
in high refracting bodies the discordance of Fresnel's formula
with experiments is palpable, for it gives results frequently
one-half more, to twice as much as experiment.
    In the Professor's next sentence                          I
                                                have to complain of a
want of candour.         My first introduction to physical optics
was the     discovery  by  experiments, of the law of reflection by
metals, of a nature quite different from the suppositions of the
 scientific world, as well as of myself previously.            Sir Isaac
 Newton had stated his opinion, such as had been received
 ever since; Bouguer most likely had it presented to him in
his experiments with mercury, but blinded by the commonly
 received theory, could not see          for       it:
                                                  complains, that after
                                                                   he

                           as                                   have not              I
 obtained decisive results. The quantity              heat reflected    of                       by
 the metals           much greater than Mr. Potter's estimate for
                      is   so
 light,     as   to
                lead me      suspect that his photometric ratios are
                                     to
 all  too small, which would nearly account for their deviation
 from Fresnel's law.”
      Here my discovery comes                      to    be   merely         a   “remark.”       I

think it should pass for a discovery amongst Professor Forbes's
remarks.
   The comparison of the former and the latter part of this
sentence is a curiosity. In the first part he considers that he
has experimentally                    verified my law, that metals reflect less
light at higher incidences, and in the second he finds reason
to suspect that my “ratios’ are       too small, which would     all
nearly account for their deviation from Fresnel's law.    Now,
by  Fresnel's formula more   light would    reflected    higher                        be                     at
incidences.   How are we      understand the Professor's mean

clination to the surface, and in another experiment he found
703 reflected. When afterwards he is speaking more parti
cularly on the subject, he says he found at 21° degrees inclina
tion in two experiments 637 and 666 reflected of every 1000.
Sir W. Herschel (Phil. Trans. for 1800.) found that his
specula reflected 67.262 of every 100 thousand rays at an                                           in
cidence nearly perpendicular.
    In my paper on the reflective powers of metals, published
in the Edinburgh Journal of Science for 1830, one speculum
gave 69-45 rays reflected of every 100 incident at 20°                                              in
cidence; another set of experiments gave 68-61 at 10°                                               in
cidence, and another 66'42 at the same incidence; the de
terioration in the successive sets being attributed chiefly to
my rubbing the speculum too severely, with the intent to pre
 vent being deceived at the higher incidences by any film re
 maining on the surface.
    In the beginning of his memorandum he refers to a paper
by Mr. Green, B.A., Fellow of Caius College, in this Univer
 sity, which appears in the forthcoming volume of the Camb.
 Phil. Trans. which he says accords with Fresnel's formula.
 This is an example of my statement that any primá facie case
 is sufficient with the advocates of the undulatory theory. Mr.
 Green finds that the intensity of the light reflected at the po
 larizing angle of a transparent substance, when the incident
 light is polarized in a plane perpendicular to the plane of                                            in
 cidence is represented by the formula
                                                  (w”   – 1)*

for glass and         u   =    5’
                           this becomes
                               I               very nearly, which  tº                                   is
more than one-half the light reflected           the perpendicular      at                              in
cidence even   taking    the  undulatory    formulae,   which give gº,
and    such
      if         proportion
                    a           still existed      one would say that    no
light polarized      the plane perpendicular
                          in                           the plane               to                  of   in

thin plate     air, which could interfere with the light from the
                 of
diamond surface.
     Now    in      Newton's          rings, formed between two glasses and

seen by transmission, the light twice reflected causes rings
which are easily visible, although one portion of the inter
fering light is less than mºnth part of the other by the undu
latory formulae, and about <U+017F>ºuth by my experiments; also, in
the former experiment, the polarizing angle for glass (564°
nearly) is approaching towards the polarizing angle for dia
mond (about 68°), therefore, the whole light reflected by the dia
mond would be only a small fraction of the incident light, and
that by the glass, according to Mr. Green's formula, would bear
                                                                                        sobe

Mr. Green's formula neither represents the facts nor agrees
with Fresnel's.

24    Mr. G. Gulliver's    Observations on the Blood Corpuscles
propose to          an account of the blood corpuscles of such
             #.
             I
animals as have had an opportunity of examining. Of many
                       I
of these particles believe no description has hitherto been
published; and some others which have been previously de
scribed I have examined anew with a view to more accurate
comparisons.       I am not aware that the peculiar form of the
corpuscles in certain species of the genus Cervus has been
hitherto observed in any class of animals.
    The general results appear interesting to me in many points
of view, particularly in respect to certain differences in the
size of the corpuscles in the same individual at different pe
riods of existence, as well as in nearly allied species of the
same genus; and the resemblance, on the other hand, of the
blood disks in some groups of the animal kingdom.                    The
connexion, too, between the size and form of the blood par
                                      I
ticles and the respiratory organs, have found to be remarkable.
But before entering into conclusions it will be necessary to give
the observations in detail, reserving a summary arrangement
of them, and the deductions which they appear to warrant, for
a future section of this memoir, when an opportunity will be
afforded of reference to the labours of others in this field.
    The instrument made use of in these observations is a com
pound microscope, with an achromatic object-glass of one
eighth of an inch focal length, made by Ross, and furnished
 by him with a micrometer eye-piece divided into spaces cor
responding to 1-4000th of an inch. The magnifying power
afforded is exactly 800 diameters with a clear definition.
     If one space and a quarter of this micrometer were occu
pied by a single globule, this would of course measure 1-3200th
of an inch; if three equally-sized particles lying in a line,
and touching at their edges, covered three spaces and a half, the
diameter of each of these would be 1-3429th,             if four spaces,
 1-3000th of an inch. Now these measurements are mentioned
because they are very frequently obtained from the average
sized human blood disks, which are to be distinguished from
the remarkable varieties which Mr. Bowerbank has observed
among them, and which I have also witnessed, though I think
in a less degree than he mentions, in man and various ani
mals.      In the human blood corpuscle, the diameter last
mentioned is not so common as the two former.                 In the ab
solute accuracy of any micrometer applied to objects so ex
tremely minute, it is difficult to place implicit reliance; but
 avoid acknowledging the kindness and urbanity of Mr. Ogilby, who enter
 tained my application with his usual zeal in the promotion of zoological
 inquiries. I have also repeatedly been indebted to the kind assistance
 of Mr. Youatt, the excellent medical superintendent of the Gardens.

in the relative exactness of the instrument I am disposed from
long experience to put much confidence, which is of the
greatest importance where the results are to be obtained
chiefly by comparisons.
    The corpuscles were examined thinly spread on glass and
quickly dried, also floating in their own serum, and diluted
when necessary with weak saline solutions, or sugar and water,
or with urine. The objection to these substances                    that they             is,

                                      or
 ringly, and which, perhaps, are not identical with the common
 red disks.       Neither the large white globules nor the granu

 the latter smaller than the blood disks.              As noticed        Hew                     by
 son, the common corpuscles become mulberry-shaped when,

  28   Mr. G.Gulliver's   Observations on the Blood Corpuscles
     19. Paradoxure Gennet, adult, (Paradoxurus typus). Most
 frequent size 1-5331st.      Extreme diameters 1-6600th and
  1-4572nd.     Size of corpuscles more regular than in the pre
 ceding.     Blood from a prick of the tail.
     20.  Gray  Ichneumon (Herpestes griseus), adult male. Most
 frequent diameter 1-4572nd of an inch. Extreme sizes 1-6000th
 and 1-3554th.       The dried disks had more distinct central

 mon diameter of corpuscles 1-4000th to 1-3200th of an inch.
     a. Fox-hound Puppy, one day old, a bitch. 1-3000th and
  1-2666th the most common diameters of the corpuscles. In the
 blood of the vena portae they were generally of the latter size,
     b. Fox-hound Puppy, twelve days old, a bitch.          Most
 common diameter of the corpuscles 1-3000th and 1-2885th
 of an inch. Extreme sizes 1-4000th and 1-2666th.

 amined from the cava and splenic veins.
    24. Red American Fox, half-grown dog, (Canis Vulpes,
var. Americanus).       Common-sized corpuscles 1-4000th and

 (Canis argentatus). 1-4000th of an inch most common dia
meter of corpuscles: extreme sizes 1-5333rd to 1-2666th.

disks was from 1-4000th to 1-3564th, and 1-3000th to 1-2666th
were frequent sizes. Corpuscles in the blood of vena portae
and right ventricle of the heart apparently identical.
    b. A Kitten sixteen days old. The most frequent size of
corpuscles 1-4000th.         From Mr. Siddall's observation.
    28.  Serval,  adult   female,  (Felis Serval). 1-4000th of an

the   corpuscles.
    30. Lynx, nearly full-grown, male, (Felis Caracal). Most
                                                                                       to an

preceding species.
   34. Horse, gelding, aged three years, and another aged
five (Equus Caballus). Blood from jugular vein. The average
sized corpuscles      both 1-4800th and 1-4572nd
                         in                                inch.        of   an
   a.  Gelding, twenty-six years old. Same size generally,
but more irregular, many being seen         large        as

 an  inch.     Inthis and the   preceding,   when collected into
rouleaux, the edges            of
                          the corpuscles were from 1-12,000th
 to 1-14,000th      of

disks  occupied   two spaces         of
                                the micrometer.
   35. Ass, old female, (Equus Asinus).       Most common dia
meter    ofcorpuscles 1-4000th            of   an

the jugular vein.
   36. Dromedary, full-grown male, (Camelus Dromedarius).
Disks oval. Long diameter: the most frequent was 1-3200th

 30   Mr. G. Gulliver's Observations                           on the        Blood Corpuscles
  1-3000th and 1-2666th.          Short diameter, 1-6000th, the most
  frequent, and the following were seen, viz. 1-6600th, 1-6400th,
  and 1-5333rd, and 1-4800th.            Thickness of the edges of the
  disks  1-16,000th   to 1-12,000th     of an inch. A very few circular
  corpuscles, about 1-6400th of an inch in diameter, were ob
  served. Blood obtained from a prick in the skin.
     87. Vicugna, adult male, (Auchenia Picugna).                Disks oval.
  Long diameter most frequently 1-4000th of an inch; and the
 following long diameters were observed : 1-5333rd, 1-3200th,
  1-3000th. Short diameter; the most frequent 1-6400th ; also
 many varying from 1-8000th to 1-5333rd of an inch. A few
 circular corpuscles observed, as in the Dromedary.                   Blood
   obtained from skin of the      leg.
     38. Paco, male, nearly full-grown, (Auchenia Paco). Disks
 oval. Long diameter generally 1-3200th of an inch ; some
  1-4000th, others 1-2666th of an inch.            Short diameter, most
 commonly 1-6400th and 1-6000th; some of 1-8000th, and
  1-5333rd.      A few circular particles observed, as in the Dro
 medary and Vicugna. Blood obtained by pricking the ear.
     39. Guanaco or Wild Lama, adult female, (Auchenia
 Glama).       Blood obtained from the ear. Disks oval, and
 not differing appreciably from those of the Paco.
     Thus in the Vicugna, Paco, and Wild Lama, the blood
 corpuscles are elliptical”, as the interesting discovery of M.
 Mandl has shown them to be in the Dromedary.                        In the
 Vicugna the disks are rather smaller than in the Dromedary.

few disks 1-5333rd of an inch              diameter.  in   Blood from the
vena cava and from the renal          artery.
 *    As   announced   in    the Phil. Mag. for December 1839, and   the Dublin     in
Medical Press, No.47.           Some observations               on
                                                      the blood and pus   these           of
animals were read      at   the Royal Med. Chir. Society, Nov. 26, 1839,

           or Red Disks of the Mammiferous Animals.              31
    42. Common sheep, adult, (Ovis Aries).         Corpuscles re
markably irregular in size, most commonly 1-6000th and
1-5333rd of an inch. All the following measurements taken
from corpuscles which were abundant: 1-8000th, 1-5.142nd,
1-4800th, 1-4221st.       Blood from right ventricle, and from
vena portae.
    43. Bearded Sheep, an old male, (Ovis tragelaphus). The
most common diameter of corpuscles 1-6000th and 1-5333rd
of an inch; extreme sizes, 1-6400th and 1-4000th, the former
much more frequent than the latter.
    44. Philantomb Antelope, adult male, (Antilope Philan
tomba).    Average-sized corpuscles 1-6000th and 1-5333rd of
an inch.     A large number 1-4365th. Extreme diameters,
1-6400th and 1-4200th.         Blood from a prick of the ear;
disks examined     dry,  in their own serum, and diluted with
urine.   A very few distinct oval or spear-shaped corpuscles
were seen, both in the wet and dry specimens.
    45. Gazelle Antelope (Antilope Dorcas).        Most common
sizes 1-5333rd and 1-4800th.         Extreme diameters 1-6000th
and 1-4000th.      Thickness of the edges of disks 1-16,000th
of an inch.    Blood from a vein of the ear.
    46. Calf at the seventh month of utero-gestation, (Bos Tau
rus).   Most of the corpuscles 1-4000th and 1-3428th of an
inch. Extreme diameters 1-6000th and 1-3200th.               Blood
 from jugular, umbilical, and portal veins.
    a. Cow, adult, giving milk. Size very variable, from 1-5333rd
to 1-3555th. Average size, 1-4268th and 1-4000th of an inch
diameter.    Blood from jugular vein.
    b. Brahmin Cow, adult, (Bos Taurus, var.). 1-4572nd and
 1-4800th very common sizes.         Extreme diameters 1-6000th
and 1-3557th.
    47. Fallow Deer, full-grown buck, (Cervus Dama). Ave
rage-sized corpuscles 1-4572nd of an inch. Extreme measure
ments 1-6000th and 1-3200th.         Several corpuscles 1-5333rd.
 Blood from jugular vein.
    a. A buck Fawn, four or five days old.           Average-sized
 corpuscles 1-4365th of an inch. Extreme diameters 1-4000th
 and 1-5333rd.      Blood from jugular vein.
    48. Mexican    Deer,  adult female, (Cervus Mericanus).    Cir
 cular corpuscles generally 1-6000th of an inch in diameter;
 oblong corpuscles, most frequently from 1-3200th to I-2400th
 long, and from 1-12,000th to 1-8000th broad, at their gibbous
   art.
    The blood of this animal contains a large quantity of        lu
 nated or crescentic corpuscles, besides many of the ordinary
 circular form. The singular lunated corpuscles are remark

   32    Mr. G. Gulliver's     Observations on the Blood Corpuscles
   ably distinct and characteristic, and         I  believe unlike any
   hitherto described in the animal      kingdom.    They are generally
  acutely pointed at the ends and gibbous in the middle; some
  times they are not curved, and then, to use a botanical term,
  they present a lanceolate figure.         A more particular descrip
  tion of them, with drawings, is in preparation.
      49. Napu Musk Deer, adult female, (Tragulus Javanicus*).
  Average size of disks 1-12,000th of an inch. Extreme diameters
  1-15,000th and 1-9600th.           Blood examined from a prick of
  the ear, also from a small vein of the leg.
      Hence the blood disks of this beautiful little animal are
  smaller than those, hitherto described, of any other mammal.
  They were remarkably distinct, and very well seen in dry
  specimens, also diluted with serum or urine.
      50. Pig, about half-grown, (Sus Scrofa).            Common dia
 meters 1-4000th and 1-3728th.            Extreme sizes 1-5333rd and
  1-3200th, and the corpuscles generally very variable.               The
 blood examined was arterial and venous mixed.
     51. Elephant, male, apparently an adult, (Elephas Indicus).
 Most frequent diameters of disks 1-3000th, 1-2666th, and
 1-2462nd of an inch.            Other sizes, 1-3329th, 1-2910th,
 1-2823rd, and 1-2286th. Blood obtained from a vein in the ear.
     Consequently the blood corpuscles of this animal are larger
 than any hitherto described in the mammalia, being consider
 ably larger than in man.          But a reference to the compara
tive    magnitude   of the blood disks of the horse and the bat,
 and some species of Mus, will show how little relation there is
between the size of the animal and the diameter of the red
particles.     In the mouse for instance they are larger than in
the horse.
     52. Rhinoceros,     full-grown male, (Rhinoceros Indicus).
Common size of disks 1-4000th and 1-2554th.                   Many were
observed with diameters of 1-4572nd and 1-3200th of an inch,
with of course every intermediate gradation of size.               Blood
from a prick in the nose.
     53. Common seal (Phoca vitulina), 1-3200th the most fre
quent diameter. Extreme sizes 1-3554th and 1-2666th. The
disks very regular in size.        Blood from prick of caudal fin.
     The  particles  are slightly   larger than in the adult human
subject, and approach in appearance to corpuscles of the
monkey's blood.                                             º

Moschus Javanicus of Pallas. Since my observation of the singular blood
disks of this animal was published, Professor Owen has given an account
of them in another species (M. pygmaeus), in which they seem to be equally
small, as he remarks he had anticipated.

1-4572nd and 1-2910th of an inch. Blood from right ventricle,
and from renal artery and vein.
   55. Kangaroo, adult male, (Macropus Bennettii).           Most
common diameters 1-3600th and 1-3432nd of an inch; and
the following sizes were rather frequent : 1-4000th, 1-3200th,
and 1-3000th.      Blood from a prick at the end of the tail.
   56.  Flying Opossum,    adult female, (Petaurus Sciurus). Ave
rage-sized disks 1-3600th. Extreme diameters 1-4800th and
1-3000th of an inch.      Blood from a prick in the nose.
   57. Ursine   Opossum,   adult male, (Dasyurus Ursinus). Most
frequent sizes 1-3428th and 1-3600th.         Extreme diameters
1-4365th and 1-3000th. Thickness of the edges of the disks
from 1-10,000th to 1-12,000th of an inch.          Blood from a
vein in the ear.
    58. Another species, (Dasyurus viverrinus). 1-4000th a very
common diameter of the disks; 1-4800th and 1-3554th were
also the sizes of several of the disks.       Blood from the left
ventricle.
    59. The Perameles, (Perameles lagotis).        Common sizes
1-4572nd and 1-4000th of an inch. Several disks were seen
of the following diameters: 1-4800th, 1-3428th, and 1-3200th.
Blood from a prick in the ear.
   Thus the blood disks of these five Australasian animals
agree in form and size with the red particles most common in
other mammals.
    Since the foregoing paper was printed I have examined the
blood of some other mammiferous animals.            I subjoin the
notes in the order   they  happen  to have been made. All the
observations will soon be systematically arranged, so as to
exhibit in some measure the relation between the blood cor
puscles and the organization of the animal.       The blood par
ticles of the different species  of the  genus  Cervus, Antilope,
and the congeners of the Napu Musk Deer, appear to me to be
especially deserving of further observations; and it is very
probable that any physiologist who may prosecute the inquiry
will be rewarded with some interesting results.                 -
    60. White-fronted Lemur, adult male, (Lemur albifrons).
 Size of corpuscles very variable, from 1-4800th to 1-3000th.
The most frequent diameter 1-3600th. Blood from both ven
tricles, from the splenic and portal veins, and the disks ap
parently identical in all.

V. On the Employment of Carbon in Voltaic Combinations.
    By MR. John Thomas Cooper, Lecturer on Chemistry,
    &c. &c.
              To Richard Phillips, Esq., F.R.S., &c.
    DEAR SIR,
IT asoccurred    to me on reflecting upon the use of the platinum
          employed by Mr. Grove in the construction of his
very energetic voltaic combination *, as it was only to conduct
the electricity from the decomposing nitric acid, that any
cheaper substance which conducted electricity, and upon
which nitric acid had no action, might be employed with equal
advantage, and probably supply the place of the more ex
pensive material.                            I
                        With these views was induced to make
trial of charcoal, and the other forms of carbon, viz. plumbago,
and a peculiar kind of carbon which is frequently met with as
an incrustation in the retorts in which coal is decomposed for
the purpose of gas lighting; and was gratified on making the
experiments in finding my anticipations fully realized.               In
order to show the comparative value of each of the substances,
I here subjoin the results of some of the experiments made
with acids of the same strength, and with amalgamated zinc
cylinders, each presenting to the action of the dilute sulphuric
      [* See Lond. & Edinb, Phil.        Oct. 1839, vol. xv. p. 287.]

   From the above results it will be evident that the platinum
appears to possess a trifling advantage over the other sub
stances; this, however, I am inclined to ascribe to the more

to    superior qualities

VII.    On the Combinations of Carbon with Silicon and Iron
    and other metals, forming the different species of Cast Iron,
    Steel, and Malleable Iron.   By Dr. C. SchAFHAEUTL, of
        Munich.
                             [Continued from vol. xv. p. 428.]
Tº       chemical ingredients of the iron are easily to be ascer
     tained; but the information thus obtained is of no value in
investigating the real chemical nature of iron, and can only
be used as a preliminary method which must guide or verify
further proceedings.
   I will only here remark, that by separating silica in the
usual way by means of alkalis, there is considerable difficulty
in rendering silica insoluble in water when combined with a
great quantity of oxide of iron, it requiring a great length of
time to drive away the last traces of water and acid from the
evaporated solution; and by a quick evaporation, if the residuum
is not heated almost to a red heat, the silica either dissolves
in a great measure again, or goes through the filter after a
most tedious filtering process.          It is always a laborious pro
cess, causing much loss to separate it afterwards, when the
solution contains manganese. On the contrary, if the heat is
increased to so high a degree, the separated silica retains a
great quantity of oxide of iron, from which it is the most
readily freed by treating           after ignition, with hot chlorohy

fragment was more rapidly attacked than the bright crystal
line fracture of the steel. That most rapidly attacked was
the before-mentioned adhering drop of steel; a light yellow
powder was first separated, which partly rose to the surface
and partly descended to the bottom; next a gray precipitate
was generated, which increased until the acid ceased to act
upon the steel. All parts of the steel fragment which show
ed an incipient melting and silver-white colour, retained this
colour during the action of the acid; the other parts of the
outside of the fragments showed a blackened granular forma
tion, traversed by white shining needles.
   After having taken the fragment from the acid, filed the                        I
surface of the before-mentioned steel drop off, and laid open
a grayish surface traversed by a venous network, white and
shining, and much more difficult to be attacked by the file
than the lower gray and softer parts betwixt the network.

No. 1. was attacked very violently: the liquid became milky,
and a yellow precipitate with a very few traces of black flocks
remained. During a space of nine weeks the solution had im
bibed so much water from the surrounding atmosphere, that
the glasses were nearly overflowing.        The acid was then
poured off and distilled water poured over the precipitate; the
precipitate was now white and flocky, and the most copious
of the three samples.
   No. 2. was not so violently attacked, and did not become
milky: first, fine black scales became separated, adhering to
the sides of the glass very regularly; afterwards, the interstices
between these black scales or spots became filled up with the
before-mentioned yellow powder.        The whitish powder ap
peared very fine, never granulated or flocky, and adhered to
the sides of the glass almost entirely. The whitish precipitate
of Nos. 1. and 3. fell to the bottom of the glass.
   No. 3. was the most rapidly attacked by the acid, and
became milky, the same as No. 1. The liquid was, after a
lapse of nine weeks, rather turbid and showed the smallest
quantity of black scales swimming in the liquid. A few hours
after the acid had been poured over                         it,

the progressive advancement from cast iron            that    mal           to            of

    Q:41 of this yellow powder was melted in a platinum cru
cible with carbonate of soda, and the effervescence was very
vivid.    I separated silica to the amount of 0.115. The solu
tion, from which the silica was separated, saturated with car
bonate of ammonia, left alumina with a little silica, which
amounted to 0-107; no trace of iron could be detected.
    Fourteen grains of filings of English iron, made after my
peculiar method for steel, were then dissolved in a test glass
with five drams of hydrochloric acid.           The iron dissolved
rapidly; a dark gray oily skinny scum collected on the sur
face, and the glass was filled to an inch in height with a whitish
gray saline granulated precipitate of protochloride of iron,
which, on having removed the acid and substituted distilled
water, disappeared completely.         The solution, stirred and
quickly poured into another vessel, left gray heavy scales of
the form of the filings on the bottom.
    These gray-white scales, well washed, were very slowly at
tacked by diluted hydrochloric acid; concentrated, it acted
rather more powerfully, and the liquid became yellow and
milky fourteen hours after the action of the acid had ceased.
A few black spots remained on the bottom; a grayish viscid
mass floated on the surface, like sulphur, separated by aqua
regia from sulphurets; the sides of the tube were covered by a
layer of yellowish-white substance, which       I could sublime over
a  lamp   and volatilize.  The fumes    escaping   had, in a degree,
the scent of French     brandy  and fennel oil.
    The black viscid mass, slowly ignited on a platinum foil,
emitted first fumes of volatilized sulphur; then some sulphur
ous acid appeared; and lastly, the mass began suddenly to
glow like tinder, and burnt without further assistance, leaving
a residue of darkish brown powder, which, boiled with muriatic
acid, assumed a vivid red colour, was scarcely attacked by
aqua-regia, and only dissolved completely after being boiled
again in hydrochloric acid.       This scaly remainder consisted
therefore of      Iron and
                  Sulphur       a great quantity;

                  Hydrogen
probably a sulphuret of carbon mixed with iron, or a carburet
 of iron mixed with sulphur.
    The water, quickly separated from the heavy scales as before
 mentioned, became, after a little time, clear, a white precipitate
 having fallen to the bottom. This precipitate, heated first on
 a platinum foil, gave out sulphur, then a small quantity of
 sulphurous acid, when the mass began to glow and a light
 white powder of silica remained.

VIII. A          few Observations on the Authenticity                                 of   the   Pass
   age   in the Treatise of Boetius de Geometria on Numerical
     Contractions.  By J. O. HALLIwell, Esq., F.R.S., F.S.A.,
  F.R.A.S.            &c.   *
I VENTURE         to add the following remarks to what I have
    previously writtent, in consequence of a postscript by
M. Libri, who wishes for more substantial evidence on the
point of authenticity than has hitherto been produced.   Such
crude   arguments   as I am able to furnish must not   by any
means be considered as the result of a strict or   lengthened
inquiry, but are rather intended to show that the question is
well worthy of much greater attention than has yet been paid
to it.
   M. Libri was the first who conjectured that this passage
might be an interpolation, and with some justice; for it may
be reasonably asked, why does not Boetius allude to the new
§.
system in his treatise on arithmetic.   Again, from the abacal
        employed in that treatise, I should be inclined to think
that the articulate and composite divisions were certainly not
introduced until after that period.
   In the library of Trinity College, Cambridge, there is a
very beautiful quarto MS. of the eleventh century on vellum,
containing the treatise of Boetius de Geometria plentifully                                       il
lustrated with neat diagrams. This manuscript, one of the
most ancient in this country, does not contain the disputed
passage. M. Libri has challenged me to produce such an
evidence; accipe si vis—the manuscript may be found under
the press mark R. xv. 14, and is briefly mentioned at p. 99
of Bernard's Catalogue, No. 491.
   It would, perhaps, be scarcely fair to make          extreme sin             its

                                         the coloured films produced

appearances               as

chromy was adopted.          The method            which these appear     by
ances are produced            thus described,

this in such a manner that the distance between the point and
the plate may be about half a line.          A solution of acetate of
lead is next   poured   into the  vessel, so as not only to cover the
plate, but to rise two or three lines higher than the point.
The plate and the point are now brought into communica
tion, the former with the positive and the latter with the ne
gative pole of an electric pile.         At the moment when the
voltaic circuit is closed, a series of rings similar to those
formed at the centre of the Newtonian lenses is to be seen on
the surface of the plate precisely under the point.” The same
process has been adopted to produce the films, the investiga
tion of which will be detailed in an after part of this paper.
The voltaic powers consisted of two small batteries, con
structed on the principles of Professor Daniell's, and the ef
fects were produced in small platina dishes or capsules for the
convenience of investigation.        We must now pass on to an
other part of Professor Nobili's memoir, in order to collect the
facts and their explanation.         At p. 106, we find, “The ap
pearances which constitute the chromatic scale are due to the
electro-negative elements of the solution (oxygen and acid),
which being transferred by the current to the positive pole,
are then spread out into thin transparent films, from which
all  the colours             of
                      the scale arise. The electro-positive ele
ments (such         hydrogen

contrary, transferred        the negative pole, and then deposited

Philosophical Mag.: for this information      am indebted    IMr. Brayley.                  to

56           Mr. Warington      on the coloured Films
layer which is thus coloured a suboride.”       In a foot-note at
p. 110, we read, “Berzelius was more sensible of the diffi
culty,” (of accounting for these coloured films) “perhaps,
than any one else: but would not an open avowal have been
better than the attempt to evade it by the adoption of the
term suboride, which is quite as vague and undefined as the
principle of oridation, for which it was offered as a substitute?”
 This is rather strong language to be used against such an au
 thority as Berzelius, every one of whose statements is backed
 by investigation, and brought by Prof. Nobili, who does not
 adduce a single experiment in proof of his statements. But
 to proceed:  “I    have always entertained some doubts as to
 the correctness of this explanation; because each degree of
 oxidation has a colour peculiar to itself, and in no way re
 lated to that variety of tints of which we speak.       I
                                                         was also
 struck by the well-known practice of giving steel a violet colour
 in order to secure it from rust.” “Were this tint, as it is pre
 sumed to be, the effect of oxidation, it would, in my opinion,
 instead of preventing, serve only to accelerate oxidation.”
 “But this is not all; the superficial colours of which we speak
 are changeable, and belong evidently to the same class as
                                             *.
  those produced by thin plates.      Now the pure metals are,
  from their opacity, incapable of this species of coloration.
  Can they acquire that capacity in their first degree of oxida
  tion by becoming suddenly transparent in                 of their
  union with a small quantity of oxygen?, The hypothesis far
  exceeds the bounds of probability, and the phaenomenon re
  quires to be otherwise explained.”     Again, “Confining my
  self in this place to the colours produced on metals by the
 action of fire, I do not hesitate to say, that I think their
 origin now placed beyond the reach of doubt.        It may be
 safely laid down as a general proposition, that the oxygen of
 the atmosphere produces them, not, as is supposed, by             oxi
dizing the surface of the metal, but by becoming fixed in the
form of a thin plate or film, similar to those of the electro
chemical appearances.”     Professor Nobili then gives a detail
of the production  of the colours by heat, and observes, that
as long as the colours are seen there is no oxidation, but that
when the metal loses        brilliancy and lustre
                          its                      has become
                                                    it
oxidized, and that  if  removed from the heating medium be
fore this effect takes place, the oxygen will cover the metal
and adhere as   a  varnish.

various metals and the action      ofheat upon them,         he
                                                           states
distinctly, that copper, lead, and tin form protoxides, and that
palladium forms     asuboxide;    so

    While arguing at page 110 against the probability of the
 principle of oxidation, Prof. Nobili observes that the violet
 tint on steel, “does not, perhaps, consist solely of oxygen, as
 it does when the metals are pure. Steel is a carburet of iron,
 and the oxygen of the air on being precipitated on this com
 pound, becoming combined with the carbon, in some manner
 or other might form the layer in question.” Now this is a
 most extraordinary statement. After arguing so long and so
                                       the oxygen uniting with
                                         is all

 electro-negative elements disposed            thin layers are       too                                at

    To sum up the whole         this subject      of few words, then,       in  a

 are not films           of
                   oxygen and acid, but lead              high stage             in   a                       of

 To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
ASonI do not consider the substance and spirit of my paper
      Devon and Cornwall, which was read at the meetin
of the Geological Society on the 4th inst. is fairly
in the Athenaeum of the 7th, I request you will favour                                       me
with an opportunity of righting myself with your readers, and
of reporting progress since my communication which was
published in your last October Journal (vol. xv. p. 293). I feel
                 I
assured that am not intentionally misrepresented in the Athe
naeum; the abstract however imputes to me (as hastily read                    I
it before I left London) that I hold mineral characters to be
everything and organic evidences nothing, in determining the
relative ages of strata. Now it was very distinctly read by the
Secretary, Mr. Darwin, that I did not consider the law pro
posed by Dr. Smith to be of any value in classifying the
rocks of the earth in remote localities, if it did not suppose a
final and universal extinction of genera and species; and in
as much as some plants and animals would probably be en
abled by the Creator to survive mutations which would be
death to others,             I
                          considered that a classification of the
older rocks should be regulated by some per-centage test,
such as Mr. Lyell had applied to the tertiaries, rather than
by a more restricted rule.          I quote from memory, not being
able to refer to either the Athenaeum or to my paper. I stated
that I unequivocally believed in the extinction of genera and
species, severally at distant epochs, and therefore did not be
lieve that the Posidonia and Goniatite, which I discovered in
some trashy lentiform limestones in Devonshire, were specially
created for the mountain limestone alone, when                   knew it            I
                                                                                  º
could be    proved   to  demonstration,     that those Posidonia lime
stones of Devon, and                   all
                                their associated rocks, not only bore
 no  lithological resemblance         any        to
                                               the mineral of         any               of
portion   of  the  great  English    coal-field,  but that  they   under

the slates  of  Cornwall.       exhibited sections evidencing the ac

south-west of Callington, with those which had been pro
cured from the fine culm shales near Bideford.                   I believe it
to be an impossibility, on account of the same coarseness of
the matrix in the great outlier, as exists everywhere, that                                           I
have seen, in the rocks of the floriferous series generally,
 where I have never met with clearly defined specimens, ex
cept in the finer culm-shales just mentioned.                 All I am pre
 pared to prove then               is,
                                 that about St. Mellion and Pillaton,

   to the other, we have nothing more than one great wave (of
   probably some far extended undulation) consisting simply of
   two convex arcs inclosing a central trough, apparently the
   result of the same system of forces acting on a vast floor of
   matter, successively and regularly accumulated; either an
  overlying mass, or a fractured section of an original continua
  tion of the Cambrian and Silurian deposits; for if we compare
  the precipitous and vertical cliffs of Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5, of
  Exmoor (in echellon arrangement beetling over the deep tide
  way of the Bristol Channel) with the carboniferous limestone
  and secondary rocks of the opposite coast of Wales, we have
  all the evidences of an enormous fault.
     But what are the results if we compare the positive testi
 mony afforded by gradation, alternation, succession, and con
  formable supraposition, with that afforded by organic re
 mains?      The Petherwin fossils near Launceston, and those
 of the coral limestones of South Devon,                I
                                                  include without
 doubt or hesitation in a lower horizon, or subdivision of the
 floriferous series, No. 9, above the Posidonia limestones; so
 that if we suppose the ratio of extinction of vegetable species
 not to have been governed by the causes which effected that
 of marine zoophyta and testacea, the exceptions afforded by
 the Posidonia limestones are but as dust in the balance of              or
ganic evidence; and in this respect alone, geologists will               in
volve themselves in inextricable difficulties and contradictions,
if they reject the maximum and rely on the minimum amount
of organic evidence.        I
                            repeat the fact, that the lower flori
ferous, and Coddon Hill grit series are overlaid in the south
by the slates of Cornwall, which comprise in their ascending
terms, first, the St. Germans, and lastly, the Plymouth lime
stones; so that it appears to me, that the great consecutive
series from No. 2 to 10, evidences a transition of organic type,
in progress, as it were, from the grauwacké towards the car
boniferous limestone; that the latter, or              its
                                                 coal-field,  not   is

emergence.         Athousand embarrassing facts on the west of
Dartmoor, and elsewhere,         at once were reconciled, and the
rocks appeared before me, like a cloud of witnesses, to testify
that the floriferous      series was overlaid          by the Cornish
killas, and requiring me, as it were, to restore each to his
rightful throne.
    My long section exhibited at the Geological Society did
not perhaps show the south anticlinal axis sufficiently pro
minent or distinct, for            I
                               see by my maps that the Coddon
Hill grit, commonly dipping south, occupies nearly two miles
of country from north to south ; and that at and about Dod
discomb Leigh, it is in the same parallel with the great line
of fracture on the W. of Dartmoor which ranges by Laun
ceston to Bos-Castle; and that this line continued through
Dartmoor will intersect it at Amicomb Hill, between Fur
Tor and Yes-Tor, which Mr. MacLauchlan has determined
to be the highest points of elevation in the West of England.
Any omission in my section, however, I request may be im
puted to my deficiency in tact in getting up a section, and
not to any imperfection in the evidences afforded by the coun
try; but in reply to the objection urged by Mr. Murchison,
I  may state, that the Posidonia limestones being only insulated
patches in the Coddon Hill grit, and therefore part and parcel
of the mineralogical axis, are quite as likely, in the southern
fall, to dip away from the trough, as to dip into                 my sec      it;

A Treatise        on Crystallography,               by   W. H. Miller, F.R.S., Professor
                  of   Mineralogy in the University                 of Cambridge.
      T is well known to those who have attended to the subject of cry
      stallography, that the classification of crystalline forms introduced
by Haüy, as well as the methods of expressing these forms and of cal
culating their relations, have been in a great measure superseded by
other modes of treating the subject.           The distinction of systems of
crystallization proposed by Weiss and Mohs has been generally ac
cepted among crystallographers;           and the angles made by faces,
edges, and the like, instead of being deduced by means of geome
trical reasoning, have been obtained by the more general methods of
spherical trigonometry and analytical geometry.                 Weiss may be
looked    upon   as the  person   who first introduced this more general
mode of    calculation;  and he has been followed by G. Rose, Kupffer,
Köhler, Naumann, Neumann, Grassmann, Hessel, and others, in Ger
many, and by Mr. Levy, Mr. Brooke, and Mr. Whewell in England.
Along with these different modes of calculation, different modes of
notation for crystalline forms have also been employed. The old
unsystematic notation of Haüy has been modified and retained by
Mr. Brooke, Mr. Levy, and Mr. Phillips in England, and by several
French writers; while Professors Mohs and Weiss have each intro
duced his own method of notation.
    The notation of Mohs, in itself most superfluously cumbrous and
unsymmetrical, has been made the basis of a much improved system
of notation by Prof. Naumann; and the symbols of Weiss, which
are really the most general, and depend upon a single convention,
have been somewhat simplified by Mr. Whewell.                  In this state of
the subject, we turn with great interest to the treatise of Professor
Miller, who from his familiarity with analysis is able to give to cry
stallographical methods                  all
                                    the generality and simplicity            the               of

the present memoir Mr. Green employs himself upon two                       three                   or
other cases       the general problem, and

as  his expressions show,) in a vertical circular orbit of which the
radius decreases very rapidly as the depth below the surface increases.
We may point out to Mr. Green that this conclusion had already
been virtually drawn by Laplace in his Memoir on the Tides, pub
lished by the Academy of Sciences in 1775. We may, however,
observe that this result has acquired a new interest since the ex
perimental researches of the Webers on this subject, with which it
is in complete accordance.     Mr. Green has in another case (that of
 a canal with a triangular section) compared his theoretical results
 with the experiments of Mr. Russell, and finds the agreement much
 more close than that which is given by Mr. Russell's own empirical
 formula.
    The constitution and motions of the supposed fluid of light and
 heat form a wider subject of investigation.    Ever since it appeared
 by the great discoveries of Young and Fresnel, that the hypothesis
 of transverse undulations explains with such marvellous exactness
 the most complex phaenomena of light, mathematicians have been
 endeavouring to demonstrate the mechanism of such undulations,
 and to determine their laws under various circumstances.
    M. Cauchy in France, Sir William Hamilton and Prof. Maccullagh
 in Ireland, Prof. Airy, Mr. Green, Mr. Kelland, Mr. Tovey in Eng
 land, have employed on investigations of this kind all the higher
 resources of mathematics.     In the volume now before us, we have,
 bearing on this subject, Mr. Green's memoir “On the Laws of the Re
 flection and Refraction of Light at the common surface of two non
 crystallized Media;” and Mr. Earnshaw's “On the Nature of the
 Molecular Forces which regulate the Constitution of the luminife
 rous AEther.”      Mr. Green explains the peculiar starting-point of his
 researches in this manner.         M. Cauchy had considered the lumini
 ferous aether, and the bodies which act upon            it, systems
                                                                  as      mole   of
 culesof in which every two particles act upon each other            the direc
                                                                       in
 tion      the straight line which joins them.          But this supposition,
 Mr. Green says, seems                                         restriction; for
                                          of to
                                    involve too narrow             a

 dicate certain polarities       the particles, which have never yet been
                                         in

                  resolvable into direct attraction and repulsion. Hence
 he selects for his basis      wider assumption, which may
                                     a                               expressed

which value, in the case of reflection from water at the proper angle,
is T4T part of the intensity of the incident wave. This minimum
value increases rapidly as the index of refraction increases; and
thus the quantity of light reflected at the polarizing angle becomes
considerable for highly refracting substances; a fact, which has
been long known to experimental philosophers.
   In Mr. Earnshaw's memoir the aetherial medium is treated as a
system of detached particles; and he is led by his investigations
to various conclusions, of which the most important are, that the
molecular forces which regulate the vibrations of the aether do
not vary according to Newton's law of universal gravitation, but
that these forces are repulsive, and vary according to an inverse
power of the distance greater than two.       M. Cauchy, in his “Mé
moire sur la Dispersion de la Lumière,” had inferred from his ana
lysis that “in the neighbourhood of contact, the action of two
particles is repulsive, and reciprocally proportional to the fourth
power of the distance.”
   Mr. Kelland, in a memoir contained in the previous volume of
these Transactions, (vol.     Part            vi.

   We shall notice, in the last place, Mr. Holditch's memoir “On
Rolling Curves.”    The object of this paper is to determine curves
of such a form   that, revolving about two centres, one of them may
communicate motion to the other, as in the case of the teeth of
wheels; with the condition that the curves, in this communication
of motion, are to roll upon each other without friction.     Euler in
the Acta Petropolitana had deduced the characteristic property of
these curves, but he did not follow out the investigation so as to
furnish actual forms of curves; nor has the method of obtaining
such curves been pointed out by any previous writer.        They are
commonly found by a tentative process; but Mr. Holditch thought
it worth while to search for rules and forms for their construction ;
and these he has found and given the present memoir. Some of the
 results are very curious and novel.
Principles of General and Comparative Physiology,            intended as an In

    The science of      physiology    has been too generally considered by
 physical philosophers as beyond their pale.             The nature of the
 phaenomena which it embraces, and the mode in which it is to be
 pursued, have been regarded as sufficiently distinct to limit the cul
 tivation of    it,with few exceptions,                to
                                               those who make             part    it   a        of
 their  regular   professional   studies. We cannot but think that such
a   state  of things may       advantageously modified.

  ciples of inductive philosophy which have been and still are too
 much neglected by physiologists.            All classes of living beings are
 regarded by him as of equal importance in a scientific view, as fur
  nishing instances, by the collection and comparison of which general
 laws may be established.         It is thus perceived that what is obscure
 in one is frequently evident in another; that the life of the simple
 zoophyte may elucidate, if properly observed, the varied phaeno
 mena presented by man; and that the functions of the humblest
 plant may be traced as fundamentally the same, though gradually
 becoming more complex, in the ascending scale of the animal as
 well as of the vegetable creation.           Such a work, we cannot but
 hope, may contribute to excite and facilitate the study of physiology
amongst those who make science their pursuit.                 We need hardly
 point out, that the connexion between these different branches of
knowledge is daily being rendered more intimate, especially by the
researches of the geologist and of the organic chemist; the former
of whom requires to know those general laws which govern the
conformation and distribution of organized beings, while the latter
 seeks to elucidate the mysteries of vital action, by ascertaining the
extent to which the physical properties of matter are concerned in
it.    One   of the most interesting examples            the valueof      such         of               in

chemical and physical; whilst others can only be called into play
under conditions of a more complex nature, which are only supplied
by   a living organized system, where many particles being combined
by   a previously-existing life into one structure, exhibit actions of a
peculiar character, dissimilar to any they have heretofore presented,
which are denominated vital.
   The dependence of life upon external stimuli is then pointed out,
and a great variety of interesting facts, many of them novel, are col
lected, relative to the influence of heat, light, and electricity upon
living beings. The general laws which have been ascertained to
govern the structure and actions of organized beings are then enun
ciated, and their application illustrated by examples.         To pursue
their application through the whole range of the animal and vege
table kingdoms is the object of the second book, entitled Special
Physiology.     Here each function is considered in detail, in the va
 rious phases under which it appears in the ascending scale both
of the vegetable and animal kingdoms; the fundamental unity
which prevails throughout is displayed; and the very extraordinary
correspondence which exists between the transitory states of                                  dif
ferent organs in the embryo condition of the higher classes of each
kingdom, and the permanent forms of the same in the lower, is de
monstrated in a striking and satisfactory manner. This part of the
volume is illustrated by a large number of well-executed figures,
which greatly aid the comprehension of the text.
    The author appears to us to have fulfilled his design in the most
 satisfactory manner; and as his work has been received with high
 approbation by the Medical Press, we can feel no hesitation in re

problem.
    “Every method,” the author remarks, “which I have yet seen
requires that the observed geocentric places of the comet be reduced
to longitude and latitude.            The places must, however, in the first
instance, be observed in right ascension and declination.                         Now,
the conversion of right ascension and declination into longitude and
latitude is one of the most troublesome operations that commonly
occurs.       It requires the use of 7-figure logarithms, and is liable to
errors.      An alteration in one original AR, or declination, requires a
complete repetition of the calculations; and when
                                                                                                it to all

necessary        to refer them back           the equator. to    For these reasons,
it   has long since appeared                         to

     Among the various changes to which the comet's apparent path
is   subject,  and of which an arbitrary choice may be made, for the
purpose of determining the distance in the cases in which the
general equation fails, or becomes unsafe, the author considers the
following to be the best:-viz. first, the curvature of the comet's
path, produced by the sun's action (or the deflection measured only
in the direction perpendicular to the apparent path); second, the
                                                               of by

   Extract of a Letter from Professor Schumacher to the Astronomer
Royal, relative to the determination of differences of Longitude, by
observations of Shooting Stars. .
   M. Schumacher states that, although observations of shooting
stars have long since been proposed by Mr. Benzenberg as a means
of determining differences of longitude, no attempt has yet been
made to carry the plan into practice.     With a view to ascertain the
degree of exactness with which such observations can be made, he
resolved to make some trials on the night of the 10th of last August.
He preferred to observe the eatinction of the meteor, because                                                  its
apparition gives warning, and           some   measure prepares the
                                                               in
observer for the phaenomenon. Having given                notice     his                  no              of
intention     other astronomers,
                to                   had      expectation he  obtaining   no                    of
corresponding observations; but was agreeably surprised when                                                   he
subsequently obtained them from Bremen, Breslau, and even Königs
berg.    They did not give very accurate differences         longitude,                        of
because the observers      those places had observed the apparition
                                          at
and not the extinction; and because, not having the same object                                                in
view, they did not ascertain the equation         the clock with pre           of
cision.   Nevertheless the observations gave approximate differences,
and showed that the method       practicable.       is

   John Hull, M.D.—Dr. Hull was ardently attached to the study of
Botany, and in the midst of an extensive medical practice, he found
occasional moments of leisure to devote to the cultivation of his
favourite pursuit.      We are indebted to him for the publication of a
British Flora in    1799,   of which a second edition appeared in 1808;
and the Elements of Botany, in 2 volumes, 8vo, in 1800.                  These
works, highly creditable to their author, tended to increase the taste
for botanical pursuits.                                       -
    Matthew    Martin,    Esq.—Mr.     Martin reached the advanced age of
90.     He became a Fellow of this Society in 1791.
    George Milne, Esq.-Mr. Milne pursued with much ardour the
study of Entomology for more than half a century, and his name is
familiar to the cultivators of that branch of science in this country.
He possessed an extensive cabinet of insects, particularly rich in Bri
tish and Exotic Lepidoptera.        He had retired from London for several
years to his native place Johnshaven, Kincardineshire, where he died
some months ago at an advanced age.
    The Rev. Robert Niron, B.D., F.R.S.
    William Younge, M.D.—Dr. Younge was the early friend and a
fellow student of our late distinguished President and Founder Sir
J. E. Smith, and the companion of his tour on the continent in the
years I786 and 1787, of which an account appeared in three volumes
8vo, in 1793, and a second edition in 1807. Dr. Younge was elected
a fellow of this Society at          its

which were chiefly obtained from his own coal mines in Bohemia,
and of an excellent Monograph of the genus Sarifraga, illustrated
by coloured figures. To him we are indebted for the recovery of the
vegetable treasures collected by Haenke in Peru, Cochabamba, and in
the Philippines, whither he had accompanied the Spanish voyage of
discovery under the celebrated, but unfortunate, Malaspina.    These
interesting plants have been published by Presl, under the auspices
of Count Sternberg, in a work entitled “Reliquiae Haenkeanae.”
Count Sternberg was distinguished for his urbanity, hospitality, and
an eager desire to promote every useful work. He left his collections
and books of Natural History to the Museum already mentioned.
   Among the Associates are the following:—
   Mr. John Hunneman.—Mr. Hunneman having been long the me
dium of communication between the botanists of this country and
those of Germany, Switzerland, and Russia, our collections have
been enriched through his means with a vast variety of new and                     in
teresting plants. A curious Mexican genus, belonging to the natural
family Papaveraceae, bears his name, and commemorates the services
rendered by him to science.
   Mr. George Penny.—He was well acquainted with the plants
which he successfully cultivated, and was the author of the “Hortus
Epsomensis', and of several papers on Garden Botany in Mr. Loudon's
Gardener's Magazine.
   Mr. William Weston Young made the drawings for Mr. Dillwyn's
valuable work on British Confervae, and a series of drawings of Bri
tish birds now in the possession of Mr. Yarrell.
   The President also announced that twenty Fellows, five Foreign
Members, and two Associates had been elected since the last An
niversary.
   At the election, which subsequently took place, the Lord Bishop of
Norwich was re-elected President; Edward Forster, Esq., Treasurer;
Francis Boott, M.D., Secretary; and Richard Taylor, Esq., Under
Secretary. The following five Fellows were elected into the Council
in the room of others going out, viz. W. J. Burchell, Esq.,       W.          J.
Lubbock, Esq., Hugh Duke of Northumberland, John Forbes Royle,

   The equitable system of rating the postage of papers by weight gives rise to
the necessity for a ready method of determining what charge any letter or packet
may be liable to.
   If extreme accuracy be desired, nothing will be found equal to good scales and
weights; but as this is seldom essential, and such an apparatus is not very conve
nient on a writing-table, many contrivances of a less cumbrous nature and less
subject to derangement have been produced.
   These are generally variations of the steelyard, and of course require the adjust
ment of a counterpoise for each different case, which is somewhat troublesome and
liable to mistakes.
   We have lately seen a very simple and ingenious instrument, which avoids these
                                                               -
inconveniences. It indicates the weight at once, is not subject to get out of order,
and while it occupies but little space, is rather of an ornamental form than other
wise.

XIII.  An Account of some Experiments made in the South of
  Wirginia, on the Light of the Sun. By John W.M. DRAPER,

    GENTLEMEN,
         HAVEjust seen in the Journals for the current month,
    brought out by the British Queen, a letter from Sir J.
Hersche<U+017F> to the [British] Association for the Advancement of
Science, in reference to some remarkable actions of the dif
ferent colours of the solar spectrum.
   About five years ago, having the advantage of a bright and
almost tropical sky,             I
                           amused myself with attempting a repe
tition of Morichini's     experiment   for the magnetizing of steel,
and was led to some results in respect to the chemical action
of the sun's rays, which appear to bear very much on the
subject of the letter above alluded               Most          to.
                                                           these have       of
been published          the Journal

excellent   Magazine,       give  my  testimony
                                     to                 subject, which a

                            Bichromate of potassa.
                            Chromate of potassa.
                            Yellow hydrosulphuret of ammonia.
                                            of lime.
                            Muriate of iron.
                            Chloride of gold.
                            Chloride of platinum.
    It is to be remarked, that every one of these solutions is
yellow, but             I
                    also found that a great many vegetable coloured
infusions would in like manner absorb the chemical rays,
especially those which have a yellow tint.
    2. When I exposed pieces of paper covered with a layer
of chloride of silver, to a beam which had passed through the
red sulpho-cyanate of iron, the paper became of a brick-red
colour; if to a beam which had passed through a solution of
 sulphate of copper and ammonia, it became of a blue brown;
and lastly, on exposing a piece in a box which I shall pre
 sently mention, for five days, to light which had been acted
 on by bichromate of potassa, it became perceptibly of a faint
yellowish green.
    3. It is very probable, that there exist in the sunlight, rays
having particular chemical powers.
    A beam which has passed through bichromate of potassa,
does not appear to cause the union of a mixture of chlorine
and hydrogen.           I kept such a mixture for several hours in                             it,
and could not       perceive   any change.
    But this same beam can nevertheless enable vegetable leaves
to  effect the decomposition                of
                                      carbonic acid.       took wooden     I         a
box, about cubic foot  a            dimensions, and having removed

              thereabouts. Into the trough thus formed, poured                       I
a  solution            of
                   bichromate              of
                                     potassa,                   or
                                                   any other salt under
trial, and the box being raised                    on
                                            one end, served         closet           as  a

of   gas sufficient for analysis was evolved,             was found that

The result gave mixture     a          carbonic acid, oxygen, and ni

trogen : the uniform appearance of this latter body was sub
sequently traced to the leaves employed.
    Plants, also, become green in light that has been submitted
to the action of these yellow salts, and therefore deprived of
the rays that blacken chloride of silver.            I took a number of
pea-plants out of the garden, in May 1837, and caused them
to vegetate in light modified in this way, and also in light
which had passed through sulpho-cyanate of iron, and sul
phate of copper and ammonia, &c., but in every instance the
leaves became green.         It may also be mentioned, that seeds
of common cress were caused to germinate and grow under
these circumstances; the young plants after reaching a certain
size were always green, but those which had grown in the
dark had yellow leaves and white stalks.
   Professor Silliman states, in one of the early numbers o.
his Journal, that he witnessed an explosion of hydrogen and
chlorine, caused by the light of a common fire.
   4. Ritter was the first who asserted, that the opposite ex
tremities of the spectrum possess opposite powers of chemi
cal action: he states that phosphorus will emit fumes in the
red ray, but if the violet be thrown on                ceases   it,smoke:

this experiment     I repeated often, and under favourable cir
cumstances, but could not make             succeed.

      DEAR SIR,
NQT   having
  hail which        took
                             met with any notice
                           place  during
                                              of the remarkable fall of
                                            the storm of thunder and
lightning that passed over the counties of Sussex, Surrey,
and Middlesex on the evening of the 7th of last July, I beg
leave to offer you the following memorandum respecting                                        it,

phaenomena, which,           not altogether new, may coincide with
                                if

meteorologists.
   Except       the fall
               in             very large hail, the storm above-men
                                    of
tioned did not differ     materially   from the wide-spreading and
grander thunder storms which sometimes gather                         our            on
coasts, and pass over the metropolis, from the south-west,

 The amount of this                       at the horizon, or when e = 1,
 is f" x 62"-1, almost the same with fºx 62"-4, which, as is
 shown in § 9, is the limit of the integral when it is extended
 from r = 0 to a = co.            It is thus proved that the error of
 the series is of no account.          This part of the refraction can
 not be computed because f" is unknown. But although the
 precise value off" is uncertain, it is probably very consider
                           2
 ably less than f, or      g;  so
                                     that the effect on the refraction
 cannot exceed a few seconds even at the horizon. We shall
 be better able to form a just notion with respect to this point,
 when the Theoretical Table in this paper is compared with
 observations.

 made in the practical application for the deviations indicated
 by the meteorological instruments from the mean constants
  used in constructing the table.

From this view it appears that the three tables agree within
less than 1" as far as 80°  from the zenith; the new table
is in accordance with Bessel's, with slight discrepancies, to
88° or 884° from the zenith; from 80° to 88° of zenith di
stance the numbers in the French table exceed those in
Bessel's, the excess being 2" at 84°, and 4" at 88°.      But
when the distance from the zenith is greater than 80°, the
accuracy of the French table is questionable, both on account
of the hypothetical law of the densities, and because the quan
tity assumed for the horizontal refraction is uncertain.
   A few examples are subjoined, as well for explaining the
use of the new table as for affording some indications of              its
accuracy   atlow altitudes.  The two first instances are taken
from the Tables Astronomiques, and are likewise published
yearlyin  the Conn. des Temps.

XVII.           Letter to Richard Taylor, Esq., with reference to two

                                            animadversions in the January Num
                                              Magazine, I would request you to
                                                             I addressed to him after
          “MY       DEAR        SIR,                         “Edinburgh, Jan. 8th, 1840.
     “I     have read with some                  pain,     and at least equal surprise,
some observations by you on photometry, stated to have been

              in    the Philosophical   Magazine for January.                103
 occasioned by reading a brief notice of some experiments of
 mine, with respect to heat, which I thought might, perhaps,
 bear some analogy to the case of light. It is evident, how
 ever, that as it would be impossible to predicate beforehand
 that heat and light are reflected according to the same law,
 any verification of Fresnel's law for light obtained in this
 way could only be an analogical one,           a<U+017F>:
                                            therefore acceptable
 only whilst photometric methods are so very imperfect as still          I
 consider them to be, however dexterously employed.
    “It was a matter, as         I
                             say, of equal surprise and pain to
 me to find that   you   should have so gratuitously misinter
 preted my sentiments towards you, which              I
                                                deliberately de
clare to you were solely those of entire friendship and re
spect. The object of this letter is simply to assure you of
this, and if I could do it in stronger terms, I would.
    “It seems to be strange and almost incredible that one
whose   experiments  I have so often quoted with respect, whose
results   I
          have made known, and whose originality in the mat
ter of metallic reflection I have so often vindicated at home
and abroad, in private conversation and in public lectures,
should take a pleasure in misinterpreting my expressions.
I  am persuaded that at some future time you will do me jus
tice, and in the mean time I will rather run the risk of sus
taining any prejudice which your letter may excite against
my experiments until they appear to speak for themselves,
than enter into a public disputation about statements and
expressions, to the certain loss both of time and temper.                     I
mean to write to Mr. Taylor to this effect, and shall per
haps communicate to him the substance of this letter.

    Now, Sir, after this statement it is not my intention to enter
into any defence of the “memorandum” inserted in your Jour
nal for December (L. & E. Phil. Mag. vol. xv. p. 479.). I shall
correct neither Mr. Potter's statements nor his inferences, which
so far as they relate to myself are certainly unfounded.     Had
I been  at    all
               aware     the extreme importance which Mr. Pot

             former communication't I omitted to mention that
INinmymany      of the observations an achromatic object glass        was
used, of one tenth of an inch focal length, made by Powell,
and adapted to the same eye-piece as the excellent object-glass
by Ross. They both perform admirably, and the additional
power gained by the former one is not only of considerable
advantage, but it affords an opportunity of instituting com
parative trials, so as to diminish the chances of error.            Both
these glasses will therefore be employed in the succeeding
observations, and I shall avail myself of opportunities of test
ing the measurements previously given, and of recording the
 results when they seem to be of any consequence. The mag
 nifying power of Powell's glass with the micrometer eye-piece
 is as nearly as possible nine hundred and eighty diameters,
 and the object is very distinctly defined.
      After repeating very carefully numerous observations on
 the corpuscles in their own serum, as compared with speci
  mens dried in the manner formerly described, it appears that
  the latter are almost always a little larger and more accurately
  defined in the outline than the former.           This is particularly
  observable at the     margins    of the dried    preparations,    where
  the corpuscles are very thinly spread, and where desiccation
  takes place instantaneously when they are applied warm from
  the wound to the glass. Towards the centre, as the particles
  are more thickly aggregated, they do not dry so quickly, but
   have time to contract a little, and accordingly correspond in
   diameter pretty accurately with those observed in their own

   shrunk while under examination in the serum, as if they were
   acted on by the glasses between which they were placed, the
   edges of the disks becoming more rounded, occasionally gra
              and not unfrequently puckered or swollen, so that
   the central concavity in many of them was very remarkable,
   and often more or less misshapen from the bulging of the
   edges towards the centre, a triangular depression with con
   cavity of the margins being thus occasionally produced on the
    surface of the corpuscles.
       Though saline solutions are useful in diluting the blood for
    comparative observations, measurements from corpuscles so
    preserved are not worthy of much reliance.            The shrinking,

   106        Mr. Gulliver's     Observations   on the Blood Corpuscles
   or the alteration of form in the disks, may generally be ob
   served even in the course of a minute or two after the mix
   ture. Nor is the serum of one animal always proper to di
   lute the blood of another; for I could seldom get the cor
  puscles of the carnivora, or even of some ruminants, to mix
   well with the serum of the horse.
      If obtained from the body a day or two after death, the
  disks are generally so clustered together as to be seen very
  indefinitely in the wet state, although some of the smallest
  detached from the masses are often tolerably distinct.              The
  corpuscles are mostly very irregular in size, approaching
  more to the spherical shape, and even more susceptible of
  alteration from any of the common methods of dilution, than
  in blood procured from the living animal. By drying, how
  ever, a tolerably clear outline of the disks from the carcass
  may in most instances be procured, although every method
  sometimes fails, as I experienced a short time since in some
  blood from the Sloth Bear and from the Malay Sun Bear.
  Though the bodies of these animals were perfectly fresh, and
  the masses of fibrine in the heart and great vessels firmly
  coagulated, the particles of the blood were so much con
  glomerated, and their size so singularly variable, that it was
  impossible either by drying or any method of dilution to ob
  tain even an approximation to their average diameter; and
 yet some corpuscles procured from the living Sloth Bear did
 not exhibit such irregularities.
     Of the accidental circumstances by which the particles are
 liable to become enlarged, besides incipient putrefaction, the
 moisture of the atmosphere, of the breath, or of the hand are the
 most frequent.      Dried or drying specimens are thus instantly
 injured or destroyed, the disks being more or less altered in
 shape and deprived of their colouring matter. But much de
 pends on the degree in which these causes may have acted;
 for a diminution in the magnitude of the corpuscles may be
 the consequence.          If,
                            for example, some water        bemixed with
 blood, the disks immediately become much enlarged and
 spherical, quickly losing their colouring matter; and yet

They       have a very characteristic appearance, being remarkably
flat and pellucid, several generally touching at their edges so
as to form groups, scarcely ever turning over or even moving
in the fluid. It is obvious from the size, shape, and general
appearance of these particles, that they are not identical with
those which have been usually described as the nuclei of the
blood corpuscles. The average diameter of the disks in the
 first instance was 1-3429th of an inch.
     Besides the precaution concerning the preservation of the
 blood, it is equally necessary to be careful as to how it is ob
 tained. The corpuscles are more or less modified very quickly
 after extravasation; and if some delay occur, and the drop
 of blood, effused into the subcutaneous tissue, require press
 ure to determine it to the surface, the corpuscles in that
 blood may be expected to be irregular in form and mag
 nitude, many of them particularly presenting a granulated
 appearance. Hence the glass should not be pressed upon the
  wound, but merely lightly touched on a drop of the blood,
  however small, that has appeared freely immediately after the
 puncture.        A specimen thus procured, and dried as before
  noticed, will be excellent, although in               cases where  all                       it

     The discrepancies just alluded to are frequently adduced
 as instances of how little credit should be attached to micro
 scopical anatomy generally.        There does not appear to me to
be any reason in the objection; first, because it is seldom if
ever urged by those who are sufficiently acquainted with the

    In the venous blood of the monkey tribe, besides lymph

their being seen occasionally to alter in shape, like a drop of
any viscid matter subjected to currents of particles on              mar           its

112      Mr. Gulliver's   Observations  on the Blood Corpuscles
commonly presented the following diameters, 1-4365th and
                an inch; and there were several 1-4000th, the
thickness of the edges of the disks being 1-16,000th. The
blood was examined quickly after it was obtained, and no
appreciable difference was seen between the arterial and ye
nous corpuscles. They are certainly but very slightly smaller
than in the tiger.
   99. A Kangaroo, (Macropus Eugenii?) a female, 1-3554th,
1-8432nd, and 1-3200th, a common diameter of the disks, and
1-4000th and 1-3000th rather frequent sizes. The edges of
the corpuscles generally from 1-12,000th to 1-10,000th of an
inch thick.     Blood from a prick of the tail.
   100. The    Coypu,   (Myopotamus Coypus,) an adult.        Most
common diameters of corpuscles 1-3500th and 1-3200th of
an inch. Small disks, 1-4000th ; large, 1-2666th, in the dry
state.   Thickness of the edges of the corpuscles 1-12000th to
1-9600th.     In the serum, the corpuscles were more variable
in size, 1-4572nd and 1-3000th of an inch being very fre
quent.     Blood from a prick near the buttocks.
    101.  Gray   Squirrel, (Sciurus cinereus,) adult male.   Com
mon diameters 1-4266th, 1-4000th, 1-3840th, and 1-3600th.
Extreme sizes 1-6000th and 1-3000th.            Magnitude of cor
puscles very irregular; a few not more than i-64ooth.
Blood from a prick of the nose for the first examination, and
from the ear a few days subsequently for another trial.
    102. Capistrated Squirrel, (Sciurus capistratus,) adult male.
Common        diameters 1-4000th, 1-3790th, and 1–3693rd.
Extreme sizes 1-5333rd and 1-3000th. A few of the very
small corpuscles less than 1-6400th of an inch in diameter.
Blood from a prick of the upper lip.
    103. Black Squirrel, (Sciurus niger,) an adult.        All the
following sizes frequent, 1-3600th, 1-3692nd, 1-3790th, and
1-3840th.      Extreme diameters 1-5333rd and 1-3000th.         A
few of the very small corpuscles were seen.
   The size of the corpuscles, as far as I have observed, is
very irregular in the genus Sciurus.           There are circular
particles, though not in large numbers, yet very remarkable
for their regularity and diminutive size in regard to the com
mon blood disks.       For this reason the very small corpuscles
should be further examined.          I have certainly seldom seen
them so remarkably in any other genus, though I think they
appeared in the blood of the female Sloth Bear. In the Palm
Squirrel (72.) there were several about 1-7000th of an inch.
   104. Wild Boar, (Sus Scrofa,) from Asia, male, nearly
full-grown. 1-4266th, 1-4365th, and 1-4000th, most frequent

          or Red Particles of the Mammiferous Animals.                     113
diameters of the disks. Extreme sizes 1-1533rd and 1-3555th,
Blood from a prick of the nose.
   105. Collared Peccari, (Dicotyles torquatus,) from Mexico.
Full-grown    female. 1-4 173rd, 1-4500th, 1-4572nd, and
1-4800th   very  common diameters of disks.     Extreme sizes
1-6000th and I-3555th. . Much more irregular in size than
in the Wild Boar, and from two examinations appearing to
be smaller. Blood from a prick of the upper lip.
   106. Zebra, (Equus Burchellii,) full-grown female.  Aver
age-sized disks 1-4500th ; and 1-4800th, 1-4365th and
1-4000th, not uncommon.         Extreme sizes 1-5800th and
1-3368th.    Blood from a  prick of the nose.
   107. Dshikketai or Wild Ass, (Equus Hemionus), a fe
male, as large as a common Ass. The most frequent sizes of
corpuscles 1-4572nd and 1-4800th.        Several as large as
1-4000th.    Extreme diameters 1-5800th and 1-3555th of an
inch. Blood from a prick of the nose.
   With reference to the blood of the Horse (see No. 34 in
the former paper) Mr. Siddall obtained the following measure
ments of the common-sized corpuscles from a cart stallion,
aged 12, suddenly killed: 1-4360th, 1-4208th, and 1-4362nd.
The blood, from a vein of the testicle, examined soon after
the death of the animal.
   108. Axis Deer, (Cervus Aris,) adult male. Most frequent
sizes 1-4924th and 1-5333rd of an inch. Extreme diameters
1-6000th and 1-4365th.      Altogether very irregular in size.
Blood from a vein of the ear.
    109. A Deer, (Cervus macrourus?). Most frequent diame
ters 1-5 142nd and 1-5333rd.     Extreme sizes 1-6400th and
 1-4000th.   An adult male and female; the blood from the
renal vein of the former, and from the ear of the latter.
    These animals were shipped at Honduras, and brought
home with the Mexican Deer.
    110. Reeves's Muntjac, (Cervus Reevesii, Ogilby). The
corpuscles belonging to the same class as those of the Porcine
and Mexican Deer. They will be                  all
                                      fully described together
on    future occasion.

male. Corpuscles very variable from 1-6000th        1-4000thto              ol
 an inch; 1-4800th was very common, and 1-5333rd common.
Blood from prick
               a             of

                                                      a
half-grown. 1-4924th, 1-4800th and 1-4572nd,           common    all
diameters. Extreme sizes 1-6000th and 1-4365th of an- inch.

114.         On the Blood Corpuscles             of the Mammiferous Animals.
puscles remarkably variable in size, and differing much whether
examined dry or in their serum. In the former state 1-5333rd
and 1-6000th most common diameters, and extreme sizes

broader in proportion than the others, some nearly circular,

measurements agree as nearly as possible with mine, and
the corpuscles in the Vicugna appear to be a little smaller

the ear, the blood was of a bright  brick-red colour, as it ap

     INxiv.
        my former communication (L. and
              461.)  p.
                    considered the nature

                                                                                       Phil. Mag. vol.
                                                                                        a   well-known

      and the effects     of lightning   on   H.M.S. Rodney,      &c.    117
phaenomenon in electricity, termed by Cavallo, Priestley, and
others the lateral explosion, and showed that it did not apply
to the state of a metallic rod in the act of transmitting a va
nishing electrical accumulation between two opposed electri
fied surfaces, as insisted on by Mr. Sturgeon in a recent num
ber of his Annals of Electricity. I will now proceed to ex
amine the general character and effect of ordinary electrical
discharges, whether produced on the great scale of nature,
or artificially, with a view of further showing, that such lateral
explosions do not occur at the instant of the passing of a
shock of lightning through a metallic conductor, as also with
a view of meeting certain other objections which have been ad
vanced at different times to the use of lightning rods in ships.
   2. I should not have felt myself called upon to notice fur
ther Mr. Sturgeon's memoir, did                I
                                            not consider the state
ments it  contains,  although  superficial and inconclusive, likely
to mislead the    public  upon  many  important   points connected
with the effectual protection of shipping against the destructive
effects of lightning, and convey false views of the nature of
electrical action.    Under these impressions I have little hesi
tation in noticing what he has advanced under the following
heads:–
     1st. Examination of the observed effects produced on
       shipping by lightning.
     2nd. A comparison of the observed effects of lightning
       and the probable effects which lightning would pro
       duce by the application of Mr. Harris's conductors to
        shipping.
   3. The first contains an excellent, and I have no doubt, an
accurate statement, by an intelligent officer of the Rodney, of
the destructive effects of lightning lately experienced in that
ship, together with notices of two cases in which ships fitted
with my conductors were struck by lightning without any
attendant    illconsequence.        the second,
                                    In                  the author’s
                                                        it
object  to prove, from the effects       lightning
                                          of         in is
                                                       the Rodney,
that my system        inadmissible; since the discharge
                     is                                        light
                                                                  of
ning,   he observes, which struck the Rodney, “would have
been powerful enough           to
                               have rendered even the thickest
part of Mr. Harris's conductors sufficiently hot         ignite gun
                                                        to
powder.”
   Considering the boldness          this assertion, and the high
                                     of
pretension     ofthe memoir,   we should expect,        onexamining
the author's  researches,     to
                              find him      possession

 really the actual power                      of
                                       the charge.          We see, for example,
 that  it  did not fuse         copper  a  funnel,         inches long,   16  inches                             10

my conductor, the thickest part of it would have become red
hot: , His reasoning, in fact, amounts to this; an explosion
of lightning having slightly fused a small brass sheave, weigh
ing 4 ounces, and having failed to fuse a short copper funnel,
therefore had it fallen on a rod of copper of one inch in dia
meter, and 200 feet long”, that rod would have been rendered
red-hot.
     This, it must be allowed, is                                a somewhat amusing                          kind of
special pleading, quite unprecedented,                                          I   believe, in any paper
on Science.

 would have rendered that rod red-hot.

   8. The manifest deficiency of sound practical information in
Mr.    Sturgeon's memoir, imposes upon me the necessity of                                   ad
verting to the general character and operation of common
electrical discharges, whether produced by artificial means or
on the great scale of nature.           In doing this have no desire    I
to excuse     myself,  in case  I  should not have written clearly and
explicitly on the subject, since in no department of physics is
the field of observation so fertile, and the path of experiment
so sure and easy. We have before us the experience of nearly
a century, during which time lightning-rods have been em
ployed; a great number of instances have occurred of shocks
of lightning falling on ships under a variety of different                                   cir
cumstances, in some cases where lightning conductors have
been present, in others where absent; in many instances where
ships have been near each other and exposed to the same
storm, some having conductors, others not. The general laws
of the discharge are traceable in them all, and the effects on
metallic bodies distinctly shown.            On the other hand, we can
 on a minor     scale,   imitate  successfully     the great operations of
 nature, and examine experimentally every possible contin
 gency attendant on the operation of a shock of lightning in a
 ship.     It is our own fault, therefore, if we do not treat the
 subject scientifically, and arrive at complete practical solutions
 of such questions as these : Is a lightning conductor desirable
 in a ship? Will it cause by attraction a shock of lightning to
 fall on a ship when otherwise such would not take place?                                     If
 so, can it cause damage by              its
                                         inability     get ridto  the light       of
 ning which falls     on   it? What the best form and dimensions
                                              is

Is it    liableto   cause damage               by

 cannot now      be    reasonably determined they probably never

      9.  Although some theoretical differences may have arisen

       and the effects              of lightning       on   H.M.S. Rodney, &c.                              121
concerning the precise nature of electricity, yet the following
explanation runs sufficiently parallel with facts to entitle it to
our confidence, and put us in possession of one of the great
advantages of every theory, viz. a classification and connexion
of observed effects; the province of human knowledge, being,
as justly observed by a most intellectual and accomplished
writer, “to observe facts, and trace what their relations
are”.”
  General principles: —
  10. There is an invisible agency in the material world inti
mately associated with common matter, termed electricity.
  11. Lightning, thunder, and a variety of analogous phaeno
mena of a minor kind, artificially produced, result from dis
charges      of this agency                 between         bodies differently                        affected
bv it.
    12. In every case of electrical discharge there are two
surfaces of action; one existing on some substance eager to
throw off redundant electricity, being, according to Dr. Frank
lin, overcharged with it; the other existing in some other sub
stance eager to receive electricity, being, according to the same
philosopher, deficient of           undercharged.
                                            it,   or
    13. Two    opposed    bodies,  when placed           these opposite             in
electrical states,  have sort                     of
                                     exclusive action on each other,
                                     a
either directly through any intervening substance, whether                                                       a
conductor       the electrical principle
                    of                          not,     otherwise indi

Now the separate pieces of leaf-gold thus placed, may be taken
  to represent detached conducting masses fortuitously placed
  along the mast and hull of a ship.
     Exp. 2. Let a thin continuous line, m, n, be passed through
  the separated pieces, and a dense accumulation discharged
  over the whole, as in the preceding case. The effect will be
 as represented in fig. 6. : the discharge will be confined to the
 line of least resistance; and we may perceive in this, as in the
 former case, that those pieces, or parts of pieces, out of the
 track of the discharge, are not affected; thus a part only of the
 piece g is destroyed, also of the piece i, whilst other pieces,
 b, d, e,f, l, which in the former case, where the continuous
 line, a, b, was not present, were blackened by the discharge,
 remain here perfect.

 by other comparatively short collateral branches, as de, d c,
 having one common connexion at B, then a discharge which
 would destroy the line A, B, will divide upon these auxiliary
 lines, and the part d, B will either escape, or the whole will
 suffer together.

fitting continuous conductors of lightning of great capacity in
the masts of ships, linking them by efficient communications,
together with the principal detached metallic bodies in the
hull, into one general continuous system, and finally connect
ing the whole with the sea. These conductors consist of two
laminae of copper-sheet, varying from one inch and a half to
five inches wide, and being together nearly one-fourth of an
inch thick; they are inlaid so as to be fair with the surface of
the mast, and form a series of shut-joints; they are otherwise
so constructed as to present an uninterrupted line of action
from the highest point to the sea. The method has been par
tially used in the British navy for several years, and has been
proved in every way efficient. In no case has any of the ves
sels fitted with them received the slightest damage, although
frequently exposed to severe thunderstorms, and in some                                       in
stances actually struck by heavy discharges similar to that
which fell on the Rodney in December, 1838.*.
    20.  If  we consider attentively the effects of this shock, we
shall find them in complete accordance with the principles just
stated. The attendant phaenomena were of the simplest kind,
and such as have always occurred in cases of ships struck by
lightning not having a continuous conductor: e.g. the elec
trical discharge, in forcing                       its
                                      way between the sea and clouds,
over    resisting  intervals,    and between discontinuous metallic
masses, was productive                        of
                                     violent expansive effect

                            the same time        considerable evolution
                                                                  a

    this  instance;   the course                   of
                                      the discharge was very simple              a
affair, being, according          the law      electrical action just ex

action; thus we find the points of ingress and egress of an
artificial charge, when caused to fall on a slip of gold leaf or
other matter, are always those in which the most powerful
effect arises; and when we desire to fire inflammable matter
by electricity we place it directly between detached metallic
points.
   21. The circumstance of the lightning striking over portions
of the wet       mast without damage, is precisely the same effect as
observed in certain cases of artificial electrical discharges.Thus
a very slight film of moisture will allow a jar intensely charged
to discharge a luminous ball over a long strip of glass. Dr.
Franklin found he could destroy a dry rat by an electrical
shock when he failed to hurt a wet one.                     we continue to       If
follow the     discharge    we find similar    expansive   and destructive

   Although Mr. Sturgeon has gone far out of his way to twist
these phaenomena into an accordance with certain theoretical
views, and sets them up as being of an extraordinary kind,
they are nevertheless          of a very simple character, and are
merely illustrative of         a   few well-known laws              of electrical

XXI.        On a new Compound               of    Ferrocyanide   of      Potassium,
  with      Cyanide of Mercury.                  By Robert       KANE, M.D.,
  M. R.I.A.”
    had frequently occurred to me to notice that, in the pro
ITcess for obtaining cyanide of mercury by the action of
ferrocyanide of potassium on sulphate of mercury, it was
necessary to observe accurately the equivalent proportions of
these substances, in order to ensure success.        If any ferro
cyanide of potassium were present in excess, a corresponding
deficiency in the quantity of the cyanide of mercury always
occurred.    I at last traced this circumstance to the fact, that
the  ferrocyanide   of potassium in excess combines with the
cyanide of mercury, to form a new substance so similar in ap
pearance to the former of the two, as to be very easily con
founded with it and thus rejected in the crystallizations.
   This new salt is most easily prepared by dissolving together
in a moderate quantity of water about one part of ferro
cyanide of potassium in crystals with two of cyanide of mer
cury.     On cooling, the new salt separates in the form of
rhomboidal plates of a rich yellow colour, almost as deep as
that of ferrocyanide of potassium.      When heated, these cry
stals lose some water and become whitish and opake, then
blacken and yield cyanogen and mercury; the usual products

porated, by which the degree of dilution is altered; 2ndly,
the water which is condensed in the upper part of the tube
again falling down, causes a momentary increased dilution,
and consequently an increased quantity of the precipitate;
and 3rdly, the boiling point is heightened the greater the
quantity of salt of iron dissolved in the water. Nevertheless
the result of the experiments is sufficiently accurate to          al
low of our establishing the following law with respect to the
 relative quantities of the peroxide of iron remaining in solu
tion after boiling : With a 200-fold and greater dilution, the
 quantities of the perovide of iron remaining in solution are
in inverse ratio to the dilution.      Indeed if these quantities are
 calculated  acording  to the above-mentioned proportions, we
       approximatively   that,

                                       of the peroxide of iron re

       — 1000          —          Tº
 This progression, however, lis not generally exact, for           in
 stance by a 100-fold dilution 3ds of the iron should remain
dissolved.     The law therefore is approximative only for the
central members.
    If a solution of the neutral sulphate of the peroxide of iron
is mixed with a solution of the neutral sulphate of potash, the
 same basic salt is precipitated without any part of the potash
entering into the combination.          The properties of the solu
 tion of sulphate of iron now described may be employed to
 separate the peroxide of iron from some salts.         The neutral
 sulphates of manganese, nickel and cobalt have no acid re
action upon litmus paper like the neutral sulphate of the per

132            Prof. Sylvester on Elimination and Derivation
oxide of iron. If therefore one of these sulphates is mixed with
the latter in solution, by far the greater portion of the iron
may be precipitated by saturating, as nearly as possible, the
solution with potash, and the remaining portion of iron may
be thrown down by dilution and boiling.          It remains only
to be observed that no other acid than sulphuric acid must
be present, and that the solution nearly saturated must be
diluted with at least twice or three times            quantity                            its                    of

of Boetius was not introduced by him.         It does not appear
to me that much      authority  ought   to be given to the                                            well
known passage of William of         Malmsbury,”    as far as it is
supposed to prove that Gerbert brought the knowledge of the
abacus from Spain: and, as Professor Peacockt so well                                                       ob
serves, “the passage of this historian contains no certain                                                  in
timation of the knowledge of the notation by nine figures and
zero, as the rules which would be thence derived, would tend
rather to relieve than increase the labours of the sweating
calculators,”—quae a sudantibus abacistis vir intelliguntur.
Now had the question of the Boetian contractions been
broached when Professor Peacock composed his history of
arithmetic, he would immediately have seen how evidently this
passage refers to them, and this supposition would have                                                   ex
plained his doubts in the remaining part of his argument.
    In the treatise of Berhelinus in the Bodleian libraryf, the
Boetian contractions occur explained by Greek numerals,
a most singular and important fact, and one which affords a
very strong argument for what M. Chasles has stated at p. 474
of his Apercu Historique. . En passant, this is also an argu
ment for the antiquity of this artificial abacal system.
    Again, what difference is there between the system of the
Greeks, the system in the Mentz Manuscript, the system in
the passage in Boetius as satisfactorily explained by M.
Chasles, and the Arabic method 2 I mean with regard to
first principles.    All, in fact, are contained in the following
formula, which is the general expression for any finite num

                 various bodies to the Chemical Rays.                139
that, I read Mr. Talbot's paper on photographic drawing,
which opened to me new views, and pointed out paths rich
in the promise of important results.
     The vast sum of delight which the pursuit of this subject
during the past year has afforded me, makes me a large debtor
to that erudite gentleman, which I thus humbly, but sincerely,
acknowledge.
     My first endeavours in the photographic art were directed
to restoring the natural order of light and shadow; and I
fortunately succeeded in effecting this very early in the sum
mer of 1839. My next were to improve the camera for pho
tographic purposes, in which object I was most materially
assisted by Mr. John Towson, of this town, who, having di
rected much of his attention to optics, furnished me with in
formation and instruments by which my progress was greatly
accelerated”.
     Having, in conjunction       with this gentleman, while trying
a variety of      lenses,  been often perplexed by the dissimilar
results obtained on the same paper from different kinds of
         I
glass, was induced to commence a series of experiments on
the interference of transparent bodies to the permeation of
 chemical light.
     The same subject has, I am informed, engaged the atten
 tion of two scientific inquirers on the continent; but beyond
 a brief notice of M. Edmond Becquerel's experiments in the
 Athenaeum, No. 621,         I am perfectly unacquainted with the
 methods or results of their observations.
     Being anxious to obtain a measure of the interference of
 the various bodies I was about to examine, I constructed a
        delicate galvanometer—the coil being of ribbon copper
 ...}
 and the needles of French watch-spring. To this instrument I
 connected, by platina wires, a U tube, as suggested by M. Bec
 querel in his Traité d'Electricité, which held in one arm a solu
  tion of nitrate of silver, and in the other a solution of iodide of
 potassium.       Every part of the tube was screened from light,
  except the lowest point, at which the fluids met.               On this
  point, by means of a powerful lens, a concentrated pencil of
  light was thrown, which was made to pass through the bodies
  to be examined. The force of electro-chemical action being
  dependent on the quantity of chemical light impinging on
   the exposed portion of the fluids, led me naturally to con
  clude that the deflections of the needle would furnish ver
   accurate comparative results.        I have also tried the plan N.
  E. Becquerel adopts, of floating one photometric fluid upon

140                 Mr. Hunt      on the Permeability  of
another.     Experience has, however, convinced me that the
galvanometer, although capable of being made in the hands
of a skilful manipulator a very accurate measurer of the diur
mal variations of the quantity of chemical rays in the solar
beam", cannot be depended on where a series of nice com
parisons are required.       I have never yet been enabled to ar
rive at precisely the same results by this instrument in any
two sets of observations;          every thin cloud or the lightest
smoke    materially  altering    the deflections.   I have, however,
found it of use in giving me near approximations to a correct
arrangement.       I proceed thus: having by the galvanometer
tabulated a number of bodies, I select those whose interfe
rence seems to approach near each other, and place them in
regular order, under the same circumstances, upon a sheet of
highly sensitive photographic paper in a dark room; then
opening the window-shutters, expose it for three minutes to
the direct influence of the solar rays, or for twice that time
to diffused daylight; again darkening the apartment I ex
amine the tints at which the paper has arrived under each
body, and mark their correspondence or otherwise with the
observations by the galvanometer.             By carefully repeating
many times each set of experiments, I am enabled to correct
small errors of observation.
    I use yet another method to test the correctness of the
foregoing processes, which consists in filling a camera with
the fluid or gas to be examined, or interposing the solid body
and receiving the sun's image on a disc of silvered copper,
 prepared according to the principles of the Daguerreotype.
    As many simple contrivances will suggest themselves to
those who are desirous of repeating the experiments, it may be
sufficient for me to state, that my apparatus is simply one
cylinder sliding within another for the purpose of adjusting
the focus to the different densities of the bodies, and that the
photographic disc is protected from the fluid or gas by a
piece of tested plate glass well greased around the edges, as
are also the cylinders, throughout their length.
    This plan may appear open to some of the objections I have
urged against the galvanometer; but, as from the sensitiveness
of the preparation an exposure of thirty seconds is sufficient,
you are enabled to select your moments of observation, and
   * Long prior to the publication of the speech of M. Arago on the re
port of the Commission on the Daguerreotype, both Mr. Towson and
myself had remarked that the light of morning acted more powerfully on
photographic  preparations than the evening light. The paper which at
nine in the morning became in ten minutes a rich purple bronze, took
almost twice that time to reach the same hue at three in the afternoon.

using the galvanometer at the same time to mark the intensity
of light, try every substance under precisely the same circum
stances.    Having completed the exposure of a series, place                       I

                     Electric Condition of Iron.                143
   Jan. 1st, 1839. A galvanic combination of iron and zinc
was put in communication with two poles of a differential
galvanometer; a like-sized combination (or gal. pair) of copper
and   zinc was connected with the other two poles of the diff.
galvanometer: Deviation of needle in favour of the iron and
zinc  pair = 25 degrees.
   Feb.   27, 1839.      Experiments made on the comparative
power of two galvanic batteries fitted up on Wollaston's
plan (that is with the negative plate opposed to both surfaces
of the zinc or positive plate.) The size of the plates was the
same in both batteries, viz. zinc plate 2% inch. by 24 inch.
The number of pairs in each battery was ten. The only
difference between the two batteries was, that the negative
plates in one were of copper and in the other of iron.
   The exciting solution was dilute sulphuric acid, which was
not renewed during the experiment, but the experiment was
continued until the acid was exhausted. The power of each
battery was applied to the decomposition of water, and the gas
collected was the measure of the power.

after sixteen years of almost unremitting application on the part of the
author.     The sixteen volumes which, if arranged systematically as
proposed by Mr. Curtis, will form eight, contain illustrations of all
the Genera of Linnaeus, Fabricius, and Latreille that are recorded as
native groups, as well as most of the interesting discoveries that have
been made for many years past, comprising 770 copper-plates, giving
faithful figures of our wild flowers, as well as the insects, beautifully
coloured and finished with the greatest care. The letter-press,
amounting to nearly 1700 pages, although scientific, contains concise
accounts of the history and oeconomy of every group that is interest
ing and familiar to us, such as the Hive-Bee, Wasps, Cockroaches,
Molecrickets &c.; and there are two thick volumes of the Butterflies
and Moths.

Nov. 6.       NOTICE of showers of ashes which fell on board the Rox
  1839.         burgh, at sea, off the Cape de Verd islands, February,
 1839, by the Rev. W. B. Clarke, F.G.S., was first read.
    The object of this communication is to register an interesting oc
currence, though the author possesses no direct evidence of its pro
bable cause.
     On February 2, when the Roxburgh was in latitude 21° 14 N.,
long. 25° 6' W., the wind, which had blown from the north-east
during the passage from Plymouth, changed to the east and south
east, and was accompanied with a thick haze of a peculiar kind. The
same description of weather prevailed on the 3rd, when the ship was
off St. Anthony, one of the Cape de Verd islands.
     On Feb. 4, the latitude at noon was 14° 31' N., long. 25° 16' W.
The sky was overcast, and the weather was thicker than before and
insufferably oppressive, though the thermometer was only 72°. At 3
P.M. the wind suddenly lulled into a calm, then rose from the south
west, and was accompanied with rain, and the air appeared to be
filled with dust, which affected the eyes of the passengers and crew. At
103 P.M. the wind returned to the east and blew strongly.         During
the continuance of the haze, which was as thick as a November fog,
                 of all
and extended       around the horizon, dust was gradually deposited
on   every part    the ship that offered lodgement.

5th  of  February, the Roxburgh was        lat. 12° 36' N., long. 24° 13'

one of the Cape de Verds, was about 45 miles distant. The wea
ther was clear and fine, but the sails were found to be covered with
an impalpable reddish-brown powder, or a kind of triturated pumice,
which Mr. Clarke says resembled many of the ashes ejected from
Vesuvius, and was evidently not sand blown from the African de
sert.    On the 6th the wind returned to the south-east, and the wea
ther afterwards resumed                          its
                               ordinary characters.
   The circumstances connected with these atmospherical changes in
duced the author       infer that they were due
                                   to                    eruption    the               to   an                     in

 while  passing near Fogo,  had her sails covered with similar brown                            a

 A   considerable time afterwards the island divided itself into the form
 of two pyramids, the most northern one crumbled away diagonally
 towards the north, and the southern one disappeared in pieces, the
 base however always remaining above the surface of the sea. At
 half-past 7 o'clock the same island appeared again, or its size be
 came considerably increased, but shortly afterwards its summit be
 came flattened. At thirty-five minutes past 7 o'clock two other
 islands appeared to the southward of the first.                              Of these, the most
 southern bore south 56° west. The three islands appeared to run
 in the direction of north and south. The sea broke with violence
 upon their shores and seemed violently agitated.                               In the distances
between these islands nothing was visible but chains of rocks, among
 which a great explosion was discernible.
     “At eight minutes before 8 o'clock, the most northern island was
 the only one visible; it appeared much higher than before, and of
 the shape of a sugar loaf. The darkness of the night prevented us
 seeing the other two islands,
     “The following day, the 13th of the month, at a quarter past 1

    Mr. Caldcleugh adds, the master of another vessel reported that
the islands bore 30 leagues due east of Juan Fernandez; and that a
ship had been despatched from Valparaiso to discover whether they
remained above water or had crumbled away.
    The larger Curauma Point, referred to in the declaration, is a bluff
point, about 400 feet in height, and situated to the southward of
Valparaiso.
    A letter was next read, addressed to Charles Lyell, Esq., V.P.G.S.,
by John Buddle, Esq., F.G.S., on depressions produced in the sur
face of the ground by excavating beds of coal.
    Subsidence of the surface invariably follows the working of the
subjacent beds of coal where sufficient supports are not left, but the
extent of the subsidence is governed by the following circumstances:
    1st. The depth of the seam of coal below the surface.
    2nd. The thickness of the seam or seams removed.
    3rd. The nature of the strata between the surface and the seams
of coal.
    4th. Whether the pillars of coal are wholly-or partially worked.

                                             Geological Society.                                                             147
  If   the depth from the surface does not exceed 30 fathoms, and sand
stones form the predominant strata, the subsidence is about equal to
the thickness of the seam of coal removed; but if metal-stone con
stitute the greater portion of the intervening mass, the amount of de
pression in the surface is less. This rule is considered to hold good
at all depths.
    The degree of subsidence does not depend so much on the thick
ness of the bed of coal, as on the entire removal of it; but Mr.
Buddle states, that he has had no opportunities of making correct ob
servations on the relative effect produced in the surface. If a con
siderable portion of the coal be left, although quite inadequate to the
support of the superincumbent strata, the subsidence is retarded.
This is more particularly the case in the Newcastle system of work
ing, where rectangular pillars are left in the first instance and after
 wards removed. In working these pillars, stooks or blocks of coal of
 considerable strength are left as props to protect the colliers from
 the exfoliation of the roof; and though a subsidence of the super
 incumbent strata invariably takes place, yet the extent in the first
 instance is governed by the degree of resistance of the stooks; and
 it frequently happens, that a large tract of a coal mine remains for
 several years only filled in part, and without any perceptible change
 occurring. In course of time, however, from the exfoliation of the
  stooks and the operation of the atmosphere, a further subsidence,
  called a second creep, takes place, and generally continues until the
 excavation is completely closed.

    The high-main seam was first worked, then the Maudlin, and        af
terwards the Hutton, and the removal of each was attended with a
depression in the line of the railway. The extent of each settlement
was not measured, but the whole amount was 5 feet 6 inches, the
aggregate thickness of the seams being 14 feet 11 inches.           This
small effect Mr. Buddle explains by showing, that the railway passes
near one end of the excavated tract, and that metal-stone predomi
nates over sandstone in the superincumbent strata. The working of
the five-quarter seam is now in progress, and the effects occasioned
by the removal of the three lower seams are well exposed.         Innu
merable vertical cracks pass through the coal, its roof and pavement,
but they are perfectly close except around the margin of the settle
ment.     Along this line the strata are bent down, the cracks in the
pavement are frequently open, forming considerable fissures, the coal
is splintered, and the roof-stone is shattered.   In the interior of the
settlement the pavement is as level and smooth as if it had never been
disturbed, and the cracks are quite close, passing through the seam
without splintering it or producing any effect except that of render
 ing it tougher, or, in the language of the colliers, “woody.”     This
 effect, Mr. Buddle conceives, may be attributed to the escape of the
 gas, and he states that it is sometimes produced by other operations,
 when the coal is said to be “winded.”      The smoothness of the pave
 ment, he is of opinion, is due to the direct downward pressure of the
 superincumbent mass; and he states, that he has never noticed any
 tendency to a sliding or sideway movement in any subsidence of
 strata occasioned by the working of the coal, except the slight ob
 liquity occasioned by the offbreak at the sides of the settlement.

     December  14, 1839. The following communications were read
            parallax               By Thomas Henderson, Esq. Astro
                                                                     :-
     On the           of Sirius.
  nomer Royal for Scotland.
     The parallax of Sirius, the brightest star in the heavens, has
 been several times the subject of investigation among astronomers.
 From the variations of the zenith distances observed at Paris, the
 second Cassini inferred a parallax in declination amounting to six
 seconds of space; and, from similar variations in the observations of
 La Caille made at the Cape of Good Hope, some astronomers have
 deduced a parallax in declination of four seconds. Piazzi has also
 obtained from his observations a parallax of the same amount.       On
 the other hand, La Caille's observations of zenith distances made
 at Paris, more numerous and certain than those made at the Cape,
 do not exhibit any sensible parallax; and the observations which
 have since been made in the observatories of Europe, would appear
 to lead to the same result, as no parallax has ever been deduced
 from them.      In the Fundamenta Astronomia, M. Bessel has in
 vestigated, from Bradley's Observations of Differences of Right

                         Astronomical Society.                      149
 Ascension of Sirius and a Lyrae, the sum of the parallaxes of the
 two stars, and has found it to be an insensible quantity.
    The extensive series of observations of Sirius, made with the
 mural circle of the Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope, is well
 adapted for the investigation of the parallax, as the observations
possess some advantages over those made in Europe. The star is
near the zenith of the Cape, and the temperature is nearly the same
when it passes the meridian at noon in June, and at midnight in
December, the periods of the greatest parallaxes in declination; so
that the irregularities and uncertainties of refraction, which affect
observations in Europe, may be supposed to disappear.
   From May 1832 to May 1833, ninety-seven observations of Sirius
were made by Mr. Henderson with the mural circle at the Cape
Observatory, of which sixty-three were made by direct vision, and
thirty-four by reflection; and in Mr. Maclear's printed observations
of zenith distances, made with the same instrument, there are sixty
seven observations of the double altitude of the star, made between
August 1836 and December 1837. Each of these series of obser
vations was made in one position of the telescope upon the circle,
so that in each series the similar observations were referred to the
same divisions.
   The observations made by Mr. Henderson have been reduced in
the same manner as were those of a Centauri, given in his memoir
on the parallax of the latter star.       (Monthly Notice, Vol. IV.
No. 19.) The declinations of Sirius have been determined by com
parisons with such of the principal or standard stars as were observed
on the same day; and it is consequently assumed that, in the obser
vations of the stars of comparison, any errors which may arise from
supposing their parallaxes to be insensible, and the coefficient of
aberration to be correctly assumed, neutralize each other.         The
mean declinations of the standard stars of comparison have been
taken from the catalogue annexed to the author’s “Memoir on the
 Declinations of the Principal Stars:” the absolute places of the stars
 are not required, but only their relative positions with regard to
each other.
   Mr. Maclear observed the double altitude of Sirius, or the an
gular distances between the star seen by direct vision and by re
flexion at the same transit over the meridian. These are independent
 of the observations and assumed positions of other stars, and are
affected by twice the amount of the parallax in declination.       Ob
servations of this description appear to be the best adapted of any
which can be made with the mural circle for the investigation of
 small variations in the declination of a star.
    In the reductions of Mr. Henderson's series the constant of
aberration has been assumed = 20".50; of Mr. Maclear's, = 20"-36;
 in the reductions of both the coefficient of lunar nutation has been
 assumed = 9"25, and the annual precession and proper motion
 have been taken from the Tabulae Regiomontana.
    Mr. Maclear's observations are suitable for determining the con
stant of aberration; the correction to be applied to it has been

150                                        Astronomical Society.
therefore introduced as an unknown quantity into the equations of
condition; and, from the value which is obtained, we may judge of
the degree of accuracy with which the parallax is determined.
    On resolving, by the method of minimum squares, the two sets
of equations, and combining the results according to their relative
weights, the greatest effect of parallax in declination is found, from
the whole of the 231 observations, = + 0". 15; and the greatest
effect of aberration in declination, = 13"-07.    These quantities are
to the total effect of parallax and aberration in the proportion of
 13"> 13 to 20"-50, whence the final results are—
    Parallax of Sirius (or the angle subtended by the radius of
      the earth's orbit, at a distance equal to that of the star). = 0"-23
    Constant of aberration    .................... ---------------------- = 20-41
   The error of this determination of the parallax may be estimated
not to exceed a quarter of a second, as it is almost certain that the
constant of aberration is not in error to a greater amount.       On the
whole, it may be concluded that the parallax of Sirius is not greater
than half a second of space, and that it is probably much less.

    The catalogue was computed by M. Bessel from meridian obser
vations made by himself and his assistant, Dr. Busche.        It contains
the positions, annual precession, and      secular variations its AR and                      in
declination, together with the proper motions, and           comparison                a

     “Iwas convinced, and I had to a certain extent announced it in
my memoir, that acetic acid would produce an analogous reaction;
that is to say, under the influence of an excess of base it would
change into carbonic acid and a carburet of hydrogen, the formula
of which would be C*H*.          After some trials I perfectly succeeded
in producing this remarkable reaction.         It is only necessary to mix
10 grammes of crystallized acetate of soda with 30 or 40 grammes
of caustic barytes, and to heat the mixture very slightly in a retort,
to effect the conversion of the acetic acid into carbonic acid and a
gas, the formula of which is C+ H8.

   According to the author the experiments detailed in this memoir
P rove :
  1st.   That albumen                 of combining with a great
                                  has the property
number of metallic salts without decomposing them, and forming
with them compounds, which      are insoluble in water, when they are
united in certain proportions, but susceptible of dissolving in themse
verally when there is either an excess of albumen or of the metallic
solution combined with it.
   2nd. That these compounds, which may be designated by the
name of albuminates, appear to result from the union of several atoms
of albumen with one atom of metallic salt, as shown by the analyses
which have been performed.
   3rd. That these compounds possess the singular property of dis
solving, without undergoing any immediate alteration, in the solu
tions of alkaline salts, which decompose the metallic salts when taken
by themselves, and they remain dissolved for a shorter or longer pe
riod, according to the temperature.
   4th. That it is extremely probable that when metallic salts are
externally exhibited, there takes place in the oeconomy, effected by
absorption, an analogous combination between these salts, the tis
 sues and the albumen contained in the various animal fluids, and
 that it is probable they are conveyed in the humours, and their me
 dicinal effect is thus most commonly produced.
    5th. That it would be interesting if physicians would ascertain
 the therapeutic effects of these compounds of albumen and metallic
 salts.
    6th. That in the action of a metallic salt on any tissue, a com
 bination is effected between these two bodies, which must modify
 its vital properties and effect   change     a    functions.    in    its
    7th. That the property           of                   combining either

in which the relation between the sides of the base and the height

mid have b as a crystallographical sign. The crystals cleave readily
parallel to the lateral faces of the primary form, but more easily
parallel to one of the faces than the other, and this greater facility
corresponds with the pearly lustre peculiar to them. There are also
some indications of cleavage, parallel to the diagonal planes of the
primary form, the crystallographical sign of which is gº. The colour
of the crystals is whitish yellow ; they are translucent; their hard
ness is greater than that of haydenite, and is almost equal to that of
phosphate of lime.
     The crystals of beaumontite and haydenite form a crystalline
layer, the brilliant portions of which belong to the first-mentioned
substance, and the parts covered with brownish hydrate of iron to the
second.       This layer covers a granular rock composed principally of
 grains of quartz and haydenite.         The other face of the specimen
 is covered with small flat elongated prisms of green amphibole.—

 AN ACCOUNT        OF  THE EXPERIMENT PROPOSED BY M. ARAGO AS
      A TEST OF THE ACCURACY OF THE UN DULATORY HYPOTHE
      sis of LIGHT. *
      M. Arago proposes to avail himself of Prof. Wheatstone's revol
 ving mirror, used by that gentleman in his researches on the velocity
  of electricity whilst traversing good conductors, in determining ex
  perimentally the accuracy of one or other of the present hypotheses
  of light.    The principle of the proposed experiment is readily un
  derstood.     A ray of light incident on the surface of a plane mirror
  is reflected in the ordinary manner, the reflected and incident beams
  forming equal angles with a line perpendicular to the point of inci
  dence of the ray.      If the mirror be supposed to revolve around this
  point to an extent expressed by the quantity a, and to augment by
  this quantity the original angle of incidence, the former angle of re
  flexion will become lessened to an extent corresponding to 2 a, which
  must be added to this new angle to render it equal to the first.
  Consequently, if the incident ray remain the same, an angular move
  ment of the mirror of a will produce an angular motion of the re
  flected ray equal to 2 a.
      If then two perfectly parallel rays be incident in the same vertical
   line on a mirror revolving round the point of incidence, their paral
  lelism will be preserved after reflexion, providing they both impinge
   upon the mirror at the same instant of time, and two luminous points
   situated exactly vertically over each other will be seen; but if the
   rays impinge upon the mirror at different instants, so that one will
   be somewhat later than the other, the reflected images will no longer
   preserve their original position in the same vertical line—one ap
   pearing to the right or left of the other.

   According to the Newtonian hypothesis, or corpuscular theory of
light, a ray moves in a fluid of higher refractive power, as water,
 quicker than in air, in a ratio expressed by the direct relation of
the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of refraction; whilst
on the undulatory theory, light traverses a liquid much slower than
air, and in the inverse ratio of these sines. To test the truth of either
of these hypotheses, all that is therefore necessary, is to cause two
rays of light to be incident on a rapidly-revolving       mirror, in the
same vertical line, the lowest beam traversing air      only, whilst the
upper one passes through a tube filled with water, or other refracting
liquid. Under these circumstances, if the corpuscular theory of light
be correct, the upper ray will reach the mirror before the lower one,
and consequently the reflected images will no longer be in the same
vertical line: if the undulatory hypothesis be the true one, then the
lower ray will reach the mirror before the upper one, and the verti
cal position of the reflected images will become deranged.       Let us
suppose that the mirror revolves in a direction from right to left;
then, if the upper reflected image appear to the left of the lower,
light consists of moving corpuscules / but if the upper image appear to
the right of the lower—light is produced by ethereal undulations ! To
submit this proposed experiment to the test of experimental investi
gation is obviously a difficult matter, for, as tubes of water of any
moderate length can but very slightly affect the velocity of a ray
of light, it is obvious that the rotation of the revolving mirror must
be excessively rapid to produce a deviation of the reflected images
sufficient to admit of accurate observation.—M. Arago is inclined to
consider that a deviation of a minute of a degree produced by two
positions of the reflecting plane inclined half a minute of a degree
upon each other will be sufficient for this purpose.
   From computations deduced from the known velocity of light, it
appears that in Ixa nºmi<U+017F>tinth part of a second (the time during which
a revolving mirror moving by mechanism prepared by M. Gambey
moves through half a minute of a degree) a ray of light traverses a
portion of space corresponding to 7:07 metres, or, in round numbers,
23 English feet.     Hence if the mirror perform 2000 rotations in a
second of    time, the tube of water through which one of the rays
passes must be 23 feet in length to produce, on the theory of emis
sion, an angular separation of the reflected images corresponding to
one minute.      As a velocity of the revolving mirror of the enormous
quantity of 2000 turns in a second is extremely difficult to obtain,
the angular deviation produced by reflection from one revolving
mirror performing 1000 rotations in a second, may be increased by
viewing the images afterwards in a second revolving mirror. In this
manner, by repeated reflexions from several revolving mirrors, the
angular deviation of the images which eventually reach the eye of
the observer may be increased to a sensible quantity.
  If,   asM. Arago has thought probable,         an
                                               angular separationof the

four revolving mirrors, each performing 1000 rotations in a second.
 By employing a medium of greater refractive power than water, as
 the essential oils or sulphuret of carbon, a still greater alteration in
 the velocity of the transmitted ray will be observed, being accele
 rated on the corpuscular, and retarded on the undulatory hypothesis.
    Another mode of testing the truth of the two theories, pro
posed by M. Arago, is founded upon the different velocities of the
coloured rays of the spectrum, whilst traversing refracting media.

162       Mr. Griffith,         on the          Order of Succession of the Older
which I think it incumbent on me shortly to reply to ; and                                          I
hope to be able to show that my map is correct, and that
 Mr. Hamilton is incorrect in every case in which he has
thrown a doubt on            he
                         accuracy.
   The main points        difference between Mr. Hamilton and
myself are; 1st,             is of its
                          opinion, that    the county       Kerry,
                                                                in                       of
south      of
          Castlemaine Bay and the lower Lake           Killarney,                   of
the old red sandstone overlies unconformably those schistose
rocks which       my map are comprehended under the general
                      in
name       of
          transition,  and which include the Silurian system
and the older or Cambrian slate*.
   2nd, That the old red sandstone strata            the Gap                   of                   of
                                           Kºi...d.
Dunloe extend     uninterruptedly        southern direction from
                                                       in   a
the gap      to
            the summit                of      Reeks, from which
point they dip      the south, and are succeeded conformably
                       to
 by  a    new series        of
                         rocks which Mr. Hamilton considers                                        to
belong      tothe Devonian system.
   3rd, That the band                     of
                                  yellow sandstone shown       the                            on
geological map          underlying the carboniferous limestone
                           as                                                                      in
the valley        the River Roughty
                 of                       Kenmare, does not exist
                                                       at
there.
     Inillustration         of
                          these views Mr. Hamilton has given two
sections, the first         which extends from the gap
                                of                        Dunloe                      of
in    a   south-eastern direction across Toomies and Glena
Mountain         to
              the middle    Turk Lake Killarney, and thence
                                          or                        of
over Turk and     Mangerton    Mountains     the valley    Ken           to                of
mare; the second         representation
                                is
                                 a        Mr. Hamilton's view       of
of the strata      they appear
                       as            the west side    on
                                                      the gap                       of             of
Dunloe.
     In
      both        of
                these sections Mr. Hamilton has represented
the old red sandstone        resting unconformably                                  on
                                         heas            the older
schistose rocks, which      calls “Cambrian;” but state with                        I
out fear of contradiction that his section and statements are
incorrect     this respect, and that
                 in                        the locality      ques
                                                               in                        in
tion the old red sandstone has been deposited conformably
 on the older slate, and         descending order graduates im
                                          in     a
perceptibly into that rock.     This     also the opinion     Mr.                             of
Weaver, who considers the whole          belong             to is             to

series; and Capt. Portlock,                                    the

opinion.
     In   the first volume            of   the    Journal       of   the Geological Society
of Dublin, page 285, Mr. Hamilton describes the old red
sandstone    forming “an anticlinal axis
                  as                      the summit                          on                   of

Currawntoohill mountainº, from whence dipping to the south
ward it is covered by siliceous sandstones of a greenish or
brownish colour;” and this view is illustrated by a section
given in Plate I. fig. 3, which, together with those contained
in your Magazine, exhibit the whole of his views on the sub
Ject.
   For the         sake   of clearness,             I   have also prepared two               sec
tions passing nearly through the same line of country as those
given by Mr. Hamilton, from which it appears that the old
red sandstone on the summit of MacGillacuddy's Reeks, rests
conformably on the schistose rocks of the gap of Dunloe,
which Mr. Hamilton terms Cambrian; and that the apparent
unconformability which is visible nearly in the centre of the
gap between the chloritic quartz rock and the old red sand
stone, has been occasioned by a great north-west and south
east fault, which crosses the gap of Dunloe nearly at right
angles, and extends from thence in a south-eastern direction
along the northern declivities of the Purple, Toomies, and
Glena Mountains, from whence in continuation it reaches the
lower Lake of Killarney, near the Glena Cottage Banqueting
House, thence it crosses Brickeen Island, and passing through
Turk Lake reaches the north base of Turk mountain.
   This fault may be said to form the key to the geology of
the Killarney district, as it explains the apparent anomaly
 deducible from the persistent dip to the south of the strata
 on both sides of Glena Cottage and Brickeen Island, which
 might lead, and has led incautious observers to infer that
the strata belonging to the transition slate series which occur
to the south of the fault rest conformably on the top of the
 old red sandstone of Brickeen Bridge, of the northern part of
 Brickeen Island, and likewise on the carboniferous limestone
 east of Turk Cottage.
    In expressing my view of the geology of the district, I shall
 commence with the west side of the Gap of Dunloe; but here
 my section, Plate         fig.II.          different from Mr.
                                               1,   is      so                               Ha

                         it   isdifficulty   we can recognise them
 as  being intended      represent the same locality; yet such
                              to                                                                is
 the case.    Of the accuracy                  of
                                      my own section      entertain no         I
 doubt, having made         with  great

164    Mr. Griffith, on the Order of Succession of the    Older
from two inches to a quarter of an inch in diameter, imbedded
in a reddish gray arenaceous base. The conglomerate is          suc
ceeded by coarse-grained brownish-red slate, which is occa
sionally quarried and used for inferior roofing slate; these strata
are followed by a series of beds, consisting of red quartzose
sandstone alternating with coarse slate, the sandstone beds
presenting occasionally a conglomeritic character, but the
pebbles rarely exceed half an inch in diameter. The strata
dip to the west, though irregularly, at an average angle of
about 10° from the horizon; and consequently in ascending
the glen in a southern direction, the cliffs present the out
going or strike of the beds, which are not horizontal, but      ex
hibit a tortuous arrangement presenting frequent undulations
from north to south. At Esknagluggerny, a short distance
beyond the southern extremity of Coosane lake, the old red
 sandstone strata are cut off by the great north-west and
south-east fault already mentioned, immediately to the south
of which thick beds of green chloritic quartz rock appear at
the surface, dipping to the south at an angle of 30° from the
horizon.     These strata probably form the lowest portion of
 the transition rocks situated to the south of Castlemaine Bay,
 as we perceive the whole series to be complete in an ascending
 order from them to the summit of the Reeks.
    Commencing then with this chloritic quartz rock base, and
proceeding in a southern direction, we find that the same
rocks continue to dip to the south, and present an accumu
lation of strata for upwards of 500 feet in thickness, varying
little in their composition or character, with the exception of
an occasional interstratification of thin beds of green and
purplish gray clay slate. These slates are quite distinct in
character, as well as in colour and composition, from the
coarse red slate of the old red sandstone; they are in fact
identical with the Valentia slates, and bear a strong resem
blance in colour, composition, and lithological character to
some of those of North Wales.       Still ascending in the series,
we find that the colour of the rocks gradually changes from
green to gray, and at length the mineral chlorite is altogether
wanting.      These gray quartzose beds are not so thick as
      .
those which contain chlorite; they likewise alternate with thin
beds of clay slate, which present a purplish gray colour, with
Out        admixture of green. The gray strata may amount
altogether to about 800 feet in thickness.     Still continuing to
ascend, the same character and alternations are preserved as
the last described, but on a fresh fracture the quartzose beds
present a slight bloom or tint of red, and the disintegrated
surface of the rock exhibits a decidedly reddish hue, which

              Stratifted Rocks near Killarney and Dublin.                   165
is not visible lower down: the reddish gray strata alternate as
before with purplish gray slate.                   As we ascend and ap
proach the summits of the Coumeen Peest, or eastern ridge
of the Reeks, the strata assume a more decidedly red charac
ter, till at length they pass into brick or cherry-red quartz
rock, and contain some beds of conglomerate, identical in
colour, composition, and structure with the old red sand
stone already described, situated to the north of the fault in
the Gap of Dunloe, but not quite so coarse-grained *. These
red quartzose or old red sandstone beds differ materially from
the schistose beds of the lower part of the series. The struc
ture of the rock is decidedly granular, the strata are thinner,
and they are divided by joints into rectangular masses, while
 the schistose beds beneath usually present rhomboidal forms.
    The conglomerate on the top of the Reeks is perfectly con
 formable with the underlying strata, and in fact a regular
 gradation may be traced from the lower or chloritic portion
 of the series through the gray and reddish gray into the brick
 red quartz rock and conglomerate.
     From the summit of the Reeks still proceeding in a southern
                                  ãº.
  direction towards the valley of Kenmare, we do not find these
  old red sandstone strata                    to the southward, as shown
  on Mr. Hamilton's section already mentioned, and published
  in the Journal of the Geological Society of Dublin, but on
  the contrary they crop out to the southward, forming a re
  gular cap resting conformably on the inferior strata, whose
  ends appear in the precipitous escarpment visible on the
  northern side of the valley of Coomyduff, in the bottom of
  which the green chloritic beds already described as occur
  ring near the fault in the Gap of Dunloe again make their
  appearance, and the whole succession of the strata and pass
  age from the green chloritic beds to the red conglomerate as
  already described on the northern acclivity of the Reeks, may
  likewise be traced on the southern.
      It is unnecessary to enter into any further particulars re
   specting the detail of the succession of the strata between the
   valley of Coomyduff, and the reappearance of the old red
   sandstone at Lisinisky, to the north of the valley of Kenmare,
   as it is clearly shown in the section, and the same gradation
   of colour and character, from the green to the red rocks, is
   observable. See Plate II. fig. 1.
   i.
      The old red sandstone of the valley of Kenmare consists of
     * The conglomerate visible near the summit of Lisbug mountain on the
            ranges of the Reeks, is fully as coarse-grained as that of the Gap of
     unloe.

166     Mr. Griffith, on  the Order of Succession of the Older
red quartz rock and red clay slate, the quartz rock predo
minating; but no beds of true conglomerate have been            ob
served, though such may be discovered on a more careful         ex
amination.
   Ascending in the series, and approaching the limestone of
the valley of Kenmare, the red strata become more schistose
and chiefly consist of coarse red clay slate, which, approach
ing the limestone, is observed to alternate with yellowish green
clay slate and red limestone in thin beds. These are suc
ceeded by strata of gray quartzose sandstone containing cala
 mites, the characteristic fossil of the yellow sandstone series,
 the upper beds of which alternate with greenish gray and
dark gray clay slate, with occasional beds of gray limestone.
 Still ascending, the limestone gradually predominates, till at
length the slate disappears, and the whole stratification is
 composed of carboniferous limestone.
    To the south of the river Roughty, in a descending order,
a similar series to that above described appears at the sur
face dipping to the north, so that we have again the dark
gray slate and limestone, the yellow sandstone with calamites,
the red limestone, the old red sandstone consisting of red
slate and red quartz rock, and in continuation the whole
suite of the schistose strata of the transition series already de
scribed.
   Having described this section in detail, I again assert, that
the old red sandstone to the south of Castlemaine Bay has
been deposited conformably, on the underlying strata, and
 that the apparent unconformability noticed by Mr. Hamil
ton as occurring in the Gap of Dunloe, arises from a disloca
tion of the strata occasioned by a fault, and not from original
deposition.
   Owing to the want of fossils throughout the entire succes
sion of rocks above described, with the exception of the yel
low sandstone and carboniferous limestone of the valley of
 Kenmare, it is difficult to determine the position in geological
precedence which should be allotted to the green chloritic
quartz rock which forms the basis of the district under con
sideration, or to determine at what precise point the old red
sandstone should be said to commence. It appears to me
that the only key which is likely to unravel this mystery, will
be found in the peninsula of Dingle, to the north of Castle
maine Bay, where fossils have been discovered in the strata,
which have been recognised by Mr. James Sowerby as be
longing to the upper Silurian rocks of Murchison.
     The fossils consist of

                Stratified             Rocks near Killarney and Dublin.                                                        167

168        Mr. Griffith,    on the Order            of Succession of the Older
shire; and I am led to conclude, that the whole of the transi
tion slate of the south of Ireland is high in the series generally,
and that the principal part belongs to the Silurian system.
   Our next point for consideration with regard to the di
 strict of Kerry, south of Castlemaine Bay, will be to deter
mine where, in the graduating series between the chloritic
quartz rocks and the decided red conglomerate, we should
draw the line separating the Silurian system from the old
red sandstone.      If we again refer to Dingle peninsula, we
find that the summit of Cahirconree mountain, together with
many other mountains              of the district, is composed of rocks be
longing to the old red sandstone, which rest unconformably on
the dark gray clay slate above-mentioned, and on the other
schistose rocks which succeed      From this unconformability,
                                              it.
itwould   appear  that the series                   of
                                     the schistose strata   not                           is
complete      the peninsula
                  in            Dingle, and that
                                         of          wants the                 it
 upper members which               do

                                              the south       Castlemaine of
 Bay.      If
            we examine the old red sandstone series              exhibited      as
in   the Dingle district, we find that the under beds consist                                  of
 rather fine-grained, red quartzose sandstone, for               thickness      a
 varying from 100             to
                          150 feet            in
                                         different  localities;  the sand

the siliceous rock forms            by
                              much the most important feature    the series.          in

  170    Mr. Griffith,    on the Order    of Succession of the Older
 beds accumulate, the calcareous strata increase in thickness,
 and at length near the old copper mine of Muckross, the slate
 beds entirely disappear, and the entire stratification              con
sists of limestone, some beds of which are fossiliferous, and
contain Producta depressa, variety of the mountain limestone
 Spirifera bisulcata, Spirifera resupinata, and many of the other
 fossils which usually occur in the lower limestone.
    From Muckross mine the calcareous strata continue with
 out interruption, dipping to the south at an angle of 40°, to
 the base of Turk mountain, a quarter of a mile to the east of
 Turk cottage, and are still visible at the surface close to the
line of the eastern continuation of the fault which is there con
 cealed from view by diluvial matter.
    I have been thus particular in describing the strata visible
 on the north side of the fault at Brickeen Island and Muck
ross, as they present one of the most perfect sections which
 Ireland affords of the entire suite of the old red sandstone,
the yellow sandstone, the carboniferous slate, and the lower
carboniferous limestone, and which by their variety form a
strong contrast with the uniform character of the chloritic
             ...
quartzose strata visible on the south side of the fault, which
strata evidently belong to the same series as those which oc
cur in a               position at the Gap of Dunloe, and are in
fact a continuation of the same strike. No doubt can there
fore be entertained that these inferior strata form the lower
portion of the schistose series of the district to the south of
Castlemaine Bay, that they are identical with the chloritic
rocks of the Gap of Dunloe, and do not belong to the De
vonian as supposed by Mr. Hamilton *.
    Proceeding to the southward from Turk mountain, the suc
cession of rocks is similar to that already described as occur
ring above the chloritic beds of Dunloe : the strata undulate
very much, and present several synclinal and anticlinal axes,
so that the upper beds or reddish gray quartzose strata never
appear on Turk or Mangerton mountains, and consequently
in this line we do not meet with the old red sandstone strata
till we approach the northern boundary of the valley of Ken
mare, where it occurs in a line parallel to that already noticed
in describing the section between the Gap of Dunloe and the
valley of Kenmare.          It is true, Mr. Hamilton mentions the
occurrence of old red sandstone in the centre of Mangerton
mountain, but in that locality he may have mistaken the pur
   * A section similar to that from the Gap of Dunloe to the summit of the
Reeks may likewise be traced from the chloritic rocks, south of the fault
at Brickeen Island, up to the old red sandstone on the summit of Glena
mountain, as represented in Plate III. fig. 2.

            Stratified Rocks near Killarney and Dublin.                                         171
ple slate which there alternates with the chloritic quartz for
that rock.
  It appears to me to be extraordinary, that when arriving at
the conclusion that the chloritic rocks of Turk and Manger
ton mountains were newer than the old red sandstone, owing
to the observed dip to the south both of the old red sand
stone and the chloritic rocks, Mr. Hamilton did not (with
Mr. Weaver) consider these chloritic rocks to be superior to
the carboniferous limestone of Muckross and Turk. The
limestone beds     dip   the south towards the fault, and ap
                       all             to
parently underlie the chloritic rocks; and    the limestone                    as
strata rest upon the yellow and red sandstone, the natural
conclusion should have been, that the whole    the strata                      of                   to
the south    of
             the lakes    Killarney   of
                                    belonged   the millstone                    to
grit, which we find resting                       on
                                  the same limestone      the north                     to
of the lakes. Mr. Weaver        carefully observed      these dips;                 all
and not having noticed the fault         unconformity   orthe strike                    of
of the old red and limestone series on its north side with the
chloritic rocks            on
                      the south, and conceiving that the lime
stone   together  with the old red sandstone belonged            the                           to
transition  series,         he
                       naturally concluded that the chloritic rock
 to the south belonged         the same; but Mr. Hamilton has
                                             to
overlooked the southern dip           the limestone    ofthe north                  at

                    the carboniferous   limestone,    the banks                                     of
 the River Roughty    the Valley Kenmare.”
                                 in                         of
  I   wish Mr. Hamilton had mentioned the other instances
 that came within his knowledge  well   this,     have      as            as              as
                                                                                          I         no
 doubt I  should have been equally well able      show that the                 to
 boundaries marked were founded on actual observation.
      In
       the present case shall merely observe, that   Kilgawan,                          at
  on                             of I
     the north side     the valley   Kenmare,   above Roughty

 Bridge, yellow sandstone occurs       considerable thickness,  in
 overlying red quartz rock, green and red clay slate, and red

172    Mr. Griffith,     on the Order        of Succession of the Older
limestone, and underlying black carboniferous slate, inter
stratified with thin beds of limestone, which is ultimately
succeeded by limestone without admixture; the whole of the
strata dipping to the south. Again, on the south side of the
river Roughty, immediately to the east of Roughty Bridge,
a similar succession of strata is observed dipping to the north.
In this locality, the yellow sandstone contains that variety of                            .
calamite which is characteristic of the rock, and which is also
abundant at Brickeen Island, near Killarney, and in the same
geological position, underlying the limestone of the several
troughs of the counties of Waterford and Cork.               In the car
boniferous slate of      Roughty     Bridge,   Retepora   membranacea
was observed.       I shall mention one other locality in which
the strata in connexion with the yellow sandstone have been
observed in the valley of the river Roughty, namely, at the
pier at Kenmare. At low water in this place, gray quartz rock
and black carboniferous slate may be observed dipping to the
north under the lower beds of the carboniferous limestone,
which are exposed to view in an adjoining quarry.                 Imme
diately to the south of this quartz rock and slate, no rocks
are visible, the strata being concealed by sand; but in a very
short distance, beds of yellowish green slate, alternating with
red slate and red limestone, occur which are identical with
the strata visible in the localities already mentioned under
lying the yellow sandstone: no doubt can therefore be enter
tained that this rock is continuous on the south side of the
valley from Kenmare pier to Roughty Bridge.                It is true, in
this  locality, as well   as in  most  others,   that the yellow   sand
stone has not been seen at the surface          throughout    the entire
length of the carboniferous limestone trough,                  owingas,               to
a   thick  covering     ofdiluvial   matter,        or   of
                                                      bog,  the   precise
boundary between the base               of
                                       the limestone series and the
old red sandstone rocks            rarely visible; but
                                   is                           the yel as
low sandstone and dark gray carboniferous slate                    occur     do
in   every place where the outer boundary                     of
                                                         the limestone
series  is  exposed     toview, feel little doubt that these rocks
                                  I
equally occur   in those positions where they are concealed from
our view.    If  geologists   were only       mark the limits
                                              to                    their     of
rock districts     inthe  precise   localities     whichin the  contacts
are visible,  no  geological map could             be

     I shall next very shortly allude to another point brought
forward by Mr. Hamilton in his paper.                  In speaking of the
district coloured old red sandstone on                my   large geological
...
map which occupies extensive tracts in the counties of Water
ford and Cork, he observes, “As to classification, it appears
to me that Mr. Griffith has thrown together two rocks which
                                                                                                                   in its

geological position with the upper part              the Devonian series,of
                        to by
as  described       Professor      Sedgwick   and Mr. Murchison.”
     Itappears      me that Mr. Hamilton              mistaken        separa

fessor   Sedgwick    and Mr. Murchison include the whole series
under the general term Devonian: consequently, whether we
apply the term Devonian,             old red sandstone,
                                                or               the system,                  to

it they occur       abundance, and the upper beds which alter
                        in

undoubtedly belong               the carboniferous limestone, though

XXXI.      On Haydenite and Couzeranite.   By H. J. BRooke,
                         Esq., F.R.S.*
   N the last Number of the Phil. Mag. p. 156, I observed a
     notice of a new mineral (Beaumontite) which M. Levy has
found accompanying Haydenite, a mineral that is said to
occur near Baltimore in the United States; and M. Levy
remarks that I have classed Haydenite with Heulandite
without assigning any reason for so doing.
   I did so from perceiving that the small and brilliant yel
lowish crystals on the specimen               I
                                        examined resembled Heu
landite, in having a nacreous plane in only one direction, cor
responding with the P of W. Phillips (Mineralogy, p. 39.
 Ed. 1823); in the form, as far as I could distinguish it in
the minute and closely aggregated condition of the crystals;
 and in the near agreement, about 1 12°, of the angle between
the nacreous plane and a plane appearing to correspond with
 the a of W. Phillips.
     M. Levy is doubtless aware of a variety of Heulandite
 found at Arendal, of a brown or yellowish brown colour,
 in small bright crystals, and accompanied by stilbite in glo
 bularly-radiated concretions of a dull yellowish colour.        The
 specimen sent to me from America as Haydenite has a similar
 accompaniment of stilbite of the same description, and this
 circumstance tended to confirm my impression that Hay
 denite was Heulandite. It is probable, therefore, that the
 specimen sent to me from America as Haydenite, is really
 not that mineral, and I do not find anything like M. Levy’s
 Beaumontite upon
 brilliant, and     of
                         it,

XXXII.       Observations  on the relative Temperature of the
    Sea and Air, and on other Phaenomena, made during a Voyage
    from England to India. By the Rev.       H. PRATT, M.A.,       J.
    Member of the Asiatic Society              of    Bengal.
    To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
I SEND       you the accompanying observations on the relative
    temperature of the sea and the superincumbent air made
at various latitudes and longitudes on a voyage from England
to India, in case you should deem them of sufficient import
ance to give them a place in your valuable Magazine.
     Iregret that they do not extend through the whole voyage.
It was not till after passing the Cape that recorded any                 I
observations.     I was anxious to see what effect the Mozam
bique Channel had upon the currents; and after that               con                       I
tinued   my  observations   up  to the Bay  of  Bengal.
     Ihave also given the result of a few observations on the
velocity of the waves of a swell in unfathomable water.
   Once or twice I attempted to ascertain the temperature
of the sea water at a considerable depth, such as 40 and
 100 fathoms.     The method I adopted was this: I sunk a
quart bottle, full of sea-water and well-corked, by means of
a line, and allowed it to remain a considerable time (as an
hour or more), that the water within the bottle might attain
the temperature of the surrounding water by conduction.               I
then drew it up with great rapidity (perhaps in 14 minute),
instantly uncorked the bottle, and tried the temperature.
 When I poured the water into a glass it would change                                           its
temperature very little          in   5   or    10
                                         minutes;        felt assured        so
                                                                             I

that                      could   have  taken                 passage         in

                                 I      have   made   more       these                    of
observations, but the utter impracticability         sinking    bottle  of                a
well, except        dead calm, prevented this.

            Researches       in the Undulatory Theory of Light.                                 181
   I made     the following experiment on the velocity of waves
out at sea. Lat. 27° 2' S. Long. 27° 25' W.
    There was a swell on the sea moving from fore aft; wind only
sufficient to carry the vessel (all sails set) steadily two or three
miles an hour. Two large floats were connected by a line
forty fathoms in length, the line itself being supported on the
surface of the water by smaller floats. This apparatus was
towed astern by a long line connected with one of the large
floats by one end, the other end being wound round a reel.
    The chief officer watched the chronometer; the second
officer held the reel fixed; and I observed the large floats.
    A few seconds before the first float was raised to greatest                    its
height      by agiven wave,    gaveI    signal    the second officer

to  let the reel   run,  and immediately    the floats became sta
tionary     inthe water.
    At the instant the first float, and also the instant the se   at
cond float, was raised             greatest height
                                   to   its              the wave            by                 al

 who marked the interval         time between the signals.

  A    very good average            of
                                many trials gave      trifle less than   a
 six seconds of time for the motion of the wave from float                                       to
 float, i.e., over forty fathoms. This gives nearly 274 statute
 miles an hour.

   We shall now proceed with the investigation, in order                                                               to
compare the theory with experiment a little further.

we have, by (8),
                                  s     = Xp u +                     V-1.            Xp u',

phaenomena       of the light and heat developed; or whether we
 adopt the gross conception of the passage of a fluid; still it is

 current of electricity, without undergoing electrolyzation.             To

 wires soldered       their extremities, were inserted
                      to                                        barometer        in

no such action could take place, the platinum poles being
placed in separate cups filled with water".
   The accuracy, then of Mr. Becquerel's experiments having
been fully established, the question arises, how are we to
reconcile them with other well-known contradictory facts?
such as for instance those of Sir H. Davyt, solid potash
and sulphuric acid combining in an isolated platinum cruci
ble, and causing no electrical development. Again, a plate
of copper and of sulphur, when heated, have their elec
trical states increased until chemical action begins, when they
Cease.
   The simplest and clearest course, and that most reconcile
able with the laws of statical electricity, seems to me to be:—
to consider that no electrical development is caused by the
union of an alkali with an acid, (the electricity being thereby
disguised,) but that, at the instant before the union takes place,
the particles of the alkali and of the acid, being in opposite
electrical states, affect their surrounding particles by induc
tion, causing thereby a feeble current of electricity to circulate
from the acid through the galvanometer to the alkali, which
supposition is borne out by the fact, that a dry acid and alkali,
when in contact, show opposite electrical states.
   The same arguments apply equally well with regard to
thermo-electricity.    The contact of two metals produces in
them   opposite electrical states.  Their chemical union in an
isolated vessel gives no electrical development; thus a “solid
amalgam of bismuth and lead become liquid when mixed
together, without producing any electrical effect<U+017F>.” Again,
 “a thin plate of zinc placed upon a surface of mercury, and
 separated by an insulating body, is found to be positive, the
 mercury negative; but when kept together a sufficiently long
time to amalgamate, the compound gives no signs of elec
tricityt.”
   These experiments explain why the contact of the two ex
tremities of metallic wires, constituting a closed circuit, should,
as the potash and nitric acid just mentioned, produce an in
duced electric current.   That the electric states of different
metals in contact, when excited by heat, do not follow the law
of their natural electrical states, and change on increase of
temperature, is no argument against the explanation I have
given, for upon what this change in the electrical excitation
   * He might have added another experiment, free from  all objections—
namely, the increased intensity consequent upon  an increased number of
alternations of acid and alkali.

produced by heat depends, whether upon a peculiar arrange
ment of the crystalline parts of the metal, or of their compound
elementary particles, we are as yet perfectly ignorant.
    That the same general law of the contact of metals and of
fluids applies equally (although in an inferior degree, owing
to their want of conducting power) to the contact of the gases,
may be shown by the experiment of Dr. Faraday (Sixth Se
ries) of the union of hydrogen and oxygen by a plate of pla
tinum; the electrical force, which circulates by the interposed
platinum plate, facilitating the union of the two gases”.

Zinc, when placed in contact with a dry acid, has been found
to become positively electrified.          When the zinc plate has
been immersed in the acid       solution,   being positive, it attracts
                                                      in its
oxygen, by union with which              electrical state      disguised,             is
while the   hydrogen,     set free          highly    positive

state, reacts upon the oxide          zinc, rendering
                                                  of         negative by            it

194   Sir J. Herschel              on increasing the                light of an Argand Lamp
charcoal was made to pass through a cork inserted in one
end of the tube, the other platinum wire merely dipped into
the fused fluoride.     On connecting the wires with the battery,
strong electrolytic action commenced, bubbles of gas were
evolved rapidly at the surface of the charcoal, which, on ar
riving at the surface of the fused fluoride of lead, acted                                           in
stantly upon the glass. The litmus paper was not bleached,
nor the gold-leaf or platinum wire acted upon. Whether
fluorine would act upon perfectly dry cold glass remains to
be proved.
   Conclusion.—Fluorine       then, when obtained in an insu
lated  state, is a colourless gas, possessing properties analogous
in    all
        respects     those    chlorine; having, like

four long upright hooks, in which the lower end of the chimney
rests; or still better if the lamp be so originally constructed
as to sustain the chimney at the required elevation without
such addition, by thin laminae of brass or iron, having their
planes directed to the axis of the wick.
   The proper elevation is best determined by trial; and as
the limits within which it is confined are very narrow, it would
be best secured by a screw motion applied to the socket on
which the laminae above mentioned are fixed, by which they
and the chimney may be elevated or depressed at pleasure,
without at the same time raising or lowering the wick.                         Ap
proximately it may be done in an instant, and the experiment is
not a little striking and instructive. Take a common Argand
lamp, and alternately raise and depress the chimney vertically
from the level where it usually rests, to about as far above
the wick, with a moderately quick but steady motion.          It
will be immediately perceived that a vast difference in the
amount of light subsists in the different positions of the
chimney, but that a very marked and sudden maximum oc
curs at or near the elevation designated in the commence
ment of this letter: so marked indeed as almost to have the
effect of a flash if the motion be quick, or a sudden blaze
as if the wick-screw had been raised a turn.     The flame con
tracts somewhat in diameter, lengthens, ceases to give off
smoke, and attains a dazzling intensity.
    With this great increase of light there is certainly not a
correspondingly increased consumption of oil. At least the
servant who trims my lamp reports that a lamp so fitted con
sumes very little if any more               oil
                                     than one exactly similar                       on
 the common plan.

puscles of the Mouse (13.) are bigger than those of the Horse
(34.), and there is generally no relation between the size of
                               blood particles, yet they are larger

statement, therefore, formerly made (13.) is withdrawn for the
present; and I hope soon to be able to give the result of ano
                                                    I
ther inquiry on the subject. In the mean time may mention
that in the foetal Guinea pig at the full period of uterogestation
the corpuscles corresponded in size with those of the mother;
and in a human foetus at the fifth or sixth month they were
smaller than in the adult.
    116. Mona Monkey, (Cercopithecus Mona,) a male about
a third grown. Most frequent sizes of corpuscles 1-3554th
and 1-3428th.      Extreme diameters, 1-5333rd and 1-2900th.
Blood from the left coronary vein as well as from the different
cavities of the heart.   In the blood of the inferior cava vein
the  corpuscles   were more variable in size, the extremes being
 1-4800th and 1-2400th, with most numerous intermediate
gradations.
   117. Sooty Monkey, (Cercopithecus fuliginosus), a female
about half-grown. All the following diameters very frequent,
1-3600th, 1-3428th, 1-3368th, and 1-3200th.          Extreme sizes
 1-5333rd and 1-3000th.      Blood from the left ventricle of the
heart.
    118. Patas or Red Monkey, (Cercopithecus ruber,) a female,
nearly full-grown. The disks most commonly 1-3330th of
an inch in diameter; extreme sizes, 1-4000th and 1-3000th.
Blood from the pulmonary artery and vein, a few hours after
death.
    119. Crown Monkey, (Cercopithecus pileatus,) a male about
two-thirds grown.      The following the most common sizes:
 1-3635th, 1-3600th, and 1-3423rd.            Extreme diameters,
1-4800th and 1-2900th.        Blood from a prick of the fore
hand.
    120. Vervet Monkey, (Cercopithecus pygerythrus,) an adult
male, 1-3309th, 1-3429th, and 1-3552nd common sizes; ex
treme diameters 1-4000th and 1-2900th of an inch.            Blood
from a wound at the end of the tail.
    121. Dog-faced Baboon, (Cynocephalus anubis?) a female
about half-grown. The dried corpuscles 1-3600th, 1-3530th
and 1-3428th generally; extreme diameters 1-4000th, and
 1-3000th.    In the serum there were several disks exactly of
the same magnitude, besides many of smaller size, viz. about
 1-5333rd of an inch in diameter.
    The blood was procured from a wound of the tail, and ex
 amined in less than two hours afterwards.        The shrinking of
 some of the corpuscles in their own serum is well exemplified.
 In another dog-faced Baboon (1) the corpuscles were a little
 larger; but as in that instance the blood was obtained from

198       Mr. Gulliver's   Observations      on the       Blood Corpuscles
the animal a day or two after death, the variation is within
the limits that may occur in the same species.
   122. Black-backed Papio, or Indian Ape, (Papio mela
notus,) a male. Common diameter of corpuscles 1-3432nd of
an inch; extreme sizes 1-4570th and 1-2666th.     Blood from
the axillary vein after death.
                                                           -
   123. Wanderoo Monkey, (Papio silenus,) a full-grown male.
Frequent sizes of corpuscles 1-3600th, 1-3552nd, and 1-3270th
of an inch.     Extreme diameters 1-4570th and 1-2666th.
Blood from the left ventricle of the heart.
   124.  Chameck Spider Monkey, (Ateles subpentadactylus,) a
female about two-thirds grown.      The following diameters
most  frequent: 1-3790th, 1-3600th,  and 1-3429th of an inch.
Extreme sizes 1-4920th and 1-2900th.      Blood from a prick
of the fore hand.
   125. Black Spider Monkey, (Ateles ater,) an adult male.
All the following sizes very common: 1-3429th, 1-3528th,
1-3555th, 1-3600th, 1-3693rd and 1-3792nd.      Extreme dia
meters 1-4555th and 1-3000th.     Blood from a prick of the
fore hand.
   126. Weeper Monkey, (Cebus apella,) a female nearly full
grown. 1-3600th, 1-3554th, 1-3429th, and 1-3368th; most
common sizes.     Extreme diameters 1-4800th and 1-2666th
of an inch. Blood from a prick of the fore hand.
   The measurements slightly smaller than afforded by the cor
puscles of C. capucinus (5.), but as the blood was procured
from a dead specimen of the latter, the discrepancy is not
greater than may be often observed under similar circum
stances in one species.
   127. Squirrel Monkey,            (Callithrir    sciureus,)
                                                   a male about
two-thirds grown.          The following         very frequent:
                                                  sizes    all
1-3790th, 1-3693rd, 1-3600th, and 1-3552nd.        Extreme dia
meters, 1-4800th and 1-3200th. Blood from prick          the nose.

   The blood the Toque Monkey (81.) was obtained from the
                of

           a                                                                 a
wound     the tail,   of healthy full-grown male afforded the
                           a
following measurements, viz, dry, 1-3764th, 1-3600th, and
1-3552nd.      the serum many disks

   129. Grisly Bear, (Ursus feror,) a female about half
grown.    Most common diameters 1-3340th and 1-3552nd
of an inch. Extreme sizes 1-4570th and 1-3000th. Blood
from a prick of the nose.
     130.Badger, (Meles vulgaris,) an old male. All the fol
lowing sizes very common: 1-4128th, 1-4000th, 1-3973rd,
1-3810th, and 1-3693rd.       Extreme diameters 1-5333rd and
1-3200th of an inch.      There were besides some of the very
small circular particles as in the genus Sciurus.   Blood from
the integuments of the thigh.
   131. Common Jackal, (Canis aureus,) an old male.         The
corpuscles, dried quickly, afforded the following measure
ments: 1-4000th, 1-3764th, and 1-3840th most frequently,
the extreme sizes being 1-4800th and 1-3200th of an inch.
In the serum, examined within two hours after they were
obtained, 1-4800th was the most common diameter, and the
extreme sizes 1-6000th and 1-3200th.       Disks of the last, or
largest size, as well as of 1-3555th, were not unfrequent, ge
nerally collecting together quickly into rouleaux, from which
it was seen that the thickness of the edges of these corpuscles
was 1-14,000th of an inch.       The smaller particles, though
much more abundant, did not arrange themselves together
by their flat surfaces, and indeed could hardly be seen edge
Wise.
     The blood   was obtained freely from a puncture    in a vein
of the hind leg; and the above facts are merely mentioned
as exemplying the variations which may often be observed in
the corpuscles only a short time after the blood has been
removed, with every care, from various mammals.
    132. African Civet Cat, (Viverra civetta,) adult male.
1-4615th, 1-4360th, 1-4000th, and 1-3552nd of an inch all
frequently observed.     Extreme sizes 1-6000th and 1-3200th.
The corpuscles in this instance, therefore, very variable in
magnitude.      Blood from a prick of the tail.
   In another adult male, after death, the corpuscles were
also extremely variable in size, as the following were   allcom
mon, viz. 1-5383rd, 1-4760th, 1-4500th, 1-4412th, 1-4365th
and 1-4000th; the extreme measurements being 1-6000th
and 1-3200th of an inch.       Blood from the different cavities
of the heart, from the coronary veins, and from the portal vein.
   133. Javanese Ichneumon, (Herpestes Javanicus,)        a  full
grown male. All the following sizes common         :   1-4800th,
1-4924th, 1-5142nd, and 1-5120th.            Extreme diameters
 1-6000th and 1-4000th.      Blood from wound
                                        a          at the end of
the tail.

an adult male. 1-4173rd, 1-4000th, 1-3810th, and 1-3764th,
very common sizes. Small corpuscles 1-4800th; the large
1-3200th. Edges of disks 1-14,000th of an inch thick. Blood
from a vein of the hind leg.
   136.    Coendu or Ring-tailed Porcupine, (Synetheres pre

       of a                    in increasing the intensity of a
galvanic current, were submitted to the Society, the valuable
paper of Dr. Faraday, on the same subject, has been published,
and also various modifications of the principle have been made
by Sturgeon, Masson, Page, and others, to increase the ef
fects.   The spiral conductor has likewise been applied by
Cav. Antinori to produce a spark by the action of a thermo
electrical pile : and Mr. Watkins has succeeded in exhibiting
 allthe phaenomena      hydro-electricity

                    to Electricity and Magnetism.                    201
searches of Dr. Faraday, yet I am happy to state that the
results obtained by this distinguished philosopher are not at
variance with those given in my paper.
     2.  I  now offer to the Society a new series of investigations
in the same line, which          I hope may also be considered of
sufficient importance to merit a place in the Transactions.
     3. The primary object of these investigations was to dis
cover, if possible, inductive actions in common electricity
analogous to those found in galvanism.              For this purpose
a series of       experiments    was commenced in the spring            of
 1836, but       I was at that time diverted, in part, from the im
 mediate object of my research, by a new investigation of
 the phaenomenon known in common electricity by the name
 of the lateral discharge. Circumstances prevented my doing
 anything further, in the way of experiment, until April last,
 when most of the results which I now offer to the Society were
 obtained.        The investigations are not as complete, in several
 points, as I could wish, but as my duties will not permit me
 to resume the subject for some months to come, I therefore
 present them as they are; knowing, from the interest excited
 by this branch of science in every part of the world, that the
 errors which may exist will soon be detected, and the truths
 be further developed.
      4. The experiments are given nearly in the order in which
  they were made; and in general they are accompanied by the
  reflections which led to the several steps of the investigation.
 The whole series is divided, for convenience of arrangement,
  into six sections, although the subject may be considered as
 consisting, principally, of two parts; the first relating to a
  new examination of the induction of galvanic currents; and

  ments, consist of a number of flat coils of copper riband, which
   will be designated by the names of coil No. 1, coil No. 2,
  &c.; also of several coils of long wire; and these, to distin-,
  guish them from the ribands, will be called helix No. 1, he

  one inch and a half wide and ninety-three feet long.                It is
  well covered with two coatings of silk, and was generally used
  in the form represented in fig. 1, which is that of a flat spiral
   sixteen inches in diameter.       It was however sometimes formed

204                 Prof.    J.   Henry's Contributions
more definitely the conditions which influence the action of
the spiral conductor.
    15. When the electricity is of low intensity, as in the case
of the thermo-electrical pile, or a large single battery weakly
excited with dilute acid, the flat riband coil No. 1, ninety
three feet long, is found to give the most brilliant deflagra
tions, and the loudest snaps from a surface of mercury.               The
shocks, with this arrangement, are, however, very feeble, and
can only be felt in the fingers or through the tongue.
    16. The induced current in a short coil, which thus pro
duces deflagration, but not shocks, may, for distinction,      -
                                                                         be
called one of quantity.
    17. When the length of the coil is increased, the battery
continuing the same, the deflagrating power decreases, while
the intensity of the shock continually increases. With five
riband coils, making an aggregate-length of three hundred
feet, and the small battery, fig. 1, the deflagration is less than
with coil No. 1, but the shocks are more intense.
    18. There     is, however,     limit
                                     a        this increase
                                                         to      intensity of
of   the shock, and this takes place when the increased resist
ance    or  diminished conduction           the lengthened coil begins

 coil  ofcopper wire Tºth          of         andiameter, was increased
             by

                                                                 or

 and   seventy-five   feet was  obtained,     when the shocks also be

 scarcely any peculiar effect can              observed, when the coil
                                                         be

 then the inductive influence becomes apparent.                 When the
 current, from ten plates          the above-mentioned trough, was
 passed through the wire           be of of
                                  the large spool (10.), the induced
 shock was too severe         to  taken through the body. Again,
 when   a   small   trough        of
                                 twenty-five      one-inch plates, which
 alone would give but        avery feeble shock, was used with helix
 No.   1,  an intense shock was received from the induction
 when the contact was broken.             Also      slight shock a     this      in

                   to Electricity and Magnetism.                                                      205
arrangement is given when the contact is formed, but it is
very feeble in comparison with the other.                The spark, how
ever, with the long wire and compound battery is not as bril
liant as with the single battery and the short riband coil.
     20. When the shock is produced from a long wire, as in
the last experiments, the size of the plates of the battery may
be very much reduced, without a corresponding reduction
of the intensity of the shock. This is shown in an experi
ment with the large spool of wire (10.).                A very small com
pound battery was formed of six pieces of copper bell wire,
about one inch and a half long, and an equal number of
pieces of zinc of the same size.            When the current from this
was passed through the five miles of the wire of the spool,
 the induced shock was given at once to twenty-six persons
joining hands. This astonishing effect placed the action of
 a coil in a striking point of view.
      21. With the same spool and the single battery used in the
 former experiments, no shock, or at most a very feeble one,
 could be obtained.          A current, however, was found to pass
 through the whole length, by                   its
                                            action                     on

      23. The form of the coil has considerable influence on the
  intensity   of  the action.             In

    Section    II.- Conditions      which influence the production of
                           Secondary Currents.
     26. The secondary currents, as it is well known, were                dis
  covered in the induction of magnetism and electricity, by Dr.
   Faraday, in 1831.      But he was at that time urged to the            ex
  ploration of new, and apparently richer veins of science, and
  left this branch to be traced by others. Since then, however,
  attention has been almost exclusively directed to one part of
  the subject, namely, the induction from magnetism, and the
  perfection of the magneto-electrical machine. And I know of
  no attempts, except my own, to review and extend the purely
  electrical part of Dr. Faraday's admirable discovery.
     27. The energetic action of the flat coil, in producing the
 induction of a current on itself, led me to conclude that it
 would also be the most proper means for the exhibition and
 study of the phaenomena of the secondary galvanic currents.
     28. For this purpose coil No. 1 was arranged to receive
 the current from the small battery, and coil No. 2 placed on
 this, with a plate of glass interposed to ensure perfect insula
 tion; as often as the circuit of No. 1 was interrupted, a
                                   Fig.  3.

                                  Shock.
                                          and c, d, handles for receiving the
 powerful secondary current was induced in No. 2. The                     ar
 rangement is the same as that exhibited in fig. 3, with the
 exception that in this the compound helix is represented as
 receiving the induction, instead of coil No. 2.
     29. When the ends of the second coil were rubbed to
gether, a spark was produced at the opening.                     When the
same ends were       joined   by   the   magnetizing      spiral (11.), the
enclosed needle became          strongly    magnetic.      Also when the
secondary current was passed through the wires of the iron
horseshoe (12.), magnetism was developed; and when the
ends of the second coil were attached to a small decomposing
apparatus, of the kind which accompanies the magneto-elec
trical machine, a stream of gas was given off at each pole.
The shock, however, from this coil is very feeble, and can
scarcely be felt above the fingers,

                       to Electricity and Magnetism.                  207
   30. This current has therefore the properties of one of mo
derate intensity, but considerable quantity.
   31. Coil No. 1 remaining as before, a longer coil, formed
by uniting Nos. 3, 4 and 5, was substituted for No. 2.    With
this  arrangement,   the spark produced   when the ends were
rubbed together, was not as brilliant as before; the mag
netizing power was much less; decomposition was nearly the
same, but the shocks were more powerful, or, in other words,
the intensity of the induced current was increased by an                  in
crease of the length of the coil, while the quantity was ap
parently decreased.
   32. A compound helix, formed by uniting Nos. 1 and 2,
and therefore containing two thousand six hundred and fifty
yards of wire, was next placed on coil No. 1. The weight
of this helix happened to be precisely the same as that of coil
No. 2. and hence the different effects of the same quantity of
metal in the two forms of a long and short conductor, could
be compared. With this arrangement the magnetizing effects,
with the apparatus before mentioned, disappeared.          The
sparks were much smaller, and also the decomposition less,
 than with the short coil; but the shock was almost too                   in
 tense to be received with impunity, except through the fingers
of one hand.        A circuit of fifty-six of the students of the
senior   class,  received it at once from a single rupture of the
battery current, as if from the discharge of a Leyden jar
weakly charged. The secondary current in this case was one
of small quantity, but of great intensity.
    33. The following experiment is important in establishing
the fact of a limit to the increase of the intensity of the shock, as
well as the power of decomposition, with a wire of a given
diameter. Helix No. 5, which consists of wire only rhyth of
                                             p.
an inch in diameter, was placed on coil No. 2, and             its
                                                               length
increased    to   about seven hundred    yards.    With this extent
 of  wire, neither decomposition nor magnetism could               obbe
tained, but shocks were given          of
                                        a           pungent nature;
 they did not however produce much muscular action.               The
 wire of the helix was further increased         about fifteen hun
                                                  to to
 dred yards; the shock was now found              bescarcely percep
 tiblein   the fingers.
    34. As   a  counterpart     the last experiment, coil No. was
                                  to                                 1

 great spool      of
                  wire (11.),  and with the whole     length    this of
 (which,   ashas before been stated,      five miles) the shock was

 we therefore see from this experiment, that by increasing the
 diameter of the wire,     length may alsoits much increased,                 be

 succeeding experiments will show that this               not necessarily        is
 the case.
    38. All the experiments given                          in

                                                              articles,       of                       as
before.
    39. First, helices No.          and    were united into one, and
                                                       3

placed within helix No.            which still conducted the battery
current.      With this disposition       secondary current was pro
                                                       a
duced, which gave intense shocks but feeble decomposition,
and     no  magnetism            in
                            the soft iron horseshoe.          was there                It

                     to Electricity and Magnetism.              209
fore one of intensity, and was induced by a battery current
also of intensity.
     40. Instead of the helix used in the last experiment for
receiving the induction, one of the coils (No. 3) was now
placed on helix No. 1, the battery remaining as before. With
this arrangement the induced current gave no shocks, but it
magnetized the small horseshoe; and when the ends of the
coil    were rubbed together, produced bright sparks.       It had
therefore the properties of a current of quantity; and it was
produced by the induction of a current, from the battery, of
intensity.
     41. This experiment was considered of so much importance,
that it was varied and repeated many times, but always with
the same result; it therefore establishes the fact that an in
tensity current can induce one of quantity, and by the prece
ding experiments, the converse has also been shown, that a
quantity current can induce one of intensity.
     42. This fact appears to have an important bearing on the
 law of the inductive action, and would seem to favour the
 supposition that the lower coil, in the two experiments with
 the long and short secondary conductors, exerted the same
 amount of inductive force, and that in one case this was ex
 pended (to use the language of theory) in giving a great velo
  city to a small quantity of the fluid, and in the other in pro
 ducing a slower motion in a larger current; but in the two
  cases, were it not for the increased resistance to conduction in
  the longer wire, the quantity multiplied by the velocity would
  be the same. This, however, is as yet a hypothesis, but it en
  ables us to conceive how intensity and quantity may both be
  produced from the same induction.
     43. From some of the foregoing experiments we may con
  clude, that the quantity of electricity in motion in the helix
  is really less than in the coil, of the same weight of metal;
  but this may possibly be owing simply to the greater resist
  ance offered by the longer wire.      It would also appear, if
  the above    reasoning  be  correct, that to produce the most
  energetic physiological effects, only a small quantity of elec
  tricity, moving with great velocity, is necessary.
     44. In this and the preceding section,   I have attempted to
  give only the general conditions which influence the galvanic
  induction.    To establish the law would require a great num
  ber of more refined experiments, and the consideration of
  several circumstances which would affect the results, such as
  the conduction of the wires, the constant state of the battery,
  the method of breaking the circuit with perfect regularity,

drops should be collected, and purified     by being distilled

quantity of hydruret of salicyle ensues.

to the   air, but when wet it absorbs oxygen, becomes covered
with numerous green spots, which ultimately turn black; the

of a peculiar acid which it contains.

by salts of lead, silver, mercury, manganese, and barium.
 Salicide of ammonium is procured by mixing liquid ammonia
with the hydruret of salicyle, in the same manner as the cor
responding salt of potassium. It crystallizes in yellow needles,

acid closely resembles the benzoic; it       is scarcely soluble in
cold  water, readily soluble in hot   water, as well as in alcohol
and aether.    By  heat it sublimes with  great   facility.    Mixed
with alkaline   carbonates,  salicic acid decomposes      them, dri
ving off carbonic acid, and forming a series of salts. Digested
with sulphuric acid, the new acid undergoes no obvious
change until the mixture is heated, and then the whole turns
black. Nitric acid does not affect salicic acid in the cold; on
applying heat, however, violent and tumultuous action ensues,
dense red fumes are evolved, and a yellow solution is obtained;
this, by repose, deposits minute yellow bitter crystals, which
appear to be identical with the nitro-salicide obtained by the
action of nitric acid on hydruret of salicyle.
   Salicic acid contains an atom of combined water, which it
loses when it combines with bases; hence the crystallized
acid is a salicate of water, or (14 C, 5 H, 5 O, H-HO).

    The aqueous solution obtained by washing the decomposed
salicide of potassium, during the separation of melanic acid,
was submitted to examination, and after evaporating it to a
small bulk, mixing it with sulphuric acid, and submitting it
to distillation, acetic acid was obtained, whilst sulphate of
potass was left in the retort.
    From these experiments, it appears, that salicide of potas
sium, when moistened and exposed to the air, or to an atmo
sphere of oxygen gas, is resolved into melanic acid and acetate
of potass; and for every atom of salicide of potassium decom
posed, an equivalent of acetate of potassa is produced.                   For
this decomposition to be understood, we must admit that
three atoms of oxygen and the elements of two atoms of
water, are appropriated by each equivalent of the salicide of
potassium, thus

  When salicin is immersed in strong      sulphuric acid it as
sumes a blood-red tint; but when digested at a boiling tem
perature in the acid previously moderately diluted with water,
the salicin dissolves, forming a colourless solution.   If a so
lution thus prepared, be poured into cold water, a white pre
cipitate falls down of a resinoid character.      This substance
is turned red    by sulphuric  acid;  like the unchanged   salicin,
it readily dissolves in alkaline fluids.   Submitted to ultimate
analysis, this new substance, which from
                                                                   ofits

XXXIX.         Letter to Richard Taylor, Esq., as Editor of the
   Philosophical Magazine and Journal. By R. Potter, Esq.,
   B.A., F.C.P.S.
   DEAR SIR,
          part you have taken in the controversy between Pro
THEfessor     Forbes and myself has a good deal surprised me.
 That you should deprecate “personal imputations” in con
troversial papers, is what every reader of your periodical must
heartily approve.      However searching a review of Professor
 Forbes's “memorandum” was required for the defence of
my own investigations,       I  congratulate myself on having
 avoided personalities or any inputation of unworthy motives.
 It is a philosophical and legitimate line of defence to inquire
 whether your opponent is a competent judge of the matter
in controversy, from the consideration he has given to the
subject, and whether he is to be considered in the light of an
 impartial and unbiassed inquirer, or otherwise whether he has
imbibed theoretical views so deeply as to place him only in
the situation of a partisan of the particular theory adopted by
him.                  I
        This course have always endeavoured to pursue, and
would cheerfully concede to an opponent.       I think, however,
that  I have just reason to complain of the admission of such
terms as “gratuitously misinterpreted,” and “take a pleasure
in misinterpreting my expressions,” admitted in the very com
munication to which your note was appended.
   In respect to the unsupported quotation from your un
named correspondent's letter, which you have adopted, I have
only to express my surprise that you did not suspect more
than a filial solicitude for the Society's honour on his part.
My notice of the proceedings of the Society to which have I
the honour to belong, and amongst the leading members of

which I have the honour to number so many scientific friends,
could arise from no other motive than a desire that its author
ityand pre-eminent position in the scientific world might
be permanent and undiminished, by allowing no analytical
essays relating to physical problems to be ushered forth under
its auspices, until, in                    all
                            practicable cases,their accordance with
the involved physical facts was ascertained. The notice                                                          of
one such essay        my former paper was sufficient
                                  in                          show that                          to
such had not      always   been the case.        Your correspondent
prudently preferred leaning             his influence with you,on                                                to
challenging me        the proof      my assertion.        of
 I     have also       ask        to to

       TRANSLATE       the following extract from    letter which                            a
      I have recently  received from M.    Chasles,   because the
 view which      takes    this question
                           he             new, and his support
                                               of                       is
 ing arguments forcible:–“         passage found           In
                                                      some MISS.                             in
 at the end          of
               the second book                                 of a
                                   Boetius, the expression mensa
 geometricalia occurs; and this calculus       mentioned      ha                  is                        as

 222                Dr. R. Kane   on a Pseudomorphous
 ving been employed chiefly by the geometers.    This explains
why Boetius introduced that passage into his treatise on geo
metry; and in his treatise on arithmetic, which treats on the
properties of numbers, no mention of it is made.    This latter
work is indeed only a new version of the treatise by Nicoma
chus on the same subject.”
   This ought to be compared with what has been stated in
the number of this Magazine for December, and it will be
seen that it is quite destructive of M. Libri's principal argu
ment. I may add, in corroboration of the opinion of M.
Chasles, that Abelard's tract in the Leyden library is entitled
de Doctrina Abaci vel radii Geometrici, the manuscript itself
is thus described in the printed catalogue:—“Adolardus, qui
statim in principio dicitur philosophorum assecla ultimus, de
doctrina abaci, vel radii geometrici, ut ipse scribit quoque
vocari.   In fine legitur, Regularum abaci nobilis arithmetici
tractatus explicit feliciter.”
   And now a word with M. Libri. When he says, “Si
l'opinion de M. Halliwell avait été aussi explicite que le pense
le savant géométre de Chartres, ilsemble qu'on n'aurait pas dil
employer plusieurs pages pour tacher de le prouver,” he had
forgotten that the plusieurs pages were the produce of his own
pertinacity.   When I had explicitly stated that the Bodleian
manuscripts indicated a knowledge of the value of local
position, and that one of them actually made use of the sipos,
surely no one could reasonably accuse me of withholding
my assent from the explanation given by M. Chasles.       Much
less, in that case, could there have been a necessity for occu
pying the attention of two meetings of the Institute on a mere
question of opinion.

           the crystallization of a large quantity of iodide
      potassium,  in the manufacturing laboratory of Apo
thecaries' Hall,      I
                      observed a large group of long prisms to
be formed, of great lustre and regularity.     These prisms were
in many cases terminated by four-sided pyramids, formed by
 the joining of four rhomboidal planes, by which the solid
angles of the prism were replaced ; and I succeeded in ob
taining a series of specimens, in some of which the prism was
simple and terminated by a single plane perpendicular to                 its
axis;  in  others the solid angles were replaced          by
                                                     very minute
triangular planes, rendering the terminal plane octagonal,
and finally,   asthe triangular planes increased     size, square,

opposite rhomboidal planes was 60°. The angle across the
summit, measured            the edgeson                      of

   When iodide of potassium is crystallized in leaden or tinned
iron vessels, Mr. Scanlan has informed me that the crystalline
form is altered, from the presence of a minute quantity of
iodide of tin or lead; but what the alteration is exactly, I do
not believe has been determined.       Having heard the fact,
however, from my friend Mr. Scanlan, I sought for metallic
impurity in the crystals now described, but in vain. They are
chemically pure.

Nov.   11,      EV. Dr. Dickinson gave a verbal account of a remark
    1839.          able waterspout, which he had observed at Killiney
 during the last summer.
    Towards the end of the month of July, about 10 A.M., while
 standing on the shore of the bay of Killiney, his attention was                           di   {
 rected by a friend to a waterspout, distant about a quarter of a mile
from the land.      It was not similar in form to the representations of
waterspouts usually given, and may therefore deserve to be noticed.
 It was shaped like a double siphon, the whole being suspended at
a considerable elevation in the air; the longer end of the siphon
reached towards the sea, and appeared to approach it nearer and
nearer, till, at length,        its
                               waters were distinctly seen rushing into
the deep.     The loop gradually lowered,          sinking and lengthen
                                                      as

              own weight, while the upper part         the siphon seemed

not  to  lose    elevation.
                  in           At length the loop burst, and there were
three streams        water pouring into the sea, two
                       of                                         of

streams gradually diminished till they became invisible, but their
length seemed undiminished          long

  The author commenced his paper with              description

this subject.          He showed the inapplicability        of
                                                          the electrometers

hitherto employed, and exhibited a highly insulated galvanometer,
containing about three thousand turns of very fine wire covered
with silk, varnished and baked,—which instrument, although ex
quisitely sensitive to the feeblest voltaic electricity, was not at all
acted upon by atmospheric electricity of the low tension which ex
ists during serene weather in this country. Mr. Clarke added, that
although the application of such an instrument would be a great
desideratum in experiments on atmospheric electricity, and in this
point of view had been recommended by the highest scientific author
 ities in Europe, yet he had reason to think that it had never, in
 any country, been deflected by atmospheric electricity in serene
 weather.
     The author then exhibited the electrometer which he had devised
  for, and used in his experiments on this subject.     It consisted of a
  bell of glass, seven inches in diameter, through the side of which
  passed a sliding graduated rod, furnished with a vernier, which indi
  cated the distance, in hundredths of an inch, through which a single
  pendent slip of leaf gold was attracted towards the rod which was
  in connexion with the earth. The slip of leaf gold was attached to
  a vertical and well-insulated rod, which passed through a collar of
 leathers, and could therefore be raised or depressed, as required by
  the varying intensity, so that the lower end of the leaf should al
  ways, when electrified, be a tangent to the ball terminating the
  graduated rod.
     The author then alluded to the received opinion, that the Aurora
  Borealis is an electric discharge of considerable intensity occurring
  near the polar regions, at great heights in the atmosphere, where
 the air is necessarily rare, and where, consequently, the electric
 light (as shown in our artificial imitation of the phaenomenon) must
 be very much diffused and ramified.        Hoping to throw light upon
  this subject, he had made a series of observations on the electric
  intensity of the twenty-four hours, commencing at mid-day on the
   12th of Nov., 1838, and continued at intervals of fifteen minutes,
  except during the appearance of the Aurora, when they were made
  every five minutes, and even oftener.    The results of these observa
  tions were laid down in a chart, which exhibited the intensity of the
  electric fluid during these twenty-four hours, a period including that
 of the magnificent crimson Aurora, which was observed on the night
  of the 12th, and morning of the 13th of November, 1838, over every
 portion of the globe.      It appeared, by this chart, that the electric
 intensity during the existence of this magnificent display of Auroral
 light was but little above the mean electric intensity of that hour
 during the month; from which the author inferred that this phae
 nomenon, if at all electric, occurred at such a distance as to be un
 able to affect the apparatus.
     The author then proceeded to give an account of the extended
 series of experiments which he had undertaken at the recommenda
 tion of the Academy, and which he had continued during twelve
 months, at intervals of fifteen minutes, during at least ten days, and

from three to seven nights in each month.            He stated, that when
he had undertaken this series of experiments, he had the following
objects in view—namely, to determine the mean amount of electric
intensity existing in this country, at the different hours of day and
night, and the periods of maxima and minima; and, secondly, to
endeavour to trace the cause of this varying intensity to the influ
ence of some of the recognised agents in nature,          such as the varia
tions of atmospheric pressure; the variations of temperature; or
the varying quantity of vapour in our atmosphere.
    He was happy to announce, that he had not only determined the
mean monthly and annual force of electricity at the several hours
of the day and night, but also had succeeded in establishing its de
pendence upon two, out of the three agents, with which he had
originally proposed to investigate            connexion.       its

which        has established its connexion and proved its dependence

are, temperature, and the total quantity           moisture present   of   the                                   in

 colour uniformly diffused throughout the mass, so deep as to render
 the glass nearly opake. The experiment originated from a work
 man in the glasshouse having dipped a heated copper ladle into a
 pot of fused glass. The copper ladle was melted; the casting and
 annealing of the plates were proceeded with as usual; and on their
 completion the workmen were surprised to find, that not only were
 grains of metallic copper imbedded in the substance of the glass,
 but bands uniformly coloured of a fine bright red, were distributed
 throughout the mass.
    “The experiment of Guyton Morveau, being but a repetition of
the accidental one made by the workman, seems to have but little
engaged his attention, the colour being conceived to be due to an
 imperfect state of oxidation, as oxide of copper imparts to glass a
 greenish colour.
    “It appeared to me, at first sight, that the red colour was due to
the actual solution of the copper in the metallic state, the globules
 of copper imbedded in the mass having been deposited from a state
of solution, upon cooling. To determine this, I mixed in different
proportions with powdered glass, iron, lead, copper, silver, bismuth,
 antimony, tin, gold, platinum, in a minute state of division; and
found that glass, when mixed with iron filings, will oxidate and dis
 solve almost as much iron, when mixed with it in the metallic state,
as if it were mixed with it in the state of oxide.              Of copper, only
 a small    proportion    is oxidated and      dissolved,   imparting   a green
 colour to the   glass,   while the rest remains disseminated        throughout
the glass in globules of copper and red streaks, which are probably
the protoxide; whereas lead (for whose oxide glass has such a strong
affinity) oxidates but a small portion, when mixed with it in the me
tallic state, the rest being found imbedded in globules throughout
 its mass.    Tin, antimony, and bismuth, are more easily oxidized and
 dissolved than lead.        Gold, when fused with glass, imparts                to   it
                                                                                       a

phaenomenon generally, or show that the quantity of aqueous va

   The author adverted, in the last place, to the hypothesis of
Priestley and Beccaria,     that the upper regions of our atmosphere
were the chief depositories of the electric fluid, an opinion which
he conceived must fall, if the origin of atmospheric electricity be
due (as his experiments prove) to the existence of vapour; as these
elevated parts of our atmosphere are far above the region of per
manent vapour, or even of vapour at all.
   Professor MacCullagh read a paper “on the Dynamical Theory
of crystalline Reflexion and Refraction.”
   In a former paper, presented to the Academy in January, 1837,
and printed in volume xviii. of the Transactions,           the author had
reduced all the complicated phaenomena of reflexion and refrac
tion at the surfaces of crystals to the utmost regularity and order,
by means of a simple rule, comprised in his theorem of the polar
plane. This rule, which was verified by             agreement with exact     its
experiments,            he
                    had deduced from     set    hypotheses    arelativeof  the                                     to

count for his      hypotheses,  nor      connect them together
                                                          to              any
known principles        mechanics; and the only evidence
                                 of                                  favour                         in                   of
their truth,   was the truth       the results   of which they led.         He to
had observed, however, that these hypotheses were not independent
of  each other; he had ascertained that the laws             reflexion     the           of                       at

its interior; and he had thence been led           conclude that all these  to
laws and    hypotheses   “had common source     a     other and more inti          in
mate laws not yet discovered.”          He became impressed,            short,                               in
with the   idea,   “that the next   step     physical  optics  would lead
                                                                  in                                                     to

in the first place, that v is a function of the three differences

and, in the next place, that the only part of it which comes into
play is of the second order, containing the squares and products of
those quantities, with of course six constant coefficients.     Then,
supposing the axes of coordinates to be changed, he proves that
the usual formulae for the transformation of coordinates apply also
to the transformation of those differences; so that, by assuming the
new axes properly, the terms in the function v which depend on the
products of the differences may be made to vanish, and v will then
contain only the three squares, each multiplied by a constant co
efficient.  The axes of coordinates in this position are defined to
be the  principal axes, (commonly called the axes of elasticity); and
when we    put, with reference to these axes,

  It  will be perceived that this theory employs the general pro
cesses of analytical mechanics, as delivered by Lagrange.     The first
attempt to treat the subject of reflection and refraction in this man
ner was made by Mr. Green, in a very remarkable paper, printed in
the Cambridge Transactions, vol. vii. part 1. After stating the
dynamical principle expressed by equation (1), (though with a dif
ferent hypothesis respecting the density of the aether,) Mr. Green
observes, that, supposing the function v to be known, “we can im
mediately apply the general method given in the Mécanique Analy
tique, and which appears to be more especially applicable to problems
that relate to the motions of systems composed of an immense num
ber of particles mutually acting upon each other.”             Such is cer
tainly the great advantage of starting with that general principle;

which these  porcelain  seals found their way into this country.
   The situations in which some of them have been found are re
markable.   One was discovered     ploughing   field near Burriso
                                                           in                     a

Boyne,  near Clonard, in the county of Meath, in raising gravel;
and a fourth was discovered many years ago at a short distance from
Dublin.
  From the extreme    degree of heat to which they appear to have
been subjected, and the consequent vitrification which has in some
measure taken place, they are quite as capable of resisting the
attacks of time as the glass and porcelain deities and ornaments
found in the mummy cases of Egypt, and may have lain for an               in
definite period beneath the surface of the earth.  It is therefore, at
least, possible that they may have arrived hither from the East,
along with the weapons, ornaments, and other articles of commerce,
which were brought to these islands by the ships of the great mer
chant-princes of antiquity, the Phoenicians, to whom our ports and
harbours were well known.
    Mr. Smith then called the attention of the Academy to the re
 markable discovery, by Rosellini, Lord Prudhoe, and other recent
 travellers, of unquestionable Chinese vases in the tombs of Egypt.
He read    a passage from Davis's China, in which some of them were
described; and also an extract from Wilkinson's Ancient Egyp
tians, from which it appeared that the number of Chinese vases
found at Coptos, Thebes, and elsewhere, amounted to seven or
eight, and that the inscriptions on them had been translated by
Chinese scholars to mean, “The flower opens, and, lo! another
 year,” being a line from an ancient Chinese poem.
    From this the trade of China with distant countries, at a period
 of the remotest antiquity, being clearly proved, Mr. Smith sub
 mitted to the Academy that a case of strong probability had been
 made out, that the porcelain seals found their way into Ireland
 at some very distant period.     In fact, if they be not of modern       in
 troduction into this country—a supposition which the situations in
 which several of them have been found seems utterly to preclude—
 their arrival here must of necessity have been most ancient.
    January 13, 1840.—Sir Wm. R. Hamilton, LL.D., President, in
 the chair. Professor Mac Cullagh made a communication respecting
 the optical Laws of Rock-crystal (Quartz).
     In a paper read to the Academy in February 1836, and published
 in the Transactions, (vol. xvii. p. 461), he had shown how the
 peculiar properties of that crystal might be explained, by adding, to
 the usual equations of vibratory motion, certain terms depending on
 differential coefficients of the third order, and containing only one
 new constant c. This hypothesis, which was very simple in itself,
 not only involved as consequences          all
                                              the laws that were previously
                                                                           of by
 known, but led    to   the discovery  of
                                        a    new one—the law, namely,
 which the    ellipticityof    the vibrations depends    on  the direction
  the  ray within the    crystal.   He was not able, however,  by    account
  for his hypothesis, nor has        since been accounted for    toany one.
     But the theory developed  in it   the paper which   he  readat  the last
  meeting  of  the  Academy,      now enables him   to   assign, with a  high
  degree  of probability, the origin   of  the additional terms above-men

five coincide with the Boetian mark for the same numeral, and those
 of two others are very similar.       The idea of local position, again,
 may have had an independent European origin; the inconveniences
 of the abacus on paper would have suggested it by destroying the
 distinguishing boundaries, and inventing an arbitrary hieroglyphic
 for the representation of an empty square.”
     The author then proceeded to adduce evidence from some docu
 ments recently discovered in support of these views.            He showed
 from the Mentz MS. in the Arundel collection, in what manner the
 mode of operation with the abacus had been improved, so as to lead
 naturally to the present system. He then brought forward some
 passages from MSS. illustrative of the first employment of the zero;
 and concluded by adducing an instance from a MS. of the translation
 of Euclid by Athelard, of the fourteenth century, belonging to the
 Arundel collection, in which the number 15 is written in these con
 tractions, and without a division.

                   PRECIPITATION OF IRON BY ZINC.
           CAPITAINE      states that when a plate of zinc is immersed in
        •   a neutral solution of protochloride of iron, the zinc in a short
 time, especially if heated to ebullition, obeys the magnet and becomes
 brittle, and on continuing the immersion there remains only a friable
  fragment of pure iron. Nevertheless, as it may be suspected that
  some zinc may remain unacted upon, he has invented a very simple
  arrangement to avoid this inconvenience.         It consists in immersing
  into the solution of iron a   plate of copper  perfectly  cleaned and sol
  dered at one end to a piece of zinc. It is very nearly the same ap
  paratus as employed to obtain the lead tree, and it acts unquestion
  ably in the same manner. The iron is deposited on the copper in
  a thin friable layer, having a metallic splendour, but without any ap
  pearance of crystallization: this mode of operating has no other in
  convenience than its slowness; but in whatever manner it is con
  ducted, there is always a disengagement of hydrogen, which con
   tinues as long as the metallic precipitation.—Journal de Chimie Med.

   ACTION    OF CHLORINE ON THE CARBURETTED HYDROGEN OF
                                  ACETATES.
      M. Dumas has read a notice to the Academy, of which the follow
   ing is an abstract.   Acetic acid treated with chlorine yields chloro
   acetic acid, and this under the influence of the alkalies is converted
   into carbonic acid and chloroforme.       If there exist, as I have an
   nounced, a similarity of type between acetic and chloroacetic acid,
   the first ought to give with the alkalies a carburetted hydrogen
   C*H*, corresponding to chloroforme C*H*C1".            The production of
   this carburet under the influence of the alkalies is not known; but of
   the carburet  C*H* produced by the      acetates  corresponding to   chlo

roform C*H* Cl", it ought to give rise by means of chlorine to the
following series:
          C*H* Clº hydrochlorate of methylen
          C*H* Cl* chloride of hydrochlorate of methylen
              H2 Cl6 chloroforme

                 Cls chloride of carbon.
                 C*
     “Ihave made many attempts,” says M. Dumas, “to ascertain the
production of these various bodies;” and he adds, “according to the
details of the experiments, the gas of the acetates acts under the                                     in
fluence of chlorine as the law of substitutions and the theory of
types had previously indicated, for the body C*H* is converted into
C* Clº; it being well understood that this conclusion relates only
to the gas of the acetates, no experiments having been made with
pond gas; and he has but little experimented with the gas from
alcohol, which may be merely a mixture.         M. Dumas maintains
purely and simply his preceding conclusions: acetic acid and chlo
roacetic acid belong to the same type, and the same exists with re
spect to chloroforme and the carburetted hydrogen of the acetates;
for acetic acid produces the carburetted gas, under the circumstances
in which chloroacetic acid yields chloroforme; and the chloroforme,
as well as the carburetted gas of the acetates, is converted by the
action of chlorine into a chloride of carbon C* Clº, which belongs to
the same type as they.— L'Institut, No. 318.
                          HYDROCARBURET OF BROMINE.
   M. Pelouze and M. Millon by subjecting to the action of bromine
the carburetted hydrogen obtained from the decomposition of alco
hol by barytes, hydrocarburet of bromine corresponding to the liquor
of the Dutch chemists, M. Pelouze stated it as his opinion that this
compound, which is perfectly identical with that obtained from olefi
ant gas, could not be explained by the law of substitutions.      He
adds, that in his opinion, this law, when it is well known, is only a
particular case of the theory of chemical equivalents; and that he
has undertaken with M. Millon, some experiments to support his
opinion in this respect.—L'Institut, No. 318.

steps of stones to a stage of ten feet high, and is in a south-east di
rection. Here the roof begins to form a regular arch, the height of
which from the floor varies from five to eight feet, the grotto being
from six to twelve feet wide, to the part called the crawling place, a
name which is given to it in consequence of travellers being obliged
to crawl, in order to reach another large neighbouring chamber;
from this to the spot, in which a pillar is found, for a mile and a
quarter, there occurs an alternating succession of large and small
chambers.     Sometimes the way is flat, at other times enormous
blocks of rock must be climbed, which have been detached from the
roof, and then the pillar occurs in the form of a magnificent white
column, which reflecting the sombre light of the torches, has a
majestic and dazzling aspect.        Visiters rarely proceed further than
from 100 to 150 fathoms.          The pillar or column is 15 feet in dia
meter and thirty high ; it is regularly fasciculated from the summit
to the base.      Not far from it are several other pillars of the same
form, but of smaller dimensions: it is composed of carbonate of
lime.
    The date of the discovery of this grotto is not known; it is known
only that it was visited in 1807 by some persons who found in it a
bed of salts from 6 to 9 feet thick on the bottom of the grotto, where
they observed enormous blocks scattered over                whilst the walls     it,
were covered with saline products. The sulphate           magnesia abounds   of

SIR JOHN    F. W. HERSCHEL's NEw ResEARCHEs on THE solar
               SPECTRUM AND IN PHOTOGRAPHY.
  The  following are some of the points of novelty which occur in a
paper by Sir John Herschel, now in course of reading before the
Royal Society:—
   1. Detection of luminous rays, and a new prismatic colour beyond
the extreme violet.
   2. Discovery of a chemical spectrum beyond the ertreme red rays.
   3. Assumption, according to circumstances, of either an oxidizing
or a de-oxidizing action by the chemical rays at either end of the
spectrum.
   4. Formation of photographic impressions of the spectrum, ex
hibiting the prismatic colours in imitation of the colours of those
rays by which they are produced; and a variety of other tints.
   5. Photographic effects produced by the simultaneous action of
two rays differing in refrangibility, which neither of them, acting
alone, are capable of producing at all.
   6. Action of the spectrum on vegetable colours.
   7. Discovery of a process of secret photographic painting, in which
the image may be preserved ad infinitum in an invisible state, ca
pable of being at any moment rendered visible.
   8. Account of a process for fixing photographic pictures on glass
plates.
   9. Analysis of the absorbent action of various media on the
chemical rays.
   10. Account of a self-registering photometer for meteorological
purposes.

XLIV.    Letter from M. KREIL, Director of the Observatory
  at Milan,  to M. KUPFFER, Director General of the Phy
  sical Observatories in Russia, containing a succinct Account
  of the principal Results of M. KREIL's Magnetic Observa
  tions at Milan.*    Communicated by Major SABINE, R.A.
     HE   observations arrange themselves under three heads:
     i.e. absolute observations, observations of the periodical
changes, and of the perturbations of the magnetic forces.
The absolute observations have shown that a correction must
be applied to the declinations previously published, which
had been determined within the confines of the Palace of
Brera, where the Astronomical Observatory is placed, and
where masses of iron appear to have exercised a disturbing
influence.    A series of observations made last spring in an
open meadow 640 metres from the observatory, showed that
the previous determinations were 23' 16" in excess.         A se
cond series made in the botanical garden adjoining the ob
servatory, on a spot which is 47 metres from the palace, but
which was not available before, gave an error of 21' 51".                                I
have taken the mean of these determinations, i.e. 22'33".5, as
the quantity by which               all
                             the declinations hitherto published     -
are   tobe diminished.
    The apparatus employed          these observations was made
                                               in
in  Göttingen     by M. Meyerstein, and       furnished with two
needles, similar   inform and  weight, but                 of is
                                              unequal magnetism.

If these   two needles are employed for determining the de
clination precisely in the same manner as described in p. 146
of the 19 Supplemento alle Ephemeridi di Milano, a constant
difference of nearly 8 minutes is found between their results,
the weaker needle (No. XVII.) giving the greatest declina
tion. With needles of still weaker magnetism, some of which
have been made here, this difference amounts even to half a
degree, not only when the observations are made within the
influence of the iron of Brera, but also in the open meadow.
All the observations of declination hitherto published have
been made with the stronger needle (No. 4.).       have not been I
able to discover any reason for this phaenomenon, unless it is
caused by temporary magnetism.         However it showed itself
in the first year too plainly to be doubted;  and I should have
mentioned it before, if I had not been desirous of obtaining
the greatest certainty which repeated observations could give,
and of waiting to see whether the same circumstance might
not have been remarked by other observers.         In respect to
the horizontal intensity I have not as yet been able to per
ceive any difference between the determinations made with
these two needles.
   The observations for the periodical changes were made six
times a day; they included in the first year observations of de
clination and of the time of vibration of the horizontal needle;
in the second year the inclination was observed in addition
to the above phaenomena; and in the third year the time of
oscillation of the dipping-needle was also included.      The
result has shown that no clear view of these complicated phae
nomena can be obtained unless they are                     all
                                                    observed. The
results derived from our observations are the following:

The minimum of inclination                              was at 8 a.m. in the                       winter
months (i.e. November to March) and at 11 p.m. in the                                                      re
maining months, with the exception of June and July, when
it took place as early as 7.30 p.m.
   These results are deduced from the general or monthly
means of the different hours of observation.                Another com

not been brought into the calculation, because they were

as we have seen     in (7.) is different at different hours of the
day.     But in a  longer   series of observations, on account of

the periodicity of the last named
constant though much weaker cause acting according to quite
                     —T-
a different law must be traceable, as the result has shown.
The following are the differences       at the different hours of the
day between the declinations found with moon east and moon
West.

    It is true that these numbers are not yet corrected for the
 secular decrease of the declination, but it does not appear to
 have been great enough to affect the result essentially.           In
 the year 1836 the observations were not made exactly at the
 same hours, and cannot therefore be employed for determi
 ning the secular alteration, but from 1837 to 1838 it was 59"8,
 which would give a correction of 2".5. This if doubled
 would not alter any of the signs in the above table. . We
 conclude hence, that in this country the declination is always
 greater when the moon is east of the magnetic meridian, and
 less when it is west.
    16. All the results which we have derived from our obser
 vations in reference to the effects produced by the moon agree
 in presenting her as a body exercising magnetic influence,
 and in which the prevailing magnetism on the hemisphere
 turned towards the earth attracts that pole of our needles
 which is turned towards the south, and increases the magnetic
 intensity of our hemisphere.
    The observations of perturbations have manifested the
 following facts:
     17. Great disturbances frequently occur on the same day,
 or nearly on the same day, in different years. Thus the
 greatest disturbances which took place in the year 1886 were
 on the 22nd and 23rd of April, and on the 18th of October,
 and both these were repeated on the same days in 1837. In
  1838 several   of the disturbances took place       a few days later

to be taken from those which are ascribed to the first hour
in the morning when the apparatus was observed. It follows
that much fewer disturbances begin at that hour than in the
evening.    It is remarkable that a disturbance hardly ever
begins in the latter hours of the forenoon.
   19. The perturbations appear to commence for the most
part suddenly, as by shocks. At least it was so in those cases
in which the phaenomenon began under our eyes, that is to
say, at the time of an observation. It was so on the 18th of
February 1837, on which day an aurora showed itself with
a magnificence unusual in this country. Two series of transits
of a division of the scale across the wire had been observed
as usual.   In the first series at 4" 38" these passages agreed
to a tenth of a second of time;—a proof that the needle was
still performing         minute vibrations with perfect regularity;

tends also to the total force. The needle in our inclina
torium completes one vibration in nearly 14 seconds: during
the disturbance of the 17th of January 1838, it underwent an
alteration of 0"-074. In February of the same year the mean
of the observed times of vibration for the month was 13"'874,
but for the 21st day of the month it was 13932.     I need not
remark how important it would be to examine such kindred
phaenomena as those of the atmosphere and auroras, with the
same exactness which is now applied to magnetic investi
gation.
     I
     must mention one other phaenomenon which claimed our
attention in a very high degree, and which perhaps may
deserve that of other observers.    I mean the vertical oscilla
tions which show themselves so often in the dipping-needle,
and which also appear to be connected with determinate laws.
At least they are much more frequent in November and De
cember than at other seasons, and they occur most commonly
                                                         I
in wet weather. For this reason do not think that they can
be ascribed to a tremulous motion of the building, from which
the part of it which contains the apparatus is quite free.
Neither can they be attributed to the effect of currents of air,
because they occur less frequently at the time of the equi
noctial gales and other storms than at the above-named
times.     Perhaps they arise from very weak shocks of earth
quake, which may be revealed to us by this highly sensitive
apparatus, and which probably occur much more frequently
than the more considerable shocks which are recognised by
our senses, and by other effects. At least the greatest vertical
oscillations of the needle have almost always coincided with
considerable earthquakes, often having their seat in remote
countries.    One striking instance of this kind, after we had
experienced other similar ones, occurred on the 23rd of                                  Ja
nuary 1838. Between 7° 33" and 7h 47m p.m., Milan mean

which,   entitled “Additional Experiments on the Formation
of Alkaline and Earthy Bodies by chemical action when car
bonic acid is present, by Robert Rigg, Esq., F.R.S.”, attracted

252        Mr. J. D.      Smith's Observations on the supposed
  To  satisfy myself respecting the correctness                        of Mr. Rigg's
statement that the quantity of inorganic matter in a liquid is
increased from fifteen to nineteen times when carbonic acid is
present,    I
           dissolved 1500 grs. of the best refined sugar in
14 pint of distilled water, and added 200 grains of risen beer
yeast, then thoroughly mixed them by agitation.              This solu
tion was  passed   through    fine cambric to      separate   any inso
luble   impurities   which the solution      contained,    and divided
into three exactly equal portions.           Of these, two portions
were respectively placed in German glass jars, and imme
diately covered with unglazed paper covers; the paper was
of a close texture, and was carefully gummed down round
the exterior of the jars, to prevent any inorganic matter, as
dust, &c. getting into the solutions.        These jars were placed
in a warm situation in the     laboratory,   the temperature varying
from 60° to 70°     Fahrenheit,     and the fermentation allowed to
proceed. The third portion was then put into a flask and boil
ed, occasionally adding pure nitric acid; this acid left no stain
when a portion was evaporated to dryness in a porcelain cap
sule; the flask was kept in an oblique position, to prevent any of
the liquid being ejected by the action of the nitric acid. During
the ebullition of the liquid, nitrous acid fumes were slowly
formed and the solution assumed a primrose yellow colour;
numerous spherules of liquid were formed, apparently on the
surface of the boiling fluid, and coursed about hither and
thither with great velocity, the larger spherules seemingly at
tracting the smaller; and when by this union the globule had
attained about the size of a coriander seed, it disappeared,
being again united to the bulk of the boiling solution. I ima
gine that this singular and interesting phaenomenon is owing
                                                                                       in by

 surface   of
            the fluid, there meet with         stratum                 of

of   alight buff colour remained, weighing, with the crucible,
631.97 grs. —630.4 = 1.57 gr. of inorganic matter contained
in 500 grs. of sugar and 66:6 grs. of yeast before fermenta
tion. On examination, this ash was found to consist of an
alkaline carbonate, traces of a chloride and of a sulphate, phos
phates   of lime and magnesia in large proportions, and minute
traces  of silica and oxide of iron.
     At the expiration of six days, one of the portions which
had undergone the vinous fermentation, and which presented
the agreeable odour accompanying this stage of fermentation,
was evaporated in a mode, and with precautions, exactly
similar to the above, and the same phaenomena were ob
served during the operation.     The residual liquid evaporated
to dryness in the platinum crucible weighing 630.38 grs., and
ignited overa gas lamp to full redness as in the first experiment,
afforded an ash similar in appearance to the former, which
with the crucible weighed 631.97 grs. -680:38 = 1.59 grs.
of inorganic matter yielded by 500 grs. of sugar and 66:6 grs.
of yeast, after undergoing the vinous fermentation. This ash
was similarly constituted with that obtained in the first       in
Stance.
   From these experiments we find that whilst 500 grs. of
sugar and 66:6 grs. of yeast afford previous to fermenta
tion 1.57 grain of inorganic matter; when fermented they
give 1°59 gr., an increase of 35 gr., or of about 14 per cent.;
an increase so trifling that I do not hesitate to refer it to an
error of experiment, and not to the formation of inorganic
elements during vinous fermentation, which Mr. Rigg asserts
is the case.   I therefore conclude, contrary to the views enter
tained by Mr. Rigg on this subject, that there is no formation
of inorganic matter during the progress of vinous fermenta
tion.
     Iam at a loss to offer any feasible explanation of the enor
mous increase of inorganic matter observed by Mr. Rigg;
the only mode by which this could have taken place, which
at present occurs to me, and that an unlikely one, is that suf
ficient precautions were not taken to prevent the introduction
of foreign matters by securely covering the solutions of sugar
and yeast whilst fermenting; and that a quantity of dust, the
constant plague of a laboratory, became mixed with his solu
tions, and thus led Mr. Rigg to suppose that the alkalies and
earths were absolutely formed during fermentation.          I may
remark that the      paper covers with which   my  fermenting  so
lutions were protected from the dust, were so thickly covered
with     it,
          that had the precaution     of
                                       covering the solutions not
been   taken,  Imust have obtained very considerable increase

imagine it would have been to the extent of fifteen to nine
teen times the weight of the ash previous to                                it.

connected with the experiments to be described in the next
section, and which exhibits the action in a striking manner
This consists in causing the induction to take place through
the partition wall of two rooms.          For this purpose coil No. 1
is suspended against the wall in one room, while a person in
the adjoining one receives the shock, by grasping the handles
of the helix, and approaching it to the spot opposite to which
the coil is suspended. The effect is as if by magic, without
a visible cause.     It is best produced through a door, or thin
wooden    partition.
   52. The action at a distance affords a simple method                                                      of
graduating the intensity of the shock in the case of                 appli                       its
cation   tomedical    purposes.      The helix    may       suspended     by       be
a  string passing over         pulley, and then gradually lowered
                                    a
down towards the        plane       the coil, until the shocks are of

the  required   intensity.     At the request           medical friend,  ofa                                I

   56. Sir H. Davy found, in magnetizing needles by an elec
trical discharge, that the effect took place through interposed
plates of all substances, conductors and nonconductors *.
The experiment which I have given in paragraph 51 would
appear to indicate that the inductive action which produces
the secondary current might also follow the same law.
   57. To test this the compound helix was placed about five
inches above coil No. 1, fig. 5, and a plate of sheet iron, about
                                           Fig. 5.

Tºth of an inch thick, interposed.       With this arrangemeut
no shocks could be obtained; although, when the plate was
withdrawn, they were very intense.
   58.   It was at first thought that this effect might be pe
culiar to the iron, on account of                        its
                                           temporary magnetism;

                                       Thus a        sheet
produced no perceptible influence; also four sheets of the

                                with the same result.
ness of metal is therefore  required to produce   the screening
effect, and this thickness depends on the quantity of the cur
rent from the battery.
   61. The idea occurred to me that the screening might, in
some way, be connected with an instantaneous current in the
plate, similar to that in the induction by magnetic rotation,
discovered by M. Arago.       The ingenious variation of this
principle by Messrs. Babbage and Herschel, furnished me
with a simple method of determining this point.
   62. A circular plate of lead was interposed, which caused
the induction in the helix almost entirely to disappear.      A
slip of the metal was then cut out in the direction of a radius
of the circle, as is shown in fig. 6. . With the plate in this
condition, no screening was produced; the
shocks were as intense as if the metal were          Fig. 6.

   64. But the existence of a current in the interposed con

spiral by means of two wires to the edge of the opening in
the circular plate, as is shown in fig. 7.   By this arrangement
the latent current was drawn
out, and its direction obtained             Fig. 7.

put on the top of the helix, and in this position, although the
neutralization was not as perfect as before, yet a great reduc
tion was observed in the intensity of the shock.
   67. But here a very interesting and puzzling question oc
curs.    How does it happen that two currents, both in the
same   direction,  can neutralize each other? I was at first dis
posed to consider the phaenomenon as a case of real electrical
interference, in which the impulses succeed each other by
some regular interval.      But if this were true the effect should
depend on the length and other conditions of the current in
the interposed conductor. In order to investigate this, several
modifications of the experiments were instituted.
   68. First a flat coil (No. 3) was interposed instead of the
plates. When the two ends of this were separated, the shocks
were received as if the coil were not present; but when the
ends were joined, so as to form a perfect metallic circuit, no
shocks could be obtained. The neutralization with the coil
in this experiment was even more perfect than with the plate.
   69. Again, coil No. 2, in the form of a ring, was placed not
between the conductors, but around the helix.              With this
disposition of the apparatus, and the ends of the coil joined,
the shocks were scarcely perceptible; but when the ends were
separated, the presence of the coil has no effect.
   70. Also when helix No. 1 and 2 were together submitted
to the influence of coil No. 1, the ends of the one being joined,
the other gave no shock.
   71. The experiments were further varied by placing helix
No. 2 within a hollow cylinder of sheet brass, and this again
within coil No. 2 in a manner similar to that shown in fig. 12,
which is intended to illustrate another experiment.           In this
arrangement the neutralizing action was exhibited, as in the
case of the plate.
   72. A hollow cylinder of iron was next substituted for the
one of brass, and with this also no shocks could be obtained.
   73. From these experiments it is evident that the neutrali
zation takes place with currents in the interposed or adjoining
conductors of         all
                     lengths and intensities, and therefore can
not,  as   appears
           it           me, to         be
                                referred             to

systems     of
             vibrations.
   74. This part        the investigation was, for

tion. The electrical discharge having destroyed the insulation
at some point, a part of the spires would thus form a shut
circuit, and the induction in this would counteract the ac
tion in the other part of the helix; or, in other words, the
helix was in the same condition as the two helices mentioned
in paragraph     70, when the ends          of the wire of one were
joined.
  76. Also the same principle appears to have an important
bearing on the improvement of the magneto-electrical ma
chine; since the plates of metal which sometimes form the
ends of the spool containing the wire, must necessarily           di
minish the action, and also from experiment of paragraph
72 the armature itself may circulate a closed current which
will interfere with the intensity of the induction in the sur
rounding wire.      Iam inclined to believe that the increased
effect observed   by Sturgeon and Calland, when a bundle of
wire is substituted for a solid piece of iron, is at least in part
due to the interruption of these currents.        I hope to resume
this part of the subject, in connexion with several other points,
in another communication to the Society.
   77. The results given in this section may, at first sight,
be thought at variance with the statements of Sir H. Davy,
that needles could be magnetized by an electrical discharge
with conductors interposed.       But from his method of per
forming the experiment, it is evident that the plate of metal
was placed between a straight conductor and the needle.
The arrangement was therefore similar to the interrupted
circuit in the experiment with the cut plate (62.), which pro
duces no screening effect.     Had the plate been curved into
the form of a hollow   cylinder,   with the two ends in contact,
and the needle   placed  within  this, the effect would have been
otherwise.
SECTION V.—On the Production and Properties of induced
       Currents of the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Order.
   78. The fact of the perfect neutralization of the primary
current by a secondary, in the interposed conductor, led me
to conclude that if the latter could be drawn out, or separated
from the influence of the former, it would itself be capable of
producing a new induced current in a third conductor.
   79. The arrangement exhibited in fig. 8 furnishes a ready
means of testing this. The primary current, as usual, is
passed through coil No. 1, while coil No. 2 is placed over this
to receive the induction with      ends joined
                                     its              to

     93. In the first  glance at the above table, we are struck
with the fact that the law of alternation is complete, except be
tween the primary and secondary currents, and it appeared
that this exception might possibly be connected with the                                                             in
duced current which takes place in the first coil itself, and
which gives rise to the phaenomena of the spiral conductor.
If  this should be found to be minus, we might consider it as
existing between the primary and secondary, and the anomaly
would thus disappear. Arrangements were therefore made
to fully satisfy myself on this point.           For this purpose the
decomposition of dilute acid and the use of the galvanometer
were resorted              to,       by

current in the opposite direction.
  96.   It would also appear from the perfect neutralization
 which ensues in the arrangement of the last paragraph, that
 the induced current in the adjoining conductor is more power
 ful than that of the first conductor; and we can easily see
 how this may be. The two ends of the second coil are joined,
 and it thus forms a perfect metallic circuit; while the circuit
 of the other coil may be considered as partially interrupted,
 since to render the spark visible the electricity must be pro
jected, as it were, through a small distance of air.
    97. We would also infer that two contiguous secondary
 currents, produced by the same induction, would partially
 counteract each other.     Moving in the same direction, they
would each tend to induce a current in the other of an             op
posite direction.   This is illustrated by the following ex
periment: helix No. 1 and 2 were placed together, but not
united, above coil No. 1, so that they each might receive the
induction; the larger was then gradually removed to a greater
distance from the coil, until the intensity of the shock from
each was about the same.      When the ends of the two were
united, so that the shock would pass through the body from
the two together, the effect was apparently less than with one
helix alone. The result, however, was not as satisfactory as
in the case of the other experiments; a slight difference in
the intensity of two shocks could not be appreciated with
perfect certainty.

 XLVII.     On the Natural Products which originate from the ac
  tion of the Atmosphere on Iron Pyrites. By TH. SchEERER”.
   T is a well-known    fact, that iron pyrites, in the finely divided
     state in which it occurs in alum slates, is easily oxidized b
 the atmosphere, causing the parts exposed to acquire a reddish
 brown colour; nevertheless, the products of this decomposi
 tion are seldom to be found, from the rainwashing them away.
 In a spot near Modum in Norway, I met with a cavity in the
 mountains where they were deposited as incrustations, safe
 from   all destructive influences.     Three distinct layers were
 evident.
    The first and upper layer       is dark brown massive mineral
                                       a
 with which the slate    is impregnated:          A.

   The second layer forms a light yellow mass distinctly sepa
rated from the first, and forming incrustations similar to those
which occur in (dolomitic) limestone caverns; B.
   The third is clothed with a layer of small white crystals: C.
   The analysis of A gave:
                     80-73 peroxide of iron
                      6:00 sulphuric acid
                     13:57 water
                    100-30
which corresponds to a combination of 14 atoms of peroxide
of iron, 2 atoms of sulphuric acid, and 21 atoms of water,
which is expressed by the formula,
                       2  (Fej Š) + 21  H;
Or,
according to the manner in which the formula is written. This
iron-salt may be called, after the nomenclature of Berzelius,
the twenty-fold basic sulphate of the peroxide of iron; it is
the most basic salt as yet known. The oxygen of the oxide
amounts to the double of that in the water. It is perfectly
insoluble in water.
   Two analyses of the substance B gave the following results:
             I                      2
           49-37                  49.89 peroxide of iron

           99.95                 100'82
The   soda was found in both analyses to contain a small   quan
tity of potash, which, however, is of no importance for the
formula, which may be thus expressed,

namely 4 atoms of peroxide of iron, 5 atoms of sulphuric
acid, 1 atom of soda, and 9 atoms of water.
    The substance C was found to be pure gypsum.
    In explaining the commencement and continuation of this
process, it must be supposed that the sulphate of the protox
ide of iron was at first formed by the oxidation of the iron
pyrites; this became gradually oxidized, and was deposited

             On Light and the chemical action of the Spectrum.                                          267
as the  first brown layer of the salt A described. Yet the de
position of this basic iron-salt must have happened under sin
gular circumstances, for it is a well-known fact that a solution
of iron-vitriol, oxidized by the atmosphere, is precipitated as
a five-fold basic salt.    It is likewise difficult to explain how
the yellow layer containing alkali suddenly succeeded the dark
brown; it may indeed be supposed, that at the commencement
of this decomposition of the iron pyrites the alum-slate re
sisted for some time                  all
                             action, until    was attacked, and       it                                     its
alkali dissolved             by
                       the sulphuric acid, which commenced the
formation           of
                  new salt. But
                        a              this mode     explanation has
                                                            if                  of

beneath the iodine the paper became richly iridescent.                     The

    7. Papers already darkened by sunlight during prolonged
exposure to the influence of the dissevered rays of the spec
trum, assume a variety of colours. The same changes may
be effected by carefully arranging glasses, and placing the
photographic preparations beneath them.                      I shall copy ex
actly the memoranda of my journal.
    Dec. 12, 1839.-I placed under blue, green, yellow, and
red glass the following papers:
    A. Muriate of ammonia, with two washings of solution of
the nitrate of silver, darkened by exposure to a rich chocolate.
    B. Muriate of manganese.              Silver, two washings, dark

rich bronze.
     F. Chloriodic     acid with Liquor potassae. Silver, two wash

rainy weather, the paper E has become blue under the blue
glass. No change is apparent on the others.

    Jan. 2, 1840.-All the papers go on increasing the distinct
 ness of their colours, except E and F, which have assumed
 different shades of blackness.
     (E     and F were removed, and a paper G, prepared with
 muriate of baryta and two washings of silver, darkened to a
 chocolate, substituted.)

270    Mr. Hunt on Light   which has permeated coloured Media,
    The two papers A and G exhibit much more sensitive
ness to luminous influence than any others    I  have yet tried.
   8. The paper A, when washed with a weak solution of
the hydriodate of baryta, gives under the pencil of light a
beautiful picture, whether used in the camera or for surface
 drawings.
         !.
    These pictures exhibit the peculiarities mentioned by Mr.
 Talbot at the British Association *. Sunshine changes “the
 colour of the object delineated from reddish to black with
 great                This gentleman adds, “after which no
 further change occurs.”     I much regret I have not been for
 tunate enough to succeed thus far in fixing my drawings.
 The continued influence of light in a few months obliterates
 the impression.
    A singular change follows the exposures of these pictures
 to coloured light.
    If placed under vessels containing coloured fluids (4.) and
exposed either to sunshine or to diffused light, in a few days
the picture becomes a full red under the blue; a rose hue un
 der the green; a light blue under the yellow, and a deep blue
 under the red. These colours after deepening for some time
gradually change to different shades of green under the blue
and green fluids, to a pink under the yellow, and a red under
 the red fluid (25.). After this, the colours alter no more, and
 the picture bears exposure to light much better than at first;
      I
 but doubt if it is rendered perfectly permanent, for the dull
light of January and February has spread a downiness, like a
mist, over those photographs which have been constantly ex
posed.
                          Daguerreotypes.
    9. Exposing a plate, over which some lace was carefully
placed, under four coloured glasses (2.) for three minutes to
diffused light, I obtained, under the blue glass a beautiful
copy; no trace of a drawing beneath the green; a tolerable
impression beneath the yellow; but the mercury would not
attack the space beneath the red.
    10. A plate similarly arranged beneath four bottles of co
loured fluid (4.) exposed to diffused light for fifteen minutes,
was found on being acted upon by the mercurial vapour to
present the same appearance as above (9.), excepting that a
faint design was evident over the space the carmine fluid had
covered.
    11.  I arranged a dark chamber, to which no other rays
could    pass  but such as had permeated two inches of co
loured fluid.

its influence in full sunshine. There was not the slightest ac
tion.
    12.      In one hour on           a similar plate, under the same circum
                 I obtained        a faint, but still defined outline of a dried
 ern.
   13.       I
          exposed a bare iodidated plate for two hours to the
same influence.     On removing it from the chamber no dif
ference was   apparent;  but                       I
                              found it was no longer sensitive
to light, and the iodide adhered more closely to the metal
 than it did (28.).
   This is a reverse action, for after the exposure of a pre
pared daguerreotype plate to light, the sensitive film is most
easily rubbed off” (28.).
   14. Red solutions impart a very decided rose hue, or more
strictly speaking the influence of red light on the iodidated
plate occasions that peculiar arrangement of the mercurial
particles, which is necessary to the production of red co
lour.
    15. Green    solutions act with more or less effect in ob
 structing the passage of the so-called chemical rays according
 to their depth of colour.    But in no instance have I found
 them to    produce  that close combination, which the yellow
 and sometimes the red fluids do, of the iodide and the un
 der surface of unattacked silver (28.).     By examining the
 effects  produced   by green media        16.)   peculiar order(2,   7,          a

   For some days the only apparent difference was that the earth

the cuticle in the blue and green lights, before any change
was evident in the other parts.
   After ten days, under the blue fluid there was a crop of
cress, of as bright a green as any which grew in full light, and
far   more abundant.
     The crop  was scanty under the green            fluid and of a pale
 unhealthy colour (15.).
i.
     Under the yellow solution but two or three plants appeared,
   et they were less pale than those which had grown in green
           Beneath the red bottle the number of plants which
 grew was also small, although rather more than in the spot
 the yellow covered. They too were of an unhealthy colour.
     17. I now reversed the order of the bottles, fixing the
 red in the place of the blue, and the yellow in that of the
 green. After a few days’ exposure the healthy cress appeared
 blighted, while a few more unhealthy plants began to show
 themselves, from the influence of the blue rays, in the spot
 originally subjected to the red.
    It is evident from this that the red and yellow rays not
merely retard germination, but positively destroy the vital
principle in the seed. Prolonged exposure uncovered, with
genial warmth, free air, and indeed         all
                                              that can induce growth,
 fails to revive the  blighted   vegetation.
 I     have repeated the experiment many times, varying the
fluids, but the results have been the same.        At this time have   I
the above facts      strikingly   exemplified   where the space co

the influence of such powerful light as penetrated Professor

274     Mr. Hunt on Light which                     has permeated coloured Media,
    19.    It will be observed, that the light which has                                         passed
  through a green medium (2, 7, 9, 10, 15, 16) acts less
  powerfully in darkening photographic papers, and occasions
  vegetable leaves to be even paler than that which has been
  subjected to the interference of a yellow medium.
    I   am led to suspect that the band of rays formed by the
  meeting of the yellow and the green has an influence similar to
 the extreme red, in neutralizing the powers of the other ad
jacent rays, as was first noticed by Sir John Herschel, (22.),
  (23.), (26.).
     20. The figure on the preceding page represents the solar
 spectrum, as it impresses itself on a daguerreotype plate, not in
  shadows merely, but in colours, which have the peculiar ap
 pearance of the down upon the nectarine.                       -
     The most refrangible portion of the spectrum is repre
  sented in full colours, shading from indigo to a delicate rose,
  which is lost in a band of pure white.
     21. Beyond this a protecting influence is powerfully ex
  erted, and notwithstanding the chemical effect produced over
  the plate, by the dispersed light, a line is formed free of mer
  curial vapour, and which consequently appears black.
     22. The green portion of the spectrum is represented in
 its  true colour, but             considerably less
                                     it   is                  size than the  in
  space occupied              by
                          these  rays.

XLIX.       On the Mineral Structure of the South of Ireland, with
    correlative matter on Devon and Cornwall, Belgium, the
    Eifel, &c. By Thomas WEAver, Esq., F.R.S., F.G.S,
    M. It...I.A., &c. &c.
  “Men believe that reason governs their words, but words have often
power enough to react upon reason.”—Bacon.
        HE   following remarks, bearing on the mineral structure
          of a considerable portion of the south of Ireland, are
drawn    from me by certain representations made by Mr.
Griffith on the same subject, respecting which my first im
pression was that I might be content to suffer them to pass
without public comment, persuaded that no intelligent geolo
gist, who would duly sift and weigh the evidence adduced on
both sides, could be at a loss in coming to a correct decision.
But as it is not every reader who will take this trouble, and
as unquestioned assertions not unfrequently pass as established
truths with the unwary, further reflection has taught me that
I  owe it both to the Geological Society and to myself not to
remain silent.      However adverse to controversy, and how
ever irksome the task of entering upon                man should alwaysit, a

Soc., in May, 1839*; and, 3rd, in a paper read before the
Geological Society of Dublin, on the 13th June, 1839, the
last-mentioned being accompanied by two sections, one re
ferring to the south-eastern portion of the island, and the
other to a part of the extreme west, in the county of
Kerryt. The views of Mr. Griffith thus appearing in an
authenticated form before the public, and the author having
in his last production, while attempting to explain his own
positions, found it necessary to assail mine, the time has fully
arrived for adverting to those views.          Being thus put on my
defence, I shall proceed to consider, in connexion, the Outline
 with       Geological Map, and the three later written communi
          its

 doing, shall feel

 Griffith's  representations   are not  only  irreconcilable with the
 facts, but that those representations contradict each other                                                           f.

280   Mr. Weaver            on the Structure       of the       South      of Ireland,
(putting my own descriptions out of the question), he must
have seen that Mr. Holdsworth places in the map and speaks
in the text of the clayslate formation, as being observable in
different places along the eastern border of the Monavoullagh
range of conglomerate; and especially as being of consider
able extent in the vicinity of Stradbally, where it is in a highly
inclined position, and in places nearly vertical, stretching
thence to the westward toward the vale of Dungarvan, and
there coming in contact with the carboniferous limestone of
that valley.      In        its
                          range, therefore, the clayslate formation
 evidently occupies the district lying between Ballyvoil head
 on  the south and the Monavoullagh range                     conglomerateof
 on the   north;    and Mr. Holdsworth           observes*,     that      this                    in
 part the base       the Monavoullagh mountain range approaches
                      of
 close upon the clayslate formation.                With respect           the                    to
 Monavoullagh conglomerate itself,                 remarkst, that having

 line from north           south (which extends many miles), and

                           return        the coast, stretching eastward
                                             to

raised to their present level; a speculation into which I do
not think it necessary to enter, the established fact of the
difference of position and association, and consequently of
date as to origin, being sufficient for my present purpose.
Other matter is to               be found scattered through                           Mr. Holds
worth's observations, which comes very well in corroboration
of  the general view which I have given of the structure and
composition of that district in my memoir on the south of
Ireland; although Mr. Holdsworth nowhere draws the dis
tinction himself between the transition conglomerate and sand
stone, and the overlying conglomerate and sandstone of the
Monavoullagh range, further than by considering the former
as a conformable, and the latter as an unconformable forma
tion. On the contrary, he gives it as his opinion that     the                                   in all
conglomerates and sandstones which          has noticed     the  he
 eastern part         of
                  Waterford are identical, excepting perhaps
 those occurring            on

 and those around Dunmore on the western side of Waterford
 harbour, which             he
                         conceives may                      be   of

 tion, but   of,     reasonassigned for this opinion.
                              is                           The identity
 spoken         no

 ceding that         he
                   has confounded      together  the old red sandstone
 formation, properly           called, with the red conglomerate,

  282      Mr. Weaver              on the Structure           of the South of Ireland,
  fines, whose dip varies from south to north,                                        how could we
  expect any conformity between them?
       If wenow pass to the westward of the Monavoullagh sand
 stone   conglomerate      range by ascending from the vale of the
  Blackwater, from Lismore for example, to the table-land on
 the north, on which are planted the Knockmildown masses of
 the old red sandstone formation, we traverse in our course the
 older stratified rocks, still possessing the eastern and western
 strike, and for the greater part the southerly dip, and in which
 occur numerous slate quarries.          The Monavoullagh sand
 stone  conglomerate     range  extends nearer to the declivity lead
 ing down to the vale of Dungarvan than the Knockmildown
 sandstone conglomerate range does towards the Blackwater
 valley, from which it recedes considerably to the north, and no
 where does that formation approach and reach the vale until
 we enter upon the region of the Kilworth mountain and the ad
jacent hills, where it descends toward that valley and supports
 the carboniferous limestone; while in the defiles and ravines
 by which that mountain is furrowed, and whose course is
 toward the Blackwater, the clayslate formation is exposed to
 view in strata nearly vertical, supporting the old red sand
 stone formation in unconformed position*.          But Mr. Griffith
represents the conglomerate of the Monavoullagh as under
lying these older stratified rocks, although they           mainly                         lie          to
the west rather than         the south    the

longing to the carboniferous series, although it is admitted
that the adjacent clayslate is interstratified occasionally with
the limestone, such slate, however, to meet the occasion,
being called a “carboniferous slate *.”
     Nor    does   the dilemma end here. The eastern part of
 Waterford is coloured grey, as indicative of an older transi
 tion series, and the rest of the schistose and conglomerate
 tract, extending to the western extremity of Kerry and north
 of the line already noticed, are coloured purple, as signifying
 a newer transition seriest.
     Now, in the year 1824 I discovered (as before mentioned)
 transition fossils in the south-eastern part of the county of
 Waterford, and in 1833 Mr. Holdsworth observed the same:
 and in 1829 I found other transition fossils in the western part
 of the Dingle peninsula in Kerry; and in 1837 Mr. C. W.                  Ha
 milton discovered them also in another adjacent locality, to the
 list of which Mr. Griffith has since added others. Those col
 lected by myself appeared chiefly referable to such as are found
  in what have since been denominated in England the Cambrian
 and Silurian systems, and the same inference appears dedu
 cible from those later collected. These tracts therefore clearly
 belonging to an ancient transition series, it may reasonably
 be inquired why is the Waterford district coloured grey as
 an older transition series, and that in Kerry purple as a
 newer transition series tº
     Yet in reference to Kerry and part of Cork Mr. Griffith
            .
 also contends Š, that “the red conglomerate of Cahirconree
 and Carrantoohill (Gurrane Tual) mountains, together with
 the coarse red slate of which Tomies and Glenaa mountains
 at Killarney are composed, belong to the old red sandstone
 series;          that the limestone of Killarney, Kenmare, and
  Bantry, belongs to the carboniferous and not to the transition
 series.”     Having advanced so far, if Mr. Griffith had gone a
 step further (which he might have done with just as much
 propriety,) and included the patches of limestone near Skib
  bereen and Courtmacsherry bay also in the carboniferous
 series, the result according to Mr. Griffith's view would be
    * In the new map it will be seen that in the eastern quarter of this
 tract the purple colour is now converted into reddish-brown, as indicative of
 old red sandstone, and in the western quarter chiefly into grey, as denoting
 greywacke slate.
     + But remodelled in the new map, with reddish-brown     as old red sand
 stone in the eastern quarter, and grey as greywacke slate in the western,
  as already mentioned.
     1 In the new map, the greater part of Kerry and a small part of Cork are
  now coloured grey, as greywacke slate.

   In following Mr. Griffith's progress thus far, what is the
result 2. It amounts to this: that with the exception of the east
ern part of Waterford lying between the Monavoullagh range
and the coast, and the southern part of Cork lying south of
the line drawn from near Dursey island past the head of
Bantry bay to Ringabella inlet, both of which (coloured grey)
are referred to an older transition series or to a Silurian series;
all the rest     the schistose and conglomerated rocks, extend

of  his communications,        the old red sandstone formation,
                                              as
                                            Silurian series, (all these

                                               an
lastly,      as   an
                older transition series; while            the bands              all                              of

                                      in                 conglomerated
rocks, from the limestone band             the valley    inthe Bride on          on of
the north,        that occurring
                       to               Bantry bay  in    the south, are
referred      the carboniferous limestone, although admitted
                  to                                                                                              to
be    in direct association with the rocks              which they are      by
bounded+.
    All this undoubtedly sufficiently perplexing
                   is                                               geolo                      to   a

I     now turn         the sections; yet another anomaly claims
                            to
previous attention. All the old red sandstone tracts lying

horizontal scale as twelve to one; which necessarily produces
great distortions in the relative position of the mineral masses”.
   Let us first consider that portion of the section which lies
between the valley of the Suire and the vale of Dungarvan,
the latter of which extends westward to the Blackwater.
With respect to the relative position of the carboniferous
limestone of the valley of the Suire as reposing on old red
sandstone, both on                   its
                            northern and southern sides, there          no                            is
question.     South             of
                          the river, the old red sandstone, which
there forms       narrow border, reposes unconformably

stituting      merely  a cap or sheet formed upon an inclined plane
from west to       east,   the strata corresponding, and succeeding
each other          in
                    that direction to the junction with the carboni.
ferous limestone.                  I
                             know of no such arrangement.        On the
contrary, the strata of the old red sandstone are accumulated
to a great depth, and certainly in some quarters at least to the
level of the sea, if not deeper, being disposed in a gently
arched form from north to south, as may be well observed in
the defiles and glens which penetrate fron the north into the
interior of that mountain range”.             In this series   have not                 I
 observed a     general    dip to the east, the strata even in the most
 eastern quarter (including beds of red clay and red slaty clay)
 still preserving the flat arched arrangement from north to
 south; and it is only at the eastern foot of Slieve Meesh that
 other beds appear dipping to the east of south, and which
  from their dissimilarity altogether to the old red sandstone
  formation of the Slieve Meesh range, I could only view as a
  protruding portion of the subjacent transition rocks continued
   from the west.      I know of no organic remains to invalidate
   this conclusion.     The Spiriferae, Productae, Terebratulae, and
    Crinoidea that I met with were too indistinct to admit of de
    termining the species, but                   I
                                     am mistaken if there be not an
    Orthis among the number; while the Favosites which              no                         I
    ticed I apprehend to be F fibrosa.         This eastern foot of the
    Slieve Meesh is represented by Mr. Griffith as composed of
    a succession of beds of yellow and grey quartzy sandstone,
    dark grey clayslate, sandstone, dark grey clayslate, grey
    quartzy sandstone, alternating limestone and greenish clay
    slate, against which the carboniferous limestone is exhibited
    as abutting in unconformable position t.          The sandstone is
    stated to contain calamites, and the general series to abound
    with the casts of fossils, whose distinctive characters, it is ad
    mitted, it is difficult to recognise, but among them are Pro
    ductae, Spiriferae, Terebratulae, Crinoidea, and corals; and the
   upper beds of the greenish grey clayslate are said to be identi
   cal with those which occur alternating with limestone in the
   peninsula of Muckruss. I confess                            I
                                              have not traced any such
    uninterrupted succession as is here described, the country in
    general being well covered up; but if we suppose it to be
    correct, there is no direct proof that such succession belongs
    to the carboniferous series. From the quarry which I have

   I   º,         here appropriately advert to the remarks made by
Capt. Portlock, R.E., late President of the Geol. Soc. of
Dublin, on Mr. Griffith's arrangement of the strata in the
south of Ireland, as well deserving of the attention of the
latter*.  He observes, that Mr. Griffith's transference of
those strata which were formerly designated as of the transi
tion epoch to the old red sandstone, must be considered as
springing from the generalizations in Devonshire of Professor
Sedgwick and Mr. Murchison. To those generalizations I
have objected in the paper referred to above in the Lond.
and Edin. Phil. Mag. for August 1839; and            have already                I
stated that Mr. Austen started similar objections in the same
month.     But we may proceed a step further, and show that
evidence is not wanting to prove that the older stratified rocks
of Devon and Cornwall belong to an ancient transition series.
The genus Clymenia, discovered and determined by Count
 Münster in the Fichtelgebirge, occurs also in Cornwall and
Devon according to the observations of Mr. Ansted, Professor
 Sedgwick, Mr. Murchison, Mr. De la Beche, and Professor
 Phillips. In the Fichtelgebirge the Clymeniae are accom
panied by Goniatites also, and Count Münster enumerates
 fourteen species of the former and twenty-six species of the
 latter, together with one hundred and eighteen species of
 other fossils; namely, Trilobites 14 species, Serpula 1, Bel
 lerophom 3, Orthoceras 22, Gasteropoda 31, Conchifera 43
  (among which are species of Orthis and Terebratula, but no
 Spirifera, according to M. Von Bucht), Crinoidea 4. This
 tract is referred by Count Münster to an ancient transition
 series, the Clymenia, being confined to         and not occurring    it,
in   the upper strata                  of
                           the country, namely,      the carbonife               in
  rous limestone<U+017F>.    Von Buch also considers this tract and the
  environs         of
               Prague      belonging     as                  to

294   Mr. Weaver             on the Structure        of the        South    of Ireland,
either in the later transition limestones or in the carbonife
rous limestone; while Gonialites on the other hand, he re
marks, are widely spread in strata both of the transition and
carboniferous epochs, extending in the latter series into the
coal formation*.    Now, at South Petherwin in Devon, Pro
fessor Phillips has ascertained that at least four species of
Clymeniae occur, undoubtedly belonging to the same group
as is found in the Fichtelgebirge,     and among these one is
identified as the Clymenia lacvigata of Count Münster. With
these he notices also two species of Goniatites, one of which
belongs to the same group that occurs in the Fichtelgebirget.
But we need not rest here: other decided transition fossils
are met with in the older stratified rocks of Devon and Corn
wall, e.g., various species of Terebratula and Atrypa, namely,
such as occur in the transition tracts of Sweden, in Gothland,
&c., together with species of Orthis, Pterinea, Leptaena lata,
&c., for the general list of which                   I
                                      refer to the work of Mr.
De la Beche already cited, as well as to the observations of
Professor Sedgwick and Mr. Murchison<U+017F>.           I cannot doubt
that more extended researches in Devon and Cornwall will
vastly increase the list, and yet bring to light many facts of
high interests.
   While on the subject of the distribution of organic remains,
I will   add a few remarks on that                   of Goniatites in particular,

    § It is remarkable that Prof. Sedgwick formerly considered the strata
containing the fossils that have been indicated (and which include also Trilo
bites and Orthoceratites), as the lowest fossiliferous rocks in Devonshire and
Cornwall". And yet, according to a later view, originating in the sugges
tion of Mr. Lonsdale, Prof. Sedgwick and Mr. Murchison now include                                   all
the older stratified rocks of Devon and Cornwall under the head           old red         of

                                                    more than what we actually
encounter within the limits of the older stratified rocks of Devon and
Cornwall, respecting which, however,                we
                                               yet require much additional                           in

j                Devon and Cornwall,
in transition and carboniferous strata. If we compare to
        the labours of M. Von Buch, Count Münster, M.
                                                        Belgium, the Eifel, &c.
  eyrich, and Professor Phillips, on this subdivision of the
tribe of the Ammonites, the general result is that in the older
transition rocks the Goniatites met with possess a simple dorsal
                                                                                                          295
lobe, whilst those which occur in the carboniferous series have
a divided dorsal lobe.      If this observation were rigidly exact,
it might   be  adopted as a distinctive character between strata
of the transition and carboniferous epochs respectively; and
it might also be inferred that limestones which contain Gonia
tites, some of which possessed a simple and others a divided
dorsal lobe, might be considered as occupying an intermediate
station, that             is,
                     belonging  as   the later portion
                                                 to         the transi                     of

 possess a divided dorsal, and three a simple dorsal lobe.                Of
 the 33    species,   30 are first made known to us           by   Professor
  Phillips; only three of them having been previously noticed
 by authors, namely, Goniatites sphaericus (Mart.), Gon.                 Lis
 teri (Mart.), and Gon. Henslowi (Sow.)
      I have no doubt, that Professor Phillips, who is so well
  qualified for the task, will give due attention to this subject
 in Devon and Cornwall; and it will be interesting to learn
  in what degree the Goniatites of the carboniferous limestone
 in North Devon, near Barnstaple (e.g., at Swimbridge, where
 they abound), differ from those found in the transition di
  stricts of South Devon and Cornwall.              The same subject de
  serves attention in Ireland”.
      To M. Von Buch we owe the first precise distinction be
  tween Nautili and Ammonitest. The range of the former
  extends, it is well known, from the oldest to the most recent
  of the fossiliferous strata, the genus being still in existence.
  The Ammonites, on the other hand, though equally ancient
  in origin, do not in their range pass beyond the limits of the
  cretaceous group.        To the same distinguished naturalist we
  owe the distribution of the Ammonites into 14 familiest, the
  first and oldest of which, the Goniatites, are characteristic of
  the transition and carboniferous epochs, not extending be
  yond the coal formation; the second, the Ceratites, appear
  confined to the muschelkalk; while the remaining 12 fami
  lies are distributed through the series of formations extending
  from the lias to the chalk inclusive.            But we are indebted,
  primarily, namely, in 1828, to Professor Bronn of Heidel
  berg, for the important observation so conducive to the                 di
  stinction of formations, that no Ammonites with denticulated
  lobes have been found in strata of the transition and carboni
 ferous aeras, such being confined to the formations of a later
  origin.     This remark was publicly made known by Von
 Buch in 1829, nearly at the same time that M. Elie de Beau
 mont was preparing to announce a similar observation made
 by himself; and the remark was shortly after confirmed and
 generalized by Count Münstery.
     * Count Münster considers his Goniatites ovatus, found at Gottendorf
 and Schleitz in the Fichtelgebirge, to be the same as the Ellipsolites (Nau
 tilus) ovatus of Sowerby, which occurs in the Cork band of limestone.
 And he inquires whether some other species described as Nautili by Mr.
 Sowerby might not prove to be Goniatites.

 Dr.   Schafhaeutl on the Different Species                  of Cast Iron,     &c. 297
   M. Deshayes, however, has lately remarked that true Am
monites (with denticulated lobes,               I
                                    presume) have been found
in strata more ancient than the coal formation, namely, in the
environs of Tournay *.
  In    reference to my successive memoirs on the east and
south of Ireland,        I
                      will here add the general remark, that it
has been my endeavour in both to embody in few words the
results of practical experience and observations conducted at
intervals in that country during a lapse of more than forty
years; and in laying them before the public, it has been my
object, in both cases, to exhibit through the medium of con
densed abstracts a compendious view of the relations of the
tracts described, thus relieving the reader from the labour
and tedium of passing through the progressive steps of ex
tended researches.     That a minute examination of the ground
which    I  have trodden may lead to further discoveries, par
 ticularly in respect of the distribution and number of the
 organic remains, I am far from disbelieving, and I shall be
 ready to hail their appearance with pleasure; but as in the
 development of the main relations of the mineral masses I
 have endeavoured to be exact, I may be excused if I do not
 anticipate any very great accession to our knowledge in the
latter respect.

 duum of the Swedish iron will assume the same appearance as
the English, and so in the reverse case; this circumstance ex
 plains why anchors made of English iron, although tougher
than those made of Swedish iron, are almost twice as soon
destroyed by the action of sea water.
    The same rule holds good, when iron, with other chemical
agents, is treated in the dry way.    For instance, at the same
degrees of heat as those in which malleable iron of the specific
gravity 7.4 has combined with the greatest quantity of carbon
necessary for it to become liquid, at the same degree of tem
perature Swedish iron of the specific gravity 7-7 (called Hoop
L), or 7-8 (called double bullet), just begins to crystallize,
forming steel, and sinking down to a specific gravity of 7.5.
    The quantity of the residuums of iron of the same descrip
tion bears a very remarkable relation to the specific gravity of
the acid, as is evinced by the following table, showing the dif
ferent quantity of residuums of 35 grains of Welsh iron from
the Maesteg iron-works, specific gravity 7-407.

to the retort so much hydrochloric acid as to cause a very
moderate evolution of hydrogen.        In the last sample I put
only a few drops of acid into the retort, just sufficient to cause
a very slight attack of the iron.    The third column of       the                                      all

     By treating iron with diluted hydrochloric acid, the sulphur
escapes almost entirely as sulphuretted          hydrogen; the same is
the case with     antimony     escaping  as antimoniuretted hydrogen.
On the contrary, scarcely any portion of the arsenic escapes
with the hydrogen.
     The case is different when iron is treated with nitric acid.
When fragments of iron are treated with nitric acid of such
a specific gravity that the iron is moderately attacked in a re
tort whose beak is connected with a solution of carbonate of
barytes and acetate of copper or lead, and only a slight evo
lution of binoxide of nitrogen takes place, the nitric oxide is
then first absorbed by the air in the uppermost part of the re
tort, and a partial vacuum is produced which makes the liquid
rise in the beak of the retort several inches.            A few hours af.
terwards     pure  azote is   evolved, acting  neither on the carbonate
of barytes nor on the acetates or nitrates of metals.               Shortly
after, the evolution of gas again ceases, and after the action of
the acid on the iron stops, a new partial vacuum is produced
and the liquid is found to stand in the beak of the retort several
inches above its level.
     For example, I took 20 grains of dead gray cast iron from the
forges of Creuzot, departement de Saone et Loire, treated it
with hydrochloric acid specific gravity 11:5, and left residuum
inspection I found those lumps covered with stalks of a black vegetation,
exactly like the mould on ink or sour starch paste, and differing only in
colour; the stalks were from about a half to three-quarters of a line in
height, and terminated with a little knob on the top. The next day the
little knob on the top assumed an orange red, and on further exposure to
the air, the stalks became of the same colour.
    Viewed through the microscope, these little mosses appeared opake, of a
varnished yellow colour like the petals of Everlasting, and having a long
curved cylindric capsule on the end. The capsule was alternately expanded
and contracted very similar to the duodenum of animals, and curved into a
circle, so that the end almost met the point when the capsule was attached
to the stalk; and when viewed under the microscope superficially, the knobs
appeared to consist of a perfect ring fixed to the stalk.   I found only one
stalk, which shot forth two of these capsules from the same point, curved
up just like the horns of a ram. No operculum could be discovered; the end
of the capsule was found perfectly rounded like a globule with rather a nar
row neck, and when pressed with a fine needle, the capsule burst, emitting
extremely fine seeds, exactly like the genus Phascum.     No traces of leaves
 could be detected, unless we reckon some entangled and interwoven black
filaments on the surface of the decomposed iron. Not being sufficiently ac
 quainted with the cryptogamic branch of botany, I am not able to decide
on the generic character of these small vegetations.
    On the retort being packed up in moss and afterwards washed with rain
 water, the seeds of the moss must have been derived from one of these
 sources; but the most extraordinary circumstance is their becoming fixed
 in these decomposed fragments of cast iron, serving as a very fertile mould,
 and growing rapidly in hydrochloric acid gas and sulphuretted hydrogen,

=     7-08 grains.   The    same quantity              of the   same   iron treated
in the above-mentioned manner with nitric acid of 1:10 spe
cific gravity left residuum 3.24 grains; no trace of sulphuric
acid could be discovered in the liquid.       By boiling the re
mainder in a    platinum  crucible with strong  nitric acid, the
greatest part of the sulphur was separated, which adhered
slightly as a yellow riband to the side of the crucible, and no
traces of sulphuric acid were to be found in the solution.  The
sulphur thus separated from 1:55 grains of the residuum
weighed 0-180 grains, and this burnt on a platinum foil left
0.100 sulphuret of iron. That which the nitric acid had
dissolved during the boiling was precipitated with caustic
ammonia and consisted        of

   We see therefore that the sulphur had been in combina
tion with the iron, approaching in this formula Fº S, that is in
a certain well-known state of chemical proportions.
   Another remarkable circumstance is the difference of the
products of solution according to the difference of the specific
gravity of the acid, which throws a light on several chemical
products, which arise from different degrees of concentration
of chemical agents, and the varying products obtained by the
various degrees of heat.
   In hydrochloric acid we have a juxtaposition of atoms of
chlorine and hydrogen intermixed with atoms of hydrogen
and oxygen; and the interposition of a certain quantity of
atoms of water betwixt a certain number of atoms of chlorine
and hydrogen, alone determines how many atoms of the iron
shall combine with chlorine to form protochloride of iron, and
how many atoms of hydrogen shall form compounds with car
bon and azote.
   The description of the residuums left by treating iron with
acid was always a matter of great speculation.       Berzelius
says the remainder of the solution of iron in sulphuric acid
was black, in hydrochloric acid gray, and sometimes white.
   The colour of the residuum, as shown, depends partly on

deemed to possess sufficient interest to induce those who are
curious in these matters to bestow pains in inventing expedi
ents for impressing some particular circuit on the memory, so
as to enable the possessor of this clue to guide the knight
through the mazes of his devious route, without reference to
chart or compass.       In a memoir, which has appeared in
 Frazer's   Magazine   for the present month", which I have
just now seen, a method is recommended for attaining this
object, which consists in designating each square in the board
by a different syllable, composed of certain consonants and
vowels, indicating the horizontal and vertical columns in
which it stands. The whole series of these 64 arbitrary syl
lables, joined into 16 words, pointing out the sequence of the
 squares in the circuit, but void of any other meaning, is re

  istressing than that by which we strive to gain possession of
the chronological epochs of the kings of England, when com
mitting to memory the barbarous cacophonies of Grey's Me
moria Technica.
   It does not seem to have occurred to any of those who have
hitherto favoured the world with the results of their specula
tions, that the problem in question would be rendered more
general, and consequently more curious, by imposing, in ad
dition to the unlimited assignment of any square for the com
mencement of the moves, the further condition that they shall
terminate at any other given square of an opposite colour +.

A great many years ago, contrived a method by which the
problem, in this new and extended form, may be resolved
with the greatest ease; and the attention of the public ha
ving now been again called to the subject by the last-mention
ed paper,      I
               have thought that the communication     of my
method might not be unacceptable; especially as it depends
on a principle which not only furnishes the means of con
structing an incalculable number both of recurrent and of
non-recurrent circuits, but also admits of very general appli
cation to the problem of the knight's move. It is founded on
the following considerations.
   Conceive the chess-board to be divided into four quarters by
a vertical and horizontal line, both passing through    centre,          its

right or left, as the case may be, the circuit of each system
must be gone over in succession, according to that order:
beginning with that system to which the initial square be
longs, and ending with that of the terminal square; taking
care, however, for the reason above given, to avoid endin
the intermediate circuits at a corner square.      It will be                                             ad
visable also to avoid ending these circuits at a square situated
on the borders of the board, for they will not always admit
of a transition being made from them to the next system into
which we have to enter.

thus we here have the first element of the process of copying,

imperfect. The film of copper so thrown down would be so
thin and fragile that it would be impossible to remove it from
the surface of the tin; or if it should acquire any thickness it

heating it and allowing it to cool slowly it becomes tough and

   In this process it is evident that a metallic surface is re
quisite for the commencement of any precipitation of copper;
the arrangement in fact forms a single cell of a Daniell’s bat
tery, and is incomplete with the presence of the surface of the
second metal in the sulphate of copper.
   Mr. Spencer has shown, however, that moulds for the pre
cipitation of copper may be made of any substance by gild
ing them or otherwise covering their surface with a thin film
of metal which affords a conducting surface for the first por
tions of copper to be precipitated upon.             My attention was
early directed to this part of the process, because it seemed to
open a wide field for new and beautiful applications.                  was                   I
induced to pay particular attention to the deposition of copper
upon non-metallic surfaces, and in consequence made nu
merous experiments to ascertain the circumstances most fa
vourable to       precipitation under these conditions. My first

                                        objections, and was besides
very expensive. Subsequently          tried metals, such

not much better than the first trials.

  By this process                   I    was easily enabled to cover the surface
of any article moulded in plaster, sulphur, wax, or any other

whole surface was covered some parts had begun to throw up
little mammillated excrescences of copper which destroyed
the smoothness and regular appearance of the surface.                                                Al

316    Mr.   Smee on the Galvanic Properties      of Metals.
the public a valuable battery, no time is lost, that others may
extend and improve the new principle about to be detailed.
   With regard to the metallic elementary bodies, their pro
perties have been investigated so frequently, and to such an
extent, that it may seem unnecessary to draw attention again
to them; but two circumstances influencing their action have
never been noticed.     It is well known that the positive metal
should be the most readily acted upon by the solution, and
the negative the least, and the further these are apart, the
more forcible will be the battery: thus, carteris paribus, plati
num and zinc are more powerful than iron and zinc ; but if a
circuit be made of a piece of smooth platinum and zinc it will
sometimes happen that the effect is less than when a circuit is
formed by a similar piece of iron. Now this appears at first
sight paradoxical, though it can in many instances be easily
explained; for if the platinum be carefully examined, it will
be seen that the acid solution does not really wet the platinum,
but runs off from the greater part of the surface, as metallic
mercury does from glass.       In this state, a piece of platinum
having a surface of thirty-two square inches, formed into a
battery with amalgamated zinc and connected with a magnet,
supported three-quarters of a pound through five thicknesses
of paper; when the same piece of platinum was heated or
dipped in nitric acid and afterwards well washed, it supported
a similar weight through twelve thicknesses of paper, thus
being less powerful than iron in the first instance, and more so
in the second. In the same way, silver supported under the
like circumstances, the keeper of a magnet through three layers
of paper: on being heated and again wetted, the attractive
force was exerted through nine thicknesses of paper, but no
additional power was gained by removing the surface of the
silver by nitric acid.     The metals in these cases appear to
become coated with a film of air, which effectually prevents
the contact of the fluid. This is also seen in the various forms
of charcoal, which after ignition are very powerful, but lose
much of their force if long exposed to the air; their energy
however is restored upon their being again heated.
   As in the experiments just detailed, and in those which      I
am about immediately to describe, the relative powers of the
arrangements have to be considered, it will be proper to men
tion in what way the results were obtained. A soft iron horse
shoe magnet was suspended, round which covered wire in
communication with the poles of the battery was wound: the
keeper, which weighed three quarters of a pound, was sepa
rated from the poles of the magnet by as many layers of thin
blotting paper as could be used without     its falling; thus with

          and on a new Chemico-Mechanical                                    Battery.                        317
a battery of feeble force few layers of paper could be inter
posed; but with one of greater strength, forty or sixty thick
 .
messes might be used.       A similar form of apparatus might
easily be devised, which would show by means of a delicate
screw the exact distance at which a given weight would be
supported by the attractive force of the induced magnet.
   The influence of different conditions of surfaces is a subject
which has escaped            all
                          experimenters.    Now this        singular,                     is
for many must have noticed, that              circuit, the greatest
                                                              in   a

  ollowing this hint, piece  a     spongy platinum, consisting                                                as

                 infinity          of
                             points, was placed        contact with              in
                                                                                                      a so
amalgamated zinc, when        most violent action    ensued,     that
                                     be a                                  its

cludes it  from   being  thus used,   and therefore       was deter

the finely-divided metal. This experiment was attended with
a similar good result, and the energy        the metal thus coated of

318     Mr.      Smee on the Galvanic Properties            of Metals,
of the many   metals that    I
                            have tried can be used with similar
good results, except palladium, which though it has not much
effect in the sponge, is found when precipitated on platinum
or silver to possess powers, about equal to the finely-divided
platinum.    Precipitated silver increases the power of the me
tals, but not nearly to the extent of platinum.
   Having ascertained that a solution of platinum must be
used for increasing the power of metals in their ordinary
state, it becomes a matter of great importance to ascertain
whether the platinum may be precipitated upon other metals
with advantage;      and for this purpose it was deposited
upon earthenware, palladium, pure silver, copper plated
with silver, nickel, German silver, tin, lead, brass, cast iron,
sheet iron, steel, zinc, and charcoal. The platinized earthen
ware was not found to answer, apparently from the quantity
of the metal not being sufficient to carry the electricity. Pal
ladium, silver, and plated silver answered equally well with
platinum to receive the precipitated metal, and if there was
any difference,     I think the silver was rather the best.      Plated
copper answers very well, but care should be taken to var
nish every copper edge, or else that metal is apt to be slightly
dissolved, and deposited again upon the platinized silver,
which is injurious.       Should copper, from any cause, get upon
the silver, it may be dissolved by a little muriatic acid, and
afterwards by a little strong ammonia.            No other metal or
alloy besides this answered for the reception of the platinum,
except iron, and this was as active as silver for a time, but
then a local battery was formed between the platinum and
iron—the iron was dissolved and the battery destroyed.               In
some cases this does not take place so rapidly as in others.
Carbon answers admirably for the reception of the platinum,
and is improved in like manner.
                                                                ...;
   We have now the elements for the manufacture of a power
ful battery; for we have seen that increase of power is ob
tained by taking care that the negative metal is thoroughl
wetted by the fluid, and that this is not only
but   its power materially increased            by
                                                the numerous points
formed      bythe precipitation   offinely-divided platinum. What
ever metal, alloy,      or  compound may             be

 metal is next to be placed in an acid solution with a little
nitro-muriate of platinum, which metal is to be thrown down
 by the formation of a simple galvanic circuit; and lastly, the
platinized metal is to be formed with amalgamated zinc into
 a battery, either with a porous tube or paper bag, or without
them, according to the fancy of the operator, or the purpose
for which it is wanted.
    The advantage from this form of battery arises, as I believe,
from a mechanical help to the evolution of the hydrogen; and
therefore it is proposed to call it the Chemico-mechanical
battery. This battery may remain in the acid for a length of
time, and neither the amalgamated zinc nor platinized silver
will undergo the slightest change, and the whole will be as
silent as death. Let only communication be made, the liquid
in each cell becomes troubled;—it boils—it bubbles, and
produces the effects which have been detailed. The quan
tity of electricity passing through either wires or liquids
may be pretty accurately judged from the action taking place
in the battery, for if the communication be made through a
liquid of difficult decomposition, or through long small wires
(70 or 80 feet), but little gas will be given off from the pla
tinized metal, but when short thick wires are used the action
is violent. A galvanometer might be constructed of one cell,
similar to the oxygen cell of Professor Daniell, as this would
show the exact amount of electricity passing.
   The importance of constructing a battery that shall be small
in compass, efficient in action, cheap in           operation, andits
devoid    of
           troublesome    manipulation,    important   isthe highest    in
degree; and       Iconsider that my chemico-mechanical battery

neral, there is no need of new facts; it will suffice to read my
memoir on chloracetic acid, which has been so often quoted
for some time. We there see that besides the chloracetic
acid produced by substitution by means of the action of
chlorine on acetic acid, oxalic acid and carbonic acid are de
veloped, the production of which by substitution we may be
at a loss how to explain, at least for the present.
    And better still, it suffices to glance at my memoir relative
to indigo: we there see that the white indigo, under the                                            in
fluence of oxygen, loses an equivalent of hydrogen without
gaining anything.       In this case then there is no substitution;

  The law of substitutions sees then in these five compounds
some  of the nearest, the most necessary modifications of ether.
The  theory  of equivalents sees there any modifications what
ever more or less possible.     The one says, these five bodies
 must be formed first very easily and very abundantly;       the
other says, they may be formed, and many others with them.
     If
      the acetic acid is in question, the theory of equivalents
would besides announce the possible formation of compounds
so numerous, that nothing could guide the observer. The
law of substitutions, more precise, foresees and predicts that
in losing 1, 2, 3 equivalents of hydrogen, the acetic acid will
take 1, 2, 3 equivalents of chlorine, and will thus produce
three new compounds.      One of them constitutes the so-called
chloracetic acid.
     Ina multitude of possible actions which are nearly equally
foreseen by the theory       of equivalents, the law of substitutions
discovers with    certainty    those which are about to be produced;
it foresees them, predicts them, and up to the present time                                 its
help has truly been              of

328              M.         Dumas on the Law                    of Substitutions,           &c.
    These are the foresights, always justified by experience,
which characterize the law of substitutions. If it be connected
with the theory of equivalents, it then results that every
chemical phaenomenon is represented by equivalents, and that
the facts of substitution are chemical phaenomena; that every
possible event in chemistry is translated into the language of
equivalents, and that after all a true fact must be a possible
fact. In the same manner that the possible comprehends the
true, in like manner, and not otherwise, the theory of equiva
lents comprehends the law of substitutions.
    So far,             I
                 have reasoned as if the law of substitutions only
applied in reality to the substitution of hydrogen, which has
furnished the first examples of                                  it.
                                                 But chemists know that
in     an
        organic substance not only can hydrogen undergo sub
stitution, but also oxygen and azote,                   which      would     of             it              be
easy    to cite numerous examples.
    Still more, we can cause carbon                  undergo real substito
tutions, which sufficiently shows how artificial that classifi
             in on of
 cation        organic substances would be, which would rest
solely        the permanency           the number     of  the equivalents        of                         of

     In      organic compound,
            an                               the elements may then                                          be
displaced, and others substituted for them               succession. Those       in
which disappear most easily, abstraction being caused                                                       by
certain conditions           stability which we cannot yet foresee, are
                                        of
those       which the affinities are the most energetic. This
            of                                                                                              is

 the most rebellious, for we know few bodies which can act
 upon carbon and not upon hydrogen.
     In fine,     add that the law

of the law of substitutions, he also, at first, confounded it
with the ordinary equivalent actions; but when          had de        I

A prediction which would have been realised, if so many
minds of a higher order,           up the law of substitutions,
had not   given  it a flight which makes my part of the work
much less   necessary.

source of power in the Voltaic pile. By Michael Faraday, Esq.,
D.C.L., F.R.S., &c., was resumed and concluded.
   The determination of the real source of electrical power in gal
vanic combinations has become, in the present state of our know
ledge of electricity, a question of considerable importance, and one
which must have great influence on the future progress of that
science. The various opinions which have been entertained by phi
losophers on this subject may be classed generally under two heads;
namely, those which assign as the origin of voltaic power the simple
contact of dissimilar substances, and more especially of different
metals; and secondly, those which ascribe this force to the exertion
of chemical affinities. The first, or the theory of contact, was devised
by Volta, the great discoverer of the Voltaic pile; and adopted,
since it was promulgated by him, by a host of subsequent philoso
phers, among the most celebrated of whom may be ranked Pfaff,
 Marianini, Fechner, Zamboni, Matteucci, Karsten, Bruchardat, and
 also Davy;    of allthem bright stars     the exalted galaxy

 The theory       of
                 chemical action was first advanced            by
                                                           Fabroni, Wol
 laston, and Parret; and has been since further developed        Oersted, by
 Becquerel, De      laRive, Ritchie, Pouillet, Schoenbein, and others.

 Volta, proceeds to give an account of various modifications in the
 theory introduced by subsequent philosophers; and also of different
 variations in the views of those who, in the main, have adopted the
 chemical theory.        Being desirous of collecting further and more
 decisive evidences on this important subject, he engaged in the series
 of experimental researches which are detailed in the present
 memoir.
    It is assumed, he observes, by the advocates of the contact theory,
 that although the metals exert powerful electromotive forces at their
 points of mutual contact, yet in every complete metallic circuit,
whatever be the order or arrangement of the metals which compose
of it,
    these forces are                  so
                            exactly balanced                                as

               Action of the Rays of the Solar Spectrum.                                       333
   4. The chemical analysis of the solar spectrum forms the subject
of the next section of his paper. It has long been known that rays
of different colours and refrangibilities exert very different degrees
of energy in effecting chemical changes; and that those occupying the
violet end of the spectrum possess the greatest deoxidating powers.
But the author finds that these chemical energies are distributed
throughout the whole of the spectrum; that they are not a mere
function of the refrangibility, but stand in relation to physical quali
ties of another kind, both of the ray and of the analysing medium;
and that this relation is by no means the same as the one which de
termines the absorptive action of the medium on the colorific rays.
His experiments also show that there is a third set of relations con
cerned in this action, and most materially influencing both the amount
and the character of the chemical action on each point of the spec
trum ; namely, those depending on the physical qualities of the sub
stance on which the rays are received, and whose changes indicate
and measure their action.
     The author endeavoured to detect the existence of inactive                              spaces
in the chemical spectrum, analogous to the dark lines in the lumi
nous one   ; but without any marked success. The attempt, however,
revealed several curious facts. The maximum of action on the most
ordinary description of photographic paper, namely, that prepared
with common salt, was found to be, not beyond the violet, but about
the confines of the blue and green, near the situation of the ray F in
Fraunhofer's scale; and the visible termination of the violet rays
nearly bisected the photographic image impressed on the paper: in
the visible violet rays there occurred a sort of minimum of action,
about one-third of the distance from Fraunhofer's ray H, towards G :
the whole of the red, up to about Fraunhofer's line C appears to be
inactive; and lastly, the orange-red rays communicate to the paper
a brick-red tint passing into green and dark blue. Hence are de
duced, first, the absolute necessity of perfect achromaticity in the
object-glass of a photographic camera; and secondly, the possibility
of the future production of naturally coloured photographs.

384 Royal Society              —Sir John Herschel                     on the Chemical
lity is next investigated; and the author inquires more particularly
into the effects of the combined action of a red ray with any other
single ray in the spectrum; whether any, and what differences exist
between the joint, and the successive action of rays of any two dif
ferent and definite refrangibilities;      and whether this action be ca
pable, or not, of producing effects, which neither of them, acting alone,
would be competent to produce. The result was that, although the
previous action of the less refrangible rays does not appear to mo
dify the subsequent effects produced by the more refrangible; yet
the converse of this proposition does not obtain, and the simultaneous
action of both produces photographic effects very different from those
which either of them, acting separately, are capable of producing.
    8. In the next section, the chemical action of the solar spectrum
is traced much beyond the extreme red rays, and the red rays them
selves are shown to exercise, under certain circumstances, a black
ening or deoxidating power.
    9. The author then enters into a speculation suggested by some in
dications which seem to have been afforded of an absorptive action
in the sun's atmosphere; of a difference in the chemical agencies
 of those rays which issue from the central parts of his disc, and those
which, emanating from            its
                                 borders, have undergone the absorptive
action  of  a much greater depth        his atmosphere; and consequently
                                            of
of  the existence    of   an
                         absorptive    solar atmosphere extending beyond
the luminous one.

noticed by the author in his former communication, that the dark

terposition of a plate of glass in close contact with the photographic
paper.    The influence of various other media, superposed on pre
pared paper, was ascertained by experiment, and the results are                                                              re

the sole exception of silver positive with respect to copper. The
inconsistency of these results with any theory of contact electromo
tive force is then strongly insisted on by the author.
    The next division of the paper treats of the order of the metallic
elements of voltaic circuits when different electrolytes are used. It
is usual to say, that metals are positive or negative with respect to
each other in a certain order; but Davy, and afterwards De la Rive,
showed that, in certain cases, this order must be inverted.                  The
author, by using ten metals and seven different exciting electrolytic
solutions, shows that in no two solutions is the order the same ; but
that changes of the most extreme kind occur in exact conformity
with the changes in chemical action, which the use of the different
solutions occasions.
    The next division of the paper considers the very numerous cases
in which voltaic circuits, often such as are able to effect decompo
sition, are produced without any metallic contact, and by virtue of
chemical action alone; contrasting them with the numerous cases
given in the previous series, where contact without chemical action,
whether it be the contact of metal with metal, or with chemically
inactive electrolytes, can produce no voltaic current.
    There then follows a consideration of the sufficiency of chemical
action to account for all the phenomena of the pile.                It is shown
that chemical action does actually evolve electricity; that according
as chemical action diminishes or ceases, so the electrical current di
 minishes or ceases also ; that where the chemical action changes
from side to side, the direction of the current likewise changes with
 it; that where no chemical action occurs, no current is produced,
 but that a current will occur the moment chemical action com
 mences; and that when the chemical action which has, or could
 have produced a current                   is,

as M. Dumas       arriving
                         in     the discovery   atthe production      pond  of                             of

gas from the acetates. He endeavours to show that if they have
both arrived at the same conclusion, the means by which they have
done so are peculiar to each and have nothing in common. On this
subject M. Persoz recites several passages from a memoir which he
sent in January 1838, under the title of On the necessity of distin
guishing in chemical actions the phaenomenon of displacement from those
of alteration; this memoir is still unpublished, and M. Dumas has
declared that he was unacquainted with it; it contains the details
of experiments, from which M. Persoz states it clearly results—
   1st. That acetone contains two volumes of oxide of carbon.
   2nd. That protocarburetted hydrogen gas is derived from acetone,
and not from acetic acid, and consequently that the protocarburetted
hydrogen which arises from the decomposition of the acetates, can
not be as M. Dumas supposes the immediate product of the decom
position of acetic acid by hydrate of potash; but, on the contrary, a
consecutive secondary product resulting—
   a. From the action which heat exerts on acetic acid, whether in
a free state or combined with bases.
   b. From the action which water exerts on acetone, one of the
immediate products of the action of heat on acetic acid (MM. Liebig
and Pelouze).
   3rd. That this pond gas is formed by the disappearance of two
volumes of oxide of carbon, and the assimilation of two volumes of
hydrogen, derived from 1 eq. decomposed water.
   From the preceding statements, M. Persoz adds, it is evident that
he has not adopted the views of M. Dumas in explaining the forma
                                                         of its

                                    of      substitutions, justifies the
statement which               he

 an alkali, M. Dumas has not excluded the action which heat exerts
 upon acetic acid, and has thus neglected the compounds which re
 sult from      it.
                  He has, moreover, considered the formation            pond                  of
 gas  as the product        simple action, whereas

ofa   complex one. Lastly, M. Dumas has completely neglected the
 action which water may exert, which                       in

stated to exist between the final product of         the action of chlorine on
protocarburetted        hydrogen,  and the final product of the action of
chlorine on chloroform: a final product which is represented by C*
Cls, and obtained in the first case by the loss of eight volumes of
hydrogen, replaced by eight volumes of chlorine, and in the second
case by the loss of two volumes of hydrogen, replaced by Cl”.
    It appears to M. Persoz that in this case M. Dumas has con
founded a phaenomenon of alteration with a phaenomenon of dis

of   protocarburetted    hydrogen with an excess of oxygen, there are
obtained four volumes of carbonic acid containing four volumes of
oxygen equivalent to eight volumes of hydrogen, there occurs in
this fact an additional proof in favour of the theory of substitutions,
and that eight volumes of hydrogen being taken from C*H* they
ought to be replaced by four volumes of oxygen                     Will carbonic
 acid be ever confounded with protocarburetted hydrogen in the same

 ON ARSENIC CONTAINED NATURALLY              IN THE HUMAN BODY.
      M. Orfila has readmemoir
                             a      the above subject before the Royal
                                                on
 Academy      Medicine; the experiments detailed were made with M.
                 of
 Couerbe, and their object was      solve the following questions:
                                                to
    1st, Does arsenic exist originally    the human body  in2ndly, Do                      ?

 proved? 4thly,        possible
                        Is  it                 to
                                   determine that the arsenic obtained
 from   acorpse     not that which originally existed among the ele
                       is

  organs, applied    the exterior, &c.

      I. Arsenic exists in human bones; if the bones of an adult be
  calcined, taking care not to raise the temperature too high, and to
  avoid contact with the fuel, these bones, when reduced to powder
  and treated with purified sulphuric acid, and then tried in Marsh's
  apparatus, will yield brown, brilliant and thick arsenical spots. This
  result was obtained both from the bones of corpses of adults who
  had been dead some days, or buried for some months.
     When the calcination is effected at a white heat, no arsenic is ob
  tained, nor is any procured from the bones of commerce reduced
  to a soft paste; but if they be subjected to heat and the processes
  indicated (nitric acid, potash and sulphuric acid), a certain quantity
  of arsenic is obtained.
     From this first series of experiments, which amount to fourteen,
 I  conclude, says M. Orfila, 1st, That the bones of the human adult,
  of the horse, ox, and sheep contain minute portions of arsenic, which
 it is possible to discover by treating the bones with potash purified
  by alcohol and pure sulphuric acid.
     2ndly, This quantity of arsenic is not increased by long burial.

 occasioned      by  the volatilization which        occasions.
                                                             it

 no arsenic      isdiscoverable.

    From these facts we may conclude, observes M. Orfila, but not
positively, that the viscera             not originally contain arsenic;

acid and tested           by
                        Marsh's apparatus, gave white opake spots; some
were brilliant, with           a    blueish        tint; others were yellow, and had                        an

arsenical appearance; dissolved in boiling nitric acid, they gave no al
liaceous smell when put on red-hot charcoal; in fact, they possessed
none of the characteristics of arsenic. These spots were, however,
very numerous; submitted for nearly twenty days to a current of sul
phuretted hydrogen gas, they gave no indication of arsenic. It is pos
 sible that they were a mixture of arsenic and animal matter, and that
the muscular flesh of two or three bodies might yield some by ana
lysis; lastly, other processes may discover it in the same quantities
as those employed, by occasioning less loss; therefore, adds M. Orfila,
I will not conclude, positively, that arsenic does not exist in muscu
lar flesh.
    IV. It is possible to ascertain that the arsenic which may be dis
covered does not come from the organic substance itself, but that
it has been combined with it by absorption. For if it be found in
the bones, it will not be removed by long boiling in water, unless
it had been introduced; and the same holds good with respect to the
blood and the organs which have been examined.
    Lastly, if the muscles yield spots, some of which resemble arsenic
 at first sight, the distinctive characters which have been stated
 must be remembered; and if the subject had taken arsenical re
 medies, this circumstance ought to be particularly attended to.—

LVII.   On the Boulder Formation, or drift and associated
  Freshwater Deposits composing the Mud-cliffs of Eastern
  Norfolk. By CHARLEs LYELL, Esq., V.P.G.S., F.R.S., &c.”
THE    cliffs extending from Happisburgh or Hasborough
  light-house to near Weybourne, north-west of Cromer, in
Norfolk, comprising a distance of about 20 miles, are desig
nated in some maps as “the mud-cliffs.”           They are for the
most   part composed    of deposits of two   kinds,   first, stratified
and unstratified drift, called by some “diluvium;” secondly,
freshwater strata. Both of these rest on chalk, which is usually
concealed below the level of the sea. Occasionally between the
chalk and drift or the chalk and freshwater beds, a thin layer
is found of marine crag, agreeing in            fossils with that its                            of
Norwich, but occurring only          patches      small extent, ex  of

346                  Mr. Lyeli           on the Boulder Formation,
     The freshwater strata associated with the boulder forma
tion above mentioned occur for the most part in patches at the
bottom of the drift, and immediately above the subjacent chalk
and crag, where the latter is present, as may be seen at a va
riety of places between Happisburgh and Runton near Cro
mer. The two spots where it is most largely developed are
at Mundesley and Runton.            At the latter place it underlies
the drift and rests immediately on chalk, with the occasional
 intervention of marine crag; while at Mundesley it occupies
 for a certain space the whole cliff, taking the place as it were
 of the drift, and appearing in part to be of contemporaneous
 origin, and in part of subsequent date and superimposed.
 Everywhere it contains the same species of shells, and as these
 are almost without exception identical with well-known Bri
 tish species, it is evident that the entire formation of the mud
cliffs, whether freshwater or drift, belongs to the latest part of
 the tertiary period, the only doubt being whether it should
not rather be considered as post-tertiary or referable to a class
 of deposits which contain exclusively shells of recent species.
     Imention at once this conclusion, because the recent origin
of the drift adds a peculiar interest to the great derangement
                                                                                                   of its
and change of position which it has undergone since
deposition.          In     no

 the  sea has been continually encroaching on the cliffs, I found
 after  an interval of ten years that a different section of the
 same beds was exhibited, and some difficulties cleared up
              I
 which had been unable to explain on my first visit. Never
 theless a high beach precluded me at both periods from ob
 taining a view of the lowest beds, which are sometimes ex
 posed in winter at low water, and after storms. During my
 last visit in particular (1839) the prevalence of easterly gales
prevented my seeing in some places no less than 12 feet in
vertical height of the section which was visible in the summer
of     1829.
       The principal
                   deposit which constitutes the mud cliffs of
 Eastern Norfolk is strictly analogous in character to that which
 has been called the “boulder formation” in Denmark and

 it,forms         so

till between laminated beds of clay and loam are not unfrequent.
In 1839, I saw at a spot between the two lighthouses, till rest
ing on stratified clay and covered by stratified gravel and
white chalk rubble, which latter formed the top of the cliff.
  Owing to the continual dilapidation of the cliffs the details
of the sections              seen by me in                   1829 and 1839                       were very               dif
ferent. During my last visit the beach at Hasborough was
too high to allow me to see the fundamental bed of lignite
which exists there, which in June 1829 was exposed at low
water, the descending section being then as follows: 1st, sand
and loam, 13 feet; 2ndly, unstratified mud or till varying
from 8 to 16 feet; 3rdly, laminated sand and clay, one foot
and a half, part of the clay being bituminous and inclosing
compressed branches and leaves of trees. The clays, which
were blackish, greenish or brown, contained occasional layers
of small pebbles, rounded and angular, mostly of chalk flint.
The entire height of the cliff was about 35 feet.
   This locality has been mentioned by various authors as the
principal site of the submarine forest of East Norfolk, which
has been described as occurring about the level of low water;
and Mr. R. C. Taylor observes of this deposit generally,–
“That it     consists of forest peat, containing        cones and fragments       fir                                      of
bones;  in  others     woody clay; and elsewhere

350               Mr. Lyell      on the Boulder Formation,
on ‘the knowl,” a bank 20 miles off shore, brought up an entire tusk of
an elephant nine feet six inches long.     The elephants must have been
abundant; I have at least 70 grinders, and the oyster dredgers reported
that they had fished up immense quantities and thrown them into deep
water, as they greatly obstructed their nets *.”
     Mr. Woodward had previously spoken of the       oyster        same
bed, which was discovered off Hasborough in the year 1820,
and says that during the first twelve months, many hundred
 specimens of the molar teeth of the elephant were dredged up
by the fishermen, and that the remains of upwards of 500
animals must have been found theref.
    I was not so fortunate either here or elsewhere on this coast
as to see the stools of trees erect in this stratum, but so many
independent eye-witnesses have lately described them to me
with such minuteness as to leave in my mind no doubt of the
 fact. Besides the accounts of several fishermen, Mr. Simeon
 Simons of Cromer states, that at Cromer he saw ten or more
trees in the space of half an acre exposed below the cliffs
eastward of that town, the stumps being a few inches, or all
less than a foot in vertical height, some of them no less than
9 or 10 feet in girth, the roots spreading from them on all
sides throughout a space twenty feet in diameter. Many others
were seen by him laid open on the beach opposite Sidestrand,
about three miles further to the eastward, evidently belonging
also to a submerged forest.      All these roots were in a lami
                        i.
nated blue clay, with associated blue sand, the whole, six or
seven feet thick, resting on chalk.     In one place a thin layer
of Norwich crag intervenes between the chalk and the bed of
blue clay with              Shells had been found immediately
                             I
below the roots, but have been unable to obtain them.
     I ascertained that at Woolcot Gap, between Hasborough
and Bacton, the bed of lignite, containing the bones of ele
phants, pieces of wood, and the roots of trees in situ, had been
exposed at the base of the cliff in the preceding winter of
 1838–39.     A mass of incumbent drift about 30 feet thick
must have been removed by the waves and currents, in order
to lay open this lignite on the spot alluded to, and the great
extent of the submerged forest is proved not only by the nu
merous points between Paling and Runton, which are about
 18 miles apart, reckoning by the sea-coast, and nearly as far in
a direct line, but also by the proofs afforded of      extension   its
inland      proportion
             in           the overlying beds are swept away
                              as                                                by
denudation.
  It   follows then from the facts above stated that the chalk
in  this region had been overspread with layers        sand and    of

clay, and converted into dry land, on which forest trees lived;
these were afterwards submerged, broken off short near their
roots, and buried with their branches and leaves.    The sub
sidence implied by the submergence of the forest continued
afterwards, so as to allow of the superposition of a consider
able thickness of stratified and unstratified drift.
  The general character of the cliffs between Hasborough
and Bacton Gap, a distance of about three miles, may be thus
described: first, at the bottom, the lignite or forest bed, a few
feet thick; secondly, above this, blue argillaceous till, con
taining boulders ygranite and quartz and small pieces of
shells from the Norwich crag; thirdly, laminated blue clay
resting on the till; fourthly, stratified yellow sand, the entire
height       of the cliffs being between 30 and 40                          feet.
     The cliffs between Bacton Gap and Mundesley,                                       a distance
of about three miles, are higher, but consist in like manner
of drift containing a great variety of boulders, this being
usually the lowest bed which is visible.   Here we first meet
with fine exemplifications of strata which have undergone
great derangement since their original deposition, and which
present that most perplexing phaenomenon the superposition of
bent and folded beds upon others which appear to have under
gone no dislocation.   Thus for instance the annexed section
(fig.     1.)

horizontal beds, and apparently the till also, of which the sur
face is so even, have not participated in these movements even
in the smallest degree, we are compelled to suppose that some
lateral force has been exerted against the upper masses of
drift which has not been applied to the lower ones. Yielding
beds having a thickness of at least 15 or 20 feet must in some
cases have been subjected to this sideway pressure and moved
 bodily; and it is impossible to conceive that any original irre
gularity in the mode of deposition, nor any shrinking or set
 tling of the materials, nor anything in short but mechanical
 violence, could have produced such complicated folds. Com
 monly we are in the habit of attributing such movements to
 a subterranean force acting from below, but it is difficult to
 imagine how such agency could have disturbed the overlying
 beds without affecting the subjacent.       I shall defer to the se
 quel the consideration of the various hypotheses which may
 be suggested to account for such appearances, first describing
 other irregularities and apparent anomalies which present
 themselves in this same line of cliffs.
      At one spot between Bacton and Mundesley, where the
 cliff is 50 feet high, I observed at a depth of 30 feet from the
  top, a small pit or furrow as it were cut into strata of blue
  clay, and filled with fragmentary white chalk and chalk flint,
  regular strata of sand and loam being superimposed.             This
  indentation was four feet deep and six wide, and precisely
  resembles those irregularities which we see in superficial
 gravel; and they may                  all

chalk in situ at Mundesley at low water. In 1829 I ob
served a mass of the till prolonged in such a way into the
freshwater formation at the southern junction of the latter
with the drift as to imply the contemporaneous origin of the
lower part at least of both formations. (See diagram, fig. 2.)

 Yet      I  inclined then to the conclusion that the Mundesley
 formation, which I traced for nearly 300 yards along the
 coast, might, as a whole, be considered as the deposit of a
 lake or hollow excavated in the drift.                     In 1839, when a new
 section had been laid open by the sea, it appeared to me
 rather that these strata of Mundesley were simply a large
 development of those observable at the base of the cliff at
  Hasborough and other places, and that their position rela
 tively to the drift might be represented by the diagram, fig. 3.

                       Position of the freshwater   beds at Mundesley.
     We      may imagine that while the coast was sinking gradually,
  a small        river may have entered here bringing down drift
  wood, freshwater shells, mud, and sand, and the flow of the
  stream may have partially counteracted those causes by the
  influence of which the boulder formation was accumulating
  in the spaces immediately contiguous.                      The following is a list
  of the shells which I obtained from the Mundesley beds,                       in
  cluding some which Mr. Fitch of Norwich, and others which
  Mr.     J.  B. Wigham have kindly communicated to me: 1.                     Pa

Alder, Newcastle Trans.; 10. Cyclas pusilla; 11. C. cornea.
   Specimens of Unio or Anodon occur, but too imperfect to
be determined; one however resembles A. cygneus.
   Of the eleven shells above enumerated, the only one which
is unknown as a living species is the Paludina minuta, found
by Mr. Strickland in a freshwater deposit at Crophorn, in
Worcestershire, and also by Mr. Wood at Stutton on the
Stour in Suffolk. Mr. George Sowerby, who has examined
this species for me, finds that among recent species it agrees
most nearly with the Turbo thermalis, Lin, as         volutions                         its

     of growth were extremely minute; the species was not
striae
determined.  The scales of the perch were very numerous, but
they did not agree in a satisfactory manner with those of the
common British Perca fluviatilis which we were able to pro
cure. The cilia of the free edges were proportionally smaller
and blunter in the fossil, and the divisions in the fan at the
basal extremity were longer and more numerous.          But a
more extensive comparison might perhaps have enabled us
to identify these fossil scales with those of the living European
perch.    Most of the vertebrae and ribs may probably belong
to this same fish.
   Mammalia. —I was informed at Mundesley, that many

 R. C. Taylor, who had opportunities of observing them                                                       at
low tide as being continuous with the solid bed of chalk ex
tending under the sea for nearly a mile from Trimmingham
 to Sidestrand, constituting everywhere under water a level
 platform.     He also says that the chalk of this platform con
 tains throughout parallel strata of flint, is harder than that of
 Cromer or Norwich, is characterized by several peculiar fossils,
 and occupies, he thinks, a higher place in the series than the
 chalk at Norwich *.
    Now the platform here alluded to is evidently what the
 sea has left after sweeping away by gradual denudation                                                      all

        now      conjecture
                  to             what height the chalk thus removed
                                            to
 may once have risen. The most southern                  the three protu          of
 berances before mentioned occurs near the Beacon hill, about
 half way between Mundesley and Trimmingham, and                                                   it   is   in

of contact with the chalk. In the diagram it will be seen that
from the projecting point of chalk the cliff retires in a series
of ledges and small precipices in which inclined beds of drift,
i, d, are exposed for an aggregate thickness of several hun
dred feet.     At the top of the cliff, which I conjecture to be
about 400 feet above the sea, the beds of sand seemed to be
horizontal, but these it should be observed are not imme
diately over the inclined beds.         Respecting the tilted beds
which are in contact with the chalk, it will be sufficient to say
that they consist of gravel, sand, clay and loam like the stra
tified drift before described, that the clays are occasionally
finely laminated, and that broken fragments of Norwich cra
 shells are dispersed through some of the strata; but there are
 no signs here of the freshwater or lignite beds.
    The second or middle protuberance of chalk is near that
 last described:       its

beach, the clay, containing broken chalk flints, being traceable
for seven feet under the chalk.        It is known to have extended
formerly much further in a seaward direction.             It appeared
to me   impossible   that any   landslips   or movements of the pre
sent cliffs could have   given   rise to this inverted position of the
chalk and newer formation.           Some persons employed in the
Preventive Service assured me that the cliffs immediately
above and behind this chalk are upwards of 400 feet high,
but they appeared to me less elevated. They also said that
in digging a well at Trimmingham at the top of the cliff they
reached chalk at a depth of 120 feet from the surface. With
out insisting on the precise accuracy of their measurements, I
think it by no means improbable that the three protuberances
of chalk may belong to a much larger mass, which still forms
the nucleus         of,
                   the hill called Trimmingham Beacon, and                                  I

360                   Mr. Lyell       on the Boulder Formation,
event.    Although there is an obvious connexion between the
amount of derangement of the newer strata and their proximity
to the outliers of chalk,                   I
                              saw nevertheless no signs of the
masses of solid chalk     having  pierced the newer beds, as if
forced  through   them;  on the  contrary, it appeared to me in
every case, that the lowest bed of the drift, whether inclined at
a high angle or vertical, conformed everywhere to the surface
of the chalk, as if the same bed might have been originaliy
in contact with it when horizontal. The chalk itself appears to
have been in a flexible state, and therefore     beds    flint are         its            of
variously bent.
    Proceeding northwards from Trimmingham, we find the
cliffs near Overstrand, about      mile S.E.    Cromer, entirely

                   of

place called Sidestrand, where the cliff, composed of drift, is
120 feet high. When I was there the base of the cliff was
concealed by a high beach; but when this is removed, beds
of laminated blue clay and sand, 6 or 7 feet thick, make their
appearance, in which are some trunks of trees 3 feet in diame
ter, broken off to within a few inches of the roots, which spread
for a distance of several feet on all sides.   At one point near
the bottom of this cliff a stratum of    clay  has been seen, in
which freshwater shells of the genus Unio, apparently U. ovalis,
abound.
     Atthe town of Cromer itself, Mr. Simons has observed be
neath the drift, several feet below low-water mark, a bed of
lignite, in which were found the seeds of plants, and the wing
case   of a    beetle.
    Norwich crag at Cromer.—At a still lower level than the
freshwater beds last mentioned, and only exposed at very low
 water, is a thin bed of Norwich crag in situ, about one foot
thick, resting immediately on the chalk. It was barely visible
at low tide on the west side of the jetty when I visited Cromer,
but with the assistance of Mr. Simons, I obtained many frag
ments in which pebbles, sand, and shells were aggregated to
gether by a ferruginous cement. The most abundant shells
were the Purpura crispata, Min. Con., Tellina solidu<U+017F>a, and
Littorina littorea, both the common form and the variety
called L. squalida; I found also a Fusus contrarius and F.
striatus, and Cyprina islandica, but I could detect no small
or delicate shells, and the deposit had the appearance of
having been formed in a shallow sea, and not in still water.
   Although the deposit at Cromer varies slightly at each new
spot where we examine                it,
                                  appears from repeated observa

From the freshwater beds at Runton.     The two middle figures are of the natural

    Neither here nor at Mundesley was I able to find Cyrena
trigonula, which however we might have expected to discover
in these beds, as it accompanies a similar assemblage of shells
from various localities in Suffolk and Essex.
    I found no remains of insects in the black earth, but the
Hon. and Rev. R. Wilson, of Ashwell Thorpe, showed me in
his collection, in 1838, the elytra of beetles of the genus                Do
macia, preserving their colours, which he had found several
years before at Runton.            I observed the scales of perch and
of other fish resembling those of Mundesley in the black earth.
 Mr. Simons has also found fragments of the scapula and horns
 of a deer in the black earth.
    In general it is most difficult to speak with certainty                 re
 specting the position of fossil bones of quadrupeds derived
 from the mud cliffs, because they have been picked up at the
 base of the cliff after portions of it had been washed away by
 the sea. It is the opinion, however, of collectors that they
 are chiefly derived from strata, in which the lignite and sub
 merged trees occur.         The remains are those of the elephant,
 rhinoceros, hippopotamus, horse, ox, pig, beaver, deer, &c.
  At Cromer and Weybourne some mammalian bones occur in
 the crag, but they are commonly more rolled and worn than
 those derived from the lignite deposits.                 Unfortunately no
 <U+017F>reshwater shells have yet been obtained from precisely the
 same bed as that in which the bones of the elephant and
 other extinct quadrupeds are met with, nor from the stratum
 in which the stools of buried trees are enveloped. The fiesh
 water shells of Mundesley and Runton, although they may
 probably belong to the same formation, are not yet proved to
 be strictly coeval with the extinct quadrupeds.                The present
 state, therefore, of our knowledge would not enable us to enter
 into minute details in regard to the order of superposition of
  the beds between the chalk and drift in the mud cliffs, but it
 would appear that the principal site of the bones of extinct
  mammalia as well as        of the buried forest and lignite is be

    Crag at Runton.—In the patches of marine crag below the
freshwater at Runton, the following shells have been found
and presented to me by Mr. Simons: 1. Fusus striatus.

    The most singular and important circumstance connected
with the great outlier of chalk at Old Hythe is the fact of                                                  its
being perfectly disunited from the subjacent horizontal chalk.
I  could not myself positively determine this point either                                                   in
1829      or 1839, because there was          talus      the base

                     in                         storm, Mr. Simonsa                                           vi

     Crag near Weybourne.—It is not until we arrive within less
 than two miles of Weybourne, that the Norwich crag appears
 in considerable force in situ above the level of the sea, in a
 cliff about 30      feet high, between Old Hythe Gap and Wey
 bourne.      At two different points I observed the chalk in con
 tact with several feet of shelly sand and clay containing peb
 bles and the fossils of the Norwich crag without any inter
 vening breccia or “pan.”              This crag was covered with clay
 and loam without shells.
    About half      a  mile from Cliffend, Weybourne, the following
 section appeared, in a vertical cliff about 40 feet high, where
 I  saw the greatest thickness of crag abounding in shells:
 1st, horizontal chalk with flints, 8 feet; 2ndly, sand and flint
 pebbles with crag shells, 1 foot; 3rdly, fine sand with perfect
crag shells, 10 feet; 4thly, sand and pebbles without shells,
3 feet; 5thly, unstratified clay or till with flints, 10 feet.
    The following is a list of the shells obtained from this crag:
Fusus striatus, Littorina littorea, L. squalida (var. of prece
ding?), Purpura crispata, perhaps var. of P. lapillus, Cyprina
islandica, Cardium edule, Cardium echinatum ? Tellina obliqua,
T. solidula, Nucula Cobboldiar, Mya arenaria? Mactra, Astarte.

 372            Mr. Lyell  on the Boulder Formation,
 Norwich crag, which is rarely more than one or two feet thick,
 except near Weybourne.         Upon the crag, and where this is
 wanting immediately upon the chalk, rests here and there a
 lignite and freshwater formation, which varies in thickness
 from five to ten feet and upwards.         It is seen at intervals
 throughout the whole line of cliff from Hasborough to Run
 ton.    In some places it resembles a bed of lignite, in others
 a black earth like that found in connexion with peat, while
 occasionally it consists of gravel, sand, clay, and marl, such
 as may be met with in any lacustrine deposit.          In certain
 localities it contains the stools of trees, which remain in the
 position in which they originally grew, and which could only
 have been buried under the strata now incumbent on them
 by the submergence of what was once dry land. At Mun
desley the freshwater formation is about 40 feet thick and
occupies the whole cliff.               -
    As both the crag and freshwater formations are extremely
discontinuous in the mud cliffs, we sometimes find the one
and sometimes the other in immediate contact with the chalk,
while in many places both are wanting, and then the chalk
is covered exclusively by drift, of which the great mass of
the mud cliffs is composed.          A cursory observer, indeed,
might see nothing but drift from Hasborough to Cromer,
except at Trimmingham, where the protuberances of chalk
occur; and the section north of Cromer would seem to pre
sent little more than the same drift, with a slight exposure of
chalk on the sea beach.          The thin stratum of freshwater
origin and the subjacent marine crag are most commonly
hidden by the beach, or by the sea, except at low water.
    Age of the crag.—As to the age of the crag, it agrees with
that of Norwich in the species of marine shells which it con
tains, and the occasional presence of land shells and the
rolled bones of mammalia.        From the various localities above
enumerated, I obtained the following eleven species of shells:
Purpura crispata, Fusus striatus and contrarius, Littorina
littorea and squalida, Scalaria graenlandica, Natica helicoides,
Nucula Cobboldiae, Cardium edule, Cyprina islandica, Tellina
obliqua, T. solidula, and Mya arenaria & All of these are
known as recent except three, Fusus striatus, Tellina obliqua,
and Nucula Cobboldiae.        It would be rash however to pre
tend to determine the     per  centage of recent species from so
small a number, and the late discovery of Natica helicoides,
one of the eleven, in a living state, should make us careful
not to assume, when reasoning on these more modern de
posits, that we have acquired a perfect acquaintance with the
present Fauna of our seas.

    Age of        the freshwater deposit.—Next, as to the age of the
freshwater         beds, we know as yet too little of the species of
mammalia, fish, insects, and plants, which are imbedded in
them in considerable abundance, to entitle us to lay much
stress on their evidence alone. But we have from Mundesley
and Runton, at least nineteen species of shells in an excellent
state of preservation, namely, Paludina vivipara, P. impura,
P. minuta, Valvata piscinalis, V. cristata, Limnea palustris,
 L. stagnalis, L. glutinosa, L. peregra, Planorbis vorter, P.
imbricatus, P. albus, P. marginatus, P. laevis, Alder, Ancylus

little doubt that the freshwater mussels                   Mundesley and  of

coast of Norfolk.           Into this estuary or bay one or many
rivers   entered,    and in the strata then formed were imbed
ded the remains of animals and shells of the land, river,
and sea.      Certain parts of this area seem at length to have
been    changed     from sea into low marshy land, either be
cause the sea was filled up with sediment, or because                                                 its

miles, chiefly opposite to Beeston Hill*.
  The author just cited truly remarks, that this singular as
semblage of boulders must have been dislodged from the
wasting cliffs, of which the softer and finer materials have
been removed by currents, for similar boulders are occasion

    In different parts of the interior of Norfolk, boulders weigh

   I  stated in the first edition of my Principles of Geology
that I was unable in 1829 to draw a line of demarcation be
tween the crag and the drift or diluvium.         The Rev. W. B.
 Clarke afterwards insisted on the distinctness of the two for
mations f, in which opinion I now concur, although                am                             I

and between Southwold and Yarmouth,             say where the crag        to
ends and the stratified drift   begins.    But this difficulty arises
 from the absence      fossils      of
                                  the crag     well inthe drift, and     as         as

376                  Mr. Lyell        on the Boulder Formation,
some granitic boulders are floated in ice from the distant
 shores of Labrador into the Gulf of St. Lawrence, while
 other large fragments of rock, together with much gravel and
sand, are firmly frozen into ice and carried down every winter
 by various rivers into the same gulf.           As the part of Canada
where this drift is now         forming    corresponds     in latitude to
that of Norfolk, the adoption of this theory of ice-drift does
not of necessity require us to assume the former existence of
a colder climate than that now prevailing in North America.
    Dr. Mitchell, in a paper on the Drift of Norfolk, Suffolk,
&c., (Geol. Proc., vol. iii., p. 5) has suggested that the ma
terials have been in great part derived from the destruction
of strata which once occupied the site of the German Ocean.

378            Mr. Lyell   on the Boulder     Formation,
   By landslips and slides.—The last remark leads naturally
to the consideration of every combination of causes which can
give rise to great disturbance in the overlying beds, while the
 stratification of those below remains even and unchanged.
 For striking examples of this phaenomenon the reader is
referred to figures 1 and 13, in which the superposition of
 vertical to horizontal drift, and of huge fragments and needles
of chalk to horizontal chalk and crag, are clearly exhibited.
 In order to explain these sections, we may imagine that banks
of mud and sand existed beneath the sea in which channels
were occasionally excavated by currents.         In banks of this
kind off Great Yarmouth, a broad channel sixty-five feet deep
was found in 1836, where there had been only a depth of four
feet in 1822*.     Ifthe cliffs of loam or sand bounding this new
channel give way, large masses may descend bodily and as
sume a vertical or curved position.       They may easily escape
subsequent denudation, because the direction of the currents
are constantly shifting.     Thus strata which have assumed a
vertical   position may be forced laterally against the opposite
sides of the channels, where the beds have remained horizontal.
Both the juxtaposition of vertical and horizontal beds, and
the superposition of disturbed to undisturbed strata, may be
caused in this manner. The constant descent of strips of land
into river beds in the deltas of the Indus, Ganges, and            Mis
sissippi, on the subsiding of the annual inundations, are well
known, and may give rise to analogous effects.
    During the late landslip near Axmouth on the 24th of
December 1839, a lateral movement took place, by which
masses of chalk and green sand, which had been undermined,
were forced more than forty feet in a seaward direction, and
thrown into great confusion, while the subjacent lias was not
disturbedt. The pressure moreover of the descending rocks
urged the neighbouring strata extending beneath the shingle
of the shore, by their state of unnatural condensation, to burst
upwards in a line parallel to the coast, by which means an ele
vated ridge more than a mile in length, and rising more than
forty feet, has been made to form an extended reef in front of
the present range of cliffs. This ridge when it first rose was
covered by a confused assemblage of broken strata and               im
mense blocks of rock, invested with sea-weed and corallines,
and scattered over with shells, star-fish, and other productions
of the deep.

  +  I have been indebted to the kindness of the Rev. W.D. Conybeare for
a description and section of this landslip, which I have published in the

   We may imagine in like manner masses of chalk and over
lying drift to have fallen from cliffs, and to have been forced
sideways over a floor of horizontal chalk; but it appears to
me impossible, even if we adopt this hypothesis, to explain
how the Old Hythe pinnacle of chalk (see p. 367) became en
veloped by drift, and this drift in great part vertical and rest
ing on horizontal crag and chalk. It seems necessary first to
suppose that a needle of chalk was thrown down on horizon
tal drift, and then that the whole was forced     lateral pressure          by
into vertical position, the fundamental rocks remaining un
        a
moved.

ASsubject, a conclusion to this paper, and as connected with my
                        I am tempted to advert to the disposition so pre
valent among geologists of placing in parallel British with fo
reign formations, without always maturely considering all their
respective peculiar relations.                       As a case in point, none comes
more readily to            my     hand than the late attempt of M. Dumont
to assimilate the transition tracts adjacent to the Rhine, ex
tending from the north of France through Belgium into Ger
many”, to the Cambrian and Silurian systems of Professor
Sedgwick and Mr. Murchisont.                                 From this author we had
previously derived much valuable information concerning that
region: ; but the parallel since drawn by him between the
 Belgian and British formations is the more remarkable, as it
is confessed that the two countries do not correspond in the
development of the mineral masses, nor yet in the distribution
of organic remains. Nay, so far as the latter have hitherto
been ascertained, there appears to be but a slight analogy
between them, and which I now propose briefly to show, first
introducing M. Dumont's table of equivalents, for the sake
of reference.

   : A. H. Dumont, Sur la Constitution Géologique de la Province de Liège,

       Mr. Weaver              on the Structure              of the South of Ireland. 389
  In  the Ardennes, the clayslate tract (terrain ardoisier), re
ferred  to the Cambrian system, is divided into three stages:
the lower destitute of fossils; the medial, in which roofing
slate abounds, but in which few fossils have hitherto been
found; and the upper, more quartzose than slaty, in which
the vestiges of life begin to acquire greater extension, and in
which the first indications of limestone appear, the latter
being generally slaty, containing numerous crinoidal remains,
and forming beds about a yard in thickness, but never occur
ring in   mass like the limestone of the anthraciferous tract.
In this  upper stage M. Dumont notices Orthoceratites, Cri
moidea, Polyparia, Trilobites, Strophomena, &c.; but accord
ing to M. d’Omalius d’Halloy, the most common fossils which
it displays are Spiriferae greatly expanded in the direction of
their breadth, besides species referable to the genera Caly
mene, Asaphus, Orthoceras, Hamites, Leptaena, Strophomena,
and remains of Crinoidea and Polyparia”.         M. d’ Halloy
admits that the fossils of this clayslate tract have not been
determined with sufficient exactness. Yet as far as developed
by himself and M. Dumont, can it be safely maintained that
a precise analogy has been established between them and
those found in the Cambrian system?
   The clayslate tract, thus referred to the Cambrian system,
passes in        its
                upper stage                      by
                                      insensible gradations into the

 390    Mr. Weaver on     the Structure    of the  South  of Ireland,
 tained in the schistose rocks.       But the only fossils enumerated
  hitherto are referred to the genera Producta, Spirifera, Stro
 phomena,     and the remains of Crinoidea and Polyparia.
  Where, then, it may be asked, are the peculiar organic re
 mains of the Llandeilo and Caradoc formations and of the
  Wenlock shale, to which this system is referred 2
     In the lower calcareous system, referred to the Wenlock
 limestone, ten species of coral are enumerated, six of which
 occur in the Wenlock limestone, and eight in the Eifel lime
 stone”. Two of them are also met with in the carboniferous
 limestone of Liège and Namur, namely, Cyathophyllum carspi
 tosum, Cyathophyllum pentagonum; and one in the lower part
 of the coal formation of Liège, namely, Cyathophyllum quadri
geminum. Of Terebratula we have two species common to
 the Wenlock limestone, namely T. prisca and T. aspera,
 besides two or three other species not found in the latter.           If
 to these we add Strophomena, Solarium, Nerita, and Crinoidea,
 we have the whole      of the organic remains enumerated as be
 longing to this calcareous system in his work on the province
 of Liège: but at a later period the author remarkst, that in
 this lower calcareous system are found also Terebratula con
centrica, some Spiriferae and Euomphali, besides Productae
 and other shells which are commonly met with in the upper
 calcareous system (namely, the carboniferous limestone).
 Such being the case, it may be asked, wherein does the ana
 logy consist between this lower calcareous system and the
 Wenlock limestone * Where are the numerous characteristic
 fossils of the latter? On the other hand, the occurrence in
this transition limestone of fossils which are common also in
the carboniferous limestone, deserves the attention of geolo
gists, since it forms a parallel to similar phaenomena in Devon
and Cornwall, and the south of Ireland.
     The upper quartzo-schistous system is referred by M.             Du
mont to the Ludlow formation,              But where do we find the
 various fossils of that formation as enumerated by Mr. Mur
chison?     The only corresponding species noticed are Spiri
fera   radiata,  Terebratula aspera, and T. Wilsonii. The rest
of the fossils given appear more nearly allied to the upper
calcareous system (the carboniferous) than to the lower cal
careous (the transition).       As bearing on this question, it may
also be noticed that in the upper part of this system a bed of
coal has been found.
    Of the upper calcareous system there is no question among
            * These will appear in the tables given further on.

392   Mr. Weaver               on the Structure                 of the South of Ireland,
can be established in the sequence                                   of the transition forma
tions.
  M. Beyrich considers the lower calcareous system of M.
Dumont as identical with the Eifel limestone. And M. Du
mont also places the Eifel limestone in parallel with the lower
limestone of Belgium, finding below them both the same
lower quartzo-schistous system reposing on the clayslate tract
of the Ardennes, and tracing                           all
                                        these formations        the banks                    to
of the Rhine.         this view, believe, he
                        In                       I     correct.               is
    The evidence          far  as   produced leads
                                              as             the conclu                 to
sion, that the north-western and south-eastern flanks of the
clayslate tract      the Ardennes, together with the succeeding
                       of
lower    quartzo-schistous      and lower calcareous systems                                                    on
each side,      Belgium and the Eifel, are justly referred

transition epoch.       From the same evidence            would also ap            it
pear that the upper quartzo-schistous system                more nearly                 is

surprising, since they are commonly represented                   forming                        as
 an  uninterrupted succession (yet with some exceptions), pass

conceived the lower      quartzo-schistous      system     represent the               to
old red   sandstonet,               an

which would fall into two great divisions, of which the lower
would be the Eifel limestone: but such an arrangement, he
observes, would be quite inconsistent with nature, as proved
by the evidence of organic remains”. That the old red sand
stone, however, occurs in considerable force in various parts
of Germany, I showed in the year 1821, when giving abs
tracts of the observations of M. Freiesleben on the Forest of
Thuringia, on Mansfeld, Thuringia, and the Circle of the Saale,
and of those of MM.Von Buch and Von Raumer on Lower                                       Si
lesia, the county of Glatz, and part of Bohemia and Upper                                 Lu
satia. And at that time, this formation was also conceived to
exist in partial distribution in the Netherlands, then forming
the immediate support of the carboniferous limestonet.            This
view has been more recently revived by MM. Rozet and Con
stant Prevost, who contend that the old red sandstone of                                Bri
tain is not wanting in Belgium, stating as an example, that it is
well developed between Dinant and Namur; that                 between         is,
the lower     Belgian   limestone which          force     Givet,

the carboniferous limestone which prevails              Namur; and  at
hence that M. Dumont was             error when he excluded that
                                               in
formation altogether from the seriest. This appears                 ac               to
cord with the prior observations          M. Von Dechen,
                                                      of        which           to
I   have referred above.
     But perhaps      evidence  no  more conclusive
                                               is         the want       of                  of
similarity between the Belgian and the Silurian formations
 than that which                is   to
                           be derived from     consideration of the

     * M. Beyrich remarks that Pterineae are numerous, and in a manner
 characteristic of the greywacke and slate rocks which support the Eifel
 limestone.      Besides the two species noticed above, Professor Goldfuss
 enumerates the following as occurring in the greywacke and slate coun
 tries adjacent to the Rhine, namely near Ems, Pterinea ventricosa, P. costata,
 P. lineata, P. plana, P. trigona, P. laevis, P. elongata; in Siegen (and the
 Harz) P. lamellosa; near Iserlohn, P. reticulata; and at Paffendorf (Coblenz)
 P. carinata. This last species occurs also, with P. bicarinata, at Lindlar,
 in the Berg territory. Of these fourteen species thus found in transition
 tracts, two only have been observed in the carboniferous limestone, viz.,
  Pterinea elegans in the Ratingen limestone, and P. carinata near Lewistown
  adjoining Niagara in North America.

   From the foregoing review, and the resulting numbers, it
becomes clearly apparent, that M. Dumont was not justified
in pronouncing the Wenlock and Eifel limestones as of the
same  formation.    It             is,
                           however, also evident that they are
akin   in certain
            a      degree,  the species which are common                                    to

species are to the common species as 9 to 4, or 2+ to 1; and
in the Eifel limestone as 16 to 4, or 4 to 1.
    M. Beyrich has made the remark, that the greywacke and

                                          the same fossils as
are found in this limestone; and he adds, that among them
occur a considerable number of species which are common to
the carboniferous limestone, and in this remark he is joined
by M. Dumont, as already observed: that this view is cor
rect, the following table which I have drawn up will suffi
ciently prove.

    It thus appearing that there are 47 species in the Eifel
limestone which are common to the carboniferous limestone,
it follows that they constitute about two ninths of the whole
number found in the Eifel, the ratio being as 47 to 209.
    On the other hand, we have seen that the Eifel limestone
contains 42 species which are common to the Wenlock lime
stone, or one fifth of               its
                           whole number, the ratio being                                    as   42

  This view leads naturally to the inference, that in the order
of superposition the Eifel Timestone occupies a middle rank,
namely, one higher in the series than the Wenlock, but lower
than the carboniferous limestone. This result would appear
to correspond with the notions of M. Beyrich, who, in spe
culating on the relative age which should be assigned to the
Rhenish slate mountains among the transition formations, is
disposed to consider them as of a later origin than those strata
in the north of Europe, namely in Scandinavia and Russia,
in which the Orthis tribe are so abundant. These latter may
doubtless be placed, to a certain extent, in parallel with the
Silurian.
  If the  views which I have taken be correct, in which the
formations of the Eifel, and the lower formations in Belgium
are, in the order of succession, considered as antecedent<U+017F>to the
old red sandstone of Belgium (meaning such as in Britain
has been usually designated by that name), it becomes doubly
desirable that the distinguished geologists who have taken
Devon and Cornwall in hand should complete their investi
gations.    I have been led to anticipate that a considerable
degree of analogy subsists between the two regions, and, if
it be true, it may yet be proved that the older stratified rocks
of those counties are not only of later origin than the Silu
rian formations (which would so far correspond with the views
of Mr. Lonsdale, Professor Sedgwick, and Mr. Murchison),
but of a date also anterior to that of the old red sandstone
formation, taken in the common acceptation of that term.
Whether the latter may yet be detected in the southern parts
of Devon in unconformed position, may still be a          subject                fit
for inquiry.
  It is remarkable that among the fossils       which the Devon  by

   In the limestone bands of the south of Ireland I have shown

 that  is, including Leptaena depressa and Leptaena lata; but
 others also occur which have not been determined, e.g.,                                            Avi

types are mere general results founded on actual observation,
it is obvious that they can never upset conclusions drawn from
the clear and unambiguous evidence of sections. The two
methods may be used independently, and conspire to the
same end, but in their nature connot come into permanent
                                                                               j,
collision*.”    In the present case it should be borne in
mind that the consecutive series of the older stratified rocks
of the south of Ireland is unconformably overlaid in the
northern parts of Kerry, Cork, and Waterford, directl
either by the true old red sandstone formation of
geologists, or by the carboniferous limestone, or the coal for
 mation f.
   I  might now extend the comparison by entering into the
 countries adjacent to the right bank of the Rhine, or into
the Fichtelgebirge; but in neither of them is the informa
tion hitherto obtained of so extensive and detailed a character
as to admit of precise conclusions.    To what was previously
known    respecting the former  tracts, M. Beyrich has made
considerable additions in his  Beiträge;  and from these con
tributions it may be collected, that the greater part of the
Nassau limestones near Dillenburg, &c., as well as those of
Bensberg, Refrath, Paffrath, &c., adjoining the Rhine, to
gether with the greywacke and slaty rocks in which they are
intercalated, or on which they simply rest, exhibit in general
the same organic remains as the Eifel, although they possess
also species and even genera not hitherto found in the latter;
e.g., at Paffrath the genera Nerita, Megalodon, Cardita,
Monodonta, Buccinum; and in Nassau in the Wissenbach
clayslate Parmophorus; and in the limestone on the Lahn near
Villemar an Ostrea, a genus not previously noticed in any
transition country.    Of the Nassau limestones it is remarked
that they differ chiefly from the Eifel limestone by being for
 the greater part interstratified with the greywacke and slate
rocks, while the limestones of the Eifel are merely superim
posed upon the latter in troughs.     In Belgium, however, the
same, namely, the lower limestone of that country, forms an
interstratified portion of the general series.   Considering then
 the fossils which have been noticed in these    districts, we have
here   again  an exemplification  of affinities and differences in
 the organic types of their respective strata.          Should M.
 Beyrich complete the work which he proposed to himself in
the year 1837, of drawing up an exact critical catalogue of

fell on the truck it shivered the top-gallant mast in pieces so
far as the commencement of the chain at b; here being as
sisted by the chain, it passed on without any damage to the
topmast, which is extremely worthy of remark, because in the
former case, where there was no chain, the top-mast was de
stroved.
       aving reached the point c, where the chain terminated,
it  passed   with damage over the head of the mast, until again
being assisted by the lower chain d e, it passed without da
mage to the deck; on reaching the deck at e, it passed by
means of a bolt through a beam in the forecastle upon the
chain cable, and thence into the sea”.
    29. These effects are similar to the former, and show the
protection afforded by the chains, and their power of con
ducting heavy discharges of lightning without any of the                                             ill

     It is further stated, and it is a most important fact, that a
 seaman aloft on the cross trees, at the time, did not experience
 any sensation whatever.
    31. No. 4. The Buzzard brigantine was struck by lightning
 on the Coast of Africa in February 1838, and lost her top-gal
 lant and topmast, under precisely the same circumstances as
 those of the Hyacinth, the lower mast being preserved by
 the chain topsail sheet *.
    32. No. 5. The Fox revenue cutter was struck by lightning
 in March 1818. The mast was furrowed and otherwise da
 maged in every part except where it was coppered; as appears
 by a minute made at the time by the master mast-maker at
 the Plymouth dock-yard.
    Now the copper usually placed about a cutter's mast is not
 the ºnd part of an inch in thickness.              In this case it re
 mained    perfect.
    33. No. 6. The spire of a church at Kingsbridge in Devon
shire was struck by lightning in June 1828, and fearfully
damaged. This case is particularly worthy of notice.
    The lightning fell on an iron spill, a, b, supporting the
 weather-cock, about 7 feet in length and                 Fig. 3

 1 inch in diameter.      On this it   produced   no
visible effect, nor did any damage arise to
the stone-work about the rod.             It was not

masonry was rentt.

to the Editor of the Annals of Electricity,
&c., &c., relative to the protection afforded
by    a  continuous conductor attached to the
mast    of H.M.S. Beagle.
    “Having considered your communica
tion in the Annals of Electricity on marine
lightning conductors, containing observations on the stroke
of lightning which fell on the masts of H.M.S. Beagle,
I  think it fair, both to Mr. Harris and the naval service, to
                                                        occasion; first
describe the phaenomena I witnessed on that
stating, that at the time of my joining the Beagle in 1831, pre
viously to her leaving England,          I  had no acquaintance with
Mr.    Harris,  and  certainly    no bias in favour of the conductors
with which the ship was fitted.           I  may therefore claim to be
considered an     impartial   observer.
   * This case was given me by the commander Lieut. Fox. I was myself
on board the vessel on her arrival. The particulars are noted in her log.

  “At the time alluded to, I was first Lieutenant of the
Beagle, and was attending to the duty on deck. She was at
anchor off Monte Video, in the Rio de la Plata, a part of the
world very often visited by severe lightning storms. , Having
been on board H.M. ship Thetis at Rio Janeiro a few years
before, when her foremast was entirely destroyed by lightning,
my attention was always particularly directed to approaching
electric storms, and especially on the occasion alluded                                               to,   as
the storm was unusually severe.         The flashes succeeded each
other     rapid

in the way of objection to the fixing conductors in ships' masts,
and prove in the most conclusive manner the protecting
power of such conductors: his statement, therefore, that “de
structive lateral discharges will always take place when the
vicinal bodies are capacious and near the primitive conductor
or to any of                its
                   metallic appendages,”         clearly fallacious.    is

down this and through the ship's side, did not cause “intense
sparks among the powder barrels, whose metallic linings and
hoops reciprocally interchange them t.”

 practically sound, this man ought to have been killed on
 the spot by a “lateral discharge,” as he says happened to a
 seaman called Wilson in the case of the Rodney.
     39. Mr. Sturgeon, therefore, if he still adheres to his theory,
 is at last reduced to the necessity of supposing, that his lateral
discharge may sometimes occur, and sometimes not, which is
 manifestly in the teeth of his own hypothesis.          This instance
just quoted of the little effect experienced by persons in the
 vicinity of heavy electrical discharges is by no means a solitary
one, as the following extract from a letter from Admiral
 Hawker, with which he favoured me relative to the damage
done to the Mignomne, very fully shows:—
     “The circumstances of the Mignomne being struck by
lightning were these: she had been on shore, and was going
to Port Royal, Jamaica, attended by the Désirée; we had a
day I think the hottest I ever experienced in the W. Indies,
 without a cloud. After sunset we observed clouds rising up
from every part of the horizon with thunder and lightning.
I   ordered the topsails to be lowered in case of squalls, and
we ran down towards Port Royal: about midnight the heavens
 seemed to be one continued flame, and soon after the main
 top-mast was shattered into probably fifty pieces, scattering
the splinters in        all
                        directions; the mainmast was split down
to   the keelson, and sulphurous smell came up from the hold,
                          a
 which occasioned some             cry out that the ship was
                                    to                                  on

 Two men were killed           the main-top, being burnt black, and
                               in
 having some splinters sticking             them, and
                                              in          man who was
                                                                 on a

it appears that the electric matter in passing down the main
hatchway passed between a man and a boy.           Neither were
hurt; the latter experienced a shock only. It also passed close
to another man lying across a hammock about the same spot,
who jumped up and thought his neck handkerchief was on
fire; the latter experienced a temporary effect only in                                                        his

thickness placed in the wake of the gaff. This is conclu
sive of the fallacy of Mr. Sturgeon's assertion, that any con
ductor applied     to the mast, would, under the operation of
lightning, be “probably peeled from the wood.”
    In the case of the Kingsbridge spire, No. 6. The lightning
which shivered the tower, fell on a cylindrical iron rod of an
inch diameter without producing any effect on                                       it.

414             Mr.       Snow Harris on the Electrical Discharge
tion.     “Itis said (observes Mr. Sturgeon) that the lightning
rod passing through the Nelson Monument became so hot
 by lightning that it could not be touched by the hand by the
first person who visited it afterwards. Allowing a few minutes
to have elapsed between the flash and the person entering
 the monument, the probability would be that the conductor
had been made red-hot.”        This is of the same character with
all  Mr. Sturgeon's data;          generally surmise, the show
                                                    it   is

     48. Exceptions, however, have been taken by Mr. Sturgeon
to  the phaenomena described by the officers who either com
manded or were in the ships. Thus Captain Turner, in de
scribing the shock of lightning which fell on the Dryad                            fri
gate on the coast of Africa, says, that “he saw the lightning
on the conductor on the fore-mast, and saw it during another
flash run down the mizen-mast; that all the men there heard
a loud whizzing noise.” Captain Fitzroy and Lieut. Sullivan
also mention similar phaenomena. Now the exceptions taken
are these, viz. that no noise is ever produced by electricity
entering a conductor, and that we cannot produce a “run
ning light” upon a conductor carrying an electrical charge.
    These exceptions, however, are rather captious objections
 to forms of expression, than to the facts themselves; it is easy
 to show from experience that luminous appearances are often
attendant on discharges of both natural and artificial electri
city.
   Thus in the case of the Hawk (No. 9.) the account states
that “the vessel was apparently enveloped in a flame of light
ning; ” whilst in the case of the Beagle, Lieut. Sullivan
says, “on looking aloft the ship was apparently in a blaze of
fire.” In the case of the Snake (No. 3.) the electric fluid is
said to have descended with an instantaneous explosion of a
vivid purple colour.
   When H.M. ship Norge was struck by lightning in
Port Royal harbour, the electric fluid was observed (to use
Admiral Rodd's expression) to “absolutely stream down a
conductor attached to the mast of H.M. ship Warrior,”
close by.
   Such phaenomena are besides remarkably close to the re
sults of experiments: thus a heavy shock of electricity, passed
over a metallic wire in a partially exhausted receiver, will ex
hibit a transiently passing light on        surface.its

                                          is       in

Mr. Sturgeon, however, asserts that “no such noise                ever        is
produced          by
                the fluid entering     metallic conductor.”

  Setting out from these principles       will proceed      discuss    I                       to
   Mr. Walter's numerical results.
         In
         six analyses                      of
                         the solid oil, the highest value       ob                                        he
  tained for the carbon was 77-68, and the mean         five results                     of
  was 77°36.    The lowest result for hydrogen was 12:52 and
   the mean             of
                  four was 12-66.     Mr. Walter's analyses and
   theory are therefore,

         It   is   also quite evident that the results   Mr. Walter's               of
    analyses cannot                   be
                               considered    exceedingly correct, as
                                                                  when

420       Dr. Kane's Remarks on the Compounds derived
we find that out of his six analyses, the carbonic acid was
lost in one, and the water in two instances; probably from
a too rapid and imperfect process of combustion.       Mr.   Wal
ter's formula is therefore disproved by his own analyses,
which give too much carbon and too little hydrogen; but they
agree very well with the formula      I proposed, if we allow his
analyses to have been of the average degree of excellence.
    The specific gravity of the vapour of the stearopten      fur
nishes no test whereby to distinguish between the formulae;
Cao Hso Os gives 5:455, and Cai H20 O, gives 5-666.        He ob
tained 5-62.     It is true, the experimental density generally
comes out a little higher than the calculated density; but on
the other hand, with these oils there is almost universally a
trace of decomposition by which the experimental density is
thrown too low.       Hence the density found agrees with one
formula as well as the other.
    Mr. Walter has given the name of menthene to a hy
drocarbon, produced by the action of dry phosphoric acid
on the stearopten. To this body he assigns the formula
 Ceo His : his results are,

    In every case Mr. Walter obtained an excess of weight
 which must be an error in the hydrogen, and in every case
 the hydrogen increased by this error comes only to about
 equal the hydrogen required by his formula.        In every case
also he obtained too much carbon, and this with a substance
 whose perfect combustion must evidently to every organic
 chemist be most difficult.     His formula cannot be true; but
the formula C2. His gives the following numbers:—
                    Cai   = 1289            87.76
                    His = 18.0              12:24.
                            146'9          100'00
 coinciding perfectly with the analyses.
    The density of the vapour of menthene Mr. Walter found
 to be 4.95. The formula Cºo His gives 4-835. The formula
 Col His gives 5-046. The difference here also is so very
 trifling that no stress can be laid upon it one way or        the
other.
    The results obtained by the action of sulphuric acid, not
 being definite, do not require notice, further than to mention

            from the Stearopten of Oil of Peppermint.                                        421
that the formula I announced for the sulphodadylate of lime,
was SO3. Ca O + Coo Hig, and not the formula which Mr.
Walter attributes to me.
  The     substanceobtained by Mr. Walter in acting on the
stearopten with perchloride of phosphorus is of great import
ance, as giving some evidence of how far this essential   acts                         oil
as   an
      alcohol.   The action   appears       very  complicated,
                                                     to    be
and hence     it    the analysis alone that
                   is   to                       can look for       we
explanation.   Taking for the best analysis the highest car
bon and the lowest hydrogen, the results           Mr. Walter        of
are,                       analysis.     Mean of six.

  The most natural formula      suppose that,
                                          is

carbon and too little hydrogen, but with the Cal,       my                        as   on
view, the numbers are more nearly true.     But Mr. Walter
suggests that the hydrogen may         atoms    place
                                               be    18  19,         in                 of

   Thus we have still on Blanchet's basis too little carbon
and too much hydrogen
                                                                                        at of

the formula becomes much more likely            true;           to     be

                                      Mr. Walter Co Hiz

in these cases no gas is given off for some little time. Ob
serving this, it was a matter of great interest to know what
became of the gas for the first few seconds, and it directly
occurred that the first portions of gas were bound down in a
nascent state with the charcoal: this was proved by placing it
in a solution of sulphate of copper, when the charcoal and the
coke became coated with a thin film of the metal. In the
same way gold, silver, mercury, and lead were precipitated
from their solutions, and iodine set free from iodic acid. Pro
bably the other metals were also precipitated, but their co

charcoal or the porous coke is made to form the electrodes of
 a battery, the piece forming the kathode or platinode is found
 to have similar properties; but the anode or zincode, how
 ever, is found to possess nascent oxygen from                   liberating       its

  stratively prove that which has hitherto been the prevailing
  theory, namely, that nascent hydrogen precipitates the metals,
  and that the precipitation may take place when the galvanic
  current    is broken; for the coke will retain             hydrogen       its                      in

 hydrogen is given off.
     The soft and spongy charcoals, as those of deal, possess the
 property of evolving gas very imperfectly.
    Various kinds of coal, such as anthracite and cannel, were
 tried, but none were found to evolve hydrogen, nor to have
 copper precipitated when the circuit was made in a solution of
 that metal.
     From the above experiments we see that batteries may be
 constructed of carbon in the place of a negative metal; the
 hard coke or plumbago answering best, and the porous coke
 and box-wood charcoal next *. These may be used as an
 ordinary battery with sulphuric acid, but of course a battery
 thus constructed possesses but little power.             however, the            If,

acid and dilute sulphuric acid, yields ten cubic inches of gas
in five minutes. In this case about eight square inches and a
half of carbon were exposed, and the communication was ef
fected by means of thick platinum wires.          The same quantity
of   gas  was driven off from seven     square   inches of platinum.
One piece of charcoal in a single cell gave one fifth of a
cubic inch in twenty minutes.
    Experiments were performed on the properties of selenium,
sulphur, phosphorus, bromine, iodine, and chlorine; but as
nothing very worthy of notice was discovered, it will be un
necessary to dwell upon these substances.
    The rationale of amalgamating zinc would appear to be ex
actly the converse of platinizing platinum or the other metals,
for the one favours the adhesion of the hydrogen and prevents
thereby local action, the other favours the escape of the hy
drogen by                its
                   non-adhesion, and         that way increases the

    (A) Iron from the Maesteg iron-works near Neath in South
Wales. Colour white, brilliant and granulated; on the lowest
part of the pig appearances of contraction; yielding in some
degree to the stroke of the hammer and being very difficult to
break into fragments.         I  am given to understand it is pro
duced from       clay iron-stone mixed with some Cornish ore,
probably red oxide of iron, and by means of a hot blast. Spe

    (B) Iron from Vienne in France, département de l'Isere; pro
duced from the ore of La Voulte, (that is red oxide of iron,)
mixed with about one-third part of pea-iron-ore.              The coke
is from Rive de Gierl.
    The hot blast was also used here. Colour gray, of great
dark graphite-like brilliancy; the scaly appearance very much
developed; easy to be broken into small fragments, with a spe
cies of tough resistance, making a similar sound as pure tin
when beaten, but still difficult to reduce to very fine powder;
specific gravity 6-898.
    (C) Iron of Creuzot, département de Saone et Loire; pro
duced from bog iron ore, with a mixture of brown iron ore of
varying qualities and some puddling slag. The cold blast was
applied. The fracture dead grayish; earthy; hardness con
siderable; brittle, not yielding to the hammer; specific gra
vity 7-878.
    Thirty-five grains of iron, (A) and (B), in small fragments
 were put into two retorts, and four ounces of hydrochloric acid
 of 1:16 specific gravity poured over them; the beak of the re
 tort was connected with two Woulfe's bottles, filled with a
 neutral solution of acetate of lead, temperature 62° Fahr.
   * The coke from Rive de Gier contains, according to Berthier,
                             75.00  Carbon.
                             03:50  Volatile matter.

                            100.000
containing likewise 0300 pyrites. As soon as this fuel is changed for
purer coke, gray iron cannot be produced there.

The acid had scarcely been poured        over the iron (B), when
the whole  powdered   iron rose, under a rather violent evolution
of gas, to the top of the acid. A short time after the acid be
came of a yellow colour, and the caseoid or cheese-like whitish
foam increased each moment on the top of the acid during
the evolution of hydrogen, and filling almost the whole of the
upper part of the retort.
    In Woulfe's bottles distinct glittering scales of sulphuret of
lead were rapidly deposited; the gas escaping out of the last
bottle had, in an extremely slight degree, in smell the character
of hydrogen developed by means of acids from iron, but no
longer affected a solution of nitrate or acetate of lead. The
 liquid was found next day opake, of a light gray colour,
still developing       gas.
   The evolution from iron (A) had ceased long before. The
iron (A) or white Welsh iron formed likewise a caseoid or
cheese-like substance         on the top of the acid, but           colour   its
was dark gray approaching             black, and the liquid below was
                                         to
also     of   an
              opake dark gray.

not scaly, like that from the gray iron, but resembling dark                  a
brown greasy viscid mass, making the whole liquid turbid, and
only settling two days afterwards. The mass                             in
                                                                the retort

the gelatinous silica, and analysed like graphite, as stated in
the beginning of this treatise, proved to be of the same com
position as the graphite B.
    I must here observe, that in fragments broken from the
outside of the same pig-metal traces only of sulphur could be
 discovered; that the malleable iron produced from this ac
 cording to my puddling process was extremely soft, and had
 the peculiar property of welding so easily, that tin-plates rolled
 from it adhered so firmly together by heating them a little
 too much, that it became impossible to separate them; but
 the great quantity of silicon contained in this iron was ex
 tremely destructive to the bottom and sides of the puddling
 furnace.
 Let us now return to the residuum of iron (B.); white
Welsh iron. This residuum was found to weigh 6-77 grains,
and had a dark brown colour and a very strong unpleasant
smell, peculiar to hydrogen obtained in this manner from cast
iron.   It was powerfully attracted by the magnet, and traces
only of aluminum could be found.
   3:13 grains of the dried residuum, heated cautiously in a
weighed platinum crucible, began to glow around the periphery
before the crucible became red-hot, and the ignition spread
from thence very slowly towards the centre. The platinum
crucible was now removed from the fire, covered with its lid
and cooled near concentrated sulphuric acid under a bell
glass.         Its
             weight had increased 0.08 grains, and       colour                                its
changed from brown        black.  On the crucible being again

                                    A   powder,  of
                                                  3:55 grains, heated
with hydrochloric acid         1:16 sp. gr.,of    the same crucible,   in
a   grayish powder remained, which presented              distinct in                 a
terspersion          of
                 dull black with white   spots,  and weighed   o:290;
after ignition        had gained 0.028 and became perfectly
                          it
white.
    It consisted entirely                   of
                              silica, for which we reckon 0-1528
silicon.   As the black spots disappeared and gained 0.028                        it

                Cast Iron, Steel, and Malleable Iron.              431
grains in weight during ignition, we may conclude, that the
black spots consisted of metallic silicon, which had become
oxidized into silica during the process.
    The solution had      a greenish-yellow appearance, and after
being concentrated by evaporation and diluted with distilled
water was mixed with carbonate of magnesia.       The precipi
tate dissolved in   hydrochloric  acid and  again  precipitated
with succinate of ammonia, yielded 250 oxide of iron =
17335 metallic iron; no manganese could be discovered.
   The filtered liquid now held in solution the protoxide of
iron. Digested with nitric acid, precipitated with ammonia,
ignited, dissolved again and freed from magnesia, it yielded
oxide of iron = 1° 100 = 0-8901 metallic iron. This method
of separating the protoxide of iron from the peroxide is not
sufficiently accurate, and I mention this part of the process
only to show that the iron, even after ignition, remained in
the state of protoxide mixed with peroxide.       Having tried
to ascertain the amount of protoxide and peroxide of iron in
these solutions as accurately as possible, by converting the
peroxide of iron by means of solution of sulphuretted hydro
gen into protoxide, and ascertaining the quantity of separated
sulphur &c. in one part of the solution, and mixing another
part with liquid chloride of gold and sodium,_from the quan
tity of the reduced gold the quantity of protoxide of iron was
very easily calculated, and        I
                                obtained for the greatest part
proportions which approached to a rather strange formula,
3F--2F. The carbon taken away by the escaping hydrogen              is
of far less amount than is generally asserted; and each atom
of carbon volatilized in this way is at the same time replaced
by oxygen or sometimes hydrogen.
   The remaining part of the brown powder, = 3:39, was like
wise put into a platinum crucible, heated like the first over
a spirit lamp, till it began to glow on the periphery, and then
quickly removed from the fire. The first smooth surface of
the powder on the bottom of the crucible was now found to
be intersected by small cracks, through which might be seen
the interior of the powder in ignition for some time;        its
                                                             colour
after  cooling  became   darker,   but    had neither
                                           it           gained  nor
lost  in weight.
   Hydrochloric acid        of1:16 sp. gr., did not visibly attack
this  powder;   but heated    in asand bath, the action  ofthe acid
became     at once  very  lively;     great quantity
                                       a                ofhydrogen
smelling slightly    inthe well-known way was disengaged, and
a  velvety black residuum          of rather oily appearance was
                                       a

   Its weight was found to be 0.75 grains, and it had therefore
lost in the acid 2:64 grains.
   During ignition it emitted very dense fumes—had changed
 itsdark black colour into dirty reddish-white;     a  had lost                                   it
only 0.051 grains, notwithstanding the great apparent evo
lution        of
           gases, and we must therefore conclude, that the
black residuum contained silicon, taking         exchange for                           in
carbonaceous matter oxygen from the atmosphere.

 The      difference is to be ascribed to the volatilized carbon,
 hydrogen and       azote.
    If we compare this difference with the difference between
 the real increase of the powder during ignition, and the cal
 culated oxygen, we find the
              Former difference . . 0-657294

                                                   0.000050 grains.
  This      difference is so extremely small that we may con
  sider the oxygen only calculated as the real quantity taken up,
  instead of 0-65729 carbon, hydrogen and azote. The increase
  could therefore only be 0-420000, as the remaining quantity
  of the absorbed oxygen =0:657244, was counterbalanced by
  the 0-657294 burnt carbon, hydrogen and azote.
      The black residuum of the second part of the powder, which
   as already stated weighed 3°39 grains, was equal to 0-75; the
  loss therefore in 3:39 grains was = 2-64, consisting of iron
   and oxide of iron.
     If    we calculate from the hypothetically-assumed quantity of
   carbon, hydrogen and azote in the first part of the powder,
   the same relative quantity for the second part of the powder,
   we ought then to have for 3.39 grains of residuum 0.7l 188
    grains of carbon, hydrogen and azote.
        If we therefore assume the black residuum to contain only
    silicon, and iron in     its
                              oxidized state,      obtainwealready   as

 This difference       between      the original weight of the remainder
  = 0.7500, which amounts to 0-2705, we may consider as
 carbon.
     Now we calculated the amount of carbon to be 0-71188,
 but as we find only 0.2705 grains of carbon, the difference
               –
  = 0-7118 0.2705 = 0-44138 carbon, must have been coun

                 º
 THE        connexion
        (or elasticity)
                            between the temperature and the pressure
                           of elastic vapours is a desideratum in Phy
 sics. A knowledge of it is indispensable to an exact theory of
 the Steam Engine, to an exact theory of Astronomical Refrac
 tions, and to an accurate solution of other important pro
 blems. The want of it has hitherto been supplied by un
 satisfactory approximations;              but these questions cannot be
 completely                        without a more careful attention to
 the premises than has hitherto been possible, owing to a want
 of the proper key to these researches, which consists in a know
 ledge of the mathematical law which connects the tempera
 ture and the pressure in elastic fluids, and which is required
 in addition to the law of Mariotte and Gay Lussac to com
 plete their theory.
     If  V represent the absolute heat or caloric, i the latent
 heat, c the sensible heat or that which affects the thermometer,
                                  W   = i + c.

       If   9   be the temperature as indicated by a thermometer, there can
     be little doubt that V is capable of being expressed                                                    in a series
     proceeding according to positive powers of                                          5,   so that
                                            W    = a +          b3   + c 0° + &c.
     a, b, c, &c., have a certain signification in Taylor's theorem, but
     without being able to determine their values, d priori, or to obtain
     any relations between them, they may be treated as constants.      If
     the latent heat be constant, which is probable, and if the effect
     indicated by the thermometer is proportional to the sensible heat,
                             c = b 0,  V = a + b 0.
         It must, however, be left to experiment to decide how many
      terms are to be taken into account for any given substance, within
      any given range of the thermometric scale, and in order to satisfy
      the results of observation within any given quantity. The other
       suppositions upon which my theory is founded are those of Laplace,
       viz. that the quantity called y by M. Poisson is constant for the
      same substance at different temperatures, and that the equation
                                       I
                                    r=           a    +    nº
      is the solution of a certain differential equation. See Méc. Cél.,

                         Chemical Types.
    ONSIDERED in itself, the law of substitutions has a
     practical importance quite sufficient to justify the necessity
of distinguishing it from the more general actions of che
mistry.    But this distinction becomes necessary in quite
another  way,   when to this kind of instinct which led us to
view it at first as a law of nature, succeeds the nearly perfect
certainty that it is connected with one of the most mysterious
and most important phaenomena of the science.
     I

being destroyed, of undergoing the most singular transforma

gas of the    acetates, because it contains hydrogen, and no
longer   an electro-negative body?
   Before mentioning my opinion, which is however well
known, it is necessary that the three points which make the
difficulty, and which are the definition of chemical types,
should be well understood, that of the fundamental properties,
and the confounding of the function (róle) which hydrogen
and chlorine perform among chemical bodies. Prepossessed,
for a long while with the necessity of establishing a good
natural classification of organic bodies, I have sought for                                         its
basis     their chief characters.
         in                         The discovery       chloracetic            of
acid   gave  me     an
                     opportunity      developing of   view     this           a               of
nature. Acetic acid and chloracetic acid,         distinct bodies,      as
                                                                                                    of by
constitute two species, which      have classed
                                             I      one genus,           in
reason    ofthe analogy            of
                            their fundamental   properties   and
the identity   of   their formulae.
  Thus propose uniting into one genus
          I                                     the compounds           all
which unite identical formulae with similar chemical properties.
Chloroform, bromoform, iodoform, constitute one genus;
olefiant gas and the various chloridated bodies, products
which are derived from        constitute another; acetic acid
                                         it,
and chloracetic acid represent   third, &c.     a
 I     class then    inone genus,        what comes or      the same               to
thing,   I consider     belonging
                         as            the same chemical type, the
                                                 to
bodies which contain the same number                          of
                                              equivalents, united                                  in
the same manner and which possess the same fundamental che
mical properties.
    The definition        chemical type carries with
                         of   a                             then that              it
of   the properties which      call fundamental.
                                   I                  Now,      what                      by
do we    recognize    fundamental    property?    This       question
                                                                              it be is
                     a                                                               a
easily answered          by
                       examples which appear              conclusive.   to
 When we boil chloracetic acid with an alkali,                   once                is   at
destroyed and       changed into carbonic acid and chloroform.
                  as
If  we class,       have done, acetic acid and chloracetic acid
               we I is
in  one genus,      are compelled                     to
                                          conclude from this that
acetic acid treated with alkalies will change               turn into         to   its
carbonic    gas, and into    carburetted
                                   a       hydrogen   corresponding
to  chloroform, and into marsh gas (gas des marais).          This                                 is
precisely the result which       given  is  experiment.  by
    But, say M.M. Pelouze and Millon, these approximations
are purely fortuitous.          acetic acid heated with barytes
                                       If
 changes into carbonic acid and into marsh gas,              that ba           it    is
 rytes simply determines the formation                             of
                                                  the carbonic acid,
 thatit   takes from acetic acid all the carbonic acid which its                          -
 constitution allows      itsupply.
                                  to
    Let   usadmit this first point for the moment; why should
                                        2    G  2

444.              M. Dumas             on the   Law of Substitutions,
the remainder of the elements of the acetic acid constitute
marsh gas rather than anything else?    There are four equa
tions, which, at the low temperature at which the action takes
place, are alike admissible. The acetic acid always furnish
ing carbonic gas, it may give besides,
        1. Carbon and hydrogen............... C*-H Hº,
        2. Methylene and hydrogen...... C*H* +H",
        3. Olefiant gas and hydrogen        2 C*H*+H",
        4. Marsh  gas .....................   C*H*.
Thus, when we only consult the general forces of chemistry,
at least four suppositions are presented between which there
is nothing to authorize a choice; these are the possible ac
tions.   When the consideration of the types is allowed to in
tervene, it chooses between these four possible actions the
necessary action, that which will give rise to four volumes of
a hydrocarburetted gas corresponding to chloroform, which
it represents in this decomposition.
    It is not sufficient then to explain the decomposition of the
acetic acid by the alkalies, by saying that those determine the
formation of         all
                     the carbonic acid which can            produced;    be
we must besides       give     accountan    the       of
                                                 production       marsh       of
gas. Now        iffour equations alike possible are presented, how
 shall we choose?
    We see well that the notion                       of

LXVI.      On crystallized Native Ovalate of Lime.                By H. J.
                    BRooke, Esq., F.R.S.*
I HAVE        had in my possession for some months a specimen
    of calcite+ in compound crystals of the metastatic form of
Haüy, from # to # of an inch long, with irregular and curved
surfaces occasioned by the intersections of the numerous indivi
duals of which the crystals are severally composed, and which
stand on a rather soft light gray matrix.   It is uncertain from
whence the specimen was brought, but Mr. Heuland sup
poses it to have come from Hungary.
   On the crystals of calcite are deposited a few small crystals,
from ºth to 4th of an inch long, of oxalate of lime, which had
from their high lustre been supposed to be some ore of lead.
It was, however, apparent that they differed in form from all
the known lead ores, and on examination by Mr. Sandall at
Mr. R. Phillips's laboratory, they were found to be oxalate
of lime with one proportional of water.
   The crystals appear to have been formed contemporaneously
with those of the calcite, in which some of them are partly
imbedded, a circumstance which excludes the supposition of
their being of vegetable origin; and as only one other oxalate,
that of iron, is known to exist in the mineral state, and as
it occurs in a bed of wood coal, and the oxalic acid contained
in it may be presumed to have been derived from vegetable
matter, this oxalate of lime will afford the first instance of
the occurrence of oxalic acid as a distinct mineral product.
    The primary form of the crystals is an oblique rhombic
 prism, fig. 1. P on M measuring 103° 14' and M on M'
 100° 36': a cleavage parallel to P has induced me to adopt

 forthe common rhombohedral carbonate          of lime; calcite and aragonite
thus denoting the two varieties     of

     of New York.”
                          [Illustrated by Plate VI.]
               the memoir of M. Melloni, on the
  FRQM  Heat, inserted in the second part of the
                                                          Polarization of
                                                          first volume of
  the Scientific Memoirs, we learn, that M. Becquerel, as well
  as himself, has made experiments to determine the quantities
  of electricity set in motion by known increments of heat.
  From these experiments they conclude, that through the whole
  range of the thermometric scale, those quantities are directly
  proportional to each other.
     But as thermo-electric currents are now employed in a
  variety of delicate physical investigations, and as there appears
  to be much misconception as to their character, I propose in
  this memoir to show,
      1st. That equal increments of heat do not set in motion
  equal quantities of electricity.
     2ndly. That the tension undergoes a slight increase with         in
  crease of temperature, a phaenomenon due to the increased
  resistance to conduction of metals, when their temperature
  rises.
     3rdly. That the quantity of electricity evolved at any given
  temperature, is independent of the amount of heated surface;
  a mere point being just as efficacious as an indefinitely ex
   tended surface.
     4thly. That the quantities of electricity evolved in a pile of
  pairs, are directly proportional to the number of the elements.
      First, then,   as to the comparative march of electric deve
  lopment, with the rise of temperature, in the case of pairs of
  different metals.
      The experimental arrangement which I have employed, is
  represented    in fig. 1. (Plate VI.) A A is a glass vessel, about
  three inches in diameter, with a wide neck, through which
   can be inserted    a mercurial thermometer b, and one extre
   mity of a pair of electro-motoric wires. The wires I have
   employed have generally been a foot long, and ºth of an
   inch in diameter. The extremity s of the wires thus intro
   duced into the vessel, ought to be soldered with hard solder:
   their free extremities dip into the glass cups d d, filled with
   mercury, and immersed in a trough e containing water
   and pounded ice.       By means of the copper wires,ff, ºth of
   an inch  thick,  communication is established with the mercury

cups of the galvanometer.    The coil of this galvanometer is
of copper wire ºth of an inch thick, and making twelve turns
only, round the needles, which are astatic.                                       The deviations
were determined by the torsion of a glass thread, in the way
described in the number of this Journal for October 1839.
  It is surprising to those who have never before seen the
experiment, with what promptitude and accuracy a copper
and iron wire, soldered thus together, will indicate tempera
tureS.
    In the arrangement now described, when an experiment
has to be made, the vessel A A is to be filled two-thirds full
of water, the bulb of the thermometer being so adjusted as to
be in the middle of the vessel, and the soldered extremity s
of the two wires, being placed in contact” with           and                                it,               a
small cover with suitable   apertures adjusted    the top of the                  on
vessel,       so
            that the steam        generated may rush up along

   In this table I have estimated the temperature of boiling
mercury at 662°Fahr. The quantities of electricity evolved,
as estimated     by the torsion of a glass thread, are ranged in
columns under their corresponding temperatures.                               Each series
of numbers is the mean of four trials, the differences of which
were often imperceptible, and hardly ever amounted to more
than one degree.                                    -
   Now if this table be         constructed,         the temperatures being ran
ged along the axis of abscissas, and the quantities of electricity
being represented by corresponding ordinates, we shall have
results similar to those given in fig. 2, in which it is to be ob
served, that the curves given by the systems of silver and
iron, copper and iron, and palladium and iron, are concave
to the axis of abscissas; but those given by platina and copper,
silver and palladium, and platina and iron, are convex.
   Let us now apply the numbers obtained by these several
pairs, for the calculation of temperatures, which will set their
action in a more striking point of view.                         The following table
contains such a       calculation,         on the     supposition         that for the 90
degrees from 32°Fahr. to 122°Fahr., the increments of elec
tricity are proportional to the temperatures.

  We      are therefore led to the general conclusion, that in
these six different systems of metals, the developments of electri
city do not increase proportionally with the temperatures, but in
some with greater rapidity, and in others with less.
     The results here given, I have corroborated in a variety of
ways and with a variety of wires. A pair consisting of copper
and platina, gave for the temperature of tin when in the act
of congealing 452°Fahr. instead of 442°Fahr. the point usually

 instead   ofiº    Fahr. The melting points of tin, lead, zinc, and
 occasionally of antimony and bismuth, were in this manner
 employed, for they allow time for the working of the torsion
 balance, and with the exception of bismuth, their temperature
 appears to be steady                all
                             the while they are      granular con       in  a

       Let   us now proceed to the second proposition,                                            “That            the

duction of metals when their temperature rises.”
  It will be seen, on consulting the following table, that pairs
of  different metals, at the same temperature, have tensions
which are apparently very different.
   The currents, the tensions of which are here indicated, were
generated by keeping one end of the thermal pair in boiling
water, the other ends being maintained at a temperature of
32° Fahr.

  But this peculiarity of thermo-electric currents depends
on the conducting resistance of the system that generates
them.  It is possible to give a current a higher or a lower
tension, by simply making use of thin or thick wires to ge
nerate or to carry          the foregoing table the current from

    1st. At the boiling point of water, a pair of copper and
platina, the unexcited extremity of which was carefully main
tained at 67° Fahr., evolved as a mean of four trials, three
of which were absolutely identical, 123 degrees of electricity,
of which    23 could pass a secondary wire.
     Then, by the aid of the furnace and sand-bath, the tem
perature was raised until the pair evolved 783 degrees, as a
mean of four trials; of these 163 could pass the secondary wire.
Now,
             As 783 : 163 :: 123:25} instead of 23
showing therefore a slight rise of tension.

of water 300 degrees, of which 57 passed the secondary wire.

 The    temperature was now raised, with the following results:
        490 degrees passing the primary, 95 the secondary wire.

     It will be  understood,   that  although  the   quantities of elec
 tricity indicated in the first column do not regularly increase,
 that the temperatures were notwithstanding going regularly
 upwards: to this peculiarity of the systems into which iron
 enters I have already alluded.            Let us now compare these
 measures with those obtained for the boiling point of water:
                                                  ---

  we find, therefore, that in the case of both these systems of
  metals, the tension slowly rises with increase of temperature,
  being much better marked in the latter than in the former
  instance.
      The increase of tension here detected, depends unquestion
  ably on increased resistance to conduction, which the wires
   exhibit as their temperature rises, as the following experi
   ments show.
      A pair of copper and iron evolved a current at the boiling
   point of water, which passing through a wire of copper eight
   feet long, was determined at the galvanometer to be 176            de
   grees.    Having twisted a part of this wire into a spiral, so as
   to  go over the flame of a spirit-lamp, 8 inches of it were
   thereby    brought to a red heat; the deviation of the needle
   fell now to 165, being a deficit of 11 degrees.            In this ex
   periment, care was taken that no heat should be transmitted
    along the wire to the connecting cups.

 458     Dr. Draper          on the Electro-motive Power           of Heat.
      The   same was repeated with a piece                of iron wire, of the
 same length and under the same circumstances.         The cur
 rent at first being 90 degrees, as soon as the spiral was made
 red hot, it fell to 61 degrees, being a deficit therefore of
nearly one third the whole amount.
   To the increased resistance to conduction, occasioned by
an increased temperature, we are to impute the slight rise of
tension observed in thermo-electric currents. The quantities
are of the same order.
      We  have next to show, “that the quantity of electricity
 evolved at any given temperature, is independent of the
 amount of heated surface; a mere point being just as effica
 cious as an indefinitely extended surface.”
     The quantities of electricity evolved by hydroelectric pairs
 has been shown to increase with their surfaces, but it is not
 so in thermo-electric arrangements.       A pair of disks of cop
 per and iron, two inches in diameter, were soldered together;
 they had continuous straps projecting from them, which served
 to connect them with the galvanometer cups. . At the boiling
 point of water they gave 62 degrees; on being cut down to
 half an inch in diameter, they still gave 62. On the disk
 being entirely removed, and the copper made to touch the
 iron by a mere point,       extremity being roughly sharpened,
                                 its
 the deflection was still 62.
    By means       common deflecting multiplier, obtained the

hot mercury,      was touched with the point                  of
                                                     the cold wire.
There was strong deflection
                 a                              of

direction   towhat would have been the case had the mercury
been touched and not the iron. The under surface of the
iron was therefore acting      hot face, and the parts round

  These results explain the anomalies observed by some of
those who investigated the course of thermo-electric currents
by means of small metallic fragments.
    It would therefore seem, that when wires of the same
metal are used as electromotors, the quantity of electricity
evolved depends on the quantity of caloric that can be com
 municated in a given time. Time, therefore, under these
 circumstances must enter as an element of thermo-electric
 action.  In the case of a single metal, the maximum effect
 would be produced, when the hot element is a mass, and the
 cold one a point.
   And lastly, “That the quantities of electricity evolved in a
pile of pairs are directly proportional to the number of the
elements.”
     In the first trials which I made, to determine the effect of
increasing the number of pairs in a pile, the results obtained
were contradictory; by operating however in the following
way, the proposition was at last satisfactorily determined.
      1st. The resistance to conduction was made nearly con
 stant by uniting            all
                         the pairs intended            worked with,  to   be                         at
once.      The   current,   therefore,  whether   generated         one,                      by
 two, three, four,           or pairs,     always      run  through
                         more          had                            all to
                                                                      the
 same length      ofwire, and experienced             cases     uniform
                                                                 in                      an
 resistance.
      2ndly. By making each individual element             considerable             of
 length, the liability             of
                              transmission from the hot         the cold                 to
 extremity was diminished.
      Having, therefore, taken six pairs                        of
                                                copper and iron wires,

  460               Dr. Draper           on the Electro-motive Power                   of Heat.
     Hence there cannot be any doubt, that the quantities of
  electricity evolved by compound batteries, at the same tem
  perature, are directly proportional to the number of the pairs.
          With some general remarks, arising from the foregoing
  subjects,             I
                  shall conclude this communication.
     1. It is of importance to remember, that thermo-electric
  currents traverse metallic masses only on account of differences
  of temperature existing at different points.
     2. When a current of electricity, flowing from the poles of
 a battery, is made to traverse a metallic sheet, the whole of
 it does not pass in a straight line from one pole to the other,
 but diffuses itself through the metal, diverging from one point
 and converging to the other. The greater part of the cur
 rent is found, however, to take the shortest route.
    3. Combining therefore the foregoing observations (1.2),
 we perceive, that there are certain forms of construction
 which will give to thermo-electric arrangements peculiar ad
 vantages. For example, the surfaces united by soldering must
 not be too massive.          Let a, fig. 5, be a bar of antimony, and b
 a bar of bismuth;            them     let
                                         soldered together along the line
                                                        be
     d,and       the point
                       at      let the temperature
                                        d                  raised;    current     be        a
a, is c
    immediately excited; but this does not pass around the bars
          b,   in much as        finds as   shorter and readier channel
                                             it              a
 through the metals, between              and      circulating therefore
                                                         c             d,                                 as
 indicated                  by
                    the arrows.        Nor will the whole current pass
round the       bars,   until the   temperature        the soldered surface of
has become uniform.
    An obvious improvement                 such          in

 gree shaken by the discovery of documents tending to alter
 any of his conclusions. All will agree, that with the materials
 before him, Professor Whewell has performed his task most
 admirably, for it would have been the labour of a hundred
 lives to have carefully examined every available document
 connected with the facts there brought together. Anxious
to place my mite towards the discovery of truth in a secure
 position, I intend, with the permission of the Editors of the
 Philosophical Magazine, to commence a series of papers on
 some portions of the history of the inductive sciences which
 do not appear to have been as yet thoroughly investigated.
    As regards the history of science in our own country, Pro
fessor Whewell has laboured under very great disadvantages.
 Thrown almost entirely on continental writers for his                           in
 formation, he has overlooked many important works of the
 early English authors.      For instance, the Quaestiones Na
turales* of Athelard of Bath, and the Dialogus de philosophiat
of Gulielmus de Conchis, ought to have been analysed as
grand landmarks in the period preceding the splendid epoch
of Roger Bacon; and the contents of the present paper will
prove how neglected the claims of the English writers have
been in their early reception of one of the greatest advances
ever made in natural knowledge.
    Prejudice in favour of the authority of Aristotle, even in
the sixteenth century the master of         the Universities, for

                                 in                            that         on
account we find   many  compilers                of
                                      astronomical tables  ground
ing them upon the new system, without professing, and
sometimes denying,       belief

which they were founded.       Copernicus himself says, “neque
enim necesse est eas   hypotheses  esse veras, imo neverisimiles
quidem; sed sufficit hoc unum,          calculum observationibus
                                                  si

646   Mr. Halliwell   on the History   of the   Inductive Sciences.
Aristotle and others produced to maintaine the earthes sta
bility, and also their solutions and insufficiency, wherein I
cannot a little commende the modestie of that grave philoso
pher Aristotle, who seeing (no doubt) the insufficiency of
his owne reasons in seeking to confute the earthes motion,
useth these words:–De his explicatum est ea qua potuimus
facultate.     Howbeit his disciples have not with like sobriety
 maintayned the same.       Thus much for my owne parte in this
 case I   will  onely  say there is no doubte but of a true
 grounde truer effects may be produced than of principles that
 are false, and of true principles falshod or absurditie cannot
 be inferred.    If therefore the earth be situate immoveable in
 the center of the worlde, why finde we not theorickes uppon
 that grounde to produce effects as true and certain as these
 of Copernicus?         Why cast we not away those Circulos
 AEquantes, and motions irregulare, seinge our owne philo
 sopher Aristotle himselfe the light of our Universities hath
 taught us, Simplicis corporis simplicem oportet esse motum ?
 But if contrary it be founde impossible (the earthes stability
 being graunted) but that we must necessarily fall into these
 absurdities, and cannot by any meane avoyde them, why shall
 we so much dote in the apparance of our sences, which many
 wayes may be abused, and not suffer ourselves to be directed
 by the rule of Reason, which the great God hath given us as
 a lampe to lighten the darcknes of our understandinge and
 the perfit guide to leade us to the golden braunche of veritie
 amidde the forrest of errours?”
   Robert Tanner, in his “Mirrour for Mathematiques,”
published at London in the year 1587, makes no allusion to
the Copernican theory: at fol. 37, he computes the num
ber of miles that the sun has traversed since the creation at
43,688,316,000 !    Dee, in his later works, does not allude to
                                            I
his former opinion, and the next notice find is in 1596, when
John Blagrave of Reading again revived the theory in                  its
full sway,   his Astrolabium Uranicum Generale.
            in
   Professor Whewell does not mention one English author
 of the sixteenth century    as having adopted the heliocentric
theory.    He evidently fixes the year 1600       the earliest pe
                                                   as

                       a          of  the new system, and gives
Giordano     Bremo,   a twaddling   Italian writer, the merit         of
having had “a considerable share          inintroducing the new
opinions into England.” But however little effect the writings
 ofRecorde, Dee,       Feilde may have had, yet the extreme
                      or
popularity  of  Digges’s work places the conjecture out        of
                                                               the

   (b.) A similar bottle containing camphor was placed ex
actly opposite to the first bottle, upon a stand near the west
wall (the stove being thus at equal distances from each bottle,
and not in a line between them).
   (c.) A third bottle containing camphor was placed in the
centre of a line drawn between the door and the window, and
exactly opposite to the stove, although at a distance of about
13 feet from             it.

                                                         inch    thick          an             in
ness.      It    feet from the nearest point
                is                                  the furnace which

       of Heat      and Light when transmitted through Glass.   469
emits flame, and 38 feet from the most distant flame that can
emanate from the same side of the furnace.
     (f) A thermometer suspended from a pin fixed into one
of the window bars during the process of founding, and
hanging at a distance of one inch from the glass, exterior to
the apartment, usually indicates a temperature of from 180°
to 190° Fahrenheit, when a thermometer suspended at pre
cisely the same distance from the same pane of glass in the
interior of the apartment indicates only a temperature of
from 120° to 130° of Fahrenheit.        A difference of distance
of only two inches, when influenced by the interposition of a
plate of glass only ºth of an inch thick, effects a difference
of 60 degrees of temperature under the circumstances stated
above.
    (g.) Having suspended a thermometer in a flint glass bottle
of 5 inches in diameter, and placed the stopper loosely in situ,
I   placed the bottle upon a non-conductor of heat (several
layers of felt) just exterior to this window.    The thermome
 ter gradually  rose, as  might  be  expected, to 178 degrees of
 Fahrenheit. It was then placed upon the window frame, by
sliding to one side the moveable part of the window until
there was just sufficient space to admit the diameter of the
bottle; another thermometer was suspended round the neck
of  the bottle, and adjusted so as to hang close to that surface
of the bottle which presented to the interior of the apartment.
The internal thermometer remained constant at 178 degrees,
and the external thermometer, which faced the interior of the
apartment, never indicated a higher temperature than 110 de
grees of Fahrenheit.
    (h.) A little moisture adhered to the interior of the bottle
when thus introduced, and the dew became deposited upon
that side which was most remote from the fire.
   (i.) A bottle containing a piece of camphor was now sub
stituted for that which contained the thermometer.       In four
minutes the side of the bottle which was most distant from
the fire became beautifully spangled with crystals of camphor.
   (k.) Cress seed which had been sown in a wooden trough
supported beneath this window in the interior of the apart
ment, vegetated rapidly; but although it remained constantly
exposed to a very brilliant fire light,  appearance was pre
cisely similar   that which vegetated
                     to                     in its
                                          the dark (viz. exhi
biting white and attenuated stems, with pale yellow leaves).
There was           no
               tendency     the plants
                               in       grow towards the fire
                                            to
light.
 I     believe that whensoever dew    perceived upon one side
                                       is
only       of  vessel containing
                a                 water,  the side upon which

470          On Heat and Light as transmitted through Glass.
the dew is deposited is the coldest side, and that light has no
influence whatsoever upon such a deposition.                     My experi
ments with      camphor       tend to a similar inference with respect
to the deposition of crystals upon the sides of vessels contain
ing this substance. How that surface which is presented to
wards the sun (as in Professor Draper's experiments) becomes
the coldest, is a paradoxical problem yet to elucidate.

The    spec. grav.   of Isle of Wight sand at 64°Fahrenheit was
2:644. The      spec. grav.     of crown window glass (as made at
Nailsea,) is 2.532.       Its ingredients are sand, soda, and lime.
  Now, if we    leave the silex a constant quantity, how is it
that  any increase of lime, or of soda, increases the specific
gravity of the resulting glass 2
  Any addition of alumina will produce the same effect.
  In mentioning an increase of lime, or of soda, or of alu
mina, I mean of course, an increase beyond the usual pro
portions of each ingredient commonly employed.

                            POSTSCRIPT.
       the preceding pages were committed to the press, a
SINCE
  paper by Mr. Griffith, entitled “On the True Order and
Succession of the Older Stratified Rocks in the neighbour
hood of Killarney and to the north of Dublin’,” has reached
my hands.      In reference to the vicinage of Killarney,    feel   I
it incumbent on me to offer a few remarks.
   I  think it unfortunate that Mr. Griffith should persevere in
placing in the same parallel, and designating by the same
name, two series of strata which by his own showing are
 clearly in a different order and in a different position; thus
 pursuing the same course in Kerry as in Waterford, alike
 productive of obscurity and confusion, by a misapplication of
 the term “old red sandstone.”        Thus this formation, which
 is so well characterized in the Slieve Meesh range (Cahir
 conrée of Mr. Griffith), by        peculiar beds, horizontal dis

472    Mr. Weaver                  on the Structure           of the South of Ireland,
 tive transition series, and to all, or some, of such beds as the
 case may be, when thus coloured, affixing also the term “old
  red sandstone;” e.g., in Macgillicuddy's Reeks, in Dunloe
  Gap, in Purple, Tomies, and Glenaa mountains, in Brickeen
 island and Muckruss peninsula, and in the valley of Ken
 mare. Yet Mr. Griffith himself, in combating the positions
  of Mr. Charles W. Hamilton, insists that the red sandstone,
  where occurring in these localities, has been deposited con
 formably on the older slate (which latter he seems disposed to
  refer to the Cambrian or Silurian aeras), and in a descending
  order graduates imperceptibly into that rock”. This being
  admitted, why not designate this a transition red sandstone
  (as  Ihave always done) in contradistinction to the old red
  sandstone of the carboniferous epoch, found in unconformable
  position, and commonly distinguished, in some parts of                                                    its

to rest on a seeming unconformity arising from some dif
ferences of strike”.        The whole question, I think, is simply
solved   by two considerations: 1st, by the inosculation of the

474    Mr. Weaver        on the Structure    of the South of Ireland,
beyond a certain extent? The key presented by Mr. Griffith
does not appear to me to answer the purpose, nor can I
perceive the anomaly which he conceives to arise from the
southerly dip being persistent *; since among transition
strata some are presented to us merely as intercalated bands
with a corresponding dip, while others of a similar character
are deposited in troughs, e.g., in Nassau and Belgium con
trasted with the Eifel, as noticed in a preceding part of this
  aper.
    The whole subject, so far from being of a mysterious cha
racter +, strikes me as sufficiently clear, and which I think
may be made to appear by merely taking Mr. Griffith's own
statements for our guide.            Let us, in the first instance, follow
him from the entrance of Dunloe Gap on the north and as
cend to the summit of the Reeks on the south; and in the
second, consider the view taken by him of a proposed section
drawn across Dingle peninsula from Brandon bay on the
north, to Feilaturrive on the south ; in both cases employing
his own language, more or less condensed, yet placing the
series under numbers for the sake of greater distinctness.
    From Dunloe Gap upward, the succession is thus givent:
    1. Reddish-grey quartzose rock; coarse-grained reddish
grey conglomerate; coarse-grained brownish-red slate (quar
ried for roofing slate); red quartzose sandstone alternating
with coarse slate, the sandstone presenting occasionally a con
glomeritic characters.
    2. Chloritic quartz-rock, alternating occasionally with thin
beds of green and purple clayslate; grey quartzose beds, alter
nating with thin beds of purplish clayslate.
    3. Reddish-grey quartzose beds, alternating with thin beds
of purplish clayslate.
    4. Higher up, in ascending to the summits of the Coumeen
Peest or eastern ridge of the Reeks, the strata become more
red, and pass into a brick or cherry-red quartz-rock with
some beds of conglomerate, identical in colour, composition,
and structure with the red sandstone situated to the north of

   §  Compare    this with the description which I have given of the entrance
to Dunloe Gap, in my Memoir on the South of Ireland, in § 10, in which
I have shown that these strata vary in their dip between the vertical and
the horizontal, subject to undulations from north to south, yet with a
general dip to the south.     It is here Mr. Griffith introduces his supposed
fault, but which, as before stated, I conceive to be merely an apparent de
viation in the line of strike proceeding from an interrupted curvature of
the strata.

the (supposed)      fault    in the Gap of Dunloe, but not               so
coarse-grained”.
  The    conglomerate    on the top of the Reeks is perfectly
conformable with the   underlying  strata, and, in fact, a regular
gradation may be traced from the lower or chloritic portion
of the series through the reddish-grey into the brick-red
quartz-rock and conglomerate.
   Proceeding now to the Dingle peninsula, the succession
given also from north to south, namely, from Brandon bay
to Feilaturrive, is as follows f:
   1. Dark blackish-gray clayslate, the upper beds of which
alternate with reddish-purple slate, some of which contain
Silurian fossils.
   2. Red slaty conglomerates, alternating with red and green
slate and brown quartz-rock.
    3. Chloritic quartz-rocks, with alternating purplish and
reddish-grey clayslate, similar in composition and character
to those of the Gap of Dunloe, and of that district generally.
    Now, on the preceding I have to observe, that, as the pre
vailing dip of the strata is to the south, these rocks of the
Dingle peninsula may be considered as lying deeper in the
series than those which range in a more southerly parallel,
namely, as extending from Dingle bay to the lakes of Killar
ney; yet the whole, on both sides of the bay, may assuredly
be considered, in reference to their general composition, struc
ture, and characters, as closely related to each other, and as
forming one sequence; and taken in this point of view, there
 appears no difficulty in assigning the red conglomerate, red
 sandstone, and red slate at the entrance to and in Dunloe
 Gap to their proper position in the series.        Mr. Griffith
 admits that in the  higher parts  of the Reeks (No. 4, as given
 above) the same red conglomerate is found as occurs below
 in the Gap of Dunloe (No. 1), the latter being succeeded by
 the chloritic quartz-rock (No. 2), which alternates with thin
 beds of green and purple clayslate.       Again in the Dingle
 peninsula we find also red slaty conglomerates (No. 2 of that
 series), succeeded by chloritic quartz-rocks (No. 3), which
 alternate with purplish and reddish clayslate.       Surely the
 analogy here is very close, bespeaking alternations of similar
 rocks in a line from north to south.    In the Dingle peninsula
  the red conglomerates (No. 2) repose upon the blackish-grey
  clayslate (No.   1),
                    with beds      of
                                  reddish-purple slate, and some

 76   Mr. Weaver on the Structure of the        South   of Ireland, &c.
Silurian fossils.   The immediate substrata of the Dunloe red
conglomerate, sandstone, and red slate are not visible, being
unconformably overlaid on the north by the carboniferous
limestone in the western quarter, and by the coal formation
in the eastern; while, on the other hand, the transition series
of the Dingle peninsula, just described, are unconformably
overlaid on the east by the old red sandstone of the Slieve
Meesh range (Cahircomrée of Mr. Griffith); the difference in
the aeras of production between the transition series and the
carboniferous series being thus in both cases clearly marked *.
  To   the south of the strata of which we have been speaking,
there is a band of blackish-grey clayslate, which may deserve
Mr. Griffith's attention. It is traversed by the new line of
road from Killarney to Kenmare, as it passes up by the line
of the Upper Lake, and if duly examined might perhaps be
found productive of fossils.         #.instance may suffice to
show that there is no want of repetition of similar beds in
a line traversing the series from north to south.       In the
general succession occur also well-defined greywacke and
greywacke slate, terms which being out of favour with some
geologists, Mr. Griffith appears to avoid using, although
highly distinctive and useful when employed in a legitimate
Sense.
   Upon the whole, I see no reason to depart from the opinion
which I have formerly given, namely, that the limestone of
the region of Muckruss extending to Killarney, is a local
deposit enveloped and intercalated in the general transition
series.    And the same view, as to their forming portions of
the consecutive series, applies to the other limestone bands
in the south of Ireland, whether inclosed in and interstrati
fied with the adjacent rocks, or merely superimposed and
interstratified in the form of a trough with the subjacent
series.   In the valley of Kenmare this latter position appears
to be established by the detailed researches of Mr. Griffith,
which, I confess, escaped my observation.
   That among the strata in immediate association with the
bands of limestone in the south of Ireland, some should be
found, whether bearing the character of sandstone or clay
slate, containing certain vegetable remains, cannot be held
sufficient to invalidate the general view which I have taken;
1st, because such remains are not wholly foreign to a transi
tion country; and 2nd, because it has been shown that the
older stratified rocks of the south of Ireland form one con
secutive series.

     In   the number             of the Bibliothèque Universelle de Genève
for March, is published an extract from a letter of mine to
Professor Schoenbein, giving an account of some experiments
on the voltaic disruptive discharge”.  In the kind and flat

duces a conclusion from those experiments which                 had not                             I

more intense. Several experiments confirmed this view: the

On some Phaenomena of the Voltaic disruptive Discharge. 479
obtained was 0.4 of an inch long.      I am anxious to avoid the
bad taste of eulogizing my own productions, but I think it
ought to be generally known that space is not the only thing
oeconomized in this combination.       Professor Jacobi, who has
recently written a paper on my battery, and who has wrought
on a large scale, states that he has readily fused iridium, &c.
&c. after it has been at work for a whole day. An obvious

480               Mr. Grove     on some Phaenomena       of
brilliant voltaic arc, while in hydrogen or a vacuum with the
same power a feeble spark only is perceptible at the moment
of disruption. Mercury on the other hand gives a tolerably
brilliant spark in hydrogen, azote, or a vacuum, and one more
nearly approaching to that which it gives in air. Thus in an
oxidating medium there are three requisites for a brilliant
discharge, viz. oxidability, volatility, and looseness of ag
gregation: in other media the two latter alone obtain; and the
brilliant arc given by charcoal appears to depend principally
upon the last; thus wood charcoal gives a larger and more
diffuse flame than the carbon from gas retorts.
   In the following list the metals are arranged, as nearly as
may be, in respect to the length and brilliancy of the arc
they give in atmospheric air, the discharge being taken be
tween two points of the same metal :

   It  has been noticed by Sir H. Davy, Dr. Hare, and Mr.
Daniell, that a certain portion of matter is projected from the
positive to the negative electrode: the quantity thus percepti
bly projected is indeed very small; but          I observed that when
the discharge was taken in a close vessel the whole interior
was lined with a pulverulent deposit, which if the vessel con
tained atmospheric air was an oxide of the metal employed,
but if it contained azote or hydrogen was a reguline preci
pitate of the metal.      Faraday's researches have established,
that in electrolysis a voltaic current can only pass by a de
rangement of the molecules of matter; that the quantity of
the current" which passes, is directly proportional to the
atomic disturbance it occasions: he deduces from this that
the quantity of electricity united with the atoms of bodies
is as their equivalent numbers, or in other words, that the
equivalent numbers of different bodies serve as the exponents
of the comparative quantities of electricity associated with
them. Now what takes place in the disruptive discharge?
When we see the dazzling flame between the terminals of a
voltaic battery, do we see electricity, or do we not rather see
matter, detached, as Davy supposed, by the mysterious agency
  * However unpredicable the words quantity, current, &c. may be of an
agent imponderable, and having no definite relation to space, these words
express understood functions, and it seems impossible to devise others
which would not be open to similar objections,

mechanical action? Matter is              undoubtedly      detached during
the disruptive discharge, and this discharge takes                         tone                       its

on the identity of electricity from different sources, and with
those of Fusinieri on the statical electrical discharge, it would
follow as a corollary that every disturbance of electrical equi
librium is inseparably connected with an equivalent disturb
ance of the molecules of matter.     In the remarks of Professor
Schoenbein to which I have alluded, he says that my experi
ments seem to prove the transmission of the current from one
electrode to the other to be effected only by chemical action. In
Exp. 5, I employed the diminution of oxygen as a measure
of the quantity detached, conceiving that at the intense heat
which is produced not a particle of zinc would escape oxidation,
and without concluding that chemical action was absolutely es
sential to the existence of the voltaic arc.    must at the same         I
time state that the passage                        proved

            Cobalt Ores from the Skutteruder Mine.                                          483
however, that it contains a considerable quantity                                     of cobalt;
three analyses gave the following composition: —

  17:57 sulphur              17:34 sulphur                               18.06 sulphur.
  47-55 arsenic              46-76 arsenic                               46.01 arsenic.

  99.97                  99.47                  99-42
   In a fourth   analysis merely the quantities of iron and cobalt
were determined, and were found to be 28-77 iron, 6.50 co
balt.   In a fifth the cobalt was 10-8.
   All these analyses were performed with quantities of dif
ferent crystals.
   From the difference in the relative quantities of iron and
cobalt it follows, that these two metals can remplace one
another, which is still more evident if the quantities of both
be added together, when each time the same sum is obtained.
           1.             2.          3.               4.

        34'85        35-37      35' 35     35-27
The formula for this mineral would therefore be the same
as that for arsenical iron, only that iron and cobalt are
united in the combination, viz.

    support of the so-called Chemical Theory of galvanism, or
         of that view which places the source of voltaic electricity
solely in the chemical affinity of the positive metal of the circuit,
viz. the zinc, for the electro-negative constituent of the fluid, Mr.
Faraday has of late brought forward in an especial manner the
three following arguments:—
    1. The production of a spark on completing the junction of a
       simple circuit.
    2. The electrolytic law.
    3. The preponderance of a circuit of zinc, platina, and sul
       phuric acid, over one formed of the same metals and a so
       lution of the iodide of potassium.
    With respect to the first point, the production of a spark
 on making the connexion between a single pair of plates,
 Faraday, in the Eighth Series of his Experimental Researches,
 lays much stress upon                    it,
                                and for this reason;–because       must                     it
 have passed before the metals could have come into             contact,
 and thus not only proves                       its
                                    origin from pure chemical forces,
 but also the      superfluousness       metallic contact for exciting

486               M.        Poggendorff on Galvanic Circuits composed                                           of
        It
       can no longer, therefore, be a question whether there is a
true spark on junction without metallic contact; moreover,
other good reasons render very improbable the existence of the
high tension requisite in the still open simple circuit*.
    The electrolytic law is otherwise circumstanced.            The cor
rectness of this     important    law, with which      Faraday    has en
riched the science of electricity, can be subject to no doubt;
but many well-founded objections may be raised against its inter
pretation in favour of the chemical theory.           The law consists
in the fact that the quantities of the bodies decomposed in the
 single cells of the voltaic battery are in proportion to the che
mical equivalents.       It proves that the passage of like quantities
 of  electricity is necessary   for the decomposition of equivalent
masses, but nothing more. It takes no part in the question
 respecting the origin of galvanic electricity.            It is equally
 correct, whether the voltaic current originate from the contact
 of the metals, or from the chemical action on the zinc, or from
any other causef.
    A proof in favour of the one or the other origin might
 perhaps be drawn from            were            it,
                                           exclusively peculiar  it   the                                                to

drying with bibulous paper, or, if it seemed requisite, by rub
bing with sand-paper, scouring with sand and acids or water;
although these operations are exceedingly troublesome from
frequent repetition, yet they were never neglected. Moreover,
the platina was, previous to each experiment, heated over an
alcohol lamp after having been cleansed, as it otherwise only
produces weak effects.              I
                             therefore believe that the following
results merit some confidence, especially as most of them are
deduced from several experiments repeated on various days.
   Before, however, communicating these results, I must still
add one remark.
   By whatever cause the electricity may be produced in cir
cuits of this kind, it is evident that there can be no doubt
respecting the where, that it can only occur at the places of
contact of the fluids with the metals, since a contact of hete
rogeneous metals does not take place, or rather each of the two
metallic slips contains two such contacts, which, from their
being of opposite nature, must necessarily nullify each other.
There are, therefore, in this kind of circuits four possible places
of excitation, two in each vessel; and if we combine the electro
motive force developed in each vessel, we have two such forces,
e and e, which act in opposition to each other.           moreover,                  If,
we call  r the total resistance     the circuit, then, according
                                               of                                                       to

 494     M.  Poggendorff on Galvanic Circuits composed     of
 the signs of inequality express which of the two fluids (a and 5,
 fig. 1, page 489) developes the strongest electromotive force
 when a pair of plates of the metals stated at the head of the
 stance, in the space common to the       ºn.
 column are immersed in them. The expression s 3 w, for           in
                                                    zinc-silver, and
 hydrochloric acid water, indicates that in contact with zinc and
 silver the water excites a greater electromotive force than the
 hydrochloric acid; or, in other words, that the current has a
 direction as if the zinc plate in the water were positive to the
zinc plate immersed in the acid, the word positive being taken
in the sense previously mentioned.
    I might also have added to the direction of the current, or
the direction of the magnetic deflections, their magnitudes, as    I
always noted them carefully.       But I have omitted this, on
 the one   hand,  because the intensity of the current is no mea
 sure of the difference of the electromotive forces under con
 sideration, and also because in the present case it is at the
 same time a very variable element.     In general the intensity of
the current in this kind of circuits is most powerful in the first
moment, and then rapidly decreases; the amount and velocity
of the decrease vary however considerably. This causes among
 other things that in two cases the difference of the two first de
flections of the needle, to the right and to the left, may indeed
be equal, but the magnitudes of the deflections differ consider
ably.    In the one case these deflections amounted perhaps to
 10° and 8°, in the other to 30° and 28°. In general the inten
 sity of the current only descends to zero, but at times it also
increases towards the opposite side. Sometimes this reversion
of the current takes place so rapidly, that, for example, the
first deflection of the needle, perhaps of 50° to the right, is im
mediately succeeded by one on the left of 70°. Now and then
the intensity of the current is but feeble in the first moment,
increases then for a time, and then gradually sinks to zero.
Such variations render a numerical comparison of the intensity
of the current in the different cases quite impossible, especially
as in general, on the repetition of one and the same experiment,
highly different values are obtained for the magnitudes of the
deflections.    I have therefore merely stated in general, in the
notes to the   Table,  when the current was especially strong or
feeble: when reversions of the current result, they are for the
most part already indicated in the Table by the signs of in
equality placed beneath one another.

         GENTLEMEN,
        OUR Number for the present month has just come into my
      hands, and     findI    contains     interesting paper upon the
                                             it                        an
 knight's move,       Dr.    by
                            Roget,     which my attention   to particu                                           is
 larly drawn, from the circumstance           that essay having,    ap      of                                             it

                                     my chess articles of Fraser's Ma                                in
 gazine (see Fraser               of
                           March 1840.).        that memoir, the sub            In
ject     of
         the knight's   circuitous leap was   merely  touched upon                                                                    en

            every Square   of the Chess-board alternately.                  499
passant; my object being only to give a method by which
the cavalier could be guided mechanically through the la
byrinth of the sixty-four squares, without the director's seeing
the board, but ordering the move from memory alone; and
the means furnished by me seem fully to meet the end in
view.   Dr. Roget's solution of the problem is highly inge
nious, and it has given me much pleasure to follow his knight
over the field. The subject having been once broached in
your scientific Journal, it is my present aim to add in some
degree to the materials already contributed by the learned se
cretary of the Royal Society.
    Those who have not gone deeply into chess are hardly
aware that a whole library has been written upon the knight's
move, and ten thousand modes are printed in which the feat
may be performed.          Many of these methods are coupled
with the most curious conditions, and must have taken long
years to perfect.       In addition to the authorities quoted by
Dr. Roget, I append a list of works and writers, exclusively
devoted to the problem in question. That so much time has
been well spent,    I  am not prepared to admit; although the
matter is as fair a hobby to ride as any other species of solitary
                                                        I
calculation: but attached enthusiastically as am to the prac
                           I
tice of chess as a game, cannot but regret the same energies
have not been applied to illustrate points more immediately
connected with the conduct of our scientific sport.           Many
parts of chess, particularly the openings and endings of the
game, are capable of mathematical demonstration; and to
name one, the celebrated study of what should be the legiti
mate termination of the strife by King, Rook, and Bishop,
against King and Rook only, has been an open question from
earliest time.    Philidor, at the head of a strong body of chess
scribes, considers the Rook and Bishop ought to win by force;
while an equal number of writers entitled to authority dis
miss this quantum of conflicting strength as a drawn game.
To him who shall first give a printed solution of this highly
difficult problem, the thanks of the European chess circle
would be eagerly and gratefully tendered; and we should
be proud to enrol him in the       St.George's Chess Club,      the    as
man who had achieved       a  task,  compared    with which the             la
bours  of  Hercules were but    as  typical.

I    said, the bodies produced               by

two different classes: some

genus, to the same chemical type: the others could not take
their place there.  What place can be properly assigned to
these kinds of bodies?
  We   have not to wait long for a reply, and it carries the
law of substitutions to a degree of generality and importance
which it does not belong to me to develop here, but which
the order of ideas obliges me to indicate.
  The admirable              .#
                          of M. Regnault on the aethers has
indeed  given  an  unexpected  development to the theory of
types.  There is nothing more natural than to class in one
genus bodies which approach so near as acetic acid and chlor
acetic acid : but there must be good reasons for admitting
that there is a true analogy between

   Amongst these bodies, to which, without forcing anything,
we might add prussic acid and ammonia, we meet with acids,
bases, neutral bodies, and consequently substances the most
unlike in an ordinary chemical view.
   M. Regnault admits, and, he purposes to prove, that     the                             all
bodies     unlike, chemically speaking, which this series con
           so

easy to class these ideas in the clearest manner, by the three
following propositions:—
     1. Experience proves that a body may lose one                                          of      its   ele
                                                   its
                                     place, equivalent for equivalent;
ments and take another                   of in
this    the
       is     general  fact     substitutions.
     2.When body       a     modified
                                  is        this way, we may admit
                                                               in
that      its
          molecule has always remained intact, forming group,
                                                                                            of a
a  system      which one element has taken the place
                  in                                              another
purely and simply.
     Inthis point       view, which
                           of            altogether mechanical, and
                                                            is
which       that
            is          of
                    which M. Regnault pursues the study,               the                              all
bodies   produced               by
                           substitution   present   the same    grouping
and may           be        the same molecular type.           look upon
                                  a to
               referred                                                                I
them       constituting
           as               natural family.
     3.Amongst the bodies produced                                  by
                                                substitution, there are
a  great number which evidently keep the same chemical cha
racter, acting the part        acid      of base         or    of
                                                      the same manner     in
and       the same degree
          in                                  as
                                    they did before the modification
they have undergone.
    These are the bodies which have considered       I         belonging               as
to  one chemical    type,      makingas   part      the same genus,

speak the language                of
                            naturalists.
    Thus      explained the law
                is                     substitutions, thus
                                                     of           we give                   do

loping before the Academy.
    Before going further, it is just to notice here the labours of
the chemists who have directed the science towards the point
of view which now occupies us.
    M. Regnault not only takes the first place in this respect,
by the date of his observations, but by the importance of his
researches and with respect to the ideas he has deduced from
them, we must consider this young chemist as having ad
vanced more than any one the state of the science on this
point.
                                   I
    In my own name can speak more freely than when was                                          I
commissioned to express the opinion of the Academy, and                                               I
think it my duty to declare here that the views of M. Reg
nault are connected with physical studies of the highest or
der, and that they give to the theory of substitutions a de
velopment as fortunate as it was unlooked for, in              applica                   its
 tion to  the study           of
                          the most intimate physical properties                                      of
 bodies.
    At the same time with M. Regnault, two other chemists
well known        the Academy, MM. Persoz and Laurent, were
                    to
also   occupied      researches concerning the theory
                         in                                   substitu                   of

    One    of them indeed, M. Persoz, did not appear            occupy                    to

                                  mineral bodies, agreed perfectly
with the developments which the theory               substitutions re  of
ceived     bydegrees   from   experience.   The   system      formulae               of

 mineral chemistry, have then found            fortunate application

has led    to the discovery                 of
                                     organic chemistry.

    M. Laurent on his side has made multitude              researches,

insisted on the identity of the function of the chlorine with
that of the hydrogen in bodies formed by substitution long
before     it had been positively established by experience.
     It   will not be my object now to write the history of the
theory which occupies us; when experience shall have sounded

    LXXVII.         On an apparent Inversion                  of Perspective in viewing
     Objects with a Telescope.   By JAMEs D. For BEs, Esq.,
     F.R.S., 4 rofessor of Natural Philosophy in the University
      of   Edinburgh.*
                 last, Sir John Robison directed my attention
    INtoOctober
         a curious anomaly in the apparent perspective of ob
jects seen through a telescope which had been first mentioned
 to him by Mr. Whitwell.
    It consists in a complete seeming inversion of the true                         in
 clination of two horizontal lines towards a vanishing point
when seen through an ordinary telescope.        The top and bot
 tom lines of a row of windows,   for instance, viewed obliquely,
 seem, within the limit of the field of view of the telescope to
converge to a point on the opposite hand of the spectator
from that indicated by the common rules of perspective, and
by the experience of the naked eye. . There is no better ex
emplification of the fact than by viewing the figure of a com
mon sign-board, not far from the eye and considerably fore
shortened, with a common pocket telescope.           The letters
appear gradually to increase from the nearer towards the
more remote part of the inscription.
    That the appearance is such as we describe no one will
readily admit who does not make the experiment for himself;
but once made, the fact appears so certain as to create sur
prise, that it does not always strike us, and that it has not
                I
(so far as am aware) been mentioned in books on such sub
J
iects.
  The first time I saw the anomalous appearance in com
pany with Sir John Robison and Mr. W. A. Cadell, the
explanation         which         I
                         am about to state occurred to me as
the true one.      Not  being  particularly conversant with the
subject of perspective, I contented myself with stating my
opinion in writing at the time, and should probably have
                                                      I
never recurred to the subject, had not been lately requested
to examine an ingenious paper, in which the reality of this
distortion was admitted, and an attempt made to account for
it by tracing the path of the rays through the telescopic lenses.
Conceiving these investigations to be unsatisfactory,         made            I
one or two simple experiments, which satisfied me completely
of the accuracy of the view which                         I
                                          had previously taken of
the matter, and which I now proceed to state.

508 Prof. Forbes on an apparent Inversion                                                       of Perspective,
served, the spectator has previously determined by his eye the
real position of the plane of the object towards which he di
rects his telecope: and when he views that object with a mag
nifying power of two, he believes himself to be looking at an
object twice as large in the same plane as before; or else
(what comes to the same thing) the same object as before
brought twice as near to him, but moved parallel to itself.
In either of these cases, the vanishing point ought to remain
exactly the same for the enlarged as for the original object.
If a b c d be a board 4 feet long and 1 foot high, the eye expects
to see through the telescope magnifying twice, a figure similar
to that which a board 8 feet long and 2 high would present

are admitted, the value of E different from zero shows that
the absolute heat is not constant; but the preceding theory
does not appear to me to furnish the means of determining the
value of D, and hence of deciding with certainty whether the
latent heat is constant, and whether in augmentations of heat
the sensible heat only varies.       I think there can be little
doubt that the conditions assumed by Laplace actually ob
tain, and that the hypothesis attributed to Watt” must be aban
doned.     The experiments recorded by Mr. Parkes in the
3rd volume of the Transactions of the Society of Civil Engi
neers, p. 71, which show that the quantity of fuel required to
evaporate a given weight of water is nearly the same what
ever be the pressure of the steam, do not seem to me to au
thorize a different conclusion.      For this is precisely what
would take    place  if the latent heat be constant, and if the
quantity of fuel required to generate the latent greatly exceed
that required to generate the concomitant sensible heat.
   The quantity y has never before been determined for
steamt or for the vapour of any liquid, properly so called,
as far as I am aware.      It may excite surprise that the value
of y should come out less than unity. Both Poisson and
Dulong assert that it is evident that y must surpass unity,
but the reason which they assign appears to me inconclusive.

LXXIX.          On the Combinations of Carbon with Silicon and

THE brown residuums of all white irons, when boiled with
  hydrochloric acid before ignition, parted with their iron
with extreme difficulty.  In one trial after boiling the mixture
in a bottle whose neck was shut up with a capillary tube; first
no apparent change took place, and only hydrochloric acid
escaped; after boiling an hour the contents of the bottle began
to become thickish, a disagreeably smelling gas escaped, which
when ignited burned with a small but intensely blue-coloured
flame.

chester Memoirs.   See Dr. Thomson's Outline of Heat and Elasticity, p. 19s.

left a dark-green residuum, weighing only 2.64 grains, and
this residuum burnt in a dried stream of air in a horizontal
glass tube, blackened with the first action of heat, and drops
of water collected on the upper part of the tube. After the

516           Dr. Schafhaeutl             on the Different Species         of
assume that the metallic iron is in combination with carbon,
azote and hydrogen, or perhaps in a state forming a sort of
cyanet of iron.
   The relation of the quantity of constituents of the brown
residuum of the iron is so stable and so accurately in atomic
proportions, that we may safely conclude the quantity of carbon
from the amount of oxygen absorbed.
   If we denote the increase of weight by letter (a), the oxygen
of silicon as (s), the oxygen of iron by (f), and the carbon
by (c), we obtain always the following simple formula, par
ticularly when we consider that the iron is oxidized according
                                   • 5 --
to the above-mentioned formula                     F F:
                              s +     a   =        f–a.

                             found the relations of carburets of

   If we
       further consider, that the white silica only remains
when the iron residuum has been exposed to a number of ig
nitions, and that after only a few ignitions it remains always
dark black, soluble neither in alkalis nor acids; we may find
therein likewise aproof, that silicon is combined chemically with
carbon.      Further, the remainder of the residuum five times
ignited had gained 0.028 grains, after the black-coloured
scales had disappeared; this increase in weight can only be
ascribed to the oxidation of those black scales, which must have
been a metal whose oxide was white.         Further, if we consider
that the remainder of the residuum only once ignited, after
having changed            its
                       deep-black colour      white, and after emit

   Iron of the works of Creuzot, departement de Saone et de
Loire.   Specific gravity = 7:536; the colour of the fracture
dead grey. Treated as usual with hydrochloric acid of spe
cific gravity 1-103.    The evolution of hydrogen gas con
tinued for fourteen  days. The escaping hydrogen had an in
tolerable smell, somewhat resembling the smell of selenium.
The remainder in the retort had retained the shape of the
fragments of the iron previous to solution.   When washed
 upon a filter, as soon as boiling water was poured upon the
 partially dry fragments, the air contained between the pores
 of the fragments escaped with the same hissing noise for a
 considerable time, as hydrogen escapes when hydrochloric
 acid is poured upon iron. In 35 grains of this iron 0.3213
 grains of sulphur were contained, and the remainder was
 = 14:880 of a yellowish-brown colour. Concentrated hy
 drochloric acid when cold had no further action upon                                it;

518            Dr. Schafhaeutl       on the Different Species                 of
original state, viz. a dull red heat. After cooling it had as
sumed a light-gray colour, arising from the intermixture of
black with white spots, some of the white spots had aggregated
into rather large reddish-white lumps. It gained in weight
 = 0.795 and was very powerfully attracted by the magnet.
I  boiled it again with concentrated hydrochloric acid and ob
tained a residuum = 4:217 grains.        Heated on the lid of a
platinum crucible it began to ignite spontaneously, and had
 afterwards lost 0.124 grains. Its colour now assumed a lighter
 gray appearance, and it looked more woolly and voluminous.
    It was still attracted by the magnet. The black spots must
 therefore be a compound of carbon, iron and silicon, which
 could be destroyed neither by fire nor by acids.
      I weighed again, 14.880 grains of the above-mentioned re
 siduum, and boiled it with hydrochloric acid for nearly thirty
 minutes. The remainder of the powder weighed now only
 1.68 grains, was of a dirty yellowish-brown colour, and still re
 tained the well-known smell of hydrogen gas. When heated
 it did not ignite spontaneously. It was apparently increasing
 in bulk, and began to assume a black colour, throwing up
 some dust on the sides of the crucible.       After the crucible had
 acquired a white heat, the black colour rapidly disappeared,
 and a beautiful lemon-coloured powder remained, which after
 cooling, changed to a greenish yellow, and weighed 1-12 grains.
 It consisted of 0.687 silica, and oxide of chromium and iron
  = 0:526. I mention these two experiments, to show the great
 difference betwixt the residuums of the two remainders, boiled
 for a shorter or longer time. The remainder loses                spon             its

I now proceed to show the results obtained when the above
mentioned residuum is treated, instead of acids, with caustic
levs.
    ºss  grains of this residuum, powdered and boiled with
strong caustic potash ley for ten minutes, lost 0:261 grains.
When the ley     was poured over the powder it foamed like soap
suds.    A little hydrogen was disengaged, emitting (during
the whole boiling,) an odour partly resembling that of heated
asphaltum and partly that of fresh peat. Shortly after the
boiling commenced, the powder appeared to be swimming in
the clear liquid like distinct black scales, closely resembling
so-called graphite scales, separated from gray cast iron; but
when dried on the filter, those scales resumed their former
yellowish-brown colour, and looked again like powder, with
out any trace of scales remaining; which again confirms my
former assertion, that       residuums  all

   I only state here briefly, that in order to separate chromium,
iron, phosphorus and alumina, I proceeded in the usual way,
—by melting the first-dissolved and evaporated quantity of
iron to be analysed with carbonate of soda in a platinum cru
cible, and dissolving the fused mass in distilled water. The
solution contained the phosphoric acid, the chromium, and a
little alumina and silica; the remainder was oxide of iron,
silica and alumina, and a little alkali.
    The solution kept quiet for some time in a dish covered
 with paper, in order to allow the manganese to separate, was
 neutralized with nitric acid and evaporated to dryness. After
 having been moistened

 silica was left behind. The filtered liquor, neutralized with
 ammonia,    let fall basic phosphate
                            a                alumina.  From the                      of

 lead precipitated phosphoric acid, sulphuric acid and chro
 mium  in   combination with oxide      lead. Hydrochloric acid             of

 which consisted now only        phosphate              of

             Cast Iron, Steel, and Malleable Iron.               523
    The  quantities of manganese and silicon are as 2.54 to 1;
now,   if  we follow the process during the transition of this
cast iron into steel, both those bodies have to burn away with
the same quantity of carbon.      By chemical analysis we find
in the first two-thirds of the process, the quantity of man
ganese very rapidly diminishing in comparison with the car
bon, leaving the silicon quite untouched.      On the contra
ry, when manganese is replaced by silicon, this last is oxi
dized so very rapidly, as it is in relation to manganese only
 like 1 : 2:54, so that the greatest part of the silicon is oxi
dized when more carbon is present than is necessary to pre
 vent the iron from fusion at a white heat. When the carbon
 is so far diminished, that the iron begins to become suffici
 ently solid for the hammer—all the silicon is oxidized, which
 gives, as we shall soon perceive, a hardness and tenacity to
the steel.
    Before we take   leave  these three specimens of cast iron,
                             of
I must return to the solution of acetate of lead of specimen A,
in which the sulphuretted hydrogen had been collected.
   The precipitated sulphuret of lead, as before mentioned, was
not crystallized in scales; on the contrary, it had a viscous
 dark brown appearance; and after some days standing, I found
 it to contain rhomboidal columns of white crystals deposited
 on the bottom of the bottles in needle-like aggregations, and
 in a vertical position on the sides. On first inspection I
 considered them as crystallized acetate of lead, but their dif
 ficult solubility, however, in distilled water, induced me to ex
 amine them more closely; and by trying them with the blow
 pipe, the rising copious white fumes covering the charcoal
 immediately showed the presence of antimony, and the well
 known yellow ring around the crystals on the charcoal
 plainly signified the presence of lead. The crystals them
 selves, treated with concentrated sulphuric acid, disengaged
 acetic acid, and the crystals therefore consisted of antimony,
 lead, and acetic acid.
    The above-mentioned treatment of 60 grains of white iron
 with hydrochloric acid of the specific gravity 1-103, left 2.92
  grains of sulphuret of lead mixed with antimony and acetate
 of lead, and the precipitate contained 0.833 antimony.
     It is remarkable, that not only almost                all
                                                    the antimony
  escaped with the hydrogen, but that the antimony was likewise
  deposited  in the acetate   of
                              lead, being also oxidized and con
  verted into an  acetate, and that        no
                                       trace          of
                                               antimony followed
  the  hydrogen  afterit had passed  the second bottle.

   of Tutors and private Students. By Thomas STEPHENs DAvies,
   F.R.S., Lond. and Edinb. Royal Military Academy, Woolwich.
         work of Dr. Hutton is too well known to require any de
        HE
       tailed description in our pages.   Drawn up half a century ago
for the use of the gentlemen cadets of the Royal Military Academy,
its object was to remove the inconvenience which had been felt to
arise from the use of detached parts of a multitude of works on dif
ferent branches of mathematical science. Compiled, too, for the use
of boys who entered the institution at the age of fourteen, and whose
periods of study varied from two to four years, for boys who beside
mathematics were instructed in their applications to mechanical and
physical science,—the course was necessarily rendered a brief one.
   Those of our readers who have paid attention to the history of ma
thematical science in this country, do not need to be told that, at
the time of       its
                first publication,  was by far the best treatise on the

subject existing      our language. During the time which has elapsed,
                         in
many improvements have been introduced into               Dr. Gregory,            by
to  keep pace with the progress      science; but

the alterations were much more extensive and important than any
 which had preceded them. The number              new questions which

                                           in      and   many subjects
were treated there which for the first time found their way into                                  an
elementary book,        amongst which may            particularly specified

thought that such works were useful               teachers, and

these delicate objects; and has thus had ample opportunity of con
firming the principal facts therein stated. He has now procured in
all 230 ova from the Fallopian tube. But being aware that repeated
observations alone do not suffice in researches of this nature, unless
extended to the very earliest stages, he again specially directed his
attention to the ovum while it is still within the ovary, with a view
to discover its state at the moment of fecundation, as well as imme
diately before and after that event.
    The almost universal supposition, that the Purkinjian or germinal
vesicle is the essential portion of the ovum, has been realized in
these investigations; but in a manner not anticipated by any of the
numerous conjectures which have been published.                The germinal
 vesicle becomes filled with cells, and these again become filled with
 the foundations of other cells; so that the vesicle is thus rendered
 almost opake. The mode in which this change takes place is the
 following, and it is one which, if confirmed by future observation,
 must modify the views recently advanced on the mode of origin, the
mature, the properties, and the destination of the nucleus in the physi
 ology of cells. It is known that the germinal spot presents, in some
 instances, a dark point in its centre. The author finds that such a
 point is invariably present at a certain period; that it enlarges, and
 is then found to contain a cavity filled with fluid, which is exceed
 ingly pellucid. The outer portion of the spot resolves itself into
 cells; and the foundations of other cells come into view in its in
 terior, arranged in layers around the central cavity; the outer layers
 being pushed forth by the continual origin of new cells in the in
 terior. The latter commence as dark globules in the pellucid fluid of
  the central cavity. Every other nucleus met with in these researches
  has seemed to be the seat of changes essentially the same. The
  appearance of the central portion of the nucleus                      is,
                                                             from the above
  process, continually varying; and the author believes that the
  nature  of   the nucleolus  of   Schleiden       is  thus explained.

  there arise at this part two cells, which constitute the foundation
  of the new being. These two cells enlarge, and imbibe the fluid of
  those around them, which are at first pushed further out by the two
  central cells, and subsequently disappear by liquefaction.                        The
  contents of the germinal vesicle thus enter into the formation of
  two cells. The membrane of the germinal vesicle then disappears
  by liquefaction.
     Each of the succeeding twin cells presents a nucleus, which, having
 first passed to the centre of its cell, resolves itself into cells in the
  manner above described.               By this means the twin cells, in their
  turn, become filled with other cells. Only two of these in each
  twin cell being destined to continue, the others, as well as the
  membrane of each parent-cell, disappear by liquefaction, when four
  cells remain. These four produce eight, and so on, until the germ
  consists of a mulberry-like object, the cells of which do not admit
  of being counted. Nor does the mode of propagation continue the
  same with reference to number only.                   The process inherited from

   The process above described as giving origin to the new being in
the mammiferous ovum, is no doubt universal.       The author thinks
that there is evidence of its occurrence in the ova of batrachian
Reptiles, some osseous Fishes, and certain of the Mollusca; though
the explanation given of these has been of a very different character.
It has hitherto been usual to regard the round white spot, or cica
tricula, on the yelk of the bird's laid egg, as an altered state of the
discus vitellinus in the unfecundated ovarian ovum. So far from
thinking that such is the case, the author believes the whole sub
stance of the cicatricula in the laid egg to have origin within the            its
germinal vesicle, the same manner

     M. Marchand      on the Reduction    of Chromate of Lead.      533
     Many persons imagine that in organic analysis with chromate of
Head it is necessary to use a very strong heat in order to perfect the
operation.     This is a mistake, for carbon as well as hydrogen very
easily reduces the chromate. If however it is required to libe
rate oxygen, then the temperature must be very great, and the
salt must be fused. This circumstance, as may be easily conceived,
is   inconvenient and liable to introduce error.
     When chromate of lead is heated in    a current of hydrogen gas, it
 commences to     glow  at a heat far below redness, and a quantity of
 water is formed. The yellow colour of the salt disappears; it be
 comes black, and very small metallic globules are disseminated
 through the mass.
     3-049 grammes lost 0-307 gram. or 10:07 per cent. of oxygen;
 this loss may be increased by a continued and strong heat.
      1.91 grammes lost in another experiment 0-224 gram., or 11.8
 per cent. oxygen.     At the commencement of the reduction of this
 portion the temperature was kept moderate, by which it lost 0-2045
 grm., or 10.7 per cent.        Oxygen gas was then passed over it
 while in a heated state. At a low degree of heat, the mass burnt
 with great brilliancy, turned brown, at least partly so, which was
 very evident on cooling.      It absorbed 0-133 grim. oxygen, which
 calculated for the original quantity (1-91) amounted to 7 per cent.;
 a small quantity of water was formed during the operation, amount
 ing, however, to but a few milligrammes.           It would therefore
 appear that hydrogen was condensed in the pores of the reduced
 mass, but in a small quantity; heating in a stream of carbonic acid
 gas would have entirely driven it out. The oxidated quantity 1-839
 grim. which had lost from the first 3.7 per cent. of oxygen, was
 again reduced in hydrogen gas, by which it lost 0-152 grm., this
 upon the whole quantity is equal to 8 per cent. Upon heating in
 oxygen gas the same appearances again took place, and the mass
 absorbed 0-128 grm., therefore, a similar quantity as before. A
  subsequent reduction at a very high temperature occasioned a loss
  of 0 128 grim. while a repeated oxidation only gave an increase
  of 0:119. This was again driven out by hydrogen, but without any
  further decrease of oxygen.
      If we examine these experiments, keeping in view the results,
  we shall find that 1.91 grm. lost 0-224 grim. equal to 11.8 per
  cent. while the last oxidation was only 1° 19 grm. or 6.2 per cent.
  Chromate of lead contains 19:54 per cent. of oxygen, equal to four
  atoms, Cr Pb. 11.8 per cent. is equal to 2:4 atoms or nearly Šths of
  the whole amount of oxygen.        This would be 12.2 per cent. The
  reduction, if complete, would convert all the oxide of lead into the
  metallic state and the chromic acid into the state of oxide of chrome.
                         2 Cr + 6 O    2Pb + 2 O
                                 3O            2 O
                         2 Cr + 3 O    2 Pb.
      By oxidation about half of the oxygen is recombined; this takes
   place the more readily when the metallic lead is in a finely divided

 534                    Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
 state and not melted by too strong a heat. It is not the lead alone,
 but also the oxide of chrome, which absorbs oxygen.        If oxide of
 chrome alone be heated in oxygen gas, it is not converted into ,
 chromic acid; but this takes place, as is well known, if an alkali be
 present.   I therefore consider that oxide of lead has the same effect
 in this respect as an alkali. In order to obtain an intimate mix
 ture of oxide of chrome and oxide of lead, I endeavoured by Ineans
 of heat so to decompose the chromate of lead, that all the chromic
 acid should be converted into oxide of chrome. The temperature
 must be very high for this purpose, and it requires a long time be
 fore any considerable quantity of oxygen can be driven out of this
 salt.  1409 gramme was fused in a very thin platina crucible by
 the strongest heat of a spirit-lamp before any appreciable loss took
 place. 0-057 grim. were then given off equal to 4 per cent. which is
 nearly ºths of the whole quantity contained in it; this would be
 3.9 per cent. It is therefore very probable that at first the chro
 mate of lead is so decomposed that basic chromate of lead and
 oxide of chrome are formed.
          2 (CrO, Pb O) = Cr O, Pb, O, + CrO 1% + Ola.
    The compound obtained in this manner I considered very favour.
 able for the conversion of chromic oxide into chromic acid. I heated
 it,and passed       stream
                        a        oxygen through
                                           of           However,        my great

    That chromate of lead is very easily converted by means of carbon
 and hydrogen into a mixture of oxide of chrome and metallic lead.
   This mixture by heating is in a state to combine with oxygen;
 and this combination takes place not only with the metallic lead,
 but also with the oxide of chrome.
    By heat alone it is very difficult to deprive chromate of lead of
 oxygen.     It is at first converted into a mixture of basic chromate
 of lead and oxide of chrome: in order to reduce all the chromic
 acid into oxide of chrome, an uncommonly highly temperature is re
 quired.
    When a mixture of oxide of chrome and oxide of lead is heated,
it is also converted into basic chromate of lead and oxide of lead.
    It is therefore chromate of lead, which is often employed in or
 ganic analysis, from which this latter mixture is derived.—Journal

WITH    all combinations
   positive metal, even                        with some in which amalgamated
zinc occupies that place, the water has the ascendency over the
(dilute) hydrochloric acid, as already observed by Fechner with
the combination zinc-copper in a somewhat more complex ex
periment, his experimentum crucist.
   But water also exhibits this ascendency, in the greater num
ber of cases, over sulphuric acidf; with the combinations zinc
platina, zinc-tin even more strongly than over hydrochloric acid,
exceedingly strong, especially with amalgamated zinc and re
cently heated platina. And yet sulphuric acid is no electrolyte.
   Nor is nitric acid an electrolyte, and nevertheless it so alters
the electromotive force that with zinc-platina it has the ascend
ency over water, but in the other combinations with zinc and
tin as positive member it succumbs to                            it.

538           M. Poggendorff                   on Galvanic                  Circuits composed                  of
     Just     as   little, in my opinion, do the facts speak for Faraday’s
theory.            A
              stronger affinity must undoubtedly be attributed to
the chlorine for zinc, iron, and tin than to the oxygen; and
nevertheless, in circuits containing one of these metals as positive
member, hydrochloric acid does not act more strongly, but more
weakly, than water*.
   In the dilute sulphuric and nitric acids, according to Faraday,
only the affinity of the oxygen of the water acts on the positive
metal. Consequently these acids, when water acts opposed
to them, must either produce no current, or, if the above
mentioned affinity is increased by their presence, develope, as
is otherwise generally admitted, a more powerful electromotive
force than pure water. Nevertheless the two acids act, in the
greater number of cases examined, more weakly than watert.
   The same observation may be applied to caustic potash and am
monia. In Faraday’s “Earperimental Researches” we find it stated,
 § 919, “Thus, when zinc, platina, and dilute sulphuric acid are
used, it is the union of the zinc with the oxygen of the
water which determines the current;” further, $ 932, “The si
milarity in the action of either dilute sulphuric acid or potassa
goes indeed far beyond this, even to the proof of identity,” and
§ 933, “But               all
                    the effects     these experiments prove,
                                                      in            think,                                     I

                                           necessarily dependent     upon,
and associated            with,
                              as the

                                          is               the water, that                      of
produces the current; and that the acid             alkali merely act                 or                                 as
solvents           by
              removing the oxidized zinc.”
   But      truth the caustic alkalies always act differently from
              in
water and differently from acidst, and that immediately,               the                                          in

540        M. Poggendorff            on Galvanic         Circuits composed     of
the solution of chlorine acts more powerfully than hydrochloric
acid, in which, nevertheless, the chlorine is electrolytically com
bined with hydrogen, and without doubt is more strongly re
tained by the hydrogen than in the solution of chlorine by the
water.
    It might perhaps be replied, that the solution of chlorine is
not a mere solution of the chlorine, but a mixture of hydrochlo
ric acid and the oxide of chlorine; but setting aside that this
supposition is not proved, is not even very probable, and is
accompanied by a second supposition not more probable, that
this mixture or the oxide of chlorine is of more difficult decom
position than hydrochloric acid, we need only call to mind the
other cases where non-electrolytes exert a sensible influence on
the development of the electromotive force,—the actions of sul
phuric acid, of nitric acid, ammonia, water impregnated with ory
gen, of the perovide of hydrogen”, of the quinto-sulphuret of
 potassium (KS)—to perceive that such a supposition is neither
required nor can be generalized.
    The position, that those bodies which, brought between the
 metallic plates of a voltaic pile, render it active, are all electro
 lytes (Earp. Res. § 858, 921), must therefore be thus altered,
that the fluids between the metallic plates must, it is true, be
electrolytes, i. e. decomposable bodies, since, at least with
 aqueous fluids and with a certain intensity of current, no con
 duction can take place without decomposition; but that the
 electromotive force which is developed on the contact of these
 fluids with the metals is not in any necessary connexion with
 the conductivity or decomposability, and can be increased or
 diminished by bodies which are not electrolytes, i.e. not directly
 decomposablet.       I shall hereafter communicate another proof
 on this point.
    Not less difficult for the disputed theory would be the cases
 in which hydrochloric acid and sal-ammoniac, hydrochloric acid
 and salt, or salt and sal-ammoniac are opposed to each other. In
                                                no it,
each of them, according to           only the chlorine could act                         on
both    sides, and  consequently      current arise. But    will pass          I

                             these cases and turn      the iodide         to             of

in    10 the iodide           of potassium.              In   6 the result was ambiguous,
as during the experiment a decided reversion of the current en
sued; and probably some of the first belong to this category.
If  we merely look at the number of favourable cases, the affi
nity-theory would indeed still retain some probability; but this
must entirely disappear if at the same time we take into consi
deration the weight of the unfavourable cases.
   Among the latter, viz. the unfavourable cases, those with
platina more especially surprised me, and of these that with
the combination zinc-platina and hydrochloric acid. It is in
fact the same experiment which Faraday mentions in support
of his view, which he himself had the kindness to show me in

    It   is not to be supposed that the acid, thus diluted, is too
weak to act on the zinc.; on the contrary,                                     it attacks it very
violently, so energetically indeed that it becomes sensibly warm.
The plea, that with the dilute acid the affinity of the chlorine
for the zinc has become from the presence of the water weaker
than that of the iodine for the same metal, is therefore inad
missible.
   Moreover, the same acid has with silver and with copper, no
matter whether combined with zinc (common or amalgamated)
iron or tin, in a high degree the ascendency over the solution of
the iodide of potassium,_a phaenomenon which, compared with
the opposite one on employing zinc-platina, at the same time
clearly proves what essential part the two metals of the circuit
take in the production of the current, and how contrary to nature,
therefore, that view            is,
                         according      which,                 the                                       to

simultaneously immersed and taken out. During the first im

trated acid with 4 vol. water, or in weight 1 and 2 parts).              In
this case there was no indication of s > i ; the first deflexion
      -
occurred even with the first immersion of the platina in favour
of s i, and indeed very violently = 90°. All the succeeding
effects were likewise powerful, and in the same direction.             The
deflexion was, with slight vibrations, 80°, 70°, 60°, and so on,
till at last about 20°, from whence, remarkably enough, it again
increased. The amplitude of the last observed vibration went
from 70°,+ 30°.
    The violent action of the acid on the zinc obliged me to ter
minate the experiment; but it was immediately recommenced
with amalgamated zinc and the same acid. At present the cur
                                             -

was to stand in the acid. On contemporaneous immersion of

   I have communicated these details in order to show that the
phaenomena in circuits of the kind described are by no means
always            so simple as              it   seems they should be according                                           to the
affinity-theory. That, moreover, they do not speak for it is
undoubtedly evident enough. Only at first and transitorily has
the sulphuric acid the ascendency over the iodide of potassium;
subsequently      this acid, although it incontrovertibly attacks the
zinc    more violently than the iodide of potassium (even with
euergy increasing during the course of the action), is always
overpowered by it; nay, what is remarkable, the less dilute acid
(with 4 times         vol.       its        of
                              water) succumbs         the iodide       potas            to                            of
sium           greater extent than the acid diluted with

546          M.    Poggendorff on Galvanic Circuits composed                                     of
phuric acid, without this addition of nitric acid, afford in most
cases the opposite result?          Want of chemical action on the
zinc it  certainly  is not     And then, how, even according to the
affinity-theory, is the action of the nitric acid to be explained P
   A long discussion might here be opened; I will, however,
merely touch upon one point.          Faraday states that the addition
of nitric acid to the   sulphuric   acid increases the intensity of the
chemical action; and, after communicating some facts from
which he draws the conclusion that this acid does not increase
the quantity of the electricity, he adds: “This mode of increa
sing the intensity of the electric current, as it excludes the effect
dependent upon many pairs of plates, or even the effect of
making any one acid stronger or weaker, is at once referable to
the conditions and force of the chemical affinities which are
brought into action, and may, both in principle and practice,
be considered as perfectly distinct from any other mode*.”
   Here we may with justice put the question, What measure
then do we possess for the intensity of a chemical action ?
When the question                     is,   as
                                   the attack       toacid       metal,     of    an         on   a
we    have,  I believe, no other measure than the      quantity     the                               of
metal which        dissolved from the unity
                       is                         surface    the unity      of          in
of  time.    But with this, certainly the most natural, view, there
exists no reason why the nitric acid should enjoy any single
advantage over the sulphuric acid, when these acids are taken                                                of
                      concentration that they both dissolve just the

since,       nevertheless, a specific distinction remains between the
effects of the        two acids, the one, added to the water, developing
a   slighter,      and the other a greater electromotive force than the
iodide of        potassium,   we should be forced to admit that the qua
lity of the chemical action produces a specific difference in the
excited electricity, and should thus again be brought back to
the position maintained by De la Rive, but hitherto not proved,
 of the variety of electricities. I know not whether this is the
 opinion of the English philosopher; but the above-mentioned
 position, and another in which he expresses as a conjecture, “The
 same quantity of electricity may pass in the same time, in at
 the same surface, into the same decomposing body in the same
 state, and yet, differing in intensity, will decompose in one case,
 and in the other not,”*—would admit of such a construction.
      But be this as it may, so much is certain, that there is no
  need of the hypothesis of an increase of the intensity of the
  chemical action, in order to explain the experiment in question.
  I   have in fact convinced myself in the most positive manner
  that the result of the addition of the nitric acid does decidedly
  not arise from the chemical attack of this acid on the zinc, but
  solely from an action of it on the platina.
       Instead of placing the zinc and platina in common in the
   stronger mixture of acids mentioned at p. 545,                I separated the
  two acids         by  animal membrane         (bladder),    inserted the zinc
   (amalgamated) in the sulphuric acid (1 vol. concentrated acid,
   and 4 vol. water), and the platina in the nitric acid (1 vol. con
   cent. acid, and 6 vol. water), while the two other plates, zinc
   and platina, stood in the solution of iodide of potassium. Now
   although in this case the zinc underwent no other attack
   in quantity and quality than in the experiment mentioned at
   p. 543, in which the iodide of potassium had the ascendency
   over the sulphuric acid, yet the direction of the current was the
   reverse; the iodide of potassium succumbed to the acid. The
    current also possessed a very considerable intensity, and, if not
    quite so powerful as in the case in which the zinc stood in the
    acid mixture, this, evidently, merely arose from collateral cir
    cumstances, partly from the separated acids having perhaps a
    weaker power of conduction than the mixed, partly, and with
    out doubt chiefly, from the metals in the present arrangement
    being in a somewhat disadvantageous position, the communica
    tion between the two being made only by the membranous
    moderate degrees of concentration; for it is at least in part decomposed, which
    is indicated by the altered development of gas at the zinc, and more decidedly
     evident from the ammonia, the existence of which in the solution of zinc may
     be distinctly demonstrated by the addition of an excess of caustic potassa.

without the first deflexion s = i, when sulphuric acid containing

a result of the increase of the electromotive force. But it must be proved with

 of considerable energy, gave          some indication that similar
 effects might be produced by a discharge of ordinary elec
 tricity, provided a sufficiently perfect insulation could be ob
  tained.
     100. To test this, a hollow glass cylinder, fig. 11, of about
 six inches in diameter, was prepared with a narrow riband of
                                  Fig. 11.
            a glass cylinder, b Leyden jar, c magnetizing spiral.
 tinfoil, about thirty feet long, pasted spirally around the out
 side, and a similar riband of the same length, pasted on the
inside; so that the corresponding spires of the two were di
 rectly opposite each other. The ends of the inner spiral
 passed out of the cylinder through a glass tube, to prevent
 all direct communication between the two. When the ends
 of the inner riband were joined by the magnetizing spiral
 (11.), containing a needle, and a discharge from a half-gallon
jar sent through the outer riband, the needle was strongly
 magnetized in such a manner as to indicate an induced current
 through the inner riband in the same direction as that of the
current of the jar. This experiment was repeated many times,
 and always with the same result.               -
     101. When the ends of one of the ribands were placed
 very nearly in contact, a small spark was perceived at the
 opening, the moment the discharge took place through the
 other riband.
    102. When the ends of the same riband were                   separated
to a considerable distance, a larger spark than the              last could
be drawn from each end by presenting a ball, or the              knuckle.
    103. Also if the ends of the outer riband were              united, so
as to form a perfect metallic circuit, a spark could be drawn
from any point of the same, when a discharge was sent
through the inner riband.
    104. The sparks in the two last experiments are evidently
due to the action known in ordinary electricity by the name
of the lateral discharge. To render this clear, it is perhaps

  of a    jar electrified positively, and the outer coating
               is                                                           con                     in
 nexion with the earth, then the jar contains small excess                        a                       of

    108. Experiments were next made in reference to the pro
duction of currents of the different orders by ordinary elec
tricity.    For this purpose a second cylinder was prepared
with ribands of tinfoil, in a similar manner to the one before
described. The two were then so connected that the secondary
current from the first would circulate around the second.
When a discharge was passed through the outer riband of
the first cylinder, a tertiary current was induced in the inner
riband of the second. This was rendered manifest by the
magnetizing of a needle in a spiral joining the ends of the
 last-mentioned riband.
    109. Also by the addition, in the same way, of a third cy
linder, a current of the fourth order was developed.         The
same result was likewise obtained     by  using  the arrangement
 of the coils and helices shown in fig. 9. For these experi
ments, however, the coils were furnished with a double coat
 ing of silk, and the contiguous conductors separated by a
 large plate of glass.
    110. Screening effects precisely the same as those exhibited
 in the action of galvanism were produced by interposing a
 plate of metal between the conductors of different orders,
 figures 8 and 9. The precaution was taken to place the plate
 between two frames of glass, in order to be assured that the
 effect was not due to a want of perfect insulation.
     11 1. Also analogous results were found when the experi
  ments were made with coils interposed instead of plates, as
 described in paragraph 68. When the ends of the inter
 posed coils were separated, no screening was observed; but
  when joined, the effect was produced. The existence of the
 induced current, in             all
                         these experiments, was determined                               by
      magnetism          of

 the case  of  galvanism. This result was                       so

 the   experiments   were  many    times   repeated, first with the glass
 cylinders, and then with the coils; the results, however, were
    ways the same.       The cylinders gave currents                one     all   in         di
 rection; the coils        alternate directions.

No other change was observed in the direction of the cur

 the true one, since the magnetizing spiral might itself, in
 some cases, induce an opposite current.                To satisfy myself

venient expression of Dr. Hare) that fifteen persons joining
hands and standing on the ground, received the shock at
once, when the first person of the series touched the wire.
A Leyden jar being grasped in the hand by the outer coating,
and the knob presented to the wire, a severe shock was re
ceived, as if by a perforation of the glass, but which was found
to be the result of the sudden and intense induction.
      125. These effects were evidently not due to the accumu
lated    intensity   at the extremities of the wire, on the prin
ciples of ordinary electrical distribution, since the knuckle
required to be brought within about a quarter of an inch be
fore the spark could be received. It was not alone the quan
tity, since the experiments of Wilson prove that the same
effect is not produced with an equal amount of electricity on
the surface of a large conductor.             It appears evidently there
fore a case of the induction of an electrical current on itself.

electricity, which passes off in the form of a current along
whole length, and thus the induction takes place                   the end    at

  562                  Mr. Lubbock on                 the     Heat of Vapours
 appears to open a field for discovery, which experimental
 industry cannot fail to cultivate with immediate success.
    Note.—On the evening of the meeting at which my investi
 gations were presented to the Society, my friend, Dr. Bache
 of the Girard College, gave an account of the investigations
 of Professor Ettingshausen of Vienna, in reference to the im
 provement of the magneto-electric machine, some of the re
 sults of which he had witnessed at the University of Vienna
 about a year since.     No published account of these experi
 ments has   yet reached this country, but it appears that Pro
 fessor Ettingshausen had been led to suspect the develop
 ment of a current in the metal of the keeper of the magneto
 electric machine, which diminished the effect of the current
 in the coil about the keeper, and hence to separate the coil
 from the keeper by a ring of wood of some thickness, and
 afterwards, to prevent entirely the circulation of currents
 in the keeper, by dividing it into segments, and separating
 them by a non-conducting material. I am not aware of the
 result of this last device, nor whether the mechanical diffi
 culties in       execution were fully overcome.
                       its                              gives                            It              me

INelectro-negative
    scarcely any analytical proceedings has the presence of
                   metals been more overlooked, than in the
analyses of cast iron, steel, and wrought iron: the best irons of
Sweden contain, as we shall soon show, a considerable quan
tity of arsenic, and the celebrated English Low-Moor iron
contains still more. By forging the best English cast steel,
i.
arsenic is volatilized and may be very easily detected by the
smell; and the blacksmiths who forge Low-Moor iron, fre
          complain of the unpleasant smell which escapes (by
them termed a sulphureous smell), causing them often swelled

Charcoal itself imparts a portion of sulphur to the iron.
   As a further proof of what has just been asserted, we now
refer to some specimens of French cast iron, the produce of
the furnaces near Alais, département du Gard, at the foot of
the Cevennes.
   These specimens were produced from hydrated oxides of
iron, which coverthe summits of several hills of limestone and
carboniferous sandstone extending over a long district, and
have undoubtedly been deposited in this state by water. The
greatest part of this ore has a perfectly ochry appearance,                                                 in

572           Dr. Schafhaeutl          on the Different Species            of
tion of the blast furnaces under some circumstances, which
I  shall further explain; so that I witnessed for months a dif
ferent working of the blast furnaces, even at different periods
of the day.
    Notwithstanding the profusion of rich ores throughout
 France, it is infinitely more difficult to produce iron of good
 quality from them, than from the clay ironstone in England;
 and excepting where iron is melted down with charcoal, the
 iron produced is of very inferior quality compared with that
of England.
     As   I think
                it will be very instructive to examine the chemi
cal properties of several specimens of such cast iron, obtained
from the same ore and in the same furnace, I shall briefly
describe five specimens of iron from the furnace of Alais.
     I
     call the first (a); it has a dead gray appearance, but is in
tersected by somewhat whitish shining rays having a distant re
semblance to the lamellar crystallization of white crystallized
charcoal iron. It was rather hard and brittle, and                specific      its
gravity was 7,442. The second specimen (b) was obtained
under peculiar circumstances. During one cast,                particular,  in
the iron ran from the hearth into the moulds              the sand, and
                                                                      in
the rapid contraction                of
                                the exterior           of

the still liquid interior through the face                       of
                                                        the pigs like
fountain.    The iron thus forced out           the   specimen
                                                       is         (b);                      it a

         a

a specific gravity         of
                         7-33.
   The specimen (c) was also perfectly silver-white, consisting
of       an
        extremely large pearl-like granulation, easily                                to    be
broken, and         its
                   specific gravity was 7:582.

matter was deposited, traversed by beautiful red needle-like
crystals; these crystals washed with water during solution lost
their colour, were not soluble in alcohol, and heated in a glass
tube emitted a very pungent smell somewhat resembling cya
nogen.
   The liquid solution of nitrate of lead smelt very strongly of
hydrogen developed from cast iron, and I am convinced, that
this compound of hydrogen, carbon, azote, and sulphur forms
a salt with the oxide of lead, which is more distinct, when the
acid, in which the cast iron is dissolved, is so weak, that little
or no sulphuretted hydrogen is disengaged. When acetate
of   lead is used,            and the lead carefully precipitated by                          sul
phuric acid, this compound is separated from the lead and will
be found to swim on the surface of the liquid. It is unfortu
nately too little to be collected, and the only way to glean some
idea as to         its
                 composition               is,

    The gelatinous mass, viewed through the microscope, con
sisted of an aggregation of gelatinous grains of silica, inter
spersed with grains at least ten times smaller of a vermilion
colour. The blue layers had the same composition, with the
exception, that the silica was penetrated by the before-men
tioned blue colour.
    From these experiments we can perceive very plainly the
mechanical structure of the white cast iron, in which the
close connexion of the silicon with carbon and azote is beau
tifully developed.
   The disappearance of the blue colour from the layers on
the outside during the contact of the acid and the air, shows
the progressive formation and decomposition—as well as the
interspersed brick-red grains resembling vanadic acid, and
explains the mechanical arrangement of the different consti

    Further, I dissolved 20 grains of the present specimen of
cast iron in aqua-regia; it was quickly and violently attacked,
leaving a black coaly residuum.           Nevertheless 1:11 grains
of the iron remained undissolved, which I carefully washed
and separated. The solution was then evaporated to dryness,
mixed with five times        weight       soda, and exposed

A   light gray muddy liquid was the result; but the mass on
the bottom was not much attacked. After changing the acid,
 its action was very soon stopped again.           By adding more
acid the action   began   again   very  violently;  the whole mass

      If  we treat powdered iron with a current of dry chlorine, a
quantity of silicon is always retained by the remaining car
bon and azote; and this is likewise a proof that a certain
quantity of silicon is chemically combined with the carbon,
as no alkali has the power to extract it”.
     * In specimensin which the silicon is combined with the iron, the silicon
is left after the solution of the iron in acids, in the form of a white and
 somewhat gelatinous granulation, as we saw in the gray iron from Vienne.
 On the contrary, where the carbon is combined with the silicon in not too
large proportions, even a white heat is insufficient to burn this carbon, as

has remained even in the last  edition of Turner's Chemistry,
that iron will weld at a red heat. When the grains of iron
at a white heat really come into contact with carbon, or when
a sufficient quantity of carbon has not been burnt away
during the process of puddling, the skeleton grains, instead
of adhering to each other, come into a state of fusion during
the    compressing force                  of the strokes of the hammer,                   assume

pared, silicon, iron, and arsenic were combined.                   Arsenic in
 combination with silicon has the         property    of  rendering     the lat
 ter more easily oxidized, so that the greater part of the silicon
is consumed before the arsenic, which occasioned the extraor
 dinary hissing noise, already mentioned, during the process
 of ebullition of the specimen e in the puddling furnace.
 The malleable iron thus prepared had entirely lost its sili
con, without which no peroxide of iron could be formed suf
ficiently liquid to resist the reducing power of the flames.
The protoxide, wherever it was formed, consisted of a dry
powder, which was speedily reduced by the action of the
flame into        its
                  former metallic state, combining                  the same            at

cemented steel has obtained the name of blistered steel, and
the oxygen of the part of this gas which is in contact with
the sides of the blister occasions those fine tints of yellow and
blue with which the inside of the blisters is generally covered.
    It is generally asserted that the outside of the cemented
 bar of steel contains more carbon than the inside, and that
 therefore the fusion of the cemented bar served to spread the
 carbon more equally throughout the mass. This is contrary
 to fact. When the iron bar which is to be cemented is of a
 suitable thickness, the process of carbonization commences,
 like the process of the reduction of iron ores, almost simul
 taneously at the centre and at the outside of the bar; and I
 have often found that the inside of the cemented bar contained
 a greater quantity of carbon than the outside.     The quantity
 of carbon imbibed by each portion of the bar depends en
 tirely on the quantity of carbon first contained in the differ
 ent parts of the iron bar, as well as on the carburet of silicon
 contained in      it;
                   and this different degree   carbonization may  of
even    be detected       by
                       the eye, from the various forms                                of   cry

    35 grains of this steel dissolved in hydro-chloric acid of
sp. gr. = 1.104, deposited on the vault of the retort, soon
after the acid began to act upon the iron, a dark ring of car
bonaceous matter twice the diameter of the space occupied
by the steel filings at the bottom of the retort. The inside of
this ring was gradually filled up by the black residuum,
whilst at the same time it collected in rays around the filings
at the bottom of the retort, which filings in the same ratio
disappeared, till the space formerly occupied by them was
filled up entirely by the black powder, gradually increasing
towards the centre, each grain of this black powder retaining
the form of the particle of steel filing from which it had                                               its

    hydrochloric acid.        The acid did not attack the crystal until
    heat       was applied, and then quickly formed around the crystal
    a     framework of white tough silica, apparently consisting of
    leaves or parallel threads, corresponding to the sides of the
    nucleus, which after having been separated from the silica
    with a fine needle, was finally converted entirely into a spot
    of silica.
          By repeatedly treating one of the large graphite layers or
    laminae with boiling hot hydrochloric acid and alkalies, it                                in
    creased in blackness and brilliancy; the single leaves ap
    peared thinner, their mutual connection was loosened, and
     the magnet had no further action on them.
          With the exception of hydrofluoric acid no single chemical
    liquid seemed to have any action on those scales, and only the
     most concentrated hydrofluoric acid slowly attacked them,
     when in a state of most minute division.
         After several fruitless efforts,                  I
                                                   finally discovered a new
     method of        decomposing    them  by  means of acids, which gave
     rise to new and interesting phaenomena.
          I  poured about three fluid-drachms of concentrated sul
     phuric acid over two grains of these purified graphite scales
     in a deep platinum crucible, and made the acid boil briskly
     over a spirit lamp. After this, I removed the crucible from
     the fire, till the dense fumes which arose began somewhat to
     cease.        I then drew up about one fluid-drachm of strong
     fuming nitric acid into a long small glass tube, and dropped
     one half of the acid rather slowly, the other half quickly, into
      the hot sulphuric acid, which caused the latter to boil again,
     during a rapid evolution of binoxide of nitrogen. As soon as
      the boiling began to cease, I placed the crucible again over
      the lamp, and boiled the liquid till                           all
                                                          the nitric acid was
      decomposed.           found the scales

                                            those scales was converted into

    face of the uterus; some of which accompanied the vein, and others
.   appeared to be inserted into the peritoneum.      A broad band, re
    sembling a plexus of nerves, was seen extending across the posterior
    surface of the uterus, and covering the nerve about midway from
    the fundus to the cervix. On the left side, a large plexus of nerves
    was seen, surrounding the uterine veins at the place where they were
    about to enter the hypogastric vein. From this plexus three large
    trunks of nerves were seen accompanying the uterine vein, which
    increased in size as they ascended to the fundus uteri.         From the
    nerve situated on the posterior surface of the vein, numerous fila
    ments passed off towards the mesial line, as on the right side; some
    following the smaller veins on the posterior surface of the uterus,
    and others becoming intimately adherent to the peritoneum. The
    largest of the nerves which accompanied the uterine vein was traced
    as high as the part where the Fallopian tube enters the uterus; and
    there it divided into numerous filaments, which plunged deep into
º   the muscular coat of the uterus along with the vein. A large fasci
     culated band, like a plexus of nerves, was also seen on the left side
     under the peritoneum, crossing the body of the uterus; and several
     branches, apparently nervous, proceeding from this band, were
     distinctly continuous with some of the smaller branches of nerves
     accompanying the uterine veins. The preparation of the parts was
     placed in the Museum of St. George's Hospital, on the 1st of Octo
     ber, 1838; and several anatomists who examined it were of opinion
     that they were absorbents accompanying the uterine veins, and ten
     dinous fibres spread across the posterior surface.
          Dr. Lee availed himself of another opportunity which presented
     itself, on the 18th of December of the same year, of examining a
     gravid uterus in the sixth month of pregnancy, which had the
     spermatic, hypogastric and sacral nerves remaining connected with
     it; and during the last ten months, he has been diligently occupied
     in tracing the nerves of this uterus. He believes that he has ascer
     tained that the principal trunks of the hypogastric nerves accompany,
     not the arteries of the uterus, as          all
                                                anatomists have represented,
     but the veins; that these nerves become greatly enlarged during

      form the right and left hypogastric plexuses.      These plexuses, after

  us, about two inches below the aortic plexus, sends off a large
  branch, which passes on the inside of the ureter to the superior
  uterine vein, where it is about to terminate in the hypogastric vein.
  Here the nerve suddenly expands, becomes broad and thin, and
  passes into a great plexus of nerves, which completely encircles the
  vein.    This plexus, surrounding the uterine vein, is joined below by
  two   large   branches, which proceed from the hypogastric plexus
  nearer the    vagina,  and lower down, and from which branches pass
  on the outside of the ureter.        From the upper part of this plexus,

in  the form      of  thin web,
                        a            the point where the spermatic vein

nerves, this band proceeds outwards             the round ligament, becoming

    The spermatic nerves                on

   On the right side of the uterus, the author finds that the distribu

differ from that now described as seen on the left side. The form and
situation of the right posterior band                       is,   he
                                            states, much more clearly

effect which Dr. Faraday has shown can               easily produced, even       be
with   a single series. He then refers            the experiments        Mr.to                            of
Children, Sir Humphry Davy, and Professor Daniell, recorded                                                         in
the Philosophical Transactions;       which experiments, when more

  In  order    ascertain, not only the fact

            the Voltaic  Spark before the circuit is completed.     595
Electrometer, and by which an appreciable space of one five-thou
sandth of an inch could be measured with great accuracy. He de
scribes this instrument; and relates several experiments which he
made with a view to test the correctness of its action. He first
prepared 160, and then 320 series of the constant battery, in half
pint porcelain cells, excited with solutions of sulphate of copper and
muriate of soda; but although the effects, after the contact had
been completed, were exceedingly brilliant, not the slightest spark
could be obtained. He was equally unsuccessful with a water bat
tery of 150 series, each series being placed in a quart glass vessel;
and also with a water battery belonging to Professor Daniell, con
sisting of 1020 series; but when a Leyden battery of nine jars was
introduced into the circuit of the latter, sparks passed to the extent,
in one instance, of six five-thousandths of an inch.
      The author mentions his having been present at the experiment
 of Professor Daniell, on the 16th of February, 1839, when that gen
 tleman had 70 series of his large constant battery in action; and
 having been witness of the powerful effects obtained by this appa
 ratus, he was induced to prepare 100 series of precisely the same
 dimensions, and similarly excited: but although this powerful appa
 ratus was used under every advantage, and the other effects pro
 duced were in every respect in accordance with the extent of the
 elements employed, still no spark could be obtained until the circuit
 was completed; even a single fold of a silk handkerchief, or a piece
 of dry tissue paper, was sufficient to insulate the power of a battery,
 which, after the circuit had been once completed, fused titanium,
 and heated 16 feet 4 inches of No. 20 platinum wire.
      The author then describes a series of experiments made with in
 duced currents. Twelve hundred and twenty iron wires, each insu
 lated by resin, were bent into the form of a horse-shoe. A primary
  wire of 115 feet and a secondary of 2268 feet, were wound round
  the iron wires. With this arrangement he obtained a direct spark
  (through the secondary current), sufficient to pierce paper, to charge
  a Leyden jar, &c. Several forms of apparatus employed by the
  author are next described, and also a series of 10,000 of Zamboni's
  piles.    With this arrangement he charged a Leyden battery to a
  considerable degree of intensity, and obtained direct sparks of three
  fiftieths of an inch in length. He ultimately succeeded in obtaining
  chemical decompositions of a solution of iodide of potassium,
  the iodine appearing at the end composed of the black oxide of
  manganese.
      The Society then adjourned over the Christmas Vacation, to
  meet again on the 9th of January, 1840.
      Jan. 9, 1840.-A paper was read, entitled, “On the construction
  and use of Single Achromatic Eye-Pieces, and their superiority to
  the double eye-piece of Huyghens." By the Rev.          J.  B. Reade,
  M.A., F.R.S.
      The author observes, that experience has shown it to be impracti
  cable to make a telescope even approach to achromatism, by employ
  ing the same object-glass with an astronomical, as with a terrestrial
  eye-piece: for if the focus of the blue rays from the object-glass be

thrown forwards, as it must be in order to make it impinge upon
the focus of the blue rays of the terrestrial eye-glass, then there will
be produced a great over-correction for the astronomical eye-glass;
and vice versa.     Hence it appears that the application of Huyghen
ian  eye-pieces   to refracting telescopes, is incompatible with the
conditions of achromatism, throughout the entire range of magni
fying power; and that in reflecting telescopes they unavoidably in
troduce dispersion, because they are not in themselves achromatic.
These defects the author proposes wholly to obviate, by substituting
for the Huyghenian eye-pieces, single achromatic lenses of corre
sponding magnifying power; consisting of the well-known combina
tion of the crown-lens, and        correcting flint-lens, having their ad
                                                its
jacent surfaces cemented together; thus avoiding internal reflections,
 and enabling them      act    tosingle lens. The achromatic eye-pieces

By Major Sabine, R.A., V.P.R.S., in a letter to Baron von Hum

   These letters relate to communications which Professor Lloyd
and Major Sabine have had, conformably to a resolution of the
Council of the Royal Society, with the scientific authorities at Göt
tingen, Berlin, and St. Petersburg, respecting the organization of a
simultaneous system of magnetical observations.           It appears, from
these letters, that the system proposed by the Royal Society is
viewed with general interest and approbation ; and nineteen stations
are enumerated at which there is reason to expect that magnetical
observatories, acting in concert, on that system, will be established.
    Jan. 23.-A paper was read, entitled “On the structure of Nor
mal and Adventitious Bone.”           By Alfred Smee, Esq., communi
cated by P. M. Roget, M.D. Sec. R.S.
    On examining, by means of a microscope, very thin sections of
bone, prepared in a peculiar manner, the author observed a number
of small, irregularly-shaped, oblong corpuscles, arranged in circular
layers round the canals of Havers, and also rows of similar bodies
distributed around both the external and the internal margins of the
bone.      Each corpuscle is connected by numerous filaments, passing
in      all
        directions,  with the Haversian canals and the margins            the     of
bone, and also with the adjacent corpuscles.         He finds that the ca
nals      Havers are vascular tubes containing blood.
          of                                                 The corpuscles
themselves are     hollow,  and their cavities  occasionally  communicate
with those       the canals; their length

ters, with reference to a system of notation in the mathematical
consideration of life contingencies, the author enters at length into
an exposition of the system of symbols which he has himself de

of cases.
   Jan. 30.—A paper was read, entitled “Observations on Single
Vision with two Eyes.” By T. Wharton Jones, Esq. Communi
cated by Richard Owen, Esq., F.R.S.
   The author animadverts on the doctrine which Mr. Wheatstone,
in his paper on the Physiology of Binocular vision, published in the
Philosophical Transactions for 1838, p. 371*, has advanced, in oppo
sition to the received theory of single vision being dependent on the
images of objects falling on corresponding points of the two retinae.
He maintains that, under these circumstances, the two impressions
are not perceived by the mind at the same instant of time, but some
times the one and sometimes the other.     If one impression be much
stronger than the other, the former predominates over, or even ex
cludes the other; but still the appearance resulting from the predo
minating image is nevertheless in some manner influenced by that
which is not perceived. He supposes that there are compartments
of the two retinae, having certain limits, of which any one point or
papilla of the one corresponds with any one point of the other, so
that impressions on them are not perceived separately; and consi
ders that this hypothesis, combined with the principle above stated,
is required, in order to explain the phenomena in question.
