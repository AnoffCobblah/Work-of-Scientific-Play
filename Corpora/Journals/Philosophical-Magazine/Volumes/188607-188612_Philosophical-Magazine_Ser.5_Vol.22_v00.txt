I. On the Variations of Gravity at certain Stations of the
    Indian Arc of the Meridian in Relation to their Bearing
    upon the Constitution of the Earth’s Crust.             By Rev. 0.
    FISHER, MA, E G.S.*
 IT is well known that, during the geodetic operations
         for the measurement of the Indian arc of the Meridian,
 it was found that the attraction of the Himalayas upon the
 plumb-line was less than it ought to have been, according to
 what Archdeacon Pratt calculated that their mass should have
 produced.       This was attributed by Sir G. B. Airy to a
 downward protuberance of rock, having the same density as
 the mountains, into a substratum of greater density, so that
 their position would be approximatel one of hydrostatic
 equilibrium; and he showed that suc an arrangement, by
  which their weight would be sustained, would have the effect
  upon the plumb-line of the kind, which had to be accounted
  for, greatly reducing the attraction of the mountains upon
  the plumb-line at a distant station, but much less so at a station
  near them ‘I'.
     Pratt himself, however, preferred to attribute the anomaly
  to a supposed de<U+FB01>cient contraction of the crust of the Earth
  beneath the mountains during the secular cooling of the
  globe, causing their relative elevation; and to this he attributed
  the diminution of density. He retained the average density

   of the crust for the mountains themselves, and supposed an
   attenuation equal to their mass to affect the crust for a depth
   of 50 miles beneath them *.
      Geologists, however, would hardly, be satis<U+FB01>ed with this
   explanation. For, although- there are some areas which
   appear to have been vertically lifted within comparatively
   recent times, such as notably the Colorado Plateau, neverthe
   less the usual type of an elevated region is that of rocks
   which have been heaped together by. lateral pressure, so that
   the material of which the mountains consist has been pushed
   horizontally towards the range over the nucleus ; and this is
 ' the case with the Himalayas. I have shown, in my ‘ Physics
   of the Earth’s Crust,’ that, it‘ the substratum is plastic, this
   process would involve the production of the kind of downward
   protuberance that Airy postulates, and would explain the
   existence of a de<U+FB01>ciency of' the attraction towards the moun
   tain-range. Accordingly, in the whole of my reasoning upon
   the subject, needing some working hypothesis, I have assumed
   that the crust is of the mean density of granitic rocks, viz.
   2'68; and the substratum of the density of basic rocks, viz.
   2'96. But I did not, in my book, make any quantitative
   estimate respecting the probable result of my assumptions
   upon the variation of gravity.
     ‘My attention was again drawn to this question by reading
   the instructive lecture delivered by General Walker, the
   Superintendent of the Tri onometrical Survey of India, at
   the meeting of the British ssociation at Aberdeen in 1885 T.
   This led me to look into the description of the pendulum ex
   periments referred to in that lecture, which are ublished in
   vol. v. of the ‘ Account of the Operations of the         reat Trigo
   nometrical Survey of India’li. If I understand the matter
, rightly, what was done was in principle this :——At certain
   stations of the Survey, of which the height and position had
   been already determined, the mean number of swings, called
   the “ vibration-number,” was observed, which were made by
   two pendulums in twenty-four hours which at the equator
   would have made about 86,000§ vibrations in the same in
   terval. (It will be remembered that the number of seconds
   in twenty-four hours is 86,400.) In this manner the force of
   gravity at each station could be compared. The effect of
   local attraction at the station was then estimated, as well as
     it ‘Figure ofv the Earth,’ 4th ed. p . 201 and 208.

 that of the height ;: and when these together had been allowed
 for, the corrected vibration-number so determined was re
   arded as the vibration-number for that station reduced to
 t e sea-level. Harf these disturbing circumstances been cor
 rectly estimated, and' had no others of a hidden kind existed,
 this vibration-number ought to have tallied. exactly with that
 belonging to the latitude of the station. It turned out, how
ever, that they were usually different, and‘ for the most part
in defect, often to a considerable extent. “ There appears to
be no escape from the conclusiom that there is- at more or less
marked negative variation of gravity over'the whole of the
Indian continent, and that the magnitude of this variation
is somehow connected with thee height. Let us group the
stations as follows, omitting Ismailia and Kew as foreign.”

   The method followed by Col. Herschel in estimating local
attraction was to employ the formula for the attraction of a
circular spherical cap, bein           “the part of a spherical shell
bounded by a right cone, w ose vertex is the centre of the
sphere.   Two such cones on a common axis intercept between
them a zone, which is clearly the difference between two caps
havin a common axis.’’* The proper altitude of sections, every
one 0%a set of such zones, taken around the station as their
centre, each of appropriate width for its distance, was estimated,
and also for the last zone the distance at which attraction would
cease to be appreciable. The density of the masses was taken
at 2'75, being half the mean density of the Earth.                It is
obvious that such an estimate would stop at the sea-level, and
take no account of variations of density below it ; nor yet does
it seem that the rise of the sea-level, which under the su posed
conditions would be considerable, was allowed for. The for
mulae used are essentially the same as those given by Pratt
                             * Op. cit. p. [151].

           relation to the Constitution of the Earth’s Crust.      5
in the fourth edition of his ‘ Figure of the Earth,’ to which
work Col. Herschel acknowledges himself indebted *.
    I propose, in what follows, to compare the vibration-num
bers at some of the meridian stations of the great Indian are
uncorrected for local attraction, but simply reduced to the
sea-level 1-, with what they ought to be there did no elevated
tract exist ; and the result will show how much local attrac
tion need be called upon to account for.           Then, if a given
hypothesis respecting the constitution of the Earth’s crust
fairly meets the requirements in several instances, it will
afford a fairly strong presumption that the hypothesis has a
foundation in reality.
    It will be convenient to refer other stations to Punnae as a
base. It is situated near Cape Comorin, at the southern ex
tremity of the peninsula, in latitude 8° 9’ 28” N.         But since
Punnae is 48 feet above the sea, it will be better to make the
r<1elcluction, small though it be, to the sea-leVel there, once for
a .
   We shall employ the following symbols in the calculations,
the numerical values being taken from the ‘ Account of the
Pendulum Operations ’ already referred to.
          c=the radius of the earth: 20,926,000 feet = 3963
                miles.
          6 = the elipticity, = 0' 0034483.
        m=rati0 of centrifugal force to gravity at the equator,
                 =O'OO34674.
         h=height of the station.
          l=latitude of the station.
         l’ =latitude of Punnae.
       N=number of vibrations at Punnee in twenty-four hours
                when reduced to the sea-level.
N + 3N =the observed number at another station.
        g=the Earth’s attractive force at the equator.
        G='the force of gravity at the station.
      sG=the change in G corresponding to one vibration,
                where s=0'0000023148.
         lc=the thickness of the cooled crust, taken as 25 miles.
         p=the density of the crust, mountain, and its root,
                taken as 2'68.
        a=the density of the substratum, taken as 2'96.
         h=the height of the station.
         u=the chord of the semiarc of the spherical cap.
          t=the depth of the root below the bottom of the crust.
        w = the chord of the semiarc of the root of the mountain.

     The formula for the time of vibration of a pendulum,
  t: r \/1%, enables us to connect N and G ; and it is shown
  at p. [123] that, “as rggards reduction for height of station,
  the formula 8N=§N @ is suf<U+FB01>ciently exact;” N being in it
  taken as 86400.
      Hence it appears that, taking 8N as one vibration, the
   change in G corresponding to one vibration is
                           G
                        W — G x 0 000023148,
                                 =aG (suppose).
      The reduction of gravity for the height of the station may
  be taken as 9 27h, because the part of the reduction for height
   which would depend upon latitude is inappreciable.
      Hence the correction for the reduction of gravity to the
   sea-level at Punnae for 48 feet is
                              G x 0‘0000045875.
   And the correction to be added to the vibration-number, by
   the formula for 8N, Will be
                                    019818.
      The observed vibration-number at Punnee being 85982'75,
   we may say that at the sea-level at Punnae,
                                N = 85982'95.
      As an instance of the mode of making such a comparison as
   is proposed, let us take the case of Moré, the most northern
   station visited *, being also the most elevated (15,408 feet).
    Moré is about 150 miles, by the map 1', distant from the sub
    Himalayan plains to the south-west of it, and about the same

                    — difference for height,
                    + difference for local attraction.

and of
                            Moré    =33° 15’ 39”.
   The correction to gravity for difference of latitude then
comes out
                        =g x 0'0014589.
   Also correction for height
                        = —g x 0-0014726.
                        = —_g
   Hence di<U+FB02>'erence of gravity (3G) between Moré and Punnee
at sea-level ought to have been
                         9 x 0-0000137.
   Dividing this by g X0'0000023148, which corresponds to
one swing, it appears that there ought to have been 0'59
swing less at More, irrespective of local attraction, than at
Punnze.
  Now the observed vibration-number at Moré was . 85984'62
  And at Punnae, when reduced to sea-level .... .. 85982'95
                        Actual difference, 8N .... .. = + 1'67
So that there were in fact 1'67 swings more; whereas the
difference, irrespective of local attraction, ought to have been
 —O'5.
   The result is that local attraction at Moré station needs
to account for 2'26 swings in twenty-four hours.
   Reducing this to attraction measure, we may accept as a
fact that
          Local attraction at Moré=g X 0'000052386,
where g is the attraction of the sphere.

        Relation to the Constitution of the Earth’s Crust.       9
    The <U+FB01>rst six columns of the foregoing table involve no
hypothesis beyond that the curve, which represents the Indian
meridian, does not sensibly depart from that which best repre
sents the Earth as a whole, which Colonel Clarke considers
may be assumed*; and that the sea-level is not affected by
local attraction. The <U+FB01>fth column is consequently the simple
statement of the fact that local attraction at each station must
be such as to account for so many swings of the pendulum
   er diem relative to the number at Punnse reduced to sea
 evel, and must bear the ratio to the attraction of the sphere
which is expressed in the sixth column. The seventh and
 eighth columns, deduced from the account of the pendulum
 operations‘l', involve the further suppositions that the forms
 and positions of the attracting masses above the sea-level have
 been correctly estimated relative to the station, and that their .
 density is half the mean density of the earth, the sea-level
 being supposed not to be disturbed by attraction. It will
 therefore appear that, although giving further information,
 they contain more elements of uncertainty than affect the
 numbers in the former columns. The numbers in the seventh
 column have been obtained from a tabular statement in the
 ‘Account, &c."|' by subtracting the vibration-numbers in the
 column headed “Reduced height and mass ” from those in
 the column headed “The reduced height only.” It appears
 that this ought to give the effect at the station in vibration
 numbers of the attraction of the masses elevated above the
 sea-level.
     When we compare these numbers with those in column 5,
 it is seen at a glance how much smaller local attraction
  actually is than it might be expected to be. It is no doubt
 true that if allowance has to be made for a rise in the sea
 level, it would make the heights of the masses above the
  mean level greater, and consequently diminish the numbers
  in column 4, and increase those in 5 and 6; but at the
  same time it would increase the masses referred to in column
  7 ; so that the excess of the numbers in that column over those
  in column 5 would not be thereby explained. But, what is
  still more remarkable, is that local attraction is in some
  instances actually negative, where from the size and distri
  bution of the masses it might be expected to be large and
  positive, as shown in column 7. This is notably the case,
  especially at Dehra, and to a less extent at Nojli ; while at
  More, the most elevated station (15,408 feet), it is reduced from
  the amount which ought to be equivalent to cause 23'57 addi

            Lotus now revert to the hypothesis of elevated masses of
        the Earth,produced by lateral compression, being accompanied
       ‘by downward protuberances projecting into a denser sub
       :stratum, and supported in a position of hydrostatic equilibrium;
   ‘3   and let us inquire how the variation of gravity at the surface
        would be affected by such an arrangement of the masses. I
       call the downward protuberances the “roots ” of the moun
        tains. In my ‘ Physics of the Earth’s Crust,’ I have assumed
        the density of the mountain, of the crust, and of the root to
        be the same throughout ; for since the density of more basic
       eruptive rocks is not much greater than that of acid rocks,
       there is no great mar in left for supposing a gradation. It
       may be objected that Sm root Could not remain protuberant,
       but would be melted off owing to the high temperature of the
        substratum. A probable answer to this is, that the root con
       'Sisting of acid rocks is less fusible than the basic rocks of the
       substratum. Another is, that there has not been time; and
       this reason has more to be said in favour of it than appears at
       <U+FB01>rst sight, because we know that the upper mountain, although
       continuously degraded by atmospheric causes, is not at present
       levelled down. There may therefore equally well not have
       been time for the much larger root to have been melted of.
           Professor Darwin has proved that the material of which
       the Earth is composed must be exceptionally rigid to support
       mountains, if (as I understand him) they are supported by
       rigidity alone. And since, with suf<U+FB01>cient time given, every
       known substance yields more or less freely to stress, this is of
       itself an argument in favour of the hydrostatic theory. It is
      not necessary for the purpose that the substratum should be
      what would be called <U+FB02>uid ; although I myself believe that it
      is so.
          In discussing the effect upon the local variation of ravity
      arising from the supposed constitution of the cr_ust, t e <U+FB01>rst
      question which presents itself is, to what extent the sea-level
      will be affected.    Pratt has an article (200) upon this; but
      the following proof is suggested.
          Suppose generally that there is a mass, whose volume is M
      and density p, situated exterior to the Earth, and a mass, whose
      volume is R and density it, within the Earth; and suppose
      that R is enveloped by the stratum whose density is 0-.

    We will <U+FB01>rst consider the conditions of hydrostatic equili
brium in the case of a spherical cap as already de<U+FB01>ned, such as
has been made the basis of the calculations of Archdeacon Pratt
and of Colonel Herschel, making the additional hypothesis re
 specting the support of the mountain which has been proposed.
The elevated mass will therefore be considered as of the form of a
 spherical cap, having its root also of that form. We will for the
present consider the root as contained within the same verticals
as the mountain ; that is, they are both frustra of thesame cone,
whose vertex is the centre of the earth. The conditions of
equilibrium obtain for the cone. This supposition ignores
 the rigidity of the crust, which may appear a violent assump
tion to those who are not geologists. It is now, however,
 generally admitted that the materials of the earth’s crust have
yielded very freely to the stresses which have affected them ;
and that the phenomena of schistosity, cleavage, contortion,
 and of other kinds of metamorphism, are evidences of this
 fact. In short, the materials are of the nature of more rigid
 portions imbedded in less rigid media, the shapes and magni
 tude of the more rigid, and the ductility of the less rigid
 varying both absolutely and relatively in every possible
 degree. Thus all rocks appear to be more less of a viscous
 nature; that is to say, when subjected to stress for a suf<U+FB01>
 ciently long period, they become sensibly strained out of their
 original forms and relative positions. And under these cir
 cumstances chemical reactions are also set up. It will appear
 in the sequel that rigidity does play some part in the equili
 brium of the crust; but it may be for the present supposed
 that the conditions of equilibrium are satis<U+FB01>ed throughout

  extreme distances of the upper and lower edges of the root,
  multiplied by the relative density thereof, diminished by the
  difference of the distances of the upper and lower extreme
  edges of the visible mass, multiplied by its density. But
  when the distances are great, the thickness of the visible
  mass being small compared with that of the root, the
  attraction may be regarded as practically proportional to the
  difference of the distances of the upper and lower edges of
  the root. It follows that the attraction is less the longer the
  sector, and becomes insensible when that is very long.

   To illustrate how much increasing the distance of the station
from the edge of the plateau diminishes the attraction, it may
be mentioned that the former of the above integrals gives, for
a= 80,
               The logarithmic term = —11‘274,
               The two circular terms: + 24651 ;

               The logarithmic term = —2'888,
               The two circular terms: + 5'807. -
In like manner the latter integral gives, for a=80,
                The logarithmic term: +0‘0519,
                The circular term         = —0‘1061 ;
whereas for a=b=400 these are respectively
                   +0'00798 and —O'0185.
   As another instance of the effect of form and extension, it
will be found that a circular plateau of the above height and
of 80 miles radius (and therefore of in<U+FB01>nitely smaller area
than the parallelepiped) will, with its root, produce an attrac
tion corresponding to about 11 swings per diem.
   Archdeacon Pratt, in “ a postscript on Himalayan attrac
tion,” in the Phil. Trans. 1859, p. 774, gives the rough dia
gram of the plateau here reproduced, referring to a work on
the physical geography of the Himalayas by Major R. Strachey,
adding :——“ On a careful consideration of all the data, Captain
H. Strachey estimates the mean elevation of the tableland
between the Himalayan and Turkish watersheds, and to the
 west of the ridge between the sources of the Indus and
Brahmaputra, to be 15,000 feet (p. 56) ”*. This is the
height of the station More.
    As far as I can judge by comparing the map in the
 ‘Account ’ &c., the only one in which the locality is marked,
 with the relief-map by Major G. Strahan, and with Pratt’s
 diagram, it appears that Moré is distant about 80 miles from
 the nearly straight south-western escarpment of the range
 facing the plains, and 400 miles from the escarpment facing
 the north-west. If we imagine a series of cap-sectors drawn
 about the station, it will appear that the hypothesis of the
 parallelepiped makes the sectors on the north side too short
near the cross section, and on the south side too long, while
parallel to the range they are necessarily too long. This
would make the attraction at the station too small. On the
other hand, the actual plateau rises from the plains which are
                         ~ L00. cit. p. 776.

        Further, the slope of the range ought to have been taken into
        account. Thus a close agreement is not to be expected.
        However, referring to the <U+FB01>fth column of the Table, it appears
        that local attraction at Moré relative to Punnae ought to produce
        2'2 6 swings per diem ; whereas the attraction of our parallele
        piped at a station situate as supposed would produce 4'15, or
        nearly two swings more. The visible masses were estimated
        as being capable of producing 23'57 swings. Hence the
        hypothesis of the parallelepiped, hydrostatically supported,
        accounts for 1942 out of the 2131 swings in defect which

         relation to the Constitution of the Earth’s Crust.     21
have to be accounted for.      So that the theory of hydrostatic
equilibrium in this instance may be considered a not unsatisJ
factory explanation of the phenomena.
   To understand what has been done, we observe that the
calculated effect of the local attraction of the parallelepiped is
absolute, not relative, supposing that there would be no local
attraction at the mean sea-level of a continental land-surface.
It ought therefore to be compared with an absolute quantity.
The 23'57 swings, given in column 7 of our Table, being the
difference between the effect due to height and mass at Moré
and that due to height alone, is also absolute. If, therefore,
we take-the parallelepiped to roughly represent the plateau,
23'57—4'15=19'4'2 is the absolute difference between the
effect of the plateau considered as supported by an excessively
rigid crust and by hydrostatic equilibrium. Thus far observed
vibration-numbers are not involved.
   When we consider these, we see that there were 1'67 more
swings at Moré than at Punnae. But without knowing what
the effect of local attraction is at Punnae, we can have no exact
knowledge of that which exists at More. If the number of
swings of a given pendulum at the equator at the surface of the
sea (but not subjected to the local attraction of an insular mass)
was known, knowing the number at Punnae, we could deduce
the absolute attraction there, and consequently at More also.
Here, however, we are at fault.
    Colonel Herschel has treated this question very fully in the
second Appendix to the ‘Account, &c.,’ explaining that he
has adopted a novel method ; for, whereas local variations of
gravity had previously been treated by the method of least
squares, as if they were errors of observation, he has regarded
them as having a real existence; and has obtained his equa
 tions for <U+FB01>nding the vibration-number of a given pendulum
at the equator from the numbers observed at known stations,
 on the two suppositions (1) that the mean of all observed
 local variations should be zero, and (2) that the mean of those
 in one narrow zone of north latitude should be equal to the
 mean of those in the corresponding zone of south latitude.
    But, seeing that the local variations are calculated subject
 to the attraction of the masses, and that the masses give very
 different attractions according as they are treated as if sup
 ported by excessive rigidity of the crust, or by hydrostatic
 equilibrium, it appears that the resulting equatorial mean
 vibration-number obtained on the one supposition is not likely
 to agree with that obtained upon the other.
    Colonel Herschel (Appendices, p. 45) makes local attraction
at Punnae: —4'2 swings. But if, by way of illustration, the

22    Rev. 0. Fisher on Variationsof Gravity and their
hypothesis of hydrostatic equilibrium should turn out to so
alter the equatorial vibration-number as to make it instead
= + 1'89, then the absolute local attraction at Moré would be.
189+ 2'26=4'15, the same as that of our parallelepiped hy
drostatically supported. This is merely by way of illustration,
because the parallelepiped only roughly represents the plateau;
but it shows that the hypothesis may probably be competent
to explain the phenomena.
   If u is larger than h+k+t, the expression, whose integral
is given at p. 18, may be put under the approximate form
                        hj<U+FB02> + h + t(1“
                            2a sec on
But since a is in the present case but little the larger, I have
thought it best to calculate the attraction from the fuller
formula. It seems, however, that the approximate formula
would have given a result suf<U+FB01>ciently exact ; for if we put a
successively equal to 80 and 400 miles, using the above ap
proximate formula, we get the result 4'51 swings, whereas
the fuller formula gives 4'15. These two numbers are suf<U+FB01>
ciently near for our purpose.
   Relying upon this, we can estimate the local vertical
attraction at Kaliana.
   The attraction of a cap-sector upon a point beneath it,
estimated downwards, is
                  —-p8a(u+h— Vu2+li—%L>;

    Now it appears from Major George Strahan’s Relief-map
 of India that the Himalayan plateau presents a nearly straight
 escarpment towards Kaliana, this straight face subtending an
 angle of about 120° at that station, so that radii drawn beyond
 this will not enter the plateau on the western, and at a long
 distance only on the eastern side.

     Suppose, then, a series of cap-sectors, each of axial angle
 5a, but of different radii, respectively long enough to reach the
 further edge of the plateau; and let a triangular block be
 cut off from these by a vertical plane through the crest of the
 escarpment. The vertical attraction of the mass beyond the
 vertical plane at the station will be that of the aggregate of
 the sectors, minus that of the triangular block. There will
 remain the attraction of the slope of the plateau to be added.

   If we'substitute the values indicated above, and introduce
the factor élws, to express the effect in swings, the former
of the above terms gives —2'73 swings in defect, due to the
attraction of the plateau and other masses. The second
 term is not easily estimated, on account of the irregular out
line of the further_ boundary of the plateau ; but it will cer
tainly be quite small, but being positive will make the negative
effect less. Now there were observed relative to Punnae
 —2'28 swings in defect due to local causes at Kaliana.
    The estimate —2'73, having been obtained on the suppo
 sition that the slope of the plateau is a solid inclined plane,
 will be lessened by the circumstance that it is much inter
 sected by valleys ; and this will be equivalent to assigning a
 lower mean value to the density p. Thus, on the whole, we
 may conclude that the calculated effect of local attraction at
 Kaliana brings the negative variation of gravity very close to
 the observed variation relative to Punnae.
    The above number has (as was also done in the case of
 More) been estimated on the suppositions that the ellipticity
 is correctly assumed, and that there would be no local attrac
 tion at the mean surface of the crust k considered as a land
 surface. Could we suppose Punnae to be in such a situation,
 the above comparison would be exact. But since it is on the
 sea-coast, there is probably some local attraction there.
    In all but six instances the local attractions, given in the
 "Account &c.’ as due to the visible masses, have been esti
 mated as if they were caused by an in<U+FB01>nite plain of the height
 of the station. The exceptions are Somtana, Ahmadpur,
 Usira, Debra, Mussoorie, and More, at which places allowance
 has been made for inequality of surface. It might be thought
 that we need not have estimated the attractions afresh, as has
                         * See pages 6 and 16

26        Rev. 0. Fisher 0n Variations of Gravity and their
been done roughly for Moré and Kaliana, because they have
been already‘calculated and published. But it will be observed
that the attraction of the “roots ” of the masses cannot be
discovered from that of the masses themselves, except in the
case of plains.
    At the two former of the “ very irregularl surrounded
stations,” Dehra, Mussoorie, and Moré, we s ll make no
attempt to calculate the attractions, and conclude with some
remarks upon certain stations in Peninsular India.
    There are no true mountain-ranges in Peninsular India, the
so-called “ mountains ” being only the escarpments of plateaus
which have escaped .denudation. “ Peninsular India is, in
fact, a tableland, worn away by subaerial denudation, and
perhaps to a minor extent on its margins by the sea.’-’ * The
 Deccan traps are of Lower-Eocene age, covered in places by
nummulitic rocks‘l'. Their total thickness may be 6000 feeti.
 The horizontality of the <U+FB02>ows in these plateaus is remarkable.
 In considering the bearing of the gravitational phenomena at
stations in this part of India, we ought to take its structure into
account. No root has been formed by compression during
the formation of its hills. As the country became gradually
weighted by <U+FB02>ow upon flow of the basalts, the crust must
have sunk gradually into the magma. The Geological Survey
does not appear to have yet mastered the details ; but possibly
it will be found that the country is faulted, and consequently
deep roots will answer rather to low elevations than to high
ones, and the equilibrium will be of the tract as a whole,
instead of being established within every vertical boundary.
    In any case where the attraction of the mass above the sea
level may be justly taken as due to an in<U+FB01>nite plain ,it appears
by our formula that the negative attraction of the root would,
on the hypothesis of hydrostatic equilibrium being established
within every vertical boundary, exactly balance it; and the
resulting local attraction at the station ought to be nil.       Now
there are seven stations of the great arc between latitudes 16°
and 24° N. which are upon the basalt, viz. from Pahargarh to
Kodangal inclusive ; and the local attractions, relative'to the
attraction at sea-level at Punnw, in swings of the pendulum,
range for these stations, as shown in column 5, from —O'79

   These numbers will be uniformly increased or diminished
by any local attraction there may be at Punnaa, which is not
situated on an in<U+FB01>nite plain, but where proximity to the coast
places it under conditions different from those at the stations
which we are referring to it.
   To appreciate what these diiferences from zero attraction at
the stations imply, we observe that one vibration per diem due
to local attraction corresponds to about 645 feet of elevation
of a plain ; and therefore, since the root (supposed of density p)
displaces a layer of density a", onevibration in defect caused
by it will correspond to —p~ X645, or 6172 feet, i. e, to
11707 mile of root.           0—!)
    We see, then, that the root at Damargida, where the attrac
tion is —-O'79, would be about 0'92 mile too deep for local equi
librium; and at Kalianpur, where it is +1'75, it would be
 2046 miles too shallow—these estimates being of course subject
to the uncertainty belonging to local attraction at Punnae.
    If we assume the crust at Punnee to be 25 miles thick
(which I have shown in my ‘ Physics &c.’ to be probable for
places on the sea-coast), then, the depth for zero attraction of
the root at Daniargida being 3527 miles, the actual depth there
 would be 5'171 and the whole thickness of the crust 30 miles.
 At Kalianpur, the depth for zero attraction being 3'195 miles,
 the actual depth would be 1'149 and the whole thickness
 26 miles. These two instances are the greatest variations
 that occur'thronghout 8 degrees of latitude, and there are
 but two others of similar amount among the sixteen stations
 between Kaliana and Punnae.
    Although these varying local attractions at the several
 stations make it clear that this region is not in hydrostatic
 equilibrium everywhere locally, nevertheless, the relative
 attractions bein at some stations positive and at others
 negative, it is quite possible that it may be as a whole sup

ported in that manner, because we do not know how large
the areas may be which would show positive or negative rela
tive attraction under column 5. At any rate, the mean relative
to Punnm being only 0'42 swing, the result does not seem
to discredit the hypothesis that there is a distribution of matter
not far differing from what would accord with equilibrium for
the region as a whole. The attractions at these peninsular
stations give no information about the mean thickness of the
crust, assumed at 25 miles, because, in the case of an in<U+FB01>nite
plain, the terms involving it        are neglected.
   On the whole, it is apparent that the bottom of the crust is
here irregular, and does not locally correspond for equilibrium
with the surface-contour. In a basaltic region, as already
remarked, this would seem natural ; for there will have been
no compressing action tending to produce downward bulges
corresponding] to the elevated tracts, as would be the case in
a. mountain-c ain ; so that any downward projection into the
magma       e. root) will be due simply to the local depression
of the crust, owing to its having become overweighted at the
top, while rigidity of the crust, never crushed as in a mountain
chain, would extend the depression laterally and diminish it
vertically. It is possible that the considerable local thickenings
and thinnin gs of the crust, which appear to occur at a few places
in this region, may be due to faults of lar e throw, such as are
not unknown in countries where there ias been much out
pouring of basalts.
    The object of this paper has been (1) to summarize some of
the results obtained during the Indian pendulum operations, as
far as they bear upon the problem of the constitution of the
Earth’s crust; and (2) to inquire whether, in a few of the
instances where it seemed practicable to approach the subject
by way of average, the theory of hydrostatic equilibrium gives
a fair explanation of the phenomena. The cases that have been
thus examined show that the theory of hydrostatic equilibrium
makes, in swings of the pendulum,

   It is submitted that, considering the nature of the subject,
these results are fairly con<U+FB01>rmatory of the theory, and also of
the assumed values of the densities, and to a less extent of
that of the mean thickness of the crust at the sea-coast.
    Geological changes of level are closely connected with the
theory of hydrostatic equilibrium, as I have pointed out in
my ‘Physics of the Earth’s Crust,’ chap. xvii. When the
 effects of contour have been allowed for, we ought to <U+FB01>nd a
general negative variation of gravity insuch regions as are
 now disposed to rise, because that would indicate that the root
 is too deep for equilibrium. And for thelopposite reason,
 a positive variable ought to be met with where depression is
 in progress. Whether this relation holds has, I suppose, not
been noticed. Again, if the hypothesis is true, beneath plains
the increment of underground temperature ought to be more
 rapid where the variation of gravity is positive, and more
slow where it is negative.
    Postscript—Since the foregoing was sent to press, I have
 read M. Faye’s article, “ Sur la Constitution de la Croute
 Terrestre,” in Comptes Rendus for March 22, 1886. He
 there discusses pendulum-observations at island and conti
 nental stations, the latter with especial reference to the Indian
observations. Respecting the excess of gravity found at
island stations, he comes to a conclusion similar to that
arrived at by Pratt in reference to Minicoy (art. 74). With
regard to' continents, his views likewise agree generally with
 those advanced by Pratt; see in particular Pratt’s art. 192.
 It would occupy too much space to examine here the cause to
which M. Faye attributes the greater density of the suboceanic
crust.—O. F.
         II. On a Modi<U+FB01>cation of Wheatstone’s Rheostat.
                 By SHELFORD BIDWELL, MA.*
IT is frequently desirable that the resistance of a circuit
       through which a current of electricity is <U+FB02>owing should
be made to vary continuously and not by steps, as is necessarily
the case when resistance-coils are used alone. An instrument
for effecting this object was devised by Sir Charles Wheatstone
in 1843, and was called by him the Rheostat. Two forms of
the apparatus, both of which are well known, are described in
his paper on the “ Constants of the Voltaic Circuit,” originally
published in the Phil. Trans. and contained in the Physical
Society’s Reprint of Wheatstone’s Scienti<U+FB01>c Memoirs.
       * Communicated by the Physical Society : read May 8, 1886.

30            Mr. Shelford Bidwell on a Modi<U+FB01>cation
    In the <U+FB01>rst form two equal cylinders, one of wood and the
 other of brass, are mounted on parallel axes, and so arran ed
 that a <U+FB01>ne wire can be wound off the one and on to the ot er
 by turning a handle. On the wood cylinder a spiral groove is
 cut in which the wire lies, so that its successive convolutions
 are insulated from each other; but when any portion of the
 wire is wound upon the brass cylinder, the current passes
 immediately from the wire to the cylinder, and thence to one
of the terminals of the instrument.       The e<U+FB02>‘ective part of the
length of the wire is therefore the variable portion which is
on the wood cylinder.
   In the other form there is only one cylinder, which is of
wood, and has a quantity of stout wire permanently wound
upon it in a spiral groove out upon its surface. Near the
cylinder and parallel to its axis is a brass rod, upon which a
notched “rider,” or in more modern instruments a grooved
brass wheel, is capable of sliding.       The notch in the rider,
or the groove in the wheel, <U+FB01>ts and presses upon the spiral
wire, and when the c linder is turned the rider or wheel
moves longitudinally along the brass rod. The terminals of
the instrument are connected respectively with the brass rod
and with one end of the wire upon the cylinder ; and the
resistance introduced into the circuit depends upon the posi
tion of the point of contact of the rider or wheel with the wire.
   The apparatus in either form is open to serious practical
objections. In that <U+FB01>rst described it is dif<U+FB01>cult to maintain
good electrical contact between the wire and the brass cylinder,
  0th of which must be kept perfectly clean and free from dust
and dam . Moreover the wire is liable to become slack and
to leave its groove, and not unfrequently it breaks. In the
second form there is also a dif<U+FB01>culty in securing uniformly
good contact; and if the slider <U+FB01>ts the rod suf<U+FB01>ciently tight,
the lateral pressure upon the wire is so great that it becomes
permanently stretched, and is sometimes forced completely out
of its groove. - The wire, too, is necessarily thick; and the whole
apparatus must consequently be large and cumbersome if it is
to work through any considerable range of resistance.
   A \Vhcatstone’s rheostat in good working order is rarely
seen, even in the shop of the instrument maker ; and in point
of fact it is little used except for the purpose of lecture
illustration.
   In the course of some experimental work the pressing need
of some means of continuously varying a resistance led me to
devise the modi<U+FB01>ed rheostat, which is <U+FB01>gured in the annexed
woodcut.
   As in the second form of Wheatstone’s instrument, a wire

                       of Wheatstone’s Rheostat.                     31
is coiled in a spiral groove upon an insulating cylinder. This
is mounted upon the middle of a brass axle of rather more
than three times its length. Upon one of the projecting
ends of the axle a screw is cut, thepitch of which is equal to
              F
 the distance between the consecutive turns of the wire. The
 axle revolves in two brass bearings, <U+FB01>xed at a distance apart
 equal to twice the length of the cylinder ; one of the bearings
 has an inside screw corresponding with that upon the axle.
 A <U+FB02>at spring is attached at one end to the base-board of the
 instrument midway between the bearings; to the other end
  is riveted a short copper pin, which is directed perpen
  dicularly to the axis of the cylinder and bears upon the spiral
  wire, being kept in position by a shallow notch cut in its end.
  One end of the spiral wire is electrically connected with the
  brass axle, and thence through the screwed bearing and a
  strip of copper with a terminal upon the base-board. The
  spring is directly connected with a second terminal. When
  the cylinder is turned by means of a handle, it travels back
  wards or forwards in the direction of its axis, the point of con
  tact of the copper pin with the spiral wire remaining <U+FB01>xed in
  space ; thus more or less resistance is introduced between the
  axle and the spring, and therefore between the two terminals.
      In the model exhibited at the meeting of the Physical
   Society, the length of the cylinder is 3 cm., its diameter is 8
  cm., and the diameter of the wire, which is of German silver,
  is 0'5 mm. There are nine turns of wire per centimetre of
  length, and the greatest resistance is about 10 ohms.           Since
  the instrument is generally used in conjunction with a set' of
  coils, this resistance is for most purposes amply suf<U+FB01>cient;
  indeed I am inclined to think that it would be on the whole
  advantageous to use thicker wire and wind it in a coarser
  spiral, so that the total resistance might be slightly more than
  one ohm.     The rheostat would then be used merely as a <U+FB01>ne
  adjustment*.
     " The best form of cylinder would, I think, he a hollow brass drum
  covered with a tightly <U+FB01>tting tube of ebonite, 2 or 3 mm. in thickness.
  Wood, even when well seasoned, is liable to shrink, and is more or less

   The advantages which this apparatus appears to possess
over the usual forms are obvious. It is simple, compact,
easily made, and not easily put out of order. There is no
lateral stress, and in consequence of the rubbing action the
contact is always good. The de<U+FB02>ections of the needle of
a “dead-beat” galvanometer in circuit with it are under
perfect control, responding to the rotation of the cylinder
with smoothness and regularity, and there is complete free
dom from jerks and retrograde movements. It is not indeed
more suitable for use as ameasuring instrument than the older
forms; but when it is desired to adjust a resistance to a
nicety, or to cause a continuous variation of a current, it is of
great utility. If the interposed resistance is required to
be known with accuracy, it should be measured by the bridge
method in the ordinary way.
       III. Some Thermodg/namical Relations.—PART IV.
By WILLIAM RAMSAY, Ph.D., and SYDNEY YOUNG, D.Sc.*
 SINCE the <U+FB01>rst portions of this research were published
       Professors Ayrton and Perry have criticised our work,
and while we would thank them for the appreciative way in
which they speak of our labours, we must differ entirely from
their conclusion that “there is nothing further to be said
about the four laws in question.” This conclusion rests on a
complete misapprehension of the whole scope of our papers,
and for the obvious reason that, while we have endeavoured
by a method of what may be termed approximation to arrive
at a workable plan of deducing from the known vapour
pressures of a substance like water the unknown vapour
pressures of any other substance with as little expenditure of
experimental work as possible, and have in our research made
the statement, which is only a very rough approximation to
truth, that the ratios of the absolute temperatures of any two
liquids at any given pressure are equal to the ratios at any
other pressure, but have materially modi<U+FB01>ed this statement,
and asserted next, what is a very close approximation to truth,
that when the statement given does not hold (as in by far the
affected by moisture. The depth of the groove should be about half the
diameter of the wire. The wire should be annealed, and should be
wound on when it is warm.        The notch at the end of the cop er pin
may be very shallow, for if the position of the spring is properly a justed
the pin has little or no tendency to slip o<U+FB02> the wire.

majority of cases), the relation of the ratios is expressed by
the equation
                         R' = R + 0(t’ —t)
(where B.’ is the ratio of the absolute temperatures of any two
bodies at a given pressure ; R the‘ratio at another pressure ;
 t and t’ the temperatures of one of the two bodies corresponding
to those vapour-pressures; and c is a constant). Professors
 Ayrton and Perry have based all their reasoning on the <U+FB01>rst
 statement, which laid no claim to exactitude, and have in
 formed ns, what we already knew, that Dalton’s law gives
 better results. The data given in our previous papers, how—
ever, show how nearly our generalization agrees with fact.
    To refute the accusation of having performed useless labour
 would be really to repeat the substance of our previous pa ers;
 but the members of the Ph 'sical Society would hardly thank
us were we to do so. There are, however, two or three
 remarks made by our critics which call for special reply.
    1. It is suggested that our obvious course would have been
to employ Rankine’s formula, which, our critics state, is not
empirical, but based on Rankine’s molecular theory.           We
have been informed that the formula deduced by Rankine
from his molecular theory was found by him not to agree
with the experimental results; and that, in order to secure
agreement, an empirical term was added. We would ask if
this was not the case, and, if so, whether the whole formula is
not thereby rendered empirical?
    2. We are told that our labours might have been reduced
by 75 per cent. had we recognized the fact that our four laws
are identical. Now we do not anywhere state that our
“laws ” are absolute, in which case only would the identity
necessarily _hold ; but indeed give methods for calculating
their deviation from constancy. It is moreover desirable to
test the truth of such statements in every possible way, inas
much as different determinations by different observers are
thereby introduced.
    3. That it is by no means impossible to obtain with accu
racy the speci<U+FB01>c volumes of saturated vapour will appear from
memoirs on the thermal behaviour of ethyl alcohol and ether,
which are in the hands of the Royal Society; indeed such
measurements can be made at temperatures when a direct
determination of L would be extremely dif<U+FB01>cult, if not impos
sible.    To show the necessity of using determinations from
all sources, we may point out that if Regnault’s values of L
and of 2% for alcohol and for ether are employed, and the
    Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 22. N0. 134. July 1886.          D

   impossible values are obtained, unless it is supposed that
   chemical dissociation takes place, which is absurd.
      4. We are told that the equation numbered (6g1 (p. 371 of
   the ‘ Proceedings ’), t=mjr(p), is identical wit our four
   “ laws;” and that “if (6) is true, then it follows that the ratio

   testing (7) ; and as we <U+FB01>nd from Regnault and Rankine’s
   formula that (7) is untrue, there is nothing further to be said
\ about the four laws in question.” We hope that no one has,
   like Professors Ayrton and Perry, so misunderstood our
   papers as to suppose that we imagine that “the ratio of the
   temperatures of two vapours at any pressure is always the
   same as at any other pressure.” We do, indeed, notice that this
   statement holds with very close approximation for like bodies,
   such as chloro- and bromo-benzene; but the whole of the second
   and third parts of our memoir are devoted to an attempt,
  which we deem not unsuccessful, to give a method whereby
  the deviationfrom the above statement can be estimated.
      The didactic remarks so kindly directed to us at the begin
  ning of Messrs. Ayrton and Perry’s critique, lead us to suppose
  that the great importance of such problems in Chemistry is
  not so generally known as we had imagined ; and we would
  cordially agree that the cooperative principle may here with
  advantage be applied, and physicist and chemist mutually
  assist each other.
     The problem of dissociation has for long invited the atten
  tion of chemists. Many compounds decompose at a mode
  rately high temperature, and their constituents reunite when
  the temperature is lowered. It is argued that, were it pos
  sible to attain a suf<U+FB01>ciently high temperature, all the simpler
  compounds at least would exhibit the phenomena of disso
  ciation.
     From the nature of gases, it is to be expected that a study
  of the behaviour of dissociating ases would be the simplest
  way of arriving at a knowledge 0% the subject. An obvious
  criterion of the amount of' dissociation is given by the vapour
  density of the partially dissociated body ; for if the dissociating
  gas, and the simpler gases resulting from its dissociation, obey
    oyle’s and Gay-Lussac’s laws, then it is easy to calculate

                some Thermodynamical Relations.                  35
from the density of the gas the percentage number of mole
cules decomposed. But there is no means of knowing whether
the dissociating substance, as such, does or does not obey
these laws; hence it is evidently desirable to ascertain the
behaviour of substances which do not dissociate as regards
expansion and compressibility ; so that some idea may be
 gained as to the in<U+FB02>uence exerted by molecular attraction
 between like molecules on the volume they occupy. An in
 vestigation of this nature is best carried out by ascertaining
 the behaviour of gases when they are becoming increasingly
 subject to molecular attraction, i. e. when they are approach
ing the condition of saturated vapours. The pressure of
saturation is, under normal circumstances, identical with
 the vapour-pressure; hence the importance of a knowledge
 of this quantity. We have before remarked, that we have
 communicated to the Royal Society the results of experiments
 on alcohol and ether with this view.
    Again, if the body exerting vapour-pressure be one capable
 of partial dissociation on passage from the solid or liquid to
 the gaseous state, its apparent vapour-pressure will really
 consist of its real vapour-pressure, and also of the pressure
due to its dissociation into its constituents. It is evidently of
importance to determine the latter independently of the former;
and it is only by the employment of some law applicable to
all bodies, and deduced from the behaviour of stable sub
 stances, that an idea can be formed of the pressure due to the
second cause.
    In the Philosophical Magazine for April 1886, p. 299,
 Professor Unwin also comments on our papers, and, unlike
 Professors Ayrton and Perry, has appreciated our motive in
 bringing forward the subject. We have to thank him for point
ing out the relation of the ratio of the total heat of vaporization
to the heat expended in external work, deduced from the second
half of the thermodynamic equation. We agree with him that
the approximate constancy there observed lies at the basis of
all the relations found by us.

      With mercury, the value of n is much more nearly constant
  than if Regnault’s numbers be employed.
      It will be noticed that this number is much higher than
  that given by Professor Unwin (0'69, while ours is 1'21);
  but it is worthy of remark, that if the values of n be calcu
  lated for the stable substances mentioned in our <U+FB01>rst paper,
  taking the highest and lowest pressures, and the corresponding
  values of g, the value of n varies between the narrow limits
  1'15 and 1'52.          Although we have not veri<U+FB01>ed these values
  for intermediate pressures except in the examples already
  given, it may be of interest to reproduce them.

   The whole subject of vapour-pressure is one that cannot
well be considered on its own merits, for they must evidently
be intimately related to other physical properties ; and althoug
we have already accumulated data for alcohol and ether bear
ing on this subject, we prefer to reserve a general considera
tion of the question until an investigation, as regards the
thermal behaviour of other bodies, on which we are at present
engaged, shall have been <U+FB01>nished.

IN the <U+FB01>rst two of the series of papers on “Some Ther
modynamical Relations,” published in the Philosophical
Magazine (December 1885, January and February 1886), it
was shown by one of us that the ratio of the absolute tempe
ratures of nearly related bodies, such as chlorobenzene and
bromobenzene, or ethyl chloride and ethyl bromide, is con
stant for equal vapour-pressures; and that a relation exists
between the ratios of the absolute temperatures of all bodies
which may be expressed by the equation
                        R’=R+c(t’—t),
where R is the ratio of the absolute temperatures of the two
bodies corresponding to any vapour-pressure, the same for
both ; R’ is the ratio at any other vapour-pressure, again the
same for both ; c is a constant which may be 0 or a small +
or - number; and t’ and t are the temperatures of one of
the two bodies corresponding to the two vapour-pressures.

   The determination of the vapour-pressures of a large series of
compound ethers by Schumann (Wiedemann’s Annalen, 1881,
p. 40) affords an opportunity of studying the relations of a great
number of bodies of the same type ; and it appears that in this
case also the ratio of the absolute temperatures of any two of
the ethers is a constant at all pressures. The following table
shows the ratios of the absolute temperatures of all the ethers
to those of ethyl acetate at pressures of 200, 760, and 1300
millims. (The boiling-points at these pressures are given by
Schumann.)            It will be seen that in every case the ratio is
very nearly constant at each pressure ; and the deviations
from constancy may well be due to the great dif<U+FB01>culty of ob
taining perfectly pure specimens, evidenced by the fact that
only one other boiled with perfect constancy, the rise of tem
perature during distillation amounting in one case to 0°‘7,
while the average rise was 0°‘37. The absolute temperatures
of ethyl acetate corresponding to 1300, 760, and 200 millim.
are 367°‘3, 350°‘1, and 314°‘4.

     Taking the boiling-point of ethyl acetate at the normal
pressure to be correct, and the ratio of the absolute tempera
ture of ethyl acetate to that of water at that pressure therefore
to be #2213 =0'9386, and the value of c to be 0-000387, the
ratio of the absolute temperature of ethyl acetate to that of
water at any other pressure is given by the equation
              % =0-9386+0'000387 (T’-373),
where t’ is the absolute temperature of ethyl acetate, and T’
that of water.

For any other ether in the series the equation is

              T = 50—1 {0-9386 +0'000387 (T’—373)}’
where t is the boiling-point of the ether at constant pressure.
     For pressures of 1300 and 200 millim. respectively the
equation becomes simply
                              t’= 1'0488t
and        -                  r=0~se795 t.
     It appears therefore that by determining simply the boiling
point of an ether belonging to this type, and knowing the
vapour-pressures of water ( or of one of the other ethers), it is
possible to calculate the temperatures corresponding to any
other pressure, at any rate between the limits of 200 and
1300 millim.

IV. On a new Method for the Preparation of Tin Tetrethyl.
  By Prof. E. A. LETTS, D.Sc., Ph.D., ($0., Queen’s College,
   Belfast, and NORMAN Comm, Ph.D., Science Lecturer, the
   Ladies College, Cheltenham".
HAVING had occasion to prepare large quantities of zinc
        ethyl, we employed Gladstone and Tribe’s excellent
methodT, and observed quite accidentally the formation of a
liquid bye-product which contained a metal, but was not
affected by air nor decomposed by water.
   For some time we were ba<U+FB02>led in our attempts to ascer
tain the nature of this substance, as we scarcely anticipated
that the commercial zinc we employed would contain any
foreign metal in suf<U+FB01>cient quantity to give an organo-metallic
body. Eventually, however, we proved that the substance
contained tin, and was in fact tin tetrethyl, as the following
particulars show.

    As the usual methods for the preparation of tin tetrethyl
are rather troublesome and tedious (viz. either by the action
of zinc ethyl on tin tetrachloride“, or on tin triethyl iodide, or
on tin diethyl iodide 1', or by adding fused anhydrous stannous
chloride to zinc ethyl and distillingi), it occurred to us that
the accidental discovery we have described might indicate
a simpler and more satisfactory process for obtaining it.                        As
the commercial zinc we employed could only contain a small
percentage of tin, it seemed probable (as we had obtained fair
quantities of the tetrethyl compound) that the whole of the
tin had possibly been converted into its organo-metallic deri
vative ; and we argued that, by employing an alloy of zinc rich
in tin for the couple, or by using pure tin without admixture
of zinc, we ought to obtain a good yield of tin tetrethyl.
   A rough experiment showed that tin tetrethyl is obtained
in considerable quantity by employing a couple containing a
fair percentage of tin, and that the process is easily executed.
    We next made a series of experiments to ascertain the
conditions for obtaining the best yield of the organo-metallic
body, and also for ascertaining what proportion of tin, in
alloys with zinc, of varying composition would be converted
into the tetrethyl compound. The following table illustrates
our results :—

                for the Preparation of Tin Tetrethyl.                      43
   These results indicate that, with the quantity of alloy used
(viz. 45 grms.), about 50 per cent. of the tin is always con
verted into tin tetrethyl, no matter what the composition of
the alloy may be, so long as the proportion of tin does not exceed
from 20 to 60 per cent.         They also show that the total quan
tity of tin tetrethyl obtained is proportional to the percentage
 of tin in the alloy up to about 333 per cent., but not beyond ;
 possibly for the following reasonz—A couple composed of tin
 and copper only has no immediate action on ethyl iodide ; but
 a zinc-copper couple is very active, giving zinc ethiodide
 almost immediately. The production of this substance appears
 to be a necessary preliminary to the formation of tin tetrethyl;
 and therefore as the percentage of zinc is reduced, the forma
 tion of the zinc ethiodide is retarded, if not interfered with
 altogether.
    Up to a certain point, then, su<U+FB02>icient zinc ethiodide is
formed to induce the reaction ; but if the percentage is further
increased, the action seems to stop, or at least to be hindered.
The following table illustrates this point. In each experiment
60 grms. of ethyl iodide was allowed to act on 50 grms. of
couple.

   1 In experiment 8 the digestion was stop ed at the end of eight hours,
 although the reaction was by no means <U+FB01>nishe ; for on distillation 24 grms. of
 unacted-on ethyl iodide were recovered.
    From experiments 7 and 8, it is evident that the time
 necessary for the action increases enormously with high per
 centages of tin in the alloy.
   * The commencement of the action of ethyl iodide on the couple is
 always indicated by an apparent e<U+FB01>'ervescence in place of the simple ebul
lition which occurs at <U+FB01>rst.

44             Messrs. Letts and Collie on a new Method
    As regards the mechanism of the reaction, the following
explanation may be suggested :—
                2Zn(C,H5)I + Sn= Sn(C,H5), + ZnI2 + Zn,
01'
                 Zn (O’H5)g + SI]. = SH(OQH5)2 + Zn,
and
            .   2sn(02H5)2 = Sn + Sn (02H5)4.
And this explains the fact that about 50 per cent. only of the
tin is converted into tin tetrethyl. If the above explanation be
true, an alloy of zinc and tin might not be necessary; and also
if the conversion of the tin into tin tetrethyl takes place at
the moment the zinc ethiodide is decomposed by heat, the
action of the ethyl iodide on the couple is only to produce
zinc ethiodide.           Several other experiments were therefore
made in order to ascertain as far as possible whether this is
the case.                   -
    A couple was made of ordinary zinc and copper, to which
ethyl iodide and powdered tin were added.

    This proves beyond doubt that an alloy of the zinc and tin
is not absolutely necessary.
    In the next experiment, after the whole of the ethyl iodide
had been converted into zinc ethiodide by an alloy containing
15 per cent. of tin, the <U+FB02>ask connected with an upright con
denser was heated in an oil-bath for about three hours to a
temperature high enough to decompose the zinc ethiodide,
and so allow it every facility for reacting on the tin.

    Ethyl iodide was also allowed to act on some zinc-tin alloy

              for the Preparation of Tin Tetrethyl.            45
containing 15 per cent. of tin. When the reaction was <U+FB01>nished,
the resulting crystalline mass was dissolved in ether and the
zinc ethiodide decomposed by the careful addition of alcohol,
and eventually acidulated water. Only traces of tin tetrethyl
could be detected in the etherial solution, while in the watery
solution no tin compounds were present. This result indi
cates that at the heat of the water-bath, zinc ethiodide does
not act upon tin.
   Another experiment was therefore tried to see whether, b
digesting zinc ethiodide with tin at the temperature at whic
the former substance decomposes, the formation of tin tetrethyl
Would take place readily. Fused zinc ethiodide was poured
on to about half its own weight of powdered tin, and then
digested in an oil-bath for three hours at a temperature of
about 1600 C.       On distilling, the liquid which passed over
scarcely even fumed in the air, and was nearly pure tin
tetrethyl.
    Although we have not ascertained the exact conditions
necessary for obtaining the maximum yield of tin tetrethyl,
yet our last experiment would seem to show that these con
 ditions would be realized by <U+FB01>rst obtaining a maximum yield
 of zinc ethiodide, by acting on a zinc-copper couple with ethyl
 iodide, then adding powdered tin and digesting at 150°~160°C.
 until all action is over, and <U+FB01>nally distilling.
    The action of ethyl iodide on alloys of zinc containing other
 metals was tried ; alloys of 10 per cent. of zinc with 20 per
 cent. of bismuth, aluminium, antimon , and lead respectively
 were treated with ethyl iodide, but wit negative results. The
 alloy containing 20 per cent. of bismuth was digested on the
 water-bath for several hours. After all the ethyl iodide had
 been converted into zinc ethiodide, further heating was con
 sidered unnecesary, as bismuth triethyl decomposes at 50°—60° C.
 The solid mass was extracted with dry ether when cool, and
 <U+FB01>ltered; alcohol was <U+FB01>rst added and then acidulated water,
 but not even a trace of an organo-metallic bismuth compound
 could be detected.
    The aluminium alloy also did not yield even a trace of any
 volatile organic aluminium compound.
    The lead alloy, after the whole of the ethyl iodide was con
 verted into the zinc ethiodide, was kept for several hours at a
 temperature 160°-170° 0.; but on allowing it to cool and
 extracting with dry ether no lead compound was dissolved.
    The antimony alloy gave traces of a volatile antimony com
 pound which distilled with the zinc ethyl, but in such small
 quantity that the investigation was not carried further.
    It is remarkable that, while alloys of zinc and the above

 46    Note on M. Mascart’s paper, “ On Magnetization.”
mentioned metals yield with iodide of ethyl only zinc ethyl,
a tin alloy should give such large quantities of tin tetrethyl.
This may be accounted for perhaps by the greater stability
of the tin tetrethyl at high temperatures, the organo-metallic
compounds of bismuth, lead, aluminium, and antimony all
decomposing when strongly heated.
 V. Note on M. Mascart’s paper, “ On Magnetization.”*
   By E. F. J. LOVE, B.A., Demonstrator of Physics in the
   Mason Science College, Birmingham ’r.
IN the above-mentioned paper, M. Mascart draws attention
      to the fact that the values of the coef<U+FB01>cient of magnet
ization, as determined by using long cylinders, differ from
those obtained by the employment of rings; and tries to
demonstrate that “ a special phenomenon is produced in the
case of closed rings which exaggerates the effects of induc
tion.”
   Without presuming to question M. Mascart’s investigations,
I may be allowed to point out that the facts admit of an
entirely different and much simpler explanation.
   Calling the two values of the magnetization-coefficient
determined with the help of bars, f and f1, as is done by
M. Mascart, I may <U+FB01>rst point out that f, is measured by
<U+FB01>nding the magnetic induction at the centre of the bar, while
  is determined by the magnetic moment, which depends on
the distribution of magnetic induction throughout the bar.
In all cases the induction through the central section is the
greatest, owing to lines of induction leaving the bar all along
its length, and not all going right through to the ends ; the
effect of this is to diminish the apparent value of the magneti
zation-coef<U+FB01>cient as determined from the magnetic moment.
The extent to which the induction-lines escape is very
surprising, as the following example will show :—
   A rectan ular bar of soft iron was bent into a ring, and
turned in t e lathe to a true circle, 10 centim. in diameter.
It was then cut into two halves along a diameter, and the cut
ends worked to true planes. On each half a primary coil of 185
turns was wound, and these were connected together, giving a
primary of 370 turns covering up the iron. Two secondary ' ,
coils of 10 turns each were then wound on, one near the end
of one of the semicircles, the other forminga spiral extending
over the surface of the same semicircle. The two electro

magnets thus formed were placed on a block between springs
which held their ends <U+FB01>rmly in contact, thus giving a closed
iron circuit. A magnetizing current being passed through
the primar , the induction through the secondary coils on
reversing -t e primary current was measured, and found to be
the same for both coils. Then a piece of copper 0'5 millim.
thick was interposed between each of the opposed pairs of
faces’of iron ; and the induction near the end was found to be
 onl ' 0'73 of the mean induction.
        e effect produced with a long iron rod would naturally be
of the same kind as with the ring described above, except
that the leakage of induction would take place to a greater
extent.
    Another point is, that in experiments with a closed iron
 ring the lines of induction lie entirely within the iron, and
 hence the magnetic permeability ,u. (:1 +4'rrlc) is determined
 directly ; but when a rod is em loyed, the lines of induction
 pass for the greatest part of their course through air, and
 what is measured is the average permeability of an air-iron
 circuit. Now air having always a smaller permeability than
 iron, the result is to bring out the magnetization-coef<U+FB01>cient
 again too low.
    Hence it would hardly seem necessary to adopt M. Mas
cart’s suggestion that“ a special phenomenon is produced
in the case of closed rings which exaggerates the effect of
induction.”

       VII. Magnetic Researches.        By Prof. G. IVIEDEMANN‘“.
                                    [Plate 1.]
 SINCE the year 1857 I have publishedT a series of inves
         tigations on the relationship between the mechanical and
 magnetic properties of bodies, and in 1877 a closely-related
 paperi on Torsion, in which I proposed to make, in continua
 tion, observations on magnetism.              In the mean time other
 investigators have made researches upon the same subject,
 which indeed are partly only repetitions and extensions of
 previous work in slightly different form ; but partly also have
 constituted an actual advance, and in particular points have
 been supposed to be in opposition to the theory I have pro
 posed. I may therefore be permitted brie<U+FB02>y to mention these
 researches here, and to describe certain new experiments
 connected with them.
                                     §1.
      Mr. Hughes§ has investigated the change in magnetic
moment of iron and steel, upon torsion &c., under various
conditions, as VVertheim and Matteuci had already done by
means of the currents induced in a spiral surrounding a
magnetic body.                                   '
     He has given a series of experiments on the behaviour,
during torsion, of iron wires through or round which a current
is passed. I have already". in a short note published in
English, called attention to the fact that the essential portion
of these results had been already observed by myself in the
years 1858-60. Nevertheless, Mr. Hughes in further com

            Prof. G. Wiedemann’s rlfagnetic Researches.                     51
citation* of earlier work, has (together with certain experi
ments following at once from my views) reproduced my
theory as new. This theory has thus, in various quarters,
 been supposed to have originated with him.
     Mr. Hughes passes, for instance, alternating currents
 through a <U+FB02>at iron band, surrounds the middle of this
 with an induction-spiral, and, in a telephone connected with
 the latter, hears no sounds; as was to be expected, since,
 with both directions of the current, the potential of the
 transverse and circularly-directed molecular magnets upon
 the spiral is zero. But if the iron band be twisted mean
 while, then, as I have expressly explained, the transversal
 molecular magnets take up a position inclined to the axis
 of the band, and partially maintain this position during
 the detorsion. Hence, under the in<U+FB02>uence of the alter
 nating currents, they assume positions variously inclined to
 the axis, so that the potentials can no longer be zero, or equal
 to each other; hence the telephone sounds. That upon the
 sudden springing back of the twisted band the molecular
 magnets may spring over to the other side, and that then the
 induced currents run in the opposite direction, is clear. It is
 equally obvious that the molecules of the iron tape may take
  up an inclined position upon the lateral approach of a magnet,
 though not spirally arranged round the axis, and that similar
 phenomena must result. These conclusions follow at once from
  my earlier results.
    In connexion with these and similar experiments,Mr. Hughes
  proposes the theory (a) that each molecule of a magnetic metal
 is an unalterable molecular magnet ; (b) that it can be caused to
  revolve on its axis by means of mechanical and electromecha
  nical forces; (0) that when there is external magnetic neu
  trality, the molecules and their polarities are so arranged that
  they satisfy their mutual attractions in the shortest possible
  way; and, lastly, (d) that if magnetism is produced, the
  molecules and their polarities become rotated into a given
  direction in a symmetrical manner, so that a north pole is
  produced in the one direction and a south pole in the opposite
  direction.    Moreover, also, a symmetrical arrangement is as
  sumed when magnetism is produced, but the circuits of attrac
  tion are not complete unless there is a keeper connecting the
  two poles.      Hence Mr. Hughes assumes still further (e) a
     * Thus, amongst others, the the01y of rotation of molecular magnets,
  given in De la Rive’s Traité d’Eléctricité, En lish edition, Sect. iii. p. 3l7
~ (1853), is attributed to De la Rive; the muc earlier fundamental deduc
  tion of W. Weber, Electrodyn. Maasbest. iii. p. 557 (1846) is not mentioned.
  My conclusions are not quite correctly represented.

rigidity, which retains the molecules in their positions after
the cessation of the active forces.
    We have long been acquainted with all these propositions.
They agree perfectly, so far as they are correct, with those
 which I have published after the earlier calculations of Weber;
 as moreover is recognized by Prof. G. Ho<U+FB01>'mann, the reporter
 upon Mr. Hughes’s experiments in the ‘ Electrotechnical
 Journal“. It is only in regard to proposition (0) that he
 thinks Mr. Hughes has the priority. This is, however, not
 correct. In the second edition of my Galvanismus, ii. (1)
p. 373, § 327 (1871) I say distinctly:——“ It is obvious that
 we may imagine an in<U+FB01>nite number of arrangements of the
 molecular magnets in bodies, with each of which no external
 action would result. If, for example, they are arranged in
 circles with their unlike poles in contact, or if their poles have
 in each space-element all possible directions, this result will
 follow.” The assumption of Mr. Hughes, that I have referred
 the neutrality of a bar to a “heterogeneous ” arrangement of
 molecules, which is completely different from his theory of
 neutrality, is thus opposed to facts.                                 ,
    Moreover, it is incorrect that the external magnetic neu
 trality, whether of a new bar or in one subject to magnetizing
 in<U+FB02>uences, is conditioned solely by the formation of closed
 molecular rings, such as Mr. Hughes imagines. This would be
 possible only with a power of perfectly free rotation of the
 molecules round their centres of gravity. But since experi
ence shows that they suffer a resistance to this rotation,
this arrangement can only be approximately attained; the
axes of the molecular magnets must in like manner deviate
from the axis of such a ring on all sides. Moreover there is,
 a priori, no ground why any one direction should have the
 preference in an absolutely neutral magnet, either for the
position of the separate molecular magnets, or for the rings
 approximately formed by their opposite attractions. The
second statement of my proposition quoted above is therefore
entirely justi<U+FB01>ed.
    Lastly, Mr. Hughes’s proposition (d), that in visible mag
 netization a “ symmetrical.” rotation and arrangement of the
molecular magnets takes place, is only correct in the case of
a symmetrical form of the body magnetized, and a Symme
trical distribution of the magnetizing forces.

experiments which I made in the year 1858—showing that
an iron or a steel bar, subjected to torsion during or after
passinga galvanic current through it, becomes magnetic—
by assuming that the <U+FB01>bres of the bar assume a spiral
arrangement upon torsion, and that so that the current also
circulates spirally through it. At the same time he himself
mentions the dif<U+FB01>culty that the effect of torsion is constant
in direction up to the strongest current which can be passed
through the wire, whilst aelotropy would result only with
feeble magnetization, and moreover is opposed to the action
of aelotropy upon the electric conductivity.
   The above view is also opposed by the fact that, upon stop~
ping the current through the wire, wires which have thus
acquired permanent transversal-circular magnetism have pro
duced in them by torsion a permanent axial magnetism.
Moreover the opposite behaviour of nickel and iron (see
below) contradicts this assumption*. But that this cause
may have some secondary action at the same time as the rota
tion of the molecular magnets is hardly to be doubted.
                                    §3.
    According to the experiments of Sir 1V. Thomson)”, the
behaviour of magnetic bars of iron, on the one hand, is opposed
to that of magnetic bars of nickel and cobalt, on the other hand,
when subjected to longitudinal tension. Whilst the tempo
rary magnetism of the <U+FB01>rst increases with the load under a
 certain critical value of the magnetic force, above which it
decreases, the temporary magnetism of nickel and cobalt
decreases below a certain other (much larger) critical value of
the magnetizing force.
    Reciprocally, it follows from the experiments of Barreti‘,
that whilst (as Joule§ has shown) iron bars lengthen upon
being magnetized, bars of nickel, on the contrary, shorten.
 Cobalt is reported to form an exception and to behave like
 iron. In these latter experiments, it is true, the purely
mechanico-electromagnetic action of the magnetizing coil
upon the bar was not excluded.
     Quite in agreement with this, Mr. Knott [[ has found that
 when a current is passed through a bar of nickel magnetized

 longitudinally, it suffers torsion in a direction opposite to that
 which I found for an iron bar treated in the same way.
    Maxwell“ and Chrystal’f have formerly endeavoured to refer
 this torsion, in the case of iron, to the above-mentioned ex
 pansion which it suffers upon being magnetized. Wires
 magnetized at the same time longitudinally and transversely,
 and therefore in an obliquely spiral direction, oughtto expand
 in this latter direction, and thus to suffer torsion in the direc
 tion determined. But with nickel, since, upon being magne
 tized, contraction instead of expansion takes place, the torsion
 ought to take place in the opposite direction, as is shown by
 experiment to be the case.
    I have myself endeavoured to refer this phenomenon, ob
 served in my <U+FB01>rst experiments in 1858, at least in the case
 of iron wires, to the obliquely spiral direction which the mole
 cules take up in consequence of the two magnetizations at
 right angles to each other, and which is accompanied secon
 darily bya displacement of the longitudinal <U+FB01>bres and sections
 of the wires, of which, in the case of iron, the <U+FB01>rst is the most
 important.
    The chief proof of my assumption which I had given was
the phenOmenon, completely coordinate with the above results,
 that a wire equatorially magnetized, whether temporarily or
 permanently, by a current passed through it, becomes longi
 tudinally magnetized upon torsion.
    I have now extended these experiments to the case of nickel
wires. They were made essentially in the same way as the
former ones. The wire, 52 centim. long and 2 millim. thick7
was stretched east and west between a clamp, a, screwed tight,
and a clamp, b, coaxial with a, capable of rotation in an up_
                                          __1’::——’
right, and provided with a divided circle. The wire was placed
end on in front of a magnetic steel mirror swinging in a thick
copper box, with the <U+FB01>xed clamp at a distance of about 20 cen
tim. from it.    The current of a Bunsen battery was led to this

clamp by long wires, placed as axially as possible, which ran
at <U+FB01>rst in the direction of the axis of the wire, then coming
together in a wide arc, were wound round each other and
carried to the poles of the battery. The deviations of the mag
netic mirror were read off upon a scale at adistance of 1 metre.
 In_order to determine the intensity of the current as well as the
temporary moments of the wires, a wire ring (Plate I. <U+FB01>g. 1)
 of 7 centim. diameter was placed in front of the mirror and co
axial with it, cut through at the bottom, and capable of vertical
rotation about a horizontal axle of brass, attached to it at its
lowest point. The two halves of the axle were provided with
 copper disks dipping into mercury-troughs. A brass wire
was <U+FB01>rst of all stretched in the torsion-apparatus, the current
passed through it and in the proper direction through the
 wire ring, and this moved axially in front of the steel mirror
 until the latter showed no deviation, and remained without
deviation when the wire was twisted. If, then, the wire
ring was turned about its axis into a horizontal position, the
deviation of the de<U+FB02>ection of the mirror corresponded to the
intensity of the current. Employing wires of iron or of nickel,
the de<U+FB02>ection in the vertical position of the wire ring gave the
temporary moment, and in the horizontal position the same
increased by a quantity proportional to the intensity of the
current.
    Frequently repeated experiments gave decisively the fol
lowing results :—
    If' the current passes through an iron wire from the movable
clamp to the <U+FB01>xed one, and if the former, as seen in the direc
tion from the movable to the fixed clamp, is rotated in a
direction opposite to the hands of a watch, the iron wire
acquires a north pole at the <U+FB01>xed clamp, and a south pole
with opposite rotation of the clamp. With reversed directions
of the current opposite polarities are produced, thus confirm;
ing former results. The same takes place after stopping the
current.
    But if a nickel wire be employed instead of an iron wire,
the results are reversed. If the current passes from the
movable to the <U+FB01>xed clamp, and if the former be rotated in a
direction opposite to that of the hands of a watch, the wire at
the <U+FB01>xed clamp becomes a south pole, and with reversed rota
tion a north pole. Here also the same result is obtained after
sto ping the current.
    gimilar results were obtained also, within certain limits,
upon repeated torsion in opposite directions. The deviations
of' the magnetic mirror far exceeded 50 or 100 scale-divisions,
with torsion of i60° in the case of wires 2 millim. thick, so

 56        Prof. G. Wiedemann’s Magnetic Researches.
 that there could be no possible doubt of the facts. The expe
 riments may even be made with an ordinary magnetic needle
 in place of the re<U+FB02>ecting magnet.      The effect is less marked
 with thinner wires.
    If the torsion acted only like an extension of the wires, it
 would not be easy to understand why an equatorially mag
 netized wire should become longitudinally magnetized by it.
 If we further assume that the <U+FB01>bres of the wires take up an
 inclined position, but that the molecules composing them
 retain their position relative to the axes of the <U+FB01>bres, then in
 all cases, if the current <U+FB02>ows from the movable to the <U+FB01>xed
 clamp, and the clamp is rotated opposite to the direction of
 the hands of a watch, the wire would acquire a south pole at
 the <U+FB01>xed clamp, equally whether it consisted of iron or nickel.
 The expansion of the <U+FB01>bres might produce under the critical
 magnetization an increase of polarization in the case of iron
 and a decrease with nickel, but not a reversal of the polari
 zation.
    A simple displacement of the sections, without a consequent
 rotation of the molecules, would communicate no longitudinal
 magnetism to the wire at all, and the expansion in length"
 could produce no change.
    Hence under all conditions torsion must produce a rotation
 of the molecules of iron opposite to that which takes place in
 nickel. I have already referred these rotations to the two
 simultaneous phenomena just mentioned, namely, to the rela
tive displacement of the longitudinal <U+FB01>bres, and that of the
 sections of the twisted wires, whereby contiguous mole
cules su<U+FB02>'er rotation in consequence of mutual friction, and in
opposite directions in consequence of the two displacements.
 In iron the friction of the longitudinal <U+FB01>bres is the greatest ;
in nickel that of the sections predominates.
    We must evidently employ these various rotations of the
molecules, as I have endeavoured to do, to explain reciprocal
phenomena. If the molecules of a wire are placed with their
axes oblique by means of two currents passing through and
round the wire, its <U+FB01>bres and sections must follow their rota
tions, as the molecules follow the displacements of the <U+FB01>bres
and sections when torsion takes place, and consequently here
also nickel must behave oppositely to iron. The change in the
length of the <U+FB01>bres can only exert a secondary quantitative
change upon the phenomenon.
   Hence I believe that the phenomena I have observed cannot
be taken simply as secondary phenomena to those observed by
Mr. Joule and Sir W. Thomson.

     If the changes of magnetic moment which take place upon
 torsion enable a conclusion to be drawn as to the rotation of
 the molecules, it appeared of interest to investigate the pro
 cesses connected with the changes still further; and <U+FB01>rst to
 examine a wire subjected to repeated twisting and untwisting
 within certain limits.
     These experiments were made with the same apparatus,
 and by the same methods as described above :—Wires, in some
cases (temporarily or permanently) longitudinally magnetized
 by currents led round them, in other cases (temporarily or
 permanently) transversely-circularly magnetized by currents
 led through them, were twisted and untwisted through a
 certain number of degrees, and their moments determined
 from the de<U+FB02>ection of the suspended steel mirror. The devia
 tions produced by the magnetizing current were compensated
 as before. By repeatedly raising and lowering the compen
 sating-ring, its constancy during the experiments on tem
 porary magnetism could be controlled.
  ' In the following tables, in order to economize space, the
 data are given only for the lst 2nd, 3rd, and nth torsion and
 detorsion after twisting the wire to and fro so many times
 that upon repetition of the experiments the same results were
 obtained.     t denotes the angle of torsion, m, the temporary,
 and m, the permanent magnetic moment.

   The magnetism of the nickel wire had diminished so much
after repeated torsion that measurements with it could not be
made use of.

           Prof. G. Wiedemann’s Magnetic Researches.            61
   The results of these observations for the last torsion and
detorsion after attaining a permanent condition, are repre
sented in Plate I. <U+FB01>gs. 2—9, by curves whose abscissa represent
torsions and ordinates the corresponding magnetic moments.
The curves marked 1., II., III. represent the results obtained
with the <U+FB01>rst, second, and third torsion and detorsion of the
soft-iron bar.
  The curves show that after the wires have been accommodated
by repeated deformation, the curves representing the mag
netism are nearly symmetrical for rising and falling torsion,
beginning from the minimal and maximal torsions of 0° and
210°. With the temporarily longitudinally magnetic iron
Wires—the moments are nearly equal for the later torsions—
they rise similarly in consequence of torsion and detorsion,
and then fall again to the limiting-point. The curves, how
ever, rise more rapidly than they fall, so that the maximum of
the temporary movements is obtained before the half-torsion
or detorsion.
   With the iron wires permanently magnetized longitudinally
and temporarily magnetized transversely, the behaviour is
similar, only the moments at the two limiting-points of 0°
and 210° are different. Starting, however, from these points,
 the curves run similarly. The moments again change more
 rapidly at the beginning of torsion or detorsion than at the
 end. With nickel the moments change in the opposite direc
 tion; but in other respects according to the same rules as
 with iron.
   We may hence conclude that, within certain limits, the
 molecules, in consequence of repeated twisting to and fro,
become movable ; so that they perform nearly equal motions
 for equal torsions from the two limiting values. With tem
porary longitudinal magnetization the tendency of the mag- .
netizing-force is to place the molecules with their magnetic
 axes longitudinal, in consequence of which a <U+FB01>nal condition
is attained in which they deviate at the limiting-points equally
 from their most nearly longitudinal position. A priori, we
 should expect that they would be most nearly longitudinal in
 the mean position, i. e. at half torsion and detorsion ; and there
the wire would show its maximum of longitudinal magnetism.
The deviation from this result shows that at the commencement
 of torsion or detorsion the molecules are more quickly in<U+FB02>u
 encedby the acting forces.
    It is also to be observed that the permanent torsions into
 which the bar, left to itself, slowly passes from the temporary
 torsions 0° and 210° do not at all agree with the torsions at
 which it shows the maximum of temporary magnetism ; these

 62         Prof. G. Wiedemann’s Magnetic Researches.
 last lie further away from the extreme torsions than the per
 manent torsions do.
    If we consider the changes in temporary magnetism in
 the <U+FB01>rst torsion, we observe in every case an increase and
 then a decrease, evidently because the molecular magnets,
 directed more or less axially by the magnetizing-force, obey
at <U+FB01>rst that force still further in consequence of vibration,
 and are then carried from their axial position into more
 oblique positions. This is con<U+FB01>rmed by the fact that with
very strong temporary magnetism the <U+FB01>rst rise through
 vibration is less than with less powerful magnetization, since
 in the <U+FB01>rst case the molecules are already more nearly in the
 axial position.
    With permanent longitudinal magnetization the directing
 force of the external magnetizing-power is absent ; the mole
cules, disregarding mutual action, are affected only by the
 displacements produced by torsion, which consequently mani
 fest themselves more distinctly than in the previous experi
 ments. The moment at the limiting-points is different, and
 thus also the position of the molecules. But, again, the most
 rapid rotation of the molecules at the beginning of each defor
mation is seen, within the given limits.
    A similar behaviour is observed in the case of temporary
 transverse magnetization, in which the magnetic directing
 force which acts upon the molecules is one-sided; and so
the moments at the limiting-points cannot be equal. Never
 theless, the rotations of the molecules with rising and falling
 torsion here also preserve the above-mentioned character.
                                §5.
    In exact analogy with the mechanical and magnetic beha
viour described in § 4, it may be shown that if a wire which
has been subjected to a temporary deformation (as a special
case, this deformation may be zero), then suffers another defor
mation, the molecules again retain the position corresponding
to the <U+FB01>rst deformation up to a certain degree.
   In order to make these experiments, a wire was temporarily
twisted by forces 0, a, b, gradually increasing, and its tempo
rary torsion measured, as also with decreasing forces b, a, 0. _
For this purpose the same apparatus was used, as in my former
experiments. A <U+FB02>at weight ryryl provided with a hook was
attached to the thread 0 g which acts upon the torsion-circle ; to
this a second weight 13 B, with a hole through the centre, was
attached by lateral threads or B *y, :11 [3, 71. These threads were
connected to a horizontal wire 3 e, which was soldered to the
frame of a pulley r) suspended by the thread §9.         The end 6

              Prof. G. Wiedemann’s Magnetic Researches.                    63
of this thread was attached to a <U+FB01>xed hook, the end § 6 passed
over a <U+FB01>xed pulley to the Windlass 5. If by turning 4’ the
pulley 1; was gradually lowered, the weight '7 yl at <U+FB01>rst acted
upon the torsion-circle until the weight [3 [3, reached the other,
when both together acted in twisting the wire. The horizontal
wires soldered to the weights rested against <U+FB01>xed vertical wires,
 and so prevented the turning of the weights with the threads
 carrying them. By winding up the pulley 27, the torsion cor
 responding to the weights B B1+7ryl and that corresponding
 to the weight 74y, alone could be determined. The weights
 were always raised and lowered very slowly, so that they
 produced their effect without any jar. The reading each
 time was not taken until, after putting on the weights, the
 temporary torsion did not perceptibly change any more. The
 weight 7 y, (1) weighed 618 gr., ,8 Bl +7 71 (1) + (2) 125'9 gr.
    As before, the torsions were read off by means of a tele
 scope in a mirror, which Was attached to the lower clamp of
 the wire subjected to torsion, and in which the image of a
 semicircular scale, placed round the wire as axis with a radius
 of 1 metre, was re<U+FB02>ected. The following tables contain some
 of the results obtained. The <U+FB01>rst column gives under G the
 weights used to produce the torsion, the following columns
 give the corresponding torsions successively obtained. The
 experiments were continued until the same torsion was
 obtained upon renewed action of the weights.

      It follows from these experiments that the temporary tor
 sion of the wires, produced by the smaller weight after the action
 of the greater weight, with a decreasing load, is in every case
 greater than that produced by the action of the same weight
 with increasing load, and before the action of the greater
 weight. The behaviour is observed not only during the accom
 modation of the wire, but also after it has attained a perma
 nent condition, when a repetition of the cycle of experiments
 gives the same results. It also is not altered by strong vibra
 tion of the wire.
      We may hence assume that, in the action of any torsional
 forces whatever (which may also be zero), the molecules are
 displaced and rotated in accordance with the deformation pro
 duced by these forces, and afterwards, upon the action of
 other forces, pass from their <U+FB01>rst positions of equilibrium
 into others, which, however, are conditioned by the <U+FB01>rst. If,
 then, the molecules are greatly displaced and rotated by a
 more powerful torsion, they still partially retain this displace
 ment and rotation upon the action of a feebler force ; whilst,
 conversely, upon changing from a feebler to a stronger tor
sional force, the latter is unable to produce so great a displace
ment and rotation of the molecules which lie nearer their
 neutral position.
     A similar behaviour in the case of wires is shown by an
experiment of H. Tomlinson’s“, in which, however, only small
differences were observed between loading and unloading.
                                    §6.
     The behaviour of iron bars in temporary magnetization,
by increasing and decreasing forces, is exactly similar to
the mechanical behaviour here described. Messrs. Righi'l',
Frpmmei, and Warburg§ have shown that if an iron bar
is successively magnetized by forces a, b, c, b, a, of which
a<b<c, the temporary moment M’b, corresponding to the
force I; with decreasing magnetization, is greater than the
temporary moment Mb, corresponding to the same force with
increasing magnetization. Warburg has ingeniously deduced
from this the behaviour of a magnetic needle vibrating above
an iron plate.

    In order to investigate whether this phenomenon occurs
only with the <U+FB01>rst increasing and decreasing magnetizations
 of the bars, or whether itoccurs also after they have attained a
   ermanent condition after repeated action of the ma netizing
Forces, the following experiments were made, in whic freshly
heated iron bars were magnetized by currents passed round
them in such a way that their intensity could be gradually
 increased up to a certain magnitude and then gradually
 reduced to zero, s0 avoiding the in<U+FB02>uence of all disturbing
induction-currents.
    For this purpose a special regulating Bunsen’s element
 was employed (<U+FB01>g. 11). It consisted of a porcelain cylinder
 36 centim. high and 10 centim. wide, on the bottom of
 which was cemented a second concentric porcelain cylinder
 closed at the top, 25 centim. high and 5 centim. wide. This
 supported a porous cell 10 centim. high and 5 centim. wide,
 in which was contained a Bunsen carbon-cylinder provided
 with a connecting wire, and was <U+FB01>lled with nitric acid. It
 was surrounded by a cylinder of amalgamated zinc 10 centim.
 high and 9 centim. wide, which was suspended by means of
 strips of zinc soldered to it from the edges of the outer
 porcelain cylinder,'which contained dilute sulphuric acid. A
 glass tube 40 centim. long closely surrounded the porous cell
 and its support, and could be raised or lowered by means of
 a cord attached to it, which passed over a pulley to a roller and
 handle. A brass band stretched by a weight pressed against
 the roller and held it <U+FB01>rmly in any position. By this arrange
  ment the current could be increased from nearly zero up to'
  a considerable strength. Of course the same arrangement
  mi ht be employed as a Daniell cell".
       be current from this cell was passed through a copper
  wire spiral 25 centim. long, 2'7 centim. internal diameter,
  and 7 centim. external diameter, lying horizontally magnetic
  east and west, 50 centim. distant from the steel mirror of the
  re<U+FB02>ecting-galvanometer. The deviation thus produced was
  compensated by means of the vertical copper ring placed in
  front of the mirror. A freshl heated bar of soft cast steel,
  24 centim. long and 1 centim. t ick, was <U+FB01>xed in the spiral, and
  its momentum determined from the de<U+FB02>ection of the mirror.
  The corresponding intensity of the current was determined
  as before, by turning down the ring. In order, further, to
  be able to adjust the current during the temporary magneti
  zation of the bar to any desired strength, the ends of the
  spiral were connected, in particular cases, with the quadrants

       It follows from these observations that even after an iron
  bar, by repeated temporary magnetization, either to-the same
  maximum of temporary magnetism, or by currents which
  always attain the same maximum of intensity, has attained a
  permanent condition, the temporary moment correspondmg

  to a given magnetizing force is always greater with decreasing
  forces than with increasing forces.                             ‘
      Here, also, there prevails then a complete analogy to the me
  chanical behaviour under torsion produced by increasing and
  decreasing torsional forces.
                                         §7.
      The gradual accommodation of the molecules upon repeated
  torsion within certain limits, described in the foregoing pages,
  as recognized by magnetic behaviour, in which the de<U+FB02>ec
  tions with the same torsion increase at <U+FB01>rst, agrees with the
  result of my former experiments *, that the permanent torsions
   of a wire, upon repeated temporary twistings of the same up
  to a certain limit, and also in the same way upon repeated
  action of the same torsional force, increases gradually up to
   a maximum. This behaviour shows clearly that the molecules
   in the deformed wire are only carried gradually from the posi
   tion of equilibrium corresponding to the zero into that which
   corresponds to the deformation.             The same holds good of the
   action of magnetic forces tendin               to rotate the molecules.
   Here, also, as the second Table,               6, shows, the permanent
   moment increases gradually up to a certain maximum, upon
   repeated temporary magnetization up to a certain limit.
      In the same way, as the above experiments show, an iron
  bar only attains, after the repeated action of a given mag
  netizing force, the maximum magnetic moment corresponding
  thereto.
      This last-mentioned behaviour has already been observed
  by Queteleti' in repeatedly rubbing steel needles with a
  ma net, and by Hermann and Scholz upon repeated contact
  wi the pole of a steel magnet, and similarly by BoutyT and
   Fromme‘l' upon the repeated introduction of iron bars into
   magnetizing spirals traversed by a constant currenti. In
- this last method, the separate portions of the bars are succes
  sively exposed to the magnetizing forces of different intensity
  at the different points of the spiral, and thus the position of
  the molecules of the bars already taken up at one point may
  assist the adjustment of the molecules at other points
  in the subsequent introduction into the spiral, or rubbing,
  and thus explain the increase of the permanent moments.

    1- On the literature of the subject, see G.Wiedemann, Elect. iii. p. 442, &c,
     I I have formerly obtained a series of results on the magnetization and
  demagnetization of iron and steel bars 1) the same method. Ex eli
  ments by the method now employed wit constant distribution 0 the
  magnetizing forces give (qualitatively) the same results.

          Prof. G. Wiedemann’s Magnetic Researches.            69
That this is also the case with an unchanged distribution of
the magnetizing forces is seen from the above experiments.
                                 §8.
   In close connection with these phenomena is the thermo
electric behaviour of stretched wires towards the same un
stretched, studied by Cohn *, which is certainly one of the
most sensitive modes of detecting changes in structure.
Here, also, the thermoelectric forces which correspond to
equal tensional forces are different with increasing and with
decreasing tension. There could be no doubt that the in
vestigation of the thermoelectric behaviour of. wires twisted
to and fro would give similar results, and this is con<U+FB01>rmed
by experiment; as also in the investigation of the same
behaviour with iron and steel bars, which are ma netized by
increasing and decreasing magnetizing forces.         n so far as
the torsion or detorsion affects the electric conductivity of
the wires, it must show analo y to the magnetic behaviour.
This much may, however, sa ely be concluded from these
investigations, that if the molecules of the bodies are dis
placed or rotated from their former positions of equilibrium,
before as well as after the molecules have accommodated
themselves by the repeated action of the force, they will
always, to some extent, also retain this displacement or rotation
upon gradual alteration of the force.
   This is seen in various ways. Thus, for example, if the
force in<U+FB02>uencing the body is reduced to zero, a permanent dis
placement and rotation remains; again, in order to reduce a
permanent torsion or magnetization to zero, a smaller force is
necessary than is required for the production of the same.
Further, a body which has accommodated itself by the re
peated action of increasing and decreasing forces, and is then
again repeatedly exposed to the action of the same forces,
shows each time, more or less, the position of the molecules
corresponding to the greater or smaller force preceding that
allowed to act last.
   Since it is not possible, in the present condition of our
knowledge, to express these phenomena of elasticity in the
widest sense of the word by mathematical laws under appro
priate theories, further experimental researches on this subject
are required, in which the time during which the forces'act,
and the time which elapses after they cease to act, must be
taken into account. A thorough study of the magnetic pro
perties of bodies, from which we can infer, up to a certain

70              Prof. W. Ostwald on the Seat of the
point, the rotations of the molecules, seems to be especially
suited to this purpose.
                                  § 9.
    The behaviour of bodies under changes of temperature is
 quite different from their magnetic and mechanical behaviour.
    If a body, whether deformed or magnetized, has been ac
 commodated by repeated heating and cooling, so that the
 molecules have assumed their <U+FB01>nal mean position of equili
 brium for each single temperature degree, the same mechanical
 or magnetic condition corresponds to the same temperature,
 whether with rising or falling temperature. Thus a thermo
 meter, after repeated changes of temperature, gives the same
indications at the same temperature, whether with rising or
 falling temperature, when once the extreme indications have
 become constant.        So also a thermo-element (say of copper
 and german silver) shows, after accommodation, always the
 same electromotive force, and a magnet always the same per
 manent moment at a given temperature, as is shown by direct
 experiment.      The difference is just this, that in mechanical
 deformation and magnetization the molecules have been
 carried over into new more or less stable positions of mecha
 nical equilibrium, by means of mechanical displacements and
 rotations, out of which they may be directly displaced by
 fresh mechanical in<U+FB02>uences ; whereas by heating we change
 only the amplitude of the vibrations of the molecules in all
 directions above the same position of equilibrium.

     SIR,—After reading your memoir on the seat of                      in
  the pile, published in last year’s Philosophical Magazine‘, allow
  me to express my full agreement with our views. But I
  further believe that it will interest you to now that there is a
  method of directly measuring differences of potential, whether
  between two liquids or between a liquid and a metal.

   The method rests upon a remark of Helmholtz*, that a
quantity of mercury, if insulated, and arranged to form dro s
quickly beneath the surface of a liquid, rapidly acquires t e
potential of the liquid. Let T (<U+FB01>g. 1) be an insulated drop
ping-funnel full of mercury, which drops inside the liquid F
through a. <U+FB01>ne point, and let M be a metal plunged into the
same liquid; the electrometer E will indicate the true differ
ence of potential between M and F. I have experimentally
convinced myself that, by careful regulation of the <U+FB02>ow, one
can get the potential of the mercury to correspond with that
of the liquid within about '01 volt.

    In order to measure the potential-di<U+FB01>'erence of two liquids,
one uses two funnels (<U+FB01>g. 2), and connects each of the
two liquids F1 and F2 with a third vessel containing one of
them by means of a capillary siphon, so as to prevent any
 mixture. 1 have to thank my friend Dr. Arrhenius for the
 suggestion of the two funnels.        I have found by this method
 that pretty big potential-differences frequently occur between
 liquids, going up to '8 or '9- volt with dilute solutions. The
          of a Daniell cell appears to be about '8 volt between
  zinc and zinc-sulphate, '3 volt between copper and copper
 sulphate; while between zine-sulphate and copper-sulphate
  the difference seems practically zero. Nevertheless, since
  copper salts have shown some hitherto unexplained phenomena,
  I do not yet quite regard this result as indubitable.
     1 am at present so immersed in literary work that I cannot
 continue my investigations for several months ; but I should
 be grateful if you will translate some of this and send it to the
 Editors of the Philosophical Magazine.

Deeley, Esq., F.G.S.
   The author, after referring to previous publications on the subject,
proceeded to notice the leading characters of the greatly developed '
Pleistocene deposits in the area drained by the Trent river and its
tributaries. He proposed to classify the beds in question under
three divisions, comprising the following stages. The beds of the
lowest division were distinguished from those of the middle and
upper by the absence of Cretaceous rock-debris.
        OLDER PLEISTOCEITE.

        NEWER PLEISTOCENE.
                 Interglacial River-alluvium.
                 Later Pennine Boulder-clay.
   Each of the separate stages was then described separately, with
details of exposures and sections throughout the area.
   The Early and Middle Pennine Boulder-clays, which closely re
sembled each other, were regarded as composed of materials derived
almost entirely from the Derbyshire mountains, but with a slight
admixture, to the westward, of erratics derived from Scotland and
Cumberland. The latter were probably brought from those localities
by an ice-stream, the main materials of the deposits having been
transported from the Pennine chain by glaciers, and deposited in the
partially submerged valley of the Trent. The intermediate quartzose'
sand was deposited in the sea during an intercalated warmer age of
considerable submergence.
   The Middle Pleistocene deposits, distinguished from the earlier by
containing large quantities of chalk and <U+FB02>ints derived from the north

                           Geological Society.                       73
east, were apparently formed at a time when the level of the Trent
valley area was lower than that of the Cretaceous tracts in Lincoln
shire and Yorkshire. The Great Chalky Boulder-clay was chie<U+FB02>y
a ground-moraine formed beneath an ice_sheet on land, but in places
presented signs of aqueous origin. The Melton sand, below, in
which Cretaceous detritus <U+FB01>rst appeared in abundance, consisted of
strati<U+FB01>ed sands with occasional beds of gravel or loam, and indicated
a less extreme temperature. In West Sta<U+FB02>'crdshire the gravels and
 sends probably represented the entire Middle Pleistocene deposits,
 no great Chalky Boulder—clay being found, and in this area frag
 ments of marine mollusca were of frequent occurrence. The Chalky
 Gravel was also a marine deposit, and,-1ike the Melton Sand, was
 probably formed when the temperature was rather milder than it
 was during the deposition of the Great Chalky Boulder-clay.
    In the Newer Pleistocene epoch re-elevation of the Trent valley
 and of the Pennine chain appeared to have again produced a change
 in the direction from which the materials of the deposits were
 derived. The Interglacial Alluvium was of freshwater origin, but
 the admixture of Scotch and Cumbrian detritus with that derived
 from the Pennine range indicated that glaciers from the north
 again reached the Trent area. A colder age succeeded, during
 which the Later Pennine Boulder-clay was formed, partly of local
 materials, partly of erratics from the Pennine range, mixed with a
 few from Cumberland and even from Wales. This deposit was
  almost entirely unstrati<U+FB01>ed, and consisted largely of moraine detritus,
 the ice-sheets having disturbed and rearranged the earlier deposits
  and mixed them with rock-detritus from the neighbourhood. To
  this later ice-sheet was attributed the contortion so frequently
  observed in the older and middle Pleistocene deposits. Reasons
  were given for the opinion that such contortions were due to ice
  and not to soil-cap motions or their later agencies.

     Attention was called to the frequent occurrence of sandstone

 the <U+FB01>shermen’s “long lines.”      The evidence favours the idea that
  these rocks are in situ.
     A list of the specimens found, with bearings and distances, was
  given ; they consist of red, and sometimes grayish sandstones,
  mostly soft, also marls, “ potato stone,” and nodules of Triassic
  trap.   The af<U+FB01>nities are with the Keuper of Devon.       The position
  deduced from the observations is about 10 miles S.E. of the Lizard,
  and beyond the 30-fathom line.       This submarine outlier is larger
  than any outlier on the mainland of Devon or Cornwall, and carries
  the English Trias nearly 50 miles further to the S.W.

  Felsitic, and other Rocks in North-western Pembrokeshire.”           By
  Henry Hicks, M.D., F.R.S., F.G.S.

 74                       Geological Society :—
    In this paper the author gave the results obtained by him during
 a recent visit to N.W. Pembrokeshire. He stated that he had further
 examined some of the sections referred to in his previous papers, as
 well as others not therein mentioned, and that he had obtained many
 additional facts con<U+FB01>rmatory of the views expressed by him in those
 papers. The lower Cambrian conglomerates and grits, he said, con
tained pebbles of nearly all they rocks in that area which he had
 claimed as of pro-Cambrian age; and the fragments of the granitoid
rocks, the felsitic rocks, the halle<U+FB02>intas, and of the various rocks of
the Pebidian series which he had found, showed unmistakably that
those rocks had assumed, in all important particulars, their peculiar
 conditions before the fragments were broken 011'.
    Moreover, he stated that there was abundant evidence to show that
the very newest of the pre-Cambrian rocks of the area had been
greatly crushed, cleaved, and porcellanized, before any of the Cam
brian sediments Were deposited; hence he maintained that there
was in the area a most marked unconformity at the base of the
Cambrian.      At Chanter’s Seat, near St. David’s, he found that the
lower Cambrian grits and conglomerates were, in parts, almost
wholly made up of fragments of characteristic varieties of the
Granitoid rocks which form the Dimetian ridge near by.
    The so-called granite of Brawdy, Hayscastle, and Brimaston, he
said, there was good evidence to show, was probably' of the age of
the Granitoid rocks of St. David’s. The mass of so-called granite
near Newgale, he stated, was composed of rhyolites and breccias,
undoubtedly 0f pre-Cambn'an age.
    The Roch Castle and Trefgarn rocks, he stated, could not possibly
be intrusive in Cambrian and Silurian strata, but belonged to a
series of pro-Cambrian rocks. He referred to the important evidence
bearing on the age of these rocks given in a paper communicated to
the Society, since his last paper was read, by Messrs. Marr &
Roberts. These authors showed that in a quarry near Trefgarn
Bridge a Cambrian conglomerate, overlain by OZenus-shales, is to be
seen resting on the eroded edges of the Trefgarn series. The author
examined this section lately, and obtained from the Conglomerate
some very large pebbles of the characteristic rocks called hiille<U+FB02>intas,
and of the ash-bands, both of which are found in situ in the quarry.
He therefore maintained that there was the most ample evidence to
show that there was a great group of pro-Cambrian rocks exposed in
N.-W. Pembrokeshire, and hence that he had proved conclusively
that Dr. Geikie’s views in regard to these rocks, as given in his

western Pembrokeshire.” By Prof. T. G. Bonney, D.Sc., LL.D.,
F.R.S., F.G.S.
    The author stated that he had examined microscopically a series
of specimens collected by Dr. Hicks, and compared them with those
described by Mr. T. Davies, in vol. XI. of the Quarterly Journal, and
with some in his own collection. He agreed with Mr. Davies’s
conclusions in all important matters.         '

       0n the Glaciation of South Lancashire, Cheshire, é’rc.         75
   The Chanter’s-Seat conglomerate contained many grains of quartz
and felspar, curiously like those minerals in the so-called Dimetian,
together with numerous small rolled fragments, about a quarter of
an inch in diameter, exactly resembling the <U+FB01>ner-grained varieties
of that rock, besides bits of felsite, similar to some which occur in
the St. David’s district, quartzite, a quartz-schist, and an argillite.
   The rocks in situ in the Trefgarn quarry were indurated trachytic
ashes, together with the curious <U+FB02>inty rock which was the most
typical of the so-called h'alle<U+FB02>intas. One of the pebbles from the
overlying conglomerate perfectly corresponded with the lastmamed
rock, others appeared to be most probably from an altered trachytic
ash, differing only varietally from those in situ.
   After prolonged examination of this “halle<U+FB02>inta” of Trefgarn
and the similar rocks from Roch, he was of opinion that while it was
possible that some specimens might be altered ashes, most of them
were originally rhyolites or obsidians, devitri<U+FB01>ed, and then silici<U+FB01>ed
by the passage of water which had contained silica in solution.
The Trefgarn group obviously could not be intrusive in the lower
Cambrian, and it was extremely improbable that the Roch Castle
series was neWer than the basement conglomerate of that district.
   The Brawdy granitoid rock might be a granite, but at any rate it
presented considerable resemblance to the “ Dimetian.”
   It was therefore evident that the Cambrian conglomerate of St.
David’s was formed from a very varied series of rocks, some of them
much older than it, and that the Dimetiau could not be intrusive in
it. Moreover, even if the Dimetian should be proved ultimately to
be a granite, and the core of a volcano which had emitted the rhyo
lites, suf<U+FB01>cient time must have elapsed after its consolidation and
prior to the making of the conglomerate to remove, by denudation,
a great mass of overlying rock. Hence, whatever its nature, it was
pro-Cambrian.                                         '
   3. “On the Glaciation of South Lancashire, Cheshire, and the
Welsh Border.” By Aubrey Strahan, Esq., M.A., F.G.S., H.M.
Geological Survey. By permission of the Director General.
                Part I. South Lancashire and Cheshire.
   The average direction of the large number of glacial striae which
have been observed in the neighbourhood of Liverpool is N. 28° W.
Further up the Mersey there is a. slight de<U+FB02>ection towards the east.
Two instances only occur of striaa having a totally different direction,
namely E.N.E. The striae themselves seldom furnish any evidence
as to the direction in which the ice travelled, but the edges of the
strata have in many cases been bent back from the north-west.
The materials of which the drift is composed, both matrix and
included boulders, have also travelled from the north-west.          The
 sands and gravels also are arranged in long banks, trailing away
 from the south-west sides of the rock—hills, in such a way as to
 show that they are distributed by currents from the north—west.
 The striae are found in connexion with the Boulder-clays, in which
 the actual presence of ice is abundantly proved. Presumably the

  same agent that distributed the Boulder-clay, also striated the rock
  surface and moved from the north-west.
                       Part II. The Welsh Border.
     The striations within the Welsh Border also show a general
  parallelism, but in a direction E.N.E., the few exceptions that occur
  being close to the-Border. The direction in which the drift has
  been transported shows a corresponding change ; though analogous
 in arrangement to the Lancashire drift, it has all travelled from
 W.S.W. to E.N.E. The boundary between the northern drift of
 the English side, and the western drift of the Welsh runs approxi
 mately along the coast, bending inland here and there, and cutting
 inland across parts of South Flintshire and Denbighshire. The
 transportation of the Welsh drift has taken place across the lines of
 the principal hill-ranges and valleys. Occasionally the two drifts
 shade one into the other, or are mixed together; but as a general
 rule the far-travelled northern drift overlies the more local deposit,
 and is easily distinguishable by its different materials and by its
 being comparatively stoneless.
    It may be concluded that :—
    1. The striae on the English and Welsh sides respectively, while
 showing variations among themselves, by a marked preponderance
 in one quarter of the compass, indicate a direction of principal
 glaciation, this direction being on the English side from about
 N.N.W., and on the Welsh from about E.S.E.
    2. The direction of glaciation in both districts agrees very closely
 with that of the transportation of the drift, but is only locally
 in<U+FB02>uenced by the form of the ground.
    3. The striae are by no means universal, but are found almost
 exclusively in connexion with those beds in the drift which contain
 evidence of the actual presence of ice.
                      Part III. Origin of the Striw.
    The striae are not such as can have been produced by valley
glaciers; they go across and not down the valleys, nor are there
any moraines. The question resolves itself into (1) the hypothesis
 of two ice-sheets moving in different directions in the two areas;
(2) that of <U+FB02>oating ice. The <U+FB01>rst is opposed by the facts that the
rock—surface is not moutonnee on a large scale, and that the striae and
terminal curvature are far from universal; that the drifts associated
with the striae are marine deposits; that striae having different
directions are found on the same slab. The well-known occurrence
of gravel-ore in the drift at the outcrop of a vein is also against this
hypothesis. The marine origin of the drifts is indicated by their
well-marked strati<U+FB01>cation as a whole, by the alternations of well
washed sands and gravels with the Boulder-clays, and by the occur
rence through all the beds of marine shells. A lower or basement
clay is seen in places under this marine drift, but it is always the
latter with which the striae are associated. The great development
of undoubted marine beds and comparative rarity of moutonnée sur
faces constitutc the principal differences between this region and

           On the Volcanic Rocks of North-eastern Fife.              77
the north, where the existence of an ice-sheet has been strongly
advocated. Auglesey is considered by Sir A. Ramsay to have
received its con<U+FB01>guration by the action of an ice-sheet from the
north ; but its physical features appear to be due rather to its geo
logical structure, and to have existed in more or less their present
form in pre-glacial times.
    The arrangement of drifts in this district presents an analogy with
that of the Norfolk drifts, and probably results from a similar
sequence of events.                              v          >
    The marine drifts, from their great variability, seem to have been
 distributed, and the striations produced by <U+FB02>oating ice, driven by
 tidal or oceanic currents, during the time of submergence. During
 this time Snowdon and the surrounding hills must have stood well
 above water, forming an island-group, and by such a group the pre
 vailing currents from the north would be de<U+FB02>ected to the south
 west over Anglesey on the one side, and to the south-east over the
 plains of Cheshire and Shropshire on the other, while withinthe
 limits of the group a local circulation might be maintained.

    The following communications were read :—
    1. “On the Volcanic Rocks of North-eastern Fife.” By James
 Durham. Esq., F.G.S., with an Appendix by the President.
    After describing the general distribution of the volcanic rocks of
 Old Red-Sandstone and Carboniferous age in the counties of Forfar
 and Fife, the author called attention to a <U+FB01>ne section exhibited
 where the Ochil Hills terminate along the southern shore of the
 Firth of Tay. In immediate proximity to the Tay Bridge, a series
 of the later volcanic rocks, consisting of felstones, breccias, and
 ashy sandstones, are found let down by faults in the midst of the
 older porphyrites (altered audesites) which cover so large an area
 in the district. The breccias contain enormous numbers of blocks
 of a red dacite (quartz-andesite), and enclosed in this rock angular
 fragments of a glassy rock, resembling a “ pitchstone-porphyry,” are
 found, everywhere, however, more or less converted into a white
 decomposition—product. The youngest igneous rocks of the district
 are the bosses and dykes of melaphyre (altered basalt and dolerite)
 which have been often so far removed by weathering as to leave
 open <U+FB01>ssures.
    In the Appendix three very interesting rocks were described in
 detail.   The rock of the North<U+FB01>eld Quarry, which is shown to be
 an augite-andesite, has a large quantity of a glassy base with
 felted microlites, and contains large porphyritic crystals of a colour
 less augite. The rock of the Causewayhead Quarries is described
  as an enstatite-andesite ; it has but little glassy base, being made
  up of lath—shaped felspar crystals (andesine), with prismatic crystals
  and grains of a slightly ferriferous enstatite; there are no por
  phyritic crystals, but the enstatite individuals are sometimes
  curiously aggregated. The red porphyritic rock from the breccias
  near the Tay Bridge was shown to be a mica-dacite, and the glassy

rock associated with it to be the same material with a vitreous in
place of a stony base. This glassy base exhibits very beautiful
<U+FB02>uidal and perlitic structures. The crystals of <U+FB01>rst consolidation
in this rock are oligoclase and biotitc, often showing marks of
injury in transport ; those of the second consolidation appear to be
orthoclase. In conclusion, the successive stages by which the
andesitic rocks of the area were altered, so as to assume the cha
racters distinctive of porphyrites, were fully discussed, as well as the
change of the glassy rock into its white decomposition-product.
   2. “ On some Eruptive Rocks from the neighbourhood of St.
Minver, Cornwall.” By Frank Rutley, Esq., F.G.S.
   The rocks described in this paper were derived from Cant Hill,
opposite Padstow, and from a small quarry about half a mile from
Cant Hill, near Carlion. At the former locality the volcanic rocks
are much decomposed, but from their microscopic characters they
may be regarded as altered glassy lavas of a more or less basic type.
No unaltered pyroxene, amphibole, or olivine is to be detected in the
specimens described, but there is a considerable amount of secondary
matter which may include kaolin, serpentine, chlorite, palagonitic
substances, &0. There is evidence of <U+FB02>uxion-structure in some of
the sections; others are Vesicular, and the vesicles are usually <U+FB01>lled
with siliceous or serpentinous matter. The relation of these lavas
to the underlying Devonian slates was not ascertained. The rock
occurring near Carlion contains numerous porphyritic crystals of
 augite in which the crystallization is interrupted by the co-develop
ment of small felspar crystals, which appear, as a rule, to have been
converted into felsitic matter. Hmenite is also present in patches
which indicate a similar interrupted crystallization to that shown by
the augite. The rock has the mineral constitution of an augite
andesite, but since it is a holocrystalline rock, exception would be
taken by many petrologists t0 the employment of the term andesite.
The lavas of Cant Hill were also probably of an andesitic character,
 so that, so far as original mineral constitution is concerned. there is
some apparent justi<U+FB01>cation for the mapping of both of these rocks
as “ greenstone ” by the Geological Survey.
   3. “The Bagshot Beds of the London Basin.” By H. W. Monck
ton, Esq., F.G.S., and R. S. Herries, Esq., B.A.. F.G.S.
   The authors stated that their object was to describe more fully the
Lower Bagshot beds, and to disprove the view lately advanced by
Mr. Irving that, in certain places, the Upper Bagshots overlap the
Lower and rest directly on the London Clay. They described or
referred to a number of sections all round the main mass, beginning
at St. Ann’s Hill, Chertsey, where they considered that the mass of
pebbles and associated greensands must be referred to the Middle
Bagshot. The outliers near Bracknell and Wolc'mgham were shown
to consist of Lower and not Middle Bagshot, which does not appear
in the valley north of Wellington College.
   The Aldershot district was explained, and it was shown that the
beds there resting on the London Clay were Lower and not Middle

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              79
Bagshot, and the occurrence of fossils in the Upper Bagshot of that
district was recorded.
   The conclusions that the authors came to were, that a well-marked
pebble-bed was almost always present, marking the division between
the Upper and Middle Bagshots, but that there were other pebble
beds of a less persistent character occurring both in the Middle and
Lower Bagshot ; that the Lower Bagshots generally consist of false
bedded sands with clay laminae and no fossils except wood, whereas
the Upper Bagshots are rarely false-bedded, and are characterized by
 the absence of clay bands and the presence of marine fossils; and
that the Middle Bagshot is a well-marked series consisting of green
 sands and clays.
    They claimed, in conclusion, that there was no reason for disturb
ing the old reading of the district, and that there was no evidence of
 an overlap of the Lower Bagshots by the Upper.

     ABSOLUTE SPHERICAL ELECTROMETER.              BY M. LIPPMANN.
 THIS instrument consists essentially of an insulated metal sphere
      which is raised to the potential we desire to know. This sphere
 is constructed so as to divide into two hemispheres, which are
 movable in respect of each other, and which repel with a force
 equal to f when their system is electri<U+FB01>ed.
    It can easily be shown that f and V are in the very simple ratio
                                   f= 5V“.
    In order to have V it is suf<U+FB01>cient to measure f. This measure
 ment might be made by several methods; I have adopted the
 following :—
    In the <U+FB01>rst place, if the apparatus intended to measure f were
 external to the metal sphere, we should be obliged to put it so far
 off that its action had no disturbing in<U+FB02>uence on the distribution
 of the electricity. 1 have accordingly preferred to put the whole
 inside the electri<U+FB01>ed sphere itself, which is hollow.
    One of the hemispheres is <U+FB01>xed; the other, which is movable,
 is suspended by a tri<U+FB01>lar system, that is to say composed of three
 vertical wires of equal lengths. When repulsion is produced, the
 movable hemisphere can only be displaced parallel to itself; the
 three wires make then a small angle with their original vertical
 position ; a is measured by a method of re<U+FB02>ection by means of a
 mirror <U+FB01>xed to two of the wires *, and seen through a small aperture.
 It will be seen that if 10 is the weight of the movable hemisphere, we
 have
                                 f=p tan a ;
 and therefore
                               1) tan a=§V2.
    Hence it is suf<U+FB01>cient to know the weight 1) which is <U+FB01>xed; the
 value of the radius of the sphere is immaterial.
             I The apparatus was constructed by MM. Breguet.

  80            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
     In a second copy of the same instrument, which I have the
  honour to place before the Academy, the system of two'hemispheres
  is contained within a concentric spherical envelope, which is
  connected with the earth. This arrangement increases the
  sensitiveness of the instrument, and protects it from air-currents
  as well as from extraneous electrical in<U+FB02>uences.
     If a and b are the radii of the two concentric spheres, we have
  the formula
                                      2
                            P=é (b—_T)2V2.
    In this case we have a=3'9 centims., b=4'92, p=3'322 grams.
 Hence if we place a millimetre scale at 1 metre from the rule,
 we have for the value of the de<U+FB02>ection,
                             d=0'00373V’.
    If V is expressed in volts, we have
                            d=O'OOOOl4OVa.
    It is desirable to multiply optically the sensitiveness of the
 instrument by reading the de<U+FB02>ections with an ocular which
 magni<U+FB01>es 15 to 50 times.        This also diminishes in the same
 ratio the small deformation which the system of the spheres
 illsldergoes owing to the de<U+FB02>ection—Comptes Rendus, March 22,

       SIMPLE DEMONSTRATION OF THE ELECTRICAL RESIDUE
                           BY FR. STENGEB.
    If two strips of tinfoil are fastened at a suitable distance on a
glass tube which has been evacuated as completely as possible, and
are connected with the electrodes of an induction-coil, continuous
electrical currents are formed in the interior, and the gas becomes
intensely luminous. If, then, the two tinfoil rings are insulated,
the tube becomes luminous at frequent intervals, and frequently
for several minutes together. This doubtless arises from the for
mation of a residue on the sides of the glass. The experiment was
made in a far more striking manner as follows :—In a glass tube,
about 2 centim. in the clear, closed at one end, a thin metal foil
was introduced so that it covered about half the inner side.       A
wire soldered to this plate was hermetically sealed in the tube, and
was provided on the out-side with a small knob. Opposite the
metal cylinder a strip of tinfoil was fastened. This small Leyden
jar was then rare<U+FB01>ed as completely as possible, and hermetically
sealed. If this was charged from a small electrical machine for
ten or <U+FB01>fteen minutes the residual electricities could be discharged,
producing a bright illumination in the tube. This method of ren
dering visible very small quantities of electricity might possibly be
used in repeating in another form the experiments of Rowland and
Nichols*, on the formation of the residue in quartz and calc-spar,
which are of theoretical interest.—Wiedemann’s Annalen, No. 6,

  XI. The Law of Attraction amongst the Molecules of a Gas.
           By WILLIAM SUTHERLAND, M.A., B.Sc.*
 B] ANY hypotheses have been advanced as to the law of
       force prevailing among the molecules of a gas, chiefly
with a view to furnishing an explanation of part of the
departures from Boyle’s and Charles’s laws ; but, as they have
not started from a clear experimental basis, they have led to
no general result of any value. The clearest evidence which
has yet been given of the actual existence of attractive forces
amongst the molecules of gases was supplied by the di<U+FB02>icult
experiments conducted by Thomson and Joule between the
years 1852 and 1862, and described in their papers in the
‘ Philosophical Transactions ’ on the “ Thermal Effects of Fluids
in Motion.”      But of the two striking general conclusions
which they were able to draw from their experimental results,
no use has been made except that which they themselves made
in employing them to obtain an accurate expression of the
relations of volume, pressure, and temperature in the case of
air. The object of the present paper is to show that Thomson
and Joule’s experiments prove that the molecules of a gas
attract one another with a force inversely proportional to the
fourth power of the distance between them, and directly
proportional to the product of their masses. It is hoped, too,
that the attention of physicists will be recalled to the power
of Joule’s method in attacking the great problem of molecular
attractions in solids and liquids.

82         Mr. W. Sutherland on the Law of Attraction 4
   It will be remembered that Joule <U+FB01>rst attempted to get
evidence of the molecular attractions or repulsions in a gas
by allowing air to escape from under pressure in one vessel
into vacuum in another, and by measuring the difference of
temperature of the gas before and after. Stated as a general
method, capable of application to all bodies to measure the
alteration of their potential energy with the distance of their
molecules, it is this :——Allow the body to pass instantaneously
from one state to another without doing external work; the
heat developed is the thermal equivalent of the change of
potential energy. M. Edlund (Poggendmf, cxxvi.) made a
study of some metal wires in this manner, but they were
stretched, and of course the stretching had to be kept within
the elastic limits. The application of these experiments was
limited to the veri<U+FB01>cation of one or two thermodynamic
relations. To obtain anything closer than a <U+FB01>rst approximation
to the law connecting the potential energy and dimensions of
bodies, it would be necessary to subject liquids and solids to
pressures increasing to the greatest possible extent, and mea
sure their change of potential energy, when released, by the
thermal effect. This law once obtained, the deduction of the
law of force would be a pure question of mathematical analysis.
   Joule’s <U+FB01>rst method not proving delicate enough for the
case of gases, he joined Thomson in the series of experiments
referred to above.    Their method may brie<U+FB02>y be described
thus :—
   Colnpressed gas was allowed to expand through a porous
plug into the atmosphere. It was always brought to a
constant measured temperature on the high-pressure side
of the plug, and its temperature was taken on the low-pressure
side.   It was found to be cooled.  However, part of the cooling
effect could be traced to the departure of the gas from Boyle’s
law in this mannerz—A volume v’ of the compressed gas in
expanding through the plug to volume 0 would have work p'v'
done on it by the gas behind (p’ being the high pressure),
 while it would do work pv on the atmosphere in front. But
 in all gases except H, at about normal pressure and tem
perature, pv >10’v’. Hence, on the whole, the expanding gas
 does external work, and must accordingly draw on its supply
of heat and get cooled. The thermal equivalent of pv—p’e’
at about 15° was calculated by Thomson and Joule from known
 data for air and CO2, and was found to represent in the one
 case about a fourth, in the other about a third, of the actual
 cooling. The rest of the cooling effect is due to a gain of
potential energy by the molecules at the expense of their heat;
 in other, words, the molecules of the expanding gas separate

                   amongst the illolecules of a Gas.             83
against their mutual attractions.       The two important general
 results obtained were :'——                    -
    (1) The total cooling effect is directly proportional to the
 difference of the pressures on the two sides of the plug.
    (2) The total cooling effect is inversely proportional to the
 square of the absolute temperature of' the gas.
    Although Thomson and Joule estimated the thermal
 equivalent of pv —p’v’ at 15°, they did not calculate its values
at different temperatures and subtract them from the total
 cooling effect at the same temperatures, in order to get the
 parts of the cooling effect at these temperatures due to increase
of the potential energy of the molecules. When this is done,
 the cooling effect due to increased potential energy, which we
 shall call 6, is, like the total cooling effect in (1), directly
 proportional to the difference of the pressures on the two sides
 of the plug, because at a given temperature pv—p’11' is very
 nearly proportibnal to p—p’. But (2) does not now hold for
 0. In its place we have this result, that the cooling effect due
to increased potential energy is inversely proportional to the
absolute temperature :—

    In obtaining the values of pv—p'v’ for air, Van der Waals’s
 formula was employed,
            (p+'Ogf7)(v--0026)=1-0011(1 +6.0;

 unit of volume that occupied by a kilogramme of“ gas at 0° C.
 and a pressure of one metre of mercury; a is the coef<U+FB01>cient
'of expansion, and t the temperature Centigrade.
    Thomson and Joule give the cooling effects at different
 temperatures corresponding to difference of pressure of 100
 inches, or 2'54 metres of mercury; so that to get values of
pv—p'v’ corresponding to the same circumstances we must
 putp='76 m., 10': 3'3 m. A kilogramme of gas is supposed
 to pass through the plug. Changing to ordinary units and

   With the relation 90C%£I thus established, it is not
di<U+FB01>icult to see that it means that the attraction between any
two molecules of the gas is proportional to the product of their
masses, and inversely proportional to the fourth power of the
distance between them.
   For the mutual potential energy of the two molecules is
inversely proportional to the cube of the distance between

                 amongst the Molecules of a Gas.               85
them; or we maysay that the potential of a particle of
mass m at a point distant r from it is given by the equation
                             V=Ai’;.
                                    ’I‘
   Let us assume that the constant A is of such magnitude
that V becomes negligible for values of r greater than a certain \
length R, which corresponds to the radius of the sphere of
action considered in most molecular theories, R being a large '
multiple of the distance between a molecule and its nearest
neighbour and at the same time small compared to sensible
distances. R is of the order of magnitude of, say, the thickness
of a capillary <U+FB01>lm. Under these circumstances we can consider
each molecule as uniformly distributed through the small
region of space round it, which may be said to belong to it.
Then any one molecule P may be supposed to be gathered
into a particle at its centre, leaving the space which belongs
to it in the form of a spherical vacuum, while all the other
molecules have been spread out around it into a continuous
matter of uniform density p. To <U+FB01>nd the potential of a <U+FB01>nite
mass of gas at the centre of P, let us describe a cone of small
solid angle w with its vertex at P, and terminating at the
boundary of the gas AA’ ; it cuts off the small area an! on the
surface of' the vacuous sphere.     Then for the potential at P of
any element and distant r from P and of thickness d-r we have

 Hence we may write Apw log ; as equivalent to the above.
                                   1
    Hence for the potential of the <U+FB01>nite mass of gas round P1
 at the centre of P we can take that of the sphere of matter of
 radius L, which is,
                            41rAp log      '
    Hence for the mutual potential energy of the particle P
 and the whole mass of gas, we have
                           47rAmp log? ;
                                        1
and for the total potential energy of n molecules, leaving
out of count those so near the boundary thata sphere of radius
 L cannot be described about them so as to lie wholly in the
matter under consideration, we have,             0

changing from the numerical coefficient 4 to 2, because we
must not count the mutual potential energy of any two
particles twice over.
    If now the mass of gas is allowed to expand (in Thomson
and Joule’s experiments it expanded by various amounts up
to six times the original volume), the value of log; remains
                                                      1
practically constant, and the new value of the total potential
energy is
                          QwAnmp’ log     ,
                                        l
where p' is the density of the gas after expansion.
   Therefore the change of potential energy is proportional to
                             M (la—PI);    '
M being the mass of gas.             '
   Now the cooling effect corresponding to this will be obtained
by dividing the above by J Ms, where s is the speci<U+FB01>c heat of

                  amongst the Molecules ofa Gas.                87

    In the case of air .9 is practically constant, so that the
theoretical cooling is directl proportional to the difference of
pressures and inversely to t e absolute temperature.
    Thus the hypothesis of a force attracting according to the
law of the inverse fourth power and the product of the masses
yields the two results deduced from the experimental data.
     It may be worth while mentioning that ifthe case is worked
out for a very long cylinder of matter, attracting according
to the Newtonian law, treated as a very prolate spheroid and
 expanded into another cylinder of the same section treated also
 as a spheroid, results in accordance with the above experimental
 results may be obtained, but with a third result, that the
  cooling effect would be proportional to the sectional area of
 the cylinder. Thus if the time ever comes when it will be
 practicable to look for the part of the cooling effect due to the
 mutual gravitation of the molecules, it will be found as a
 small fraction of the whole cooling effect, varying with the
  sectional area of the plug.
     The only other gas on which Thomson and Joule conducted
  a suf<U+FB01>ciently extended series of experiments to obtain de<U+FB01>nite
  results was C02. They were able to enunciate the same two
  general results as for air, only the total cooling effects were
 not so accurately proportional to the inverse square of the
 temperature.     To evaluate the thermal equivalent of1m —p’v’
 at different temperatures for CO2, Clausius’ formula is used,

     The unit of pressure is that of a kilogramme per square
 metre, and v is the volume in cubic metres of a kilogramme
 of 002.
     But, in the <U+FB01>rst place, the formula shews how at a given
 temperature the value of12v —p’'u’ is very nearly proportional to
p—p', so that, as in the case of air, we can assert that the
 cooling effect due to increase of molecular potential energy is
 proportional to the difference of pressure on the two sides of
the plug.

   In passing from the value of12v —p'v' to the cooling effect
Pv-P'"
   J8 , which corresponds           to it, account has been taken of
the variation of s, the speci<U+FB01>c heat of 002, with temperature.
E. Wiedemann’s determinations ('1952 at 0° C.,'2169 at 100°,
'2837 at 200°) were adopted, the values at intermediate tem
peratures being obtained by interpolation. On reverting to
the theoretical conclusion, it will be seen that the cooling is
to be proportional to P _.  T;1 ; and as svaries with the temperature,
it will be necessary to test the theory by seeing whether the
product T98 (for the constant value 100 inches of mercury
for p—p’) is constant.

effects are Thomson and Joule’s experimental numbers (Phil.

   In the <U+FB01>rst of the above tables for 00,, the products T68
show decided enough departure from constancy ; in fact T208
would be nearly constant. The departure may be taken as
showing the great value which similar experiments conducted
on vapours compressed nearer and nearer to liquefaction and

                amongst the Molecules of a Gas.                 89
then allowed to expand, might possess. For in view of the
facts that at 0° C. CO, lique<U+FB01>es under a pressure of about 40
atmospheres, while at 45° there is required 100 atmospheres to
liquefy it, and that the pressure on the high-pressure side of
the plug, in the experiments from which the above numbers
were derived, reached 6 atmospheres, it becomes apparent
that at the low temperatures the forces which are ultimately to
produce cohesion in the liquid are hardly likely to be so closely
represented by the monomial expression           as at the high
temperatures. In fact, regarding the ultimate law of the action
of one particle on another at any distance as a function of r
of the form f       orf (1%), and considering the law of gravi
tation as simply the <U+FB01>rst term of the expansion of the latter in
ascending powers of $2, which expresses the action accurately
enough within the limits of astronomical distances, we may
look I upon Thomson and Joule’s experiments on air as
showmg how the second term, involving the inverse fourth
power of 1', becomes appreciable at very small distances ; in
the case of CO, we may regard the above table as showing
how the term I}, may begin to be appreciable, and how perhaps
at still smaller distances still higher terms may appear and
become predominant in producing cohesion and elasticity.
    There remains one application of our theory which throws
an interesting light on a fact to which Thomson and Joule drew
attention more than once as being very remarkable.         When
a mixture of the two gases, C02 and air, is expanded through
a plug, it might be expected that each would contribute its
proportion of cooling effect according to its own amount and
its thermal capacity. But such is far from being the case.
 Indeed, experiment showed that the cooling effect for pure 0
 is greater than for pure N, and yet in air and other mixtures
of the two gases the cooling effect is less than in either of the
 constituents under the same circumstances.                   '
    Let Vl be the volume of a mixture of two gases before ex
pansion, Vg the volume after. Let VA" V3,, be the volumes
of the two constituent gases A and B before expansion ; VA”
 V3,, the volumes after. Suppose that there are a molecules

We must <U+FB01>rst make a hypothesis as to the action of a molecule

where C is a constant.
   Then for the mutual potential energy of all the molecules

                                          1
where pAl means the density of the gas A when its a mole
cules are distributed through a volume V1. Similarly for
the mutual potential of the molecules of B before expansion
we have

the value of 1*, being the same in each expression, because,
according to Avogadro’s law, the molecules of different gases
under the same circumstances own equal volumes of space.
Leaving the quantity L of the same value in both expressions,
amounts to asserting that the molecular forces in the two
gases are quantities of the same order of magnitude. For
the mutual potential energy of a molecule of' A and one of B
before expansion we have
                     471'C ME m'pAl log 1J— ;

                    47rC VH3 bm'pA‘ log 1
   But by proceeding in the other order, that is by writing
down the mutual potential of the h particles of B and one of
A and then summing for the a particles, we would obtain
                     41rC ME ampB log g1.

are distributed through a volume V2.
    Then for the increase of potential due to expansion we have
   Aam(pAI-—pA2) + B bm'(pBg—pBl) + 20 MAI—3 bm'(pA2—pA‘).
    Now the last term in this has the same value as
                      20 “E am(pBa—pBl);
so that it may be replaced by the square root of the pro
 duct of the two, namely
               20 s/AB am bm'(pB,—pBl)(pAq—pAl).
    Hence for the increase of potential energy we have the
sum of the two expressions Aam(pA2—pAl) ; Bbm'(pBg—pBl) ;
 and C times twice the product of their square roots.
    Now suppose that V, is the volume of the mixture at a
pressure P1; V2 at a pressure P2; the temperature T being
 the same in each case. Then pA, is to the density of the gas A
 at pressure P, in the ratio VVAl, and pA, is to the density of
                                   l
 the gas A at pressure P, in the ratio 2‘2, which is equal to
                                              2

 written

 where 8A is the speci<U+FB01>c heat of A.
    For the other terms in the gain of potential by the mixed
gases we can write corresponding expressions, and get for
the result,

    To obtain the cooling effect corresponding to this we must
<U+FB01>rst divide by J, and then by the thermal capacity of the

92               Mr. W. Sutherland on the Law of Attraction
mass operated on, which is
                              SAPAVA, + SBPBVBf
    Therefore for the cooling effect 0 of the mixture we have
       0 jAPAV—TQA             v2 + 2O’\/34PA

                           SAPAVA, + SBPBVB;
    To show with this formula how the cooling for a mixture of O
and N may be less than for either of the gases alone under the
same circumstances, let us suppose that 6 is less both than 6A
and 03 ; we will see whether the supposition leads to a possible
or impossible conclusion.
    Let us denote
     %‘_I by D, and ‘%l by D', remembering that D + D'=1 ;

    Then the supposed inequalities become

    If C: 1, this becomes, since D + D’ = 1,

which is possible. If G is less than 1, the inequalities can also
still exist together.
    Thus that the cooling effect for a mixture of two gases
should prove less than that for either of the constituents has
been shown to be a possible consequence of the theory of
molecular attractions.                        ‘
    By means of Thomson and Joule’s experimental numbers
for mixtures of air and CO5, in different proportions, we propose
<U+FB01>nally to calculate the values of C obtainable from the cooling

                 amongst the Molecules of a Gas.               93
effects in di<U+FB01>'erent mixtures and see whether they agree ; that
is, whether our theory can be tested by its power to explain
with any exactness a very peculiar experimental fact.
    There are no systematized experimental results by means
of which the value of'pv for different mixtures of air and 002
at different temperatures could be obtained directly ; but the
following argument will show that we can make use of our
previous numbers for the values of1012 —p’o’ at different tem
peratures in the case of air and 002, to deduce the numbers for
any mixture of air and 002 at the same temperatures. Let V1
be the volume of a mixture of the two gases at a certain tempera
ture and a pressure P]; as before, let VA], VBl be the volumes
which the constituent gases in V1 would occupy if separated
at pressure P1. Let W1 be the potential energy of the mixed
gases WA, WBl of the two separated gases ; then actually to
 separate t e two gases will require work,
                         Wl—WAl—Wbl.
    Expand the separated gases to a condition represented by
 suf<U+FB01>x 2, just as they were expanded in Thomson and Joule’s
 experiments, that is without doing external work other than
 that corresponding to the values ofpa —-p'v’ for each gas ; thus
 each of the separated gases would be cooled by the amount
        / I
f-"Tfl, previously calculated, and each would be cooled by
 its respective amount 0A or 0B, on account of the separation
 of molecules ; so that altogether the gain of potential energy
 during the expansion will be the sum of JsAQA and JsBQB and
 the two corrections pv—p’v'. Thirdly, allow the gases to
 diffuse into one another.     In this case the work required
 will he
                       —W2+ WA1+WB£
 Hence the total gain of potential energy by the mixed gases
 on expanding from volume V1 to V2 is
       Wl—WAx—Wnx— W2+WA2+W32+J8A6A+JSBGB
                           +(P1VA1— P1VA‘1)+(P1VB —P2VB,) ;
 but           WAl—WA2=J8A6A;        WEI—WBI=JsBQB.
 So that the total gain reduces to
           VVl—W2 +(P1VA1—P2VA2) +(P1VBl—P2VB),
 and this corresponds to the total actual cooling effect observed
  by Thomson and Joule. The cooling effect denoted above by
  6 is the equivalent of Wl—W2; to obtain 0 then from the

  94           Mr. W. Sutherland on the Law of Attraction
  experimental numbers we have to subtract from them the
 cooling effects corresponding to the terms (EVA-EVA“).
     Given that a volume VA l of air is cooled by EAT—<U+FB02>,
 and that a volume VB1 of CO, is cooled by                   1m,we LB
  have for the cooling effect in the mixture :—
         1 ((PIVA, _ P2V4,)VA,PA + ‘P1VB,_ PQVB,)VB,PB)

     In this manner the pv—p’v' part of the cooling effect of
 the mixed gases has been calculated from the previously found
  values for pure air and 002.
     The table below contains in the <U+FB01>rst column the percentages
 of' the two gases in the particular mixture ; the second contains
 the temperature (absolute) T at which the gas escaped ,- the
 third contains the total actual cooling effect for a difference of
 pressure of 100 in. or 2'54 metres of mercury, observed by
 Thomson and Joule (Phil. Trans. 1862) ; the fourth contains
 the calculated values of the above expression for the cooling
 effect to be subtracted; the <U+FB01>fth contains the cooling efi'ect 0
 obtained by subtracting the numbers in the fourth column
 from those in the third ; while the sixth contains the values of
 0 obtained by substituting the corresponding values of 0 in

    The agreement betvveen these values of G calculated from
different mixtures at different temperatures is very fair, espe
cially if the value '57 is left out of the count as being evidently
affected by some error in the'experiment from which it is de

  1'1 can hardly be right when the percentage of CO, has been
  increased from 32 to 38. Thus we can regard the experiments
  on mixed gases as furnishing con<U+FB01>rmation of the truth of the
  law of the inverse fourth power for the attractions between
  molecules of gas.
     The value of C which we have obtained for air and CO,
  (mean 17) throws an interestin light on a certain aspect of
  the phenomenon of diffusion. Suppose a volume VA ofa gas
  A containing a molecules, and a volume VB of another gas B
  containing b molecules, separated byan in<U+FB01>nitely thin partition,
  then the potential energy of the two masses of gas is (leaving
  out common factors)
                            AampA + Bbm'pB.
     When the gases are mixed together without change of
  pressure we can see from what has gone before that the
  potential becomes

      If C: 1 this is a complete square, and therefore necessarily
   positive; therefore when C='7 the expression is also positive,
   and for all values of U less than I it must be positive; that is,
   the potential energy of the molecules diminishes by diffusion.
   Hence we may regard diffusion as partly due to the tendency
   of the molecules of the mixing gases to obey the dynamical
   principle that a position of stable equilibrium is a position of
   minimum potential energy. Diffusion is motion towards the
   position of stable equilibrium for the two gases.
      However, the kinetic factor in the diffusion of gases is so
   predominant that this aspect is not of much importance. But
   in the case of liquids it is otherwise, and the form of our last
   expression suggests how the tendency of some liquids to mix
   and of others to refuse to mix may depend on the magnitude
   of a coef<U+FB01>cient like C. Indeed, the study of- the cooling effect
   of liquids and mixtures of liquids escaping from under pressure
   affords a splendid <U+FB01>eld for experimental inquiry. This paper
   will have possessed some value if it draws the attention of
   those who have facilities for such a research, to a <U+FB01>eld whose
   further exploration on the tracks of the pioneers must open
   valuable ground for Physical Science.

XII. New Instrument for continuously recording the Strength
   and Direction of a Varying Electric Current. By R. SHIDA,
   ME., Professor of Natural Philosophy in the Imperial
   College of Engineering, Tokio, Japan.

         T0 Sir William Thomson, F.R.S., LL.D., do.
   DEAR Sm WILLIAM,                   ‘
I ENCLOSE herewith a paper which I have just drawn up
      and which is a description of a new instrument I have
devised and constructed for continuously recording the strength
and direction of a varying electric current.     My chief aim in
designing such an instrument was to use it for making obser
vations of both regular and irregular variations of earth
currents which are present in the telegraph-wires of this
country, just as they are present in the telegraph-wires of any
other country. The importance of carrying on careful ob
servations of earth-currents has been felt more and more since
glou showed it before the Society of Telegraph Engineers and
  lectricians, about eleven years ago, in your presidential
address. Indeed, so great an importance is now attached to
such observations, that it was one of the main subjects discussed
by the International Electric Congress which met at Paris last
year. Now, since both regular and irregular earth-currents are
so variable, that their strength and direction change, not only
from day to day, but from hour to hour, or from minute to '
minute, or even from second to second, observations will be of
very little value unless they are continuously made ; hence the
importance of a method of continuously registering the strength
and direction of varying electric currents. The photographic
method, such as is used in the Kew Observatory, is, of course,
very satisfactory and accurate. But this method, besides
requiring an elaborate arrangement of several pieces of appa
ratus, has a serious disadvantage, namely, that the observations
must be made in a dark room. I have therefore felt for a
long time the want of a method which, though not so' accurate
as the photographic method, is simple and convenient. It
was thus that I was led to devise the apparatus described in
the accompanying paper.
   As will be seen from the description given in the paper, the
galvanometer-part of the apparatus is, in the main, the same
as that of the more recent one of your Siphon Recorders ;
that is to say, a coil containing a great number of turns of
<U+FB01>ne wire is suspended in a strong magnetic <U+FB01>eld produced by

      Strength and Direction of a Varying Electric Current.     97
  permanent magnets. There is, however, one point in the
  apparatus which is quite new, at least quite new to my know
  ledge: that is, that the advantage is taken of a singular pro
  perty of matter, “ surface-tension of liquids.” We know very
  well that a mercury-drop is often used for the purpose of
  making and breaking an electric circuit. But nobody has
  used a water-drop or an acidulated-water drop for the same
  purpose. The advantage of a water-drop over a mercury
  drop, when employed for opening and closing an electric
  circuit, is that the former offers a far smaller resistance than
  the latter to the moving body which comes in contact with it.
 Now, in the instrument I am speaking of, a water-drop or,
 what is equivalent to it, a thin column of water drawn up
  between two narrow plates partly immersed in water, is used
  for the purpose of 'making and breaking the circuit, as will
 be seen from the description given in the pa or.
     For the further details of the apparatus      ask you to be
 good enough to refer to the paper itself.
     The Instrument, I might mention, may of course be used
 as a “ coulombmeter,” becausesince in the paper ribbon, on
 which a record is obtained, the abscissas represent times and
 the ordinates represent currents, the area included by (the
 abscissa) the line of no current, and the ordinates correspond
ing to any two times and the curve of current, represents the
quantity of electricity passed through the apparatus during
 the interval between the two times.

 ONE of the principal subjects discussed by the International
 Electric Congress held in Paris in 1884, was that of Earth
currents; and the result of the Congress as regards earth
 currents was “that the Conference expresses the wish that
observations of earth-currents be pursued in all countries.”
 This resolution, together with the others, has been communi
cated to the various Governments ; and our Government
having conformed to the wish of the Conference, it was decided
that the observations of earth-currents be made by the Tele
graph Department, in which I am a chief engineer. It thus
   evolved on me to take the subject up. A little consideration,
suggested by the results of preliminary observations I have
made of earth-currents, revealed to me that in order to carry
out systematic observations of earth-currents, which, from
time to time, vary in strength and direction, it is almost
necessary, or at least extremel       convenient, to have at our
disposal a simple instrument w ich will continuously record

 98 Prof. H. Shida on a new Instrument for recording the
 the strength and direction of a varying electric current. In
  view of this, I have designed and constructed an instrument
 the description of which I have now the pleasure of communi
  cating. In order that an instrument‘may continuously record
 a varying electric current, it is necessary that it should ful<U+FB01>l
 the two following conditions :—
     1. That the motion of the needle of the galvanometer (which
 is a part of the instrument) be such that the same position of
 the needle always corresponds to the same strength of current,
 that is to sa that the motion be non-oscillatory.
  - 2. That e position of the needle of the galvanometer at
 any moment be recorded.
       shall <U+FB01>rst explain generally how these two conditions are
 satis<U+FB01>ed in the new instrument I am going to describe.
    As regards the <U+FB01>rst condition. This condition is satis<U+FB01>ed
 by having a galvanometer whose needle consists of a coil of
 <U+FB01>ne wire suspended in a powerful magnetic <U+FB01>eld, after the
 manner of the Siphon Recorder of Sir William Thomson. It
 is easy to show mathematically that in the case of an ordinary
 galvanometer, which consists of a magnetic needle suspended
 inside, or in the neighbourhood of a coil of wire, this condition
 cannot conveniently be ful<U+FB01>lled without diminishing its sensi
 bility. On the other hand, in the case of a ,galvanometer
 consisting of a coil hung in a strong magnetic eld as above
described, it is easy to obtain a great sensibility and, at the
same time, a non-oscillatory motion of the needle, as will be
seen from the following investigations :—
    Let a be the angle of de<U+FB02>ection of the cell at any time t,
and let T be its period of oscillation when no current is
circulating through it ; then we have for the equation of the
motion                    _ d2“  4,,2
    But when a current circulates through the coil, the equation
of the motion will be altered owing to a retardation of the
motion due to the current induced in the coil. Let us consider
the magnitude of this retardation. If I be the intensity of
the magnetic <U+FB01>eld which the coil occupies at time t, A the
area included in all the turns of the coil, and if we neglect
the self-induction of the coil on itself (which I think we can
con<U+FB01>dently do) ; then, plainly, N, the number of lines of force
which pass through the coil at time t, is
                          N: IA sin a ;
hence                    dN           'da
                        Ft =IA (Elsaa-t.

    Strength and Direction of a Varying Electric Current.      99
    But (2—? is the E.M.F. due to the inductive action ; hence,
if R be the resistance of the circuit and abe small, the cur
rent induced in the coil at any time t, is approximately
                            as a
                          c— R . dt.
    Now the couple or torque due to the action of the <U+FB01>eld on
the circuit is cIA ; and therefore the retardation of the
angular velocity of the coil at any time t is
                            12A2 (in
                             pR ' dt’
 where a is the moment of inertia of the coil.    Hence we have,
for equation of the motion of the coil,
                    d’a  12A2 do:    41:"
                    dt2+fbR 'dt+T”“_0'                     '
    The motion represented by this equation will be oscillatory
 or non-oscillatory according as 27r/T is greater or less than
 I2A2/2pB, so that in order to make the motion of the coil
 non-oscillatory, all that is necessary is to have the magnetic
 <U+FB01>eld so strong that I2 4i; -
     Now as regards the second condition.      The method com
  monly used of recording the motion of the needle of a galva
  nometer is the photographic method, which is, undoubtedly,
  very satisfactory. But this method, besides requiring an
  elaborate arrangement of several pieces of apparatus, has a
  serious disadvanta e, namely that the observations must be
  made in a darkened room.      The method adopted in the new
  instrument is one which, though, perha s, not so accurate as
  the photographic method, ossesses the a vantage ofbeing very
  simple and convenient.      n this method, which may be called
  the electrical method, there are several electrical circuits,
  each of which is closed when, and only when, the coil or the
  needle comes to a certain de<U+FB01>nite position corresponding to
  it, and each circuit, when closed, makes a mark on a moving
   paper ribbon chemically prepared, somewhat in the same way
   as in the Bain’s Telegraphs. If the coil turns round in one
   direction, it successively closes those circuits which make
   marks on one side of the centre of the ribbon, and if in the
   opposite direction, those circuits which make marks on the
   other side; and further, the distance of the mark from the
   centre of the ribbon is greater or less according as the turning
   round of the coil is greater or less.

100    Prof. H. Shida on a new Instrument for recording the
   How these electrical circuits are exactly arranged will be
seen later on with reference to the diagrams of the actual
instrument. At present it suf<U+FB01>ces to explain how the coil or
needle closes each electrical circuit separatel , and without its
motion being being checked or impeded.           is is effected by
taking advantage of one of the well-known properties of
matter, “ surface-tension of liquids.” When a capillary tube
is partly immersed in a liquid which wets the tube, like water,
the liquid ascends in the tube, and the smaller the diameter
of the tube the reater the height to which the liquid ascends,
and vice versd. n fact, it can be shown that if 6 be the angle
of capillarity, r the radius of the tube, w the weight of unit
volume of the liquid, T the surface-tension per unit length of
the liquid in contact with air, then h, the height to which the
liquid rises, is
                           _I    2T cos 0

But the liquid is drawn up in the same way in the space
between two parallel lates. In this case, if dbe the distance
between two plates, t en

which shows that the height to which a liquid rises between
two parallel plates is equal to the height to which it rises in
a tube whose radius is equal to the distance between the
Plates.
   Imagine now that there is a large number of capillary
arrangements, each consisting of two very narrow plates
standing in a vessel containing water at small distances from
one another, and arranged in an arc of a circle, while the
needle of the galvanometer is disposed in such a manner that,
as it turns round, it successively comes in contact with the
column of water drawn up between the plates of each of those
capillary arrangements and thus closes several circuits in
order; or else, that there is one such capillary arrangement,
while the needle carries a large number of points so disposed
that, when it turns round, these points successively come in
contact with the column of water in the capillary arrange
ment, and thus close several circuits in order. Either of
these arrangements affords us the means of closing each
circuit separately, and without the motion of the needle being
checked. In the new instrument the latter plan is used, as
will be more clearly seen with reference to the diagrams
 (Plates II. and 111.).
   Having now explained brie<U+FB02>y the principles upon which

    Strength and Direction of a Varying Electric Current.       101
the action of' the apparatus depends, I shall proceed to describe
the construction and action of the apparatus. Fig. 1 (P1. II.)
shows the general view of the apparatus ; while <U+FB01> s. 2, 3, and 4
 (Pl. III.) shows the details of the arrangement of t e coil, mag
net, &0. N and S are the poles of a powerful horseshoe magnet
consisting of a bundle of square bar-magnets made of very hard
tempered steel. Between the poles N and S there is sus
pended,by means of a <U+FB01>ne silk thread, a coil (0) , which contains
a great many turns of a very <U+FB01>ne insulated wire, and whose
plane is at right angles to the line joining the two poles of
the magnet; m is a piece of soft iron <U+FB01>xed inside the coil,
nearly lling, but nowhere touching, it, and serves to intensify
the magnetic <U+FB01>eld in which the coil hangs. When an electric
current passes, the coil tends to turn round a vertical axis in
one direction, or in the opposite direction, according as the
current is positive or negative. The two wei hts, w, to,
hanging from the coil can slide up and down t e inclined
plane         These weights resist the tendency of the coil to turn
round caused by the passage of a current through it, and serve
to bring the coil to its original position when the current
ceases. The cords by which these weights are suspended
pass through small holes in a piece of brass         , whose dis
tance from the coil can be varied by moving it up and down
along the vertical plane (P’), and thus the sensibility of the
apparatus can be altered. The strength of the <U+FB01>eld is so great
that the motion of the coil caused by the passage of a current
is almost non-oscillatory.
   Attached to the coil (C) there is a thin circular disk of
ebonite (D), whose axis coincides with the vertical axis about
which the coil is free to turn, so that any angular motion of the
coil causes exactly the same angular motion of the disk. This
disk carries, on its underside and near to a portion of its
circumference, a number of platinum teeth, t, t, t, &c.
Directly underneath these teeth, and rigidly <U+FB01>xed to the
framework of the instrument, is a vessel (V), containing
acidulated water, and in this vessel is provided a capillary
arrangement which consists of two very narrow platinum
plates p 1) (<U+FB01>g. 3) (which shall, hereafter, be called capillary
plates), standing vertically up, side by side, from the central
part of the vessel, and drawing up the water of the vessel be
tween them. The position of these capillary plates, when
everything is in its normal position, is such, that the platinum
tooth midway between the ends of the series I . . .t is in con
tact with the column of water between the capillaig' plates,
and that when the coil, and therefore the disk, is de ected to
the right or left, the other platinum teeth on the left or right

 102     Prof. R. Shida on a new Instrument for recording the
 successively come into contact with the column of water be
tween the capillary plates. Every time any one of the platinum
teeth comes in contact with the water, it closes an electric
 circuit (to be described) corresponding to it, so that these
platinum teeth may be called “ circuit-closers.”
    (L) is a cylinder of wood lacquered all over. It is covered
 with platinum sheet, and on this sheet is rolled a ribbon of
 white paper nearly as wide as the length of the cylinder. A
 portion of this cylinder is in the rectangular box (B), which
 contains a chemical solution, consisting of ferrocyanide of
 potassium, nitrate of ammonium, and water mixed in a
certain pro ortion. Further, the cylinder (L) is made to
 revolve wit uniform velocity by means of a clockwork
arrangement placed inside the box (H). Thus the paper on
the cylinder, as it rotates, comes out moistened with the
chemical solution. Bestin on the cylinder (L), and <U+FB01>tting
tightly in a rod of ebonite gr), there are a number of platinum
needles n, n, n, 850.; these needles may be called “mark
ing-needles,” for, if an electric current passes between any of
these platinum needles and the revolving paper, a bluish mark
is made on the paper directly underneath that needle.
    These marking-needles are electrically connected, each to
each, with the circuit-closers in order, there being as many
needles as there are circuit-closers; that is to say, the <U+FB01>rst
needle (on the right or left) is in connection with the <U+FB01>rst
circuit-closer (on the right or left), the second needle with
the second circuit-closer, the third with the third, and so on.
The small terminal screws, a, a, a, &c., on the ebonite
plate (E), which is <U+FB01>xed to the framework of the apparatus,
and also the screws, 6, b, b, &c., are provided for facilita
ting these connections. The exceedingly <U+FB01>ne wires (insulated)
connect the screws a, a, a, &c., with the circuit-closers,
and they all hang down from the screws in the form of spiral
sprin s, meeting together in the common axis of the disk (D),
and t e coil (C), and thence go to the circuit-closers ; so that
it is to be understood that the resistance these wires offer to
the motion of the disk and coil is so small as to be negligible.
   Now, the platinum sheet on the cylinder (L) is in connec
tion with one pole (Z) of the battery (CZ), by means of a pla
tinum spring (s) resting on it; while the other pole (C) of
the battery is in connection with the capillary plates (see <U+FB01>g.
3).    Consequently, when there is no current passing through
the coil, the positive current <U+FB02>ows from the copper pole of
the battery through the capillary plates, and the circuit-closer
in the centre, and thence through the corresponding marking
needle (the centre one), rotating paper, and platinum sheet,

     Strength and Direction of a Varying Electric Current.      103
  and back to the zinc pole of the battery, making a, blue mark
  on the rotating paper just underneath that needle ; while if
  a current passes through the coil it is de<U+FB02>ected to the right
  or left according to the direction of the current, the circuit
  closers on the left or right of the centre successively coming
  into contact with the column of water between the capillary
  plates in order, the result being that the correspondin needles
  make blue marks on the rotating paper. But since t e paper
  revolves with uniform velocity, it is evident that the longer the
  time of contact between a circuit-closer and the water between
  the capillary plates, no matter which circuit-closer it is, the
  longer the length of the mark on the paper underneath the
  needle corresponding to that circuit-closer ; and the shorter
  the shorter.                                                      '
     From the preceding description it will be clear that when
  an electric current, varying from time to time in strength
  and direction, passes through the coil (C), we shall get a curve
  made up of dots, or of dots and lines, on the moving paper
  ribbon, the nature of the curve determining the strength and
  direction of the current at any moment. Fig. 4 shows one
' of such curves experimentally obtained by allowing a varying
  current to pass through the coil. Now since the motion of
  the paper ribbon is uniform, it is easy to <U+FB01>nd out the point
  in the curve, or the position of the coil, corresponding to
  any moment; and since the motion of the coil is non-oscil
  latory, each position of the coil corresponds to a. certain
  de<U+FB01>nite strength of current, which can easily be determined
  by a simple experiment. So that by an examination of the
  curve thus obtained, it is easy to <U+FB01>nd out what was the strength
  of the current passing through the coil at any moment.
     To give a rough idea of the sensibility of the apparatus, it
  may be mentioned that when the record shown in <U+FB01>g. 4 was
   obtained the apparatus was at its ordinary sensibility, which
   was such, that the superior and inferior limits of the current
   which it could record were respectively about 4 milliamperes
   and % of a milliampere. But of course the sensitiveness of the
   apparatus can be varied within a considerable range in very
   much the same way as in Thomson’s Siphon Recorder.
      One defect of the instrument, it may be argued, is the fact
   that it does not record any current which produces such a
   de<U+FB02>ection of the coil that no one of the circuit-closers is in
   contact with the water between the capillary plates. This
   defect, however, is not a very serious one, for since the in
   strument is intended to be used for recording varying currents
   which give rise to a curve made up of dots, or of dots and
   lines, on the moving paper ribbon, it is easy, by examining

104       Prof. W. Ostwald’s Electrochemical Researches.
the positions of dots and lines, to complete the curve to a
 certain degree of approximation. If, however, a reater
accuracy be needed, all we have to do is to diminish tlie an
gular distance between the circuit-closers, and to increase
their number.       In the next instrument to be made, I am going
to introduce a few improvements, of which the most important
is the mode of arranging the circuit-closers and capillary
plates. Instead of having the circuit-closers movable with
the coil, and capillary plates <U+FB01>xed, we may arrange so that
the capillary plates move with the coil, while the circuit-closers
are kept stationary ; and by this means, it is possible to di
minish the angular distances between the circuit-closers, and
to increase their number without increasing the moment of
inertia of the needle, and thus to obviate the above defect to
a great extent, and, at the same time, to give to the instrument
a greater sensibility.                           '
  XIII. Electrochemical Researches. By W. OSTWALD, Pro
      fessor of Chemistry in the Polytechnic School, Riga".
ALL reactions of acids, dependent on the characters, rather.
         than on the nature of the constituents, of the acids,
occur with an intensity which is different in each case, but is
always proportional to an af<U+FB01>nity-constant which is itself
dependent only on the character of the acid and not at all on
the nature of the reaction. This fundamental fact, which
throws new light on the old conception of af<U+FB01>nity-constants,
has been proved by the author for various reactions ; viz. the
formation of salts in aqueous solutions, the actions of acids on
insoluble salts, the change of acetamide into ammonium ace
tate, the catalytic decomposition of methylic acetate, and the
inversion of cane-sugar’r. These reactions, some of which
are statical and others kinetical, led to the same numerical
values for the affinity-constants of the acids examined.
    Adopting Clausius’s theory of electrolysis, and Williamson’s
theory of chemical change, a distinct connection must exist
between the reactions of acids and the electrical conductivity
 of these acids~ The theory of Williamson supposes that a
 continual exchange of atoms is occurring among the reacting
 molecules; the velocity of a chemical action must therefore
 depend on the velocity of the atomic interchanges. The theory
 of Clausius says that electrolytic conduction is effected so
 that the free ions continually displace equivalent elements or
   * Abstract of Prof. Ostwald’s recent work, prepared by himself, and
communicated by M. M. Pattison Muir, Cambridge.

          Prof. W. Ostwald’s Electrochemical Researches.            105
radicles from the molecules, and that the parts of molecules
set free again change places with others. The more fre
quently the ions can interchange the more rapidly will elec
tricity be conducted, because the electricity can only pass
along with the ions.        Now as, according to Faraday s law,
the ions always transmit the same quantity of electricity
independently of their chemical character, it must be con
cluded from the theories of Clausius and Williamson that the
velocities of reactions taking place under the in<U+FB02>uence of
acids must be proportional to the velocities with which the
acids transmit equal quantities of electricity, i. e. to the elec
trical conductivities of the acids".
    This inference from the theories of Williamson and Clausius
has been veri<U+FB01>ed by the author, by a series of measurements
 of the electrical conductivities of acids the velocities of reac
 tions of which he had already determined ; the chief reactions
 in questionwere the catalytic decomposition of methylic acetate
 and the inversion of cane-sugar. The following Table (p. 106)
 presents the results. Columns 1. and II. give the velocities
 of the reactions referred to that of hydrochloric acid as 100 ;
 the numbers hold good for solutions containing respectively
 4} and % equivalents, in rammes, in 1000 cubic centimetres.
 Columns 111., IV., and . give the electrical conductivities,
 determined by the method of Kohlrausch, referred to that of
 hydrochloric acid as 100 ; the numbers in 111. apply to
 normal solutions containing one gram-equivalent in 1000 cubic.
 centim.; in IV., to 115 normal; and in V., to <U+FB01>n; normal
 solutions.
     These numbers show that the electrical conductivities of the
 acids in the table are proportional to the velocities of the
 change of methylic acetate into methylic alcohol and acetic
 acid, and the inversion of cane-sugar, brought about by these
 acids. The differences between the actual numbers in columns
 1., 11., 111., and columns IV. and V., may be explained by
 the occurrence of secondary actions among the <U+FB01>rst products
 (methyl alcohol, acetic acid, inverted sugar) of the two changes,
 measurements of the velocities of which were made. But
  determinations of the electrical conductivities of the acids are
  entirely free from the in<U+FB02>uences of secondary changes. By
  means of these determinations accurate values may be found
  for the af<U+FB01>nity-constants of the acids. These values are as
  important in the theory of chemical af<U+FB01>nity as the values of
  the equivalent weights of the elements are in Sto'ichiometry.
    * This conclusion has been already stated by Arrhenius (Bigh. till. V.
  Svensk. Ak. Hand. 8, Nos. 13 & 14, 1884); but it was based on a com
  paratively small number of experiments.

     In looking over the table we notice many relations between
  the af<U+FB01>nity-constants and the chemical composition and con
  stitution of the acids. Before, however, these relations can
  be inquired into it will be necessary to ask, What is the in<U+FB02>u
  ence of dilution on the electrical conductivities of the acids?
  The numbers in columns III., IV., and V., which apply t0~
  solutions diluted in the ratio 1: 10: 100, show that the
  quantity of water present exerts a great and varying in<U+FB02>uence
  on the conductivities. It has been found by the author
  (Journ. fitr pralct. Chemie, [2] xxxi. p. 307, 1885) that the
  amount of water also in<U+FB02>uences the actions of acids in the
  inversion of cane-sugar, and that these actions vary in the
  same way as the electrical conductivites of the acids, for the
  various degrees of dilution.
     The numbers in columns III., IV., and V. do not express
  the speci<U+FB01>c conductivities of the various acids, as this term is
  understood in Physics, but rather the roducts of the speci<U+FB01>c
  conductivities into the equivalent vo umes of the solutions.
 The meaning here given to the term equivalent-conductivity

         Prof. W. Ostwald’s Electrochemical Researches.        107
is as follows :—Let a vessel contain two parallel electrodes
at a distance of l centim. apart, and let there be used one
equivalent in grams of a speci<U+FB01>ed acid; then the conduc
tivity of the acid, when diluted with a de<U+FB01>nite quantity of
water, is the equivalent-conductivity for that degree of di
lution.      It will afterwards be found more convenient to refer
the conductivities of the acids to molecular rather than to
equivalent weights.        The molecular conductivity of an acid
is found in a similar way to that whereby the equivalent
conductivity is determined. The degree of dilution is ex
pressed by the number of litres of solution containing one
molecular weight, in grams, of any speci<U+FB01>ed acid. It would
be more accurate to express the ratio of acid to water by
a molecular ratio, e. 9. H01: 100H20; but, as only very
dilute solutions are considered here, no essential inaccuracy
will be introduced by adopting the more convenient method.
   If the dilution =0 (that is, if no water is present), the con
ductivity of an acid is usually equal to, or is very little greater
than, zero. As water is added the molecular conductivity
increases, and approaches a maximum which is reached when
the dilution is in<U+FB01>nite. There is no exception to this eneral
law. The conductivities of the stronger acids, HCl, Hgr, HI,
HNOS, H0105, HClO4, HBrO-s, HIO3, &c., are nearly at their
maxima in moderately dilute solutions; the molecular con
ductivities of these acids vary but little with the dilution.
   The following table presents the conductivities of some of
the stronger acids when the dilution increases in the ratio of
the powers of 2. The unit, in terms of which the conduc
tivities are expressed, is 4'248 times greater than the mercury
unit.

   The molecular conductivities of these acids are nearly the
same (Kohlrausch had already observed this for some of these
acids) ; they slowly increase and reach a maximum, equal to

 108       Prof. W. Ostwald’s Electrochemical Researches.
about 90 for all these acids, at a dilution of 512 litres; in
more dilute solutions the conductivities are slightly dimi
 nished, owing to the impurities in the distilled water (Journ.
ftlr prakt. Chemie, [2] xxxi. p. 440). Whether the molecular
 conductivities of' all acids reach a maximum equal to about 90
 in very dilute solutions cannot be determined by direct expe
 riments, because even with dilutions to 542 and 1024 litres
 the impurities present in the purest distilled water begin to
 exert an influence which cannot be accurately measured. An
 answer may, however, be given to this question if it is found
 possible to draw conclusions as to the behaviour of acids in
 more dilute solutions from their observed behaviour in less
 dilute solutions.

    The molecular conductivity increases in every case, but in
 a very varying degree, with increasin dilution. The increase
 is greater, for a given increase of (<U+FB01>lution, the smaller the
 conductivity of the acid ; it is also greater for weak than for
 strong aci s, and greater for small than for large dilutions.
 The value of the increase in molecular conductivity for each
 dilution follows a special course : in the case of weak acids it
 increases as dilution increases; the increase attains a maxi
 mum value, equal to 8'9, in the case of monochloracetic acid
 for a dilution of 512 litres (mol. conduc. at 256 litres = 37'8,
 and at 512 litres = 46'7, diff. = 8'9); the same value is
 attained for dichloracetic acid for the dilution from 8 to 16
 litres (mol. 0. = 43 and 521) ; approximately the same value
 is attained for hypophosphorous acid for the dilution from 8

           Prof. W. Ostwald’s Electrochemical Researches.        109
  to 16 litres (mol. 0. = 458 and 54'1), and for iodic acid for
  the dilution from 4 to 8 litres (mol. 0. = 505 and 59). As
  dilution increases in these cases, the increase in molecular
  conductivity for each dilution begins to decrease; for the
  strong acids the increase of conductivity is very small. It
  appears as if the maximum increase in molecular conductivity
  occurs where the conductivity is equal to 45—that is, is equal
  to half the maximum limit, 90. The relations between dilu
, tion and molecular conductivity are more de<U+FB01>nite in the
  various series of acids. The mol. 0. of formic acid is 1'76 for
  the dilution 2 litres; almost the same value (1'81) is reached.
  by butyric acid for the dilution 32 litres. The following
  table exhibits the numbers for these two acids :—

     The numbers run parallel to each other ; those for butyric
  acid are about 5 per cent. greater than those for formic acid.
  Aqueous solutions of formic and butyric acids exhibit there
  fore about equal molecular conductivities when the latter is
  sixteen times more dilute than the former. If the data for
  the other acids are examined, it is apparent that the dilutions
  at which the molecular conductivities of the monohasic acids
  exhibit equal values always hear a constant relation to each other.
  This fundamental fact is exhibited by the following table,
   wherein equal molecular conductivities are placed in the same
  horizontal lines. The different series exhibit a closely corre
   sponding course. The dilution is expressed by means of the
   exponent p, which is de<U+FB01>ned by the relation, dilution = 2".
   If the values ofp and the molecular conductivities are regarded
   as coordinates of a curve, then the lines for the individual
   acids all form parts of one and the same curve which is
   common to all the acids.     The point of origin for each acid
   must be specially chosen on the axis of the dilution-exponents p 5
   in other words, a special constant must be given for the value
   of p for each acid.

   This result is identical with that already stated; for, if
equal conductivities of the various acids are exhibited at
e ually proportional dilutions, then the dilution-exponents,
w 'ch can be represented as logarithms of the dilutions (with
the base 2), must show constant differences. The form of the
curve is indicated by the results obtained ; it runs asymptotic
between the axis of p and a parallel placed at a distance
equal to 90 units, and appears to be symmetric to right and
left and also above and below. The maximum of increase,
as already observed, lies at 45, where the curve shows an
in<U+FB02>exion-point.
   As we have here undoubtedly to do with a natural law, no
exception to which is shown by any of the results obtained
for 90 to 100 monobasic acids, it is reasonable to suppose
that the curve must be capable of representation by a fairly
simple analytical expression. At <U+FB01>rst sight a tangent-function
is suggested. The results were therefore reduced so that the
maximum fell at the value 90 ; they were then regarded as
angles, and the corresponding tangents were found. The
tangents, however, formed not an arithmetical but a geome
trical series; the logarithms of the tangents gave approxi
mately constant differences, they increased proportionately
with the dilution-exponents. A few examples are given.

   The differences do not exhibit a constant value; they are
somewhat greater for the stron than for the weaker acids.
The details are not given for tie other acids, but only the
mean values of the di<U+FB02>‘erences; these mean values are as
follows :—                                    -

   The mean of these is 0136 ; but the individual means
deviate from this much more than can be accounted for by
experimental errors. These deviations may be considered as
follows :—If'p0 represent the dilution-exponent at which the
conductivity is equal to half the maximum, 45 in the present
units, then tan 45°:unity, and log tan 45° = 0. Then for every

   This <U+FB01>nal equation seems to be suf<U+FB01>ciently simple. It
includes one constant, v0, dependent on the nature of the acid;
the other constant, '4124, depends on the units chosen. But
there seem to be two objections to the expression. There is
a general agreement between the observed and calculated
results, but individual acids show greater divergences than
can be accounted for by experimental errors. If one attempts
to explain these discrepancies, one is forced to admit that the
formula has no rational foundation. An angle-function is
never used in mathematical physics, so far as the author is
aware, for a quantity which has no evident connection with
angles.                     I
   The author has attempted to develop other, rationally
grounded, expressions for the nature of the action of the
water on the acid molecules ; but none has yet been found to
a ree so closely with the observed results as that given above.
T e mathematical treatment of the problem must be reserved
for future consideration.
   The author then proceeds to discuss the results obtained
with the polybasic acids. The behaviour of polybasic acids as
regards dilution differs from that of monobasic acids. In one
of his earlier papers the author suggested that when a solu
tion of a polybasic acid is electrolyzed, only one of the hy
drogen atoms of the acid goes to the cathode ; the electrolysis
takes place according to the scheme H [ HR” and H | H213!”.
 Sulphuric acid appeared as an exception. Further investi
gation has, however, shown that when the maximum conduc
tivity is nearly reached by dilution, the second, and eventually
the third, hydrogen atom takes part in the transfer of elec
tricity, and electrolysis proceeds in accordance with the scheme
 H2 I R” and Ha I R’”. The participation of the second and
third atom of hydrogen depends upon the nature of the acids ;
those which have but feeble acid properties, e. g. selenious,
 phosphorous, or phosphoric acid (shown by the impossibility
 of titrating these acids by the use of litmus) exhibit molecular
 conductivities which follow much the same course as the con
 ductivities of the monobasic acids. The results for some of
 the polybasic acids are given in the following tables; the
 molecular conductivities are referred to the same units as
 before. The values of log tan m and the differences are also
 given, so that comparisons may be made between the poly
 basic and monobasic acids.

    The differences are very small when the dilutions are large;
 this is probably due to formation of some phosphoric acid the
 molecular conductivity of which is smaller than that of phos
 phorous acid. In other respects the course of the change of
 conductivity of phosphorous acid is similar to that of the
 monobasic acids.
    Those dibasic acids Whose normal salts are not alkaline but
 neutral behave very differently. Even the weaker acids of
 this class show an increase of conductivity over the monobasic
acids when the solutions become dilute ; this advance of con
 ductivity is exhibited sooner and to a greater extent the

   At a dilution of 2 litres the conductivity of malonic acid is
about 10 per cent. less than that of monochloracetic acid ; as
dilution increases the difference between the conductivities of
 these two acids decreases, until the conductivities are equal at
 512 litres dilution ; from this point onwards malonic acid
 surpasses acetic acid; when the half' maximum is past, the
 second hydrogen atom of malonic acid begins to take part in

   Neither these numbers, nor those obtained by referring the
conductivities to the equivalent weight of sulphuric acid, can
be made to agree with the normal curve. The separate
actions of the two hydrogen atoms of sulphuric acid are
shown very markedly in the results recently obtained by
F. Kohlrausch (Gott. Nachr. 1885, p. 80). The conducti
vities of the stronger monobasic acids appear as straight lines
in the system of coordinates chosen by Kohlrausch ; the curve
of sulphuric acid forms two straight lines at different inclina
tions, joined by a short curve which falls at the dilution 2—8
litres. The table given by the author contains therefore the
second part of the complete curve. As Kohlrausch did not
examine any other dibasic acid of nearly the same strength as
sulphuric, the behaviour of this acid remains unexplained by
his results.
   The point at which, the second hydrogen atom of a very
strong dibasic acid begins to take part in the electrolysis is
situated in the concentrated solution. Dilute solutions of
such an acid behave similarly with the monobasic acids, pro
vided that molecule is not compared with molecule, but

  The last column, headed Equiv., shows that the conductivity
referred to the equivalent weight (half the molecular weight)
of this acid varies in the same way as the conductivity of a.
strong monobasic acid. The limiting value of the molecular
conductivity of dibasic acids, when the second phase of elec
trolysis is traversed, is shown by the numbers in the above
table to be twice as large as that for monobasic acids.
   The relations between dilution and conductivity of t-ribasic
and polybasic acids are analogous to those already discussed.
Phosphoric acid reacts with two equivalents of alkali to form
nearly neutral salts ; the third hydrogen atom is that of a
very weak acid. In conformity with these facts, we <U+FB01>nd the

in very dilute solutions does it surpass that acid. Citric acid

   The results for dibasic and tribasic acids cannot be brought
into mathematical form until a rational expression is found

that the dibasic acids must be regarded as to some extent the

            XIV. 0n the Self-induction of Wires.
                     By OLIVER HEAVISIDE".
A SERIES of experiments made some years ago, in which
        I used the Wheatstone-bridge and the differential tele
phone as balances of induction as well as of resistance,led me to
undertake atheoretical investigation of the phenomena occur
ring when conducting-cores are placed in long solenoidal coils,
in which impressed electromotive force is made to act, in
 order to explain the disturbances of balance which are pro
duced by the dissipation of energy in the cores. The simpler
portions of this investigation, leaving out those of greater
mathematical dif<U+FB01>culty and less practical interest, relating to
hollow cores and the effect of allowing dielectric displacement,
were published in the ‘Electrician’ from May 3, 1884, to
January 3, 1885.
   This investigation led me to the mathematically similar
investigation of the transmission of current into wires.    I say
into wires, instead of through wires, because the current is
really transmitted by diffusion from the boundary into a wire
from the external dielectric, under all ordinarily occurring
circumstances.      In the case of a core placed in a coil the
magnetic force is longitudinal and the current circular; in
the case of a straight round wire the current is longitudinal
and the magnetic force circular. The transmission of the lon
gitudinal current into the wire takes place, however, exactly
in the same manner as the transmission of the lon itudinal
magnetic force into the core within the coil, when t e boun
                 ‘F Communicated by the Author.

                      Self-induction of “<U+FB01>res.                119
dary conditions are made similar, which is easily to be realized.
Similarly we may compare the circular electric current in the
core to the circular magnetic current in the wire.
   I also found the transfer of energy to be similar in both
cases, viz. radially inward or outward to or from the axis of
the core or the wire. It was therefore necessary to consider
the dielectric, in order to complete the course of the transfer
of energy from its source, say a voltaic cell, to its sink, the
wire or the core where it is <U+FB01>nally dissipated in the form of
heat, and its temporary storage as electric and magnetic
energy in the <U+FB01>eld generally, including the conductors.
   Terminating the paper above referred to, having so much
other matter, I started a fresh one under the title of “ Electro
magnetic Induction and its Propagation,” commencing in
the ‘Electrician,’ January 3, 1885. Having, according to
my sketched plan, to get rid of general matter <U+FB01>rst, before
proceeding to special solutions, I took occasion near the com
mencement of the paper to give a general account of some of
my results regarding the propagation of current, in which the
 following occurs, describing the way the current rises in a
 wire, and the consequent approximation, under certain cir
cumstances, to mere surface-conduction. It was meant to
 illustrate the previously-mentioned stoppage of current-con
 duction by high conductivity. After an account of the
 transfer of energy through the dielectric (concerning which I
shall say a few words later) I continue (‘ Electrician,’ January
 10, 1885):—
    “ Since, on starting a current, the energy reaches the wire
 from the medium without, it may be expected that the electric
 current is <U+FB01>rst set up in the outer part, and takes time to
 penetrate to the middle. This I have veri<U+FB01>ed by investigating
 some special cases.
    “Increase the conductivity enormously, still keeping it
 <U+FB01>nite, however. Let it, for instance, take minutes to set up
 a current at the axis. Then ordinary rapid signalling ‘through
 the wire’ would be accompanied by a surface-current only,
 penetrating to but a small depth. The disturbance is thus
 propagated parallel to the wire in the manner of waves, with
 re<U+FB02>ection at the end, and hardly any tailing 01f. With in<U+FB01>
 nite conductivity there can be no current set 11p in the wire
 at all. There is no dissipativity ; wave-propagation is perfect.
 The wire-current is wholly super<U+FB01>cial, an abstraction,yet it is
 nearly the same with very high conductivity. Thisillustrates
 the impenetrability of a perfect conductor to magnetic induc
 tion (and similarly to electric currents) applied by Maxwell to
the molecular theory of magnetism.” . . . . .

120                  Mr. O. Heaviside on the
   Attention has recently been forcibly directed towards the
 phenomenon above described of the inward transmission of
 current into wires by Professor Hughes’s Inaugural Address
 to the Society of Telegraph Engineers and Electricians,
 January 1886. This paper was, for many reasons, perhaps
 the most remarkable one ever written. It was remarkable for
 the extraordinary ignoration of well-known facts, thoroughly
 worked out already ; it was remarkable for a quite phenomenal
 mixing up of the effects due to induction and to resistance,
 and the author’s apparent inability to separate them, or to see
 the real meaning of his results; one might indeed imagine
 that an entirely new science of induction was in its earliest
 stages. It was remarkable that the great experimental skill
 of the author should have led him to employ a method which
 was in itself highly objectionable, being capable of giving, in
 general, neither a true resistance nor a true induction-balance
 (as may be very easily seen by simple experiments with coils,
 without any mathematical examination of the theory)—a
 method which does not therefore admit of any exact interpre
tation of results without the fullest particulars being given
and subjected to laborious calculations; and <U+FB01>nally, it was
remarkable as containing, so far as could be safely guessed at,
many veri<U+FB01>cations of the approximation towards mere surface
conduction in wires. This is, after all, the really important
matter, against which all the rest is insigni<U+FB01>cant.
   As regards the method employed, I have shown its inaccu
racy in a paper “ On the Use of the Bridge as an Induction
balance,” in ‘ The Electrician,’ April 30, 1886, wherein I also
described correct methods, including the_simple bridge with_
out mutual induction, and also methods in which mutual
induction is employed to get balance, giving the requisite
formulae, which are of the simplest character.
   As regards the interpretation of Prof. Hughes’s thick-wire
results, showing departure from the linear theory, by which I
mean the theory that ignores differences in the current-density
in wires, I made the following remarks in the ‘Electrician,’
April 23, 1886. After commenting upon the di<U+FB01>iculty of
exact interpretation, I proceed :—
   “ The most interesting of the experiments are those relating
to the effect of increased diameter on what Prof. Hughes
terms the inductive capacity of wires. My own interpretation
is roughly this. That the time-constant of a wire <U+FB01>rst in
creases with the diameter ” [this is of course what the linear
theory shows], “ and then, later, decreases rapidly ; and that
the decrease sets in the sooner the higher the conductivity. and
the higher the inductivity (or magnetic permeability) of the

                     Sel/‘Zinduction of Wires.                 121
wires. If this be correct, it is exactly what I should have
expected and predicted. In fact, I have already described
the phenomenon in this Journal ; or, rather, the phenomenon
I described contains in itself the above interpretation. In
the ‘ Electrician’ for January 12, 1884 ” [corrected to
January 10, 1885, in a subsequent letter, May 7, 1886], “I
described how the current starts in a wire. It begins on its
boundary, and is propagated inward. Thus during the rise
of the current it is less strong at the centre than at the boun
dary. As regards the manner of inward propagation, it takes
place according to the same laws as the propagation of mag
netic force and current into cores from an enveloping coil,
which I have described in considerable detail in this Journal.
The retardation depends upon the conductivity, upon the
inductivity, and upon the section, under similar boundary
conditions. If the conductivity be high enough, or the induc
tivity, or the section be large enough, to make the central
current appreciably less than the boundary-current during the
greater part of the time of rise of the current, there will be
an apparent reduction in the time-constant. Go to an ex
treme case—very rapid short currents, and large retardation
to inward transmission. Here we have the current in layers,
strong on the boundary, weak in the middle. Clearly then,
if we wish to regard the wire as a mere linear circuit, which
it is not, and as we can only do to a <U+FB01>rst approximation, we
should remove the central part of the wire—that is, increase
its resistance, regarded as a line, or reduce its time-constant.
 This will happen the sooner the greater the inductivity and
the conductivity, as the section is continuously increased. It
 is only thin wires that can be treated as mere lines, and even
they, if the speed be only great enough, must be treated as
solid conductors. I ought also to mention that the in<U+FB02>uence
of external conductors, as of the return conductor, is of im
portance, sometimes of very great importance, in modifying
 the distribution of current in the transient state. I have had
 for years in manuscript some solutions relating to round wires,
 and hope some day to arrive at them in the course of the
 paper 1 am at present publishing, or, rather, not publishing, as
the editor has been able to afford so little space for it lately.
    “ As a general assistance to those who go by old methods,
a rising current inducing an opposite current in itself and in
parallel conductors, this may be useful. Parallel currents are
said to attract or repel, according as the currents are together
or opposed. This is, however, mechanical force on the con
ductors. The distribution of current is not affected by it.
But when currents are increasing or decreasing, there is an

122                 Mr. O. Heaviside on the
apparent attraction or repulsion between them. Oppositely
going currents repel when they are decreasing and attract
when they are increasing. Thus, send a current into a loop,
one wire the return to the other, both being close together.
During the rise of the current it will be denser on the sides
of the wires nearest one another than on the remote sides. . . . .”
   An iron wire, through which rapid reversals are sent, should
afterwards be found, by reason of its magnetic retentiveness,
magnetized in concentric cylindrical shells, of alternately
positive and ne ative magnetization. This would only occur
super<U+FB01>cially. ' he thickness of the layers would give infor
mation regarding the amount of retardation, from which the
inductivity could be deduced. The case is similar to that of
the super<U+FB01>cial layers of magnetization produced in a core in
a coil through which reversals are sent, the magnetization
being then, however, longitudinal instead of circular.
   The linear theory is departed from in the most extreme
manner, when the return-current closely envelops the wire.
The theory of the rise of the current in this case I have given
in the ‘Electrician ’ for May 14, 1886, and the case of the
return-current at any distance is considered June 11, and
will be followed by others. The investigation following in
this paper is more comprehensive, taking into account both
electrostatic and electromagnetic induction, working down to
the electromagnetic theory on the one hand, and approxima
ting towards the electrostatic theory (long submarine cable)
on the other ; with this difference, that inertia is not so
wholly ignorable in the long-line case as is elastic yielding in
the case of a short wire. Nor is the variation of current.
density wholly ignorable.
   But <U+FB01>rst as regards the transfer of energy in the electro
magnetic <U+FB01>eld. This is a very important matter theoretically.
It is a necessity of a rationally intelligible scheme (even if it
be only on paper) that the transfer of energy should be expli
citly de<U+FB01>nable. It is the absence of this de<U+FB01>niteness that
makes the German methods so repulsive to a plain man who
likes to see where he is going and what he is doing, and hates
metaphysics in science.
   I found that I had been anticipated by Prof. Poynting in
the deduction of the transfer of energy formula appropriate
to Maxwell’s electromagnetic scheme, in the main. It is,
therefore, only as having given the equation of activity in a
more general form, the most general that Maxwell’s scheme
admits of, and having deduced it in a simple manner, that I
can attach myself to the matter. In connection with it, how
ever, there is another matter of some importance, viz. the use

                     Self-induction of Wires.                  123
of a certain fundamental equation. That I should have been
able to arrive at the most general form, taking into account
intrinsic magnetization, as well as not confining myself to
media homogeneous and isotropic as regards the three quan
tities conductivity, inductivity, and dielectric capacity, in a
simple and direct manner, without any volume-integrations or
complications, arose from my method of treating the general
equations. I here sketch out the scheme, in the form I give it.
    Let H1 be the magnetic force and P the current.        (Thick
letters here for vectors. The later investigation is wholly
scalar.) Then, “ curl” denoting the well-known rotatory
operator, Maxwell’s fundamental current equation is
                        curlH1=41rF, . . . . . .                (1)
and is his de<U+FB01>nition of electric current in terms of magnetic
force. It' necessitates closure of the electric current, and, at
a surface, tangential continuity of H1 and normal continuity of
 I". The electric current may be conductive, or- the variation
 of the elastic “ displacement,” say
                             r=c+i).
 0 being the conduction-current, D the displacement, linear
functions of the electric force E, thus
                        C=IcE1,   D=cE1/4'n';
 I: being the conductivity, and c the dielectric capacity (or c/4vr
 the condenser-capacity per unit volume). Equation (1) thus
 connects the electric and the magnetic forces one way. But
 this is not enough to make a complete system. A second
 relation between E1 and H1 is wanted.
    Maxwell’s second relation is his equation of electric force
 in terms of two highly arti<U+FB01>cial quantities, a vector and a
 scalar potential, say A and P, thus
                         E1: -A-vr,                     .       (2)
ignoring impressed force for the present.        From A we get
down to H1 again, thus,
                         curl A=B,
                              B=ILH1;
B being the magnetic induction, and ,u. the inductivity. (Here
we ignore intrinsic magnetization.)
    The equation (2) is arrived at through a rather complex
investigation. From these equations are deduced the general
 equations of electromagnetic disturbances in vol. ii. art. 783.
 They contain both A and P.      One or other of them must go
 before we can practically work them, which are, independently

124                  Mr. O. Heaviside on the
of this, rather unmanageable, although they are not really
general, for impressed forces are omitted, and the intrinsic
magnetization must be zero, and the medium isotropic. Again,
and this is an objection of some magnitude, the two potentials
A and P, if given everywhere, are not su<U+FB01>icient to specify the
state of the electromagnetic <U+FB01>eld.    Try it; and fail.
   Even without using these complex general equations referred
to, but those on which they are based, (1) and (2), the very
arti<U+FB01>cial nature of A and P greatly obscures and complicates
many investigations. Not being able to work practically in
terms of A and P in a general manner, and yet knowing
there was nothing absolutely wrong, I went to the root of the
evil, and cured it, thus :—
   As a companion to equation (1) use this,
                     —-curlE1=47rG-; . . . . . .               (3)
where G is the magnetic current, or B/47r._ That this may
be derived at once from (2) is obvious. But what is of greater
importance in view of the dif<U+FB01>cult establishment of (2), is that
(3) can be got immediately independently, and that (2) is its
consequence. Equation (3) is in fact the mathematical ex
pression of the Faraday law of induction, that the electromotive
force of induction in any closed circuit is to be measured by
the rate of decrease of the induction through it.
   Now make (1) and (3) the fundamental equations of motion,
and ignore       altogether, except for special purposes. There
are several great advantages in the use of (3). First, the
abolition of the two potentials.    Next, we are brought into
immediate contact with E1 and H1, which have physical sig
ni<U+FB01>cance in really de<U+FB01>ning the state of the medium anywhere
(k, ,a, and c of course to be known), which A and P do not,
and cannot, even if given over all space. Thirdly, by reason
of the close parallelism between (1) and (3), electric force
related to magnetic current, as magnetic force to electric cur
rent, we are enabled to easily perceive many important relations
which are not at all obvious when the potentials A and P are
used, and (3) ignored. Fourthly, we are enabled with con
siderable ease, if we have obtained solutions relating to variable
states in which the lines of El and H1 are related in one way,
to at once get the solutions of problems of quite different
physical meaning, in which E1 and H1, or quantities directly
related to them, change places. For example, the variation
of magnetic force in a core in a coil, and of electric current
in a round wire ; and many others.
   That the advantages attending the use of ( 3) as a funda
mental equatiou are not imaginary, I have repeatedly veri<U+FB01>ed.

                     Self-induction of Wires.               125
The establishment of the general equation of activity, however,
which I now give (‘ Electrician,’ February 21, 1885), shows
that (3) is really the proper and natural fundamental equation
to use. But we must <U+FB01>rst introduce impressed forces, allow
ing energy to be taken in by the electric and magnetic
currents. In (1) and (3) E1 and H, are not the effective
electric and magnetic forces concerned in producing the <U+FB02>uxes
conduction-current, displacement, and induction, but require
impressed forces, say 6 and h, to be added.        Let E=E1+e,
&c. ; then we shall have
                   B=,aH,    C=leE,    D=cE/4'rr,    .  . .  (4)
as the three linear relations between forces and <U+FB02>uxes; two
equations,
                    r=c+b,       e=shm        . . .. . a)

                      --cur1 (E—e)=41rG.      .  .   .  . . (7)
Next, let Q be the dissipativity, U the electric energy, and T
the magnetic energy per unit volume, de<U+FB01>ned thus :
                Q=EC,     U=§LED,     T=§HB/-17r .      . . (8)
(according to the notation of scalar products used in my paper
in the Philosophical Magazine, June 1885 ; c, h, and a are in
  eneral the operators appropriate to linear connection between
<U+FB01>nces and <U+FB02>uxes). Then we get the full equation of activity
at once, by multiplying (6) by E and (7) by H and adding
the results. It is
          eI‘+hG=EI‘+HG+ div. V(E—e)(H—h)/47r,][             (9)
               =Q+U+T+<U+FB01>mV@—®@—M<U+FB02>m
where div. stands for divergence, the negative of Maxwell’s
 convergence. The left side showing the energy taken in per
 second per unit volume by reason of impressed forces, and
 Q+II+Tbeing expended on the spot in heating, and in
 creasing the electric and magnetic energies, we see that
 V(E—e)(H—h)/41r is the vector transfer of energy per unit
 area per second, or the energy-current density. The appro
 priateness of (7) as a companion to (6) is very clearly shown.
    The scheme expressed by (4), (5), (6), (7) is, however, in
one respect too general. The magnetic current is closed, by

 126                  Mr. O. Heaviside on the
 (7) ; but that does not necessitate the closure of the magnetic
 inductiou,which is necessary to avoid having unipolar magnets.
 Hence
                            div.B=0     .   .  .  .   .   .  .  (10)

                                in addition to with    (5), (6), of
 energy, analogous to the electric conduction-current.
    As regards the meanings of e and h, in the light of dynamics
 they de<U+FB01>ne themselves in the equation of activity ; that is, so
 far as the mere measure of impressed forces is concerned,
 apart from physical causation. Thus e is the amount of
 energy taken in by the electromagnetic <U+FB01>eld per second per
unit volume per unit electric current, and h is similarly
 related to magnetic current. Under 6 has to be included the
 recognized voltaic and thermoelectric forces. But besides
 them, it has to include the impressed electric force due to
 motion in a magnetic <U+FB01>eld, or VvB if v is the vector velocity,
 necessitating a mechanical force VI‘B. Itihas also to in
 clude intrinsic electrization, the state which is set up in solid
 dielectrics under the continued application of electric force.
 Thus                        I = 06/471
 connects the intensity of intrinsic electrization .1 with the
corresponding e.
    I can only <U+FB01>nd two kinds of h. First, due to motion in an
 electric <U+FB01>eld, viz. 41rVDv, necessitating a mechanical force
47rVDG; and, secondly, much more importantly, intrinsic
 magnetization I, connected with the corresponding h thus,
                           I=,u.h/47r.
    As regards potentials, there are, to match the two electric
 potentials A and P, two magnetic potentials, say Z and Q;
.0. being the single-valued scalar magnetic potential, and Z
the vector potential of the magnetic current, some of whose
 properties in relation to dielectric and conductive displacement
1 have worked out in the paper referred to before.
    As regards the general equations of disturbances, like Max
well’s (7), chapter xx. vol. ii., they are far more a hindrance
than an assistance in general investigations. But when we
come to a special investigation, and need to know the forms
of the functions involved, then we may eliminate either E or
H between (6) and ( 7), and use the suitable coordinates.
    We may make use of the above equations at the start, in
passing to the question of the propagation of disturbances
along a wire, after which the investigation will be wholly
scalar. Put e=0 in (7) ; then we see that we cannot alter

                     Self-induction of Wires.                     127
the magnetic force at a point without giving rotation to the
electric force. Now as in a steady state the electric force has
no rotation (away from the seat of impressed force), it follows
that under no circumstances (except by arti<U+FB01>cial arrangements
of impressed force) can we set up the steady state in a con
ductor strictly according to the linear theory. We may
approximate to it very closely throughout the greater part of
the variable period, but it will be wi ely departed from in the
very early stages.                                                   '
   Let there be a straight round wire of radius a1, conduc
tivity k1, inductivity ,uq, and dielectric capacity 01 ; surrounded
up to radius a2 by a dielectric of conductivity [0,, inductivity [1.2,
and dielectric capacity 62: in its turn surrounded to radius a3
by a conductor of k3, a3, and ca. This might be carried on to
any extent; but we stop at r=a3, r being distance from the
axis of the wire, as the outer conductor is to be the return to
the inner wire.
   Let the magnetic lines be such as would be produced by
longitudinal impressed electric force, viz. circles in planes
perpendicular to the axis of the wire and centered thereon.
Let H be the intensity of magnetic force at distance r from
the axis, and distance 2 along it from a <U+FB01>xed point. Use (6),
with 11:0, to <U+FB01>nd the electric current.         It has two compo
nents, say P longitudinal or parallel to z, and 'y radial, or
parallel to r, given by

         Before proceeding to practical simpli<U+FB01>cations, we may in
     outline continue the process of <U+FB01>nding the complete solution
     to correspond to any given initial state.            The m’s must be
     found from the terminal conditions. Suppose, for example,
     that the wire, of length l, forms a closed circuit, and that the
     sheath and the dielectric are similarly closed on themselves.
     Then clearly we shall have Fourier periodic series, with
                         m=O, 21r/l, 41r/l, Gar/l, &c.
         If, again, we desire to make the sheath the return to the
     wire, without external resistance, join them at the end z=O
     by a conducting-plate of no resistance, placed perpendicular
     to the axis; and do the same at the other end, where z=l.
     This will make
                             y=0 at m=0 and at w=l;
     will make the 0’s vanish, and
                         m=O, w/l, Qw/l, 31r/Z, &0.
     Each of these m’s has its in<U+FB01>nite series of 10’s, by the equa
    tion (22).
        Now, as regards the initial state, the electric <U+FB01>eld and the
    magnetic <U+FB01>eld must be both given. For, although the quan
     tity H, fully expressed, alone settles the complete state of the
        Phil. May. S. 5. Vol. 22. N0. 135. August 1886.                K

 130                  Mr. O. Heaviside on the
 s stem after the <U+FB01>rst moment, yet at the <U+FB01>rst moment (when
 t e previously acting impressed forces <U+FB01>nally cease) the elec
 tric <U+FB01>eld and the magnetic <U+FB01>eld are independent. The energy
 which is dissipated according to Joule’s law has two sources,
 the electric and the magnetic energies. Now we may, by
 longitudinal impressed force, set up a certain distribution of
 magnetic energy, but no electric energy. Or, having set up
 a certain magnetic and a certain electric <U+FB01>eld by a particular
 distribution of impressed force, we may alter it in various
ways, so as to keep the magnetic <U+FB01>eld the same whilst we vary
the electric <U+FB01>eld. So both <U+FB01>elds require to be known, or
equivalent information given.
    We may then decompose them into the proper normal
systems by means of the universal conjugate property derived
from the equation of activity, that of the equality of the mutual
electric energy of two complete normal systems to their mutual
ma netic energy (‘ Electrician,’ November 27, 1885). Thus,
if u and T11 are the doubles of the complete electric and
magnetic energies of any normal system, and U01 is the mutual
electric energy of the initial electric <U+FB01>eld and the normal
electric <U+FB01>eld in question, and T01 is the mutual magnetic
energy of the initial magnetic <U+FB01>eld and the normal magnetic
<U+FB01>eld, we shall have             U __T

as the expression for the value of the coef<U+FB01>cient A,, which
settles the actual size of the normal system in question. Equal
roots require further investigation. This would complete the
theoretical treatment. It is best to use the electric and mag
netic forces as initial data in the general case. As regards
potentials, we cannot express the electric energy in terms of
merely the electric potential and the electri<U+FB01>cation, but require
to use also the vector potential Z and the ma netic current.
   Now there are several important practica simpli<U+FB01>cations.
Suppose, <U+FB01>rst, that the thickness of the sheath is only a
small fraction of its distance from the axis. Then it may be
treated as if it were in<U+FB01>nitely thin, making the sheath a linear
conductor; of course its resistance may remain the same as if
of <U+FB01>nite thickness. Let ca4 be the very small thickness of the
sheath, then the big fraction on the left side of (22) will
become              "

  The inductivity of the sheath is now of no importance. Being
  on the outer edge of the magnetic <U+FB01>eld, the thinness of the
  sheath makes its contribution to the magnetic energy be
  diminished inde<U+FB01>nitely.
      Again, in important practical'cases, the resistance of the
  return is next to nothing in comparison with that of the wire.
  Then put p3=0 in (21). This makes the left side vanish, and
  then we sweep away the denominator on the right side, and
  get the determinantal or differential equation
° (P.81/P282)J0(81a1)J1(82a1)—J1(81a1)Jo(82a1)J°(8’a’)+K°(8“a’)'(25)

      Although we may have the return of nearly no resistance
  and yet of low conductivity (as in the case of the Earth), yet
   it cannot be quite zero without in<U+FB01>nite conductivity, which is
   what is here assumed. The result is that we shut out the
   return conductor from participation, except super<U+FB01>cially, in
  the phenomena. (24) will result from the condition p2P2=0,
   or F2=O, at r=a2 ; that is, no tangential current, or electric
   force, in the dielectric close to the sheath. If there could be
   any, it would involve in<U+FB01>nite current-density in the sheath.
   As it is, there is none, and the return-current has become a
   mere abstraction, to be measured by the tangential magnetic
   force divided by 4w, and turned round through a right angle
   on the inner boundary of the sheath. In a similar manner, if
   we make the wire in<U+FB01>nitely conducting (or of in<U+FB01>nitely great
   inductivity either) the wire will be shut out. Then the mag
   netic and electric <U+FB01>elds are con<U+FB01>ned to the dielectric only,
   and we shall have purely wave-propagation, unless it be a
  conductor as well.
      Now, with the return of no resistance, let the dielectric be
  nonconducting and the wire non-dielectric, or 01:0, 102:0.
   The most important simpli<U+FB01>cation arises from the smallness of
  820:2. For we have
                           — := 1.020102 +m2.
      If the length l of the line is a large multiple of the greatest
  transverse length a, we are concerned with, m” is made a
  small quantity—very small when the line is miles in length,
  except in case of the insigni<U+FB01>cant terms involving large mul
  tiples of 11' in m=mr/l.    Again, 01.20)“! is the speed of light

 the onl assumption made is that the return has no resistance.

 where B = A(plsl/p2)J0(s1a1)—:- log (a2/a1).
     The longitudinal current and electric force in the dielectric
 vary as the logarithm of the ratio ag/r, vanishing at r=a2.
 The radial components vary inversely as the distance. Nume
 rically considered, the longitudinal electric force is negligible
 against. the radial, which is important as causing the elec
 trostatic retardation on long lines. But, theoretically, the
 longitudinal component of the electric force is very important
  when we look to the physical actions that take place, as it
  determines the passage of energy from the dielectric, its seat
  of transmission along the wire, into the conductor, where it
 is dissipated.
    ~Begardin (28), however, it is to be remarked that, on
  account of t e approximations, the dielectric solutions do not
  satisfy the fundamental equation                  Applying it, we get
  I‘=O. But the other fundamental (7) is satis<U+FB01>ed. To satisfy
  (6), take

also the proper equation in the m=O case when the electro

 be inferred that the subsidence of the “current in the wire ”
 is delayed. It is accelerated, at least at <U+FB01>rst.

 if the wire is of iron [Ll/L0 may be very large, and there will
 be no approach to the linear theory. Many normal systems

     There is also the water-pipe analogy, which is always turn
 ivrég up. This I made use of in the ‘ Electrician,’ July 12,1884.
      ater in a round pipe is started from rest and set into a state
  of steady motion by the sudden and continued application of
 a steady longitudinal dragging or shearing-force applied to
 its boundary, according to the equation (32). This analogue
  is useful because every one is familiar with the setting of
 water in motion by friction on its boundary, transmitted
 inward by viscosity.
      Graphically representing (32), abscissae the time, and ordi

  the linear-theory arrival-curve at all parts of the wire, we may
  notice these characteristics. The current rises much more
  rapidly at the boundary than according to the linear theory,
  at <U+FB01>rst, but much more slowly in the later stages.            Going
  inward from the boundary we <U+FB01>nd that an in<U+FB02>ection is pro
  duced in the arrival-curve near its commencement ; the rapid
  rise being delayed for an appreciable interval of time. This
  dead period is very marked of course at the axis of the wire,
  there being practically no current at all there until a certain
   time has elapsed. That the central part of the wire is nearly
   inoperative when rapid reversals are sent is easily understood
  from this, or perhaps more easily by the use of the water-pipe

     Analogous to this, the amplitude of the current in a coil

  increased by allowing dissipation of energy by conduction in
 a core placed in the coil, when the corresponding y is great,
  a large core, high inductivity, &c. ; that is, the inertia or

      XV. On a new Hyperbolagraph.           By H. CUNYNGHAME‘.
    IT is a not unfrequent want to be able to <U+FB01>nd the rectangle
           of greatest or least areacontained between a curve and
    any given rectangular coordinate axes. In several problems
    connected with motion and pressure in steam-engines this is
    very useful ; and even in political economy the graphic repre
    sentations of monopoly-curves depend on the maxima and
    minima of this nature..
       For the solutions of such problems it is often very useful to
    be able to describe any rectangular hyperbola, the axes being
    given.     To effect this, I have constructed a machine which is
    capable of drawing these curves with considerable accuracy.
    It depends on a mathematical property of the rectangular
    hyperbola, which, so far as I am aware, is new. From a <U+FB01>xed
    point 0 let a line 0 P be drawn to meet a <U+FB01>xed line A B in P.
    Take PQperpendicular to AB, and make OP+PQ = a
    constant length.      Then Q is the locus of a rectangular hyper
    bola whose asymptotes are equally inclined to A B, and such
    that if the said asymptotes be taken as axes, wy=2(OM)2.
    This is easy to prove ; for if PM=w, PQ=y, and OQ=b and
    OM=A; then
                              y=a—OP,

 this manner by the use of a steel wire and rollers; the rollers
 being arranged so as to compensate one another, so that when
 much wire was rolled up on one, less would be rolled up on
  the others. This principle has hardly been su<U+FB02>iciently used
  up tonow, and is worthy of attention.      In many other instru
  ments depending on the length of strings, the direction of the
  forces altering, there is unequal strain ; but in this instrument
  (as was pointed out by Mr. Boys) there will be no such
  tendency, as the string is always kept stretched by a constant
  weight.              -

 XVI. Note on the Induction of Electric Currents, in an In<U+FB01>
    nite Plane Current Sheet, which is rotating in a Field of
    Magnetic Force. By A. B. BASSET, MA.”
 1.      HE determination of the currents induced in a thin
           plane conducting sheet of in<U+FB01>nite extent, which is
 rotating about an axis perpendicular to itself in a <U+FB01>eld of
 ma netic force, may be effected either by employing the
 equkns of electromotive force referred to moving axes, or
 by ‘ling with the problem directly by means of the method
 of images.    The former method has been employed by Max
 welli‘ and Prof. G. Niveni, and is probably the preferable one
 when the currents cannot be conveniently represented by a
 system of images; but when the magnetic <U+FB01>eld is produced
 by a system of magnets or currents, the problem can be easily
 solved by <U+FB01>nding an analytical expression for the magnetic
 potential of the moving trail of images, to which the currents
 are equivalent.
    In the present note I have employed the latter method of
 dealing with the problem, and have thence deduced Niven’s
 results ; and I have also worked out the solution in the case
 of a current sheet rotating about an axis, in the presence of
 a short magnet which is <U+FB01>xed at right angles to the axis of
 revolution.
    2. To solve the problem by means of images, let us choose
'the instant at which we desire to observe the currents as the
 origin of the time, and reckon the time backwards from this
    och.
 e pAdopting    Maxwell’s notation, let F (2,7) be the value of
 P’ at time 7 ago (where —dP’/8z is the ma netic potential
 of the inducin system), and let the system T” he suddenly
 introduced and kept at rest; a system of currents will be
 instantaneously generated for which the value of P (where
 —dP/dz is the magnetic potential of currents) is f(z, 'r) , the
 form of the function f being determined from the fact that it
 is the image of F with respect to the sheet.
    This system of currents, as soon as it has been generated,
 will begin to decay, the law of decay being such that, at the
 end of an interval T,
                            P=f(z+ RT, 'r),
 where 27rR is the speci<U+FB01>c resistance of the sheet.
    If, therefore, at the end of an interval air the system P’ be

   Now we have supposed the magnetic pole to be rotatin in the
same direction as that in which e is measured, therefore t e <U+FB01>rst
equation indicates a force tending to oppose the motion of the
magnet; hence the magnet exerts a force on the sheet tendin
to pull it round in the direction of rotation.      If therefore the
magnet is <U+FB01>xed and the sheet be made to rotate, the magnet
will experience a dragging force parallel to the direction of
motion of the sheet. ,                                         .

   . The second equation represents a repulsive force acting
from the disk ; and the third equation represents a force acting
towards the axis of the disk.
  ' These results are equivalent to those obtained by Maxwell
and observed by Arago (see art. 669).
       If the magnet were not suf<U+FB01>ciently long to enable us to
 leave the action of the negative pole out of account, the mag
netic potential of the currents excited by the latter will be
 found by changing m into —m, h into h+a, where a is the
 length of the magnet; and the combined effect of the two
poles will be obtained by adding the results.
       It is, however, simpler to place a short magnet, of length 20,
 at right an les to the axis of revolution, and consider the
combined e ect due to both poles. The magnetic potential
of the currents due to the action of the negative pole will be
obtained in this case by changing m into —-m, and d: into
vr+ ¢ ; whence the expressions for the magnetic forces acting
on the positive pole will be found from equations (10) by
changing m into 2m, and n into 2n+ 1, and effecting the
summation with respect to n from so to O.
       The calculation can then be effected as followsz—Expand
the Bessel’s functions in powers of 7w; the expressions for
the forces will then assume the form of series every term of

       XVII. On an Electric-light Fire-damp Indicator.
        By WALTER EMMOTT and WILLIAM Acxaovn. "’
    HE Royal Commission on Accidents in Mines point out,
       in their recently issued Report, a serious objection to
the use of the electric light in mines, notwithstanding its
many other great advantages, in that the light of an incan
descent lamp being produced within a vacuum cannot admit
of any device for the indication of <U+FB01>re-damp such as is
employed in the Davy for example. This di<U+FB01>iculty was
experienced by one of us in the course of an installation of
the electric light in the Lofthouse pit, Wyke, Yorks, in the
summer of 1885 5 and we have since made a series of experi
ments with the object of devising a method of making the
electric light an indicator of <U+FB01>re-damp. The apparatus
placed before the Physical Society is the outcome of our
work. It consists of two incandescent lamps, one with
white glass and the other with red, and other necessary
adjuncts, such that in an ordinary atmosphere the white
incandescent lamp alone shines, but in <U+FB01>re-damp the white
lamp goes out and the red one begins to emit its light.
This is effected as follows :—A porous pot of unglazed hard
baked porcelain is joined by air-tight connections to a tube
 a portion of which is represented by TT‘, <U+FB01>g. 2. This tube is
 of such an internal diameter that it will readily admit of
 being sealed with a small quantity of mercury, Hg. A
 platinum wire runs the whole length of the tube and is

connected with one of the poles of the battery B or other
source of electricity. Two other platinum wires in the tube
run parallel with this for part of the way, as in <U+FB01>g. 2, and
each is connected with a lamp. The lamps W and R are
joined, and a branch wire connects them to the other](pole of
 the battery. In <U+FB01>g. 2 the current is represented as owing
 through W; when from diffusion in an atmosphere of <U+FB01>re
damp, the conducting plug Hg is driven up to T l, the current
 will <U+FB02>ow through R, and the red light may then be taken to
indicate the presence of <U+FB01>re-damp.                                 ’

    The wires being within the tube, one or other of the lamps
must always be shining so long as there is a current, whether
the apparatus be in an atmosphere of <U+FB01>re-damp, choke-damp,
or air ; and to prevent the mercury being driven out of the
tube by too much ressure, bulbs are arranged on either side
as in <U+FB01>g. 3, whidh presents a diagrammatic view of the
apparatus. We have found an internal diameter of tubing
of about 3 millim. best adapted for ensuring easy mobility of
'the mercury. The presence of the wires within the tube has
interfered with the perfection of the seal ; this we have over
come bythe introduction of a little concentrated sulphuric acid,
which also serves the purpose of preventing sparking and of
lubricating the interior. The use of sulphuric acid necessi
tates the addition of desiccators a and 11, <U+FB01>g. 3, to each end
of the tube ; but in cases where it has been found advisable
not to use sulphuric acid, both the acid and the desiccators
have been dispensed with by slightly modifyin the arrange
ment of the wires at the lower part of the tube. €Vith this form
of apparatus we are readily able to detect the presence of 5 per
Cent. of coal-gas in a mixture of this gas with air 3 and with a
mercury seal of less weight and closer proximity of the wires
at T and T 1 (<U+FB01>g. 2), it appears possible to get any required
degree of sensitiveness. It is proposed to have the apparatus
<U+FB01>xed in the main roads and hauling roads in pit installations.

  XVIII. On certain Modi<U+FB01>cations of a Form of Spherical
    Integrator. By FREDERICK JOHN SMITH, B.A. 0won.*
 WHILE working atthe subject of Dynamometric Measure
          ments, a great number of different forms of mechanical
 integrators were attached to a. transmission—dynamometer
 (Phil. Mag. vol. xv. p.87). In one of these the small disk
 of a Morin integrator (Phil. Mag. vol. xvii. p. 59) was
 replaced by a sphere carried between four little cylinders;
 the sphere was made of phosphorbronze (Ashmol. Soc. 1884).
    As long as the dynamometer was driven with but little
 variation, the results were satisfactory; but as soon as one had to
 deal with quick variation,either of tension of belt or of velocity,
 it was found that the moment of inertia of the sphere was a
 serious obstacle to accurate results. It appeared probable that
 no instrument dependent upon the action of gravity could be
 relied upon. This being the case, it was evident that if a
 sphere was to be used it ought, in the <U+FB01>rst place, to be as light
                                 Fig. 1.
as practicable and, secondly, as <U+FB01>rmly held as possible from any~
sli . These two ends have been arrived at as follows :—The
sphere Q is made hollow in order to be li ht, and it moves
between six wheels ; of these, four wheels, D F G (<U+FB01>g. 1), are

in compression ; the frame is so moved, by means of a slot R
attached to the spring rod of the dynamometer, that the line
P M, and therefore the circle on the sphere rolling upon the
(glinder D, is proportional to the tension of the driving-belt ;
  0 cylinder K is driven at a rate proportional to the velocity
of the belt-speed, and the cylinder D is attached to a revo
lution-counter.    When the tension of the belt is constant, then
the revolution of D is proportional to the velocity.       When
the velocity is constant, the revolution is proportional to the
tension of the belt.    When both velocity and tension vary
together, then the revolution of D is proportional to the pro
duct of velocity and tension which is the work at any instant,
and the number of revolutions of D during any time is pro
portional to the work done during that time, and shows,
therefore, how much energy has been transmitted by the
dynamometer.
   In the <U+FB01>gures, for the sake of clearness, the frame which
carries the cylinders is omitted. The instrument which the
author of this communication has arrived at, is quite unaffected
by any rapid change either of velocity or tension of belt that
may take place while it is running._ The beautiful three-wheel
spherical integrator of Prof. Hele Shaw, which was applied
to the dynamometer, as long as it had to deal with slowly
varying velocity, acted very well indeed ; the idea of changing
the direction of the angle at which the poles of the sphere lie
in is taken from it.

          XIX. On hitherto unrecognized Wave-lengths.
             By Prof. S. P. LANGLEY, Allegheny, Pa.‘
                             [Plates IV.—VI.]
 WE have already‘l' presented a description of the method
       by which we are able to <U+FB01>x the wave-lengths in the solar
spectrum. by direct measurement as far as about 23,000 of
Angstriim’s scale. At this point the heat in the solar normal
spectrum had become so feeble that it taxed the utmost limits
of our capacity in 1881 to measure it; for it will be remem
bered that we are able to study the prismatic spectrum of the
infra-red with comparative ease, because the prism condenses
the heat ; but the grating greatly diffuses and weakens it, so
that, were it due to this cause alone, we should <U+FB01>nd measure
ments in this part of the grating spectrum enormously more
dif<U+FB01>cult than those in the prismatic. But, independently of
this, of the heat which belongs to any ray, our grating in
  eneral employs not over the tenth part. These causes com
liine to make the heat in certain portions, where we have been
compelled to measure, almost in<U+FB01>nitesimal.
    We are led to take this labour ; not primarily to settle the
theoretical questions involved in determining the relations
between dispersion and wave-length (though these are most
interesting), but with the object of providing a way which
will hereafter enable any observer to determine the visible or
invisible wave-lengths of any heat, whether from a celestial
or terrestrial source, observed in any prism ; and thus to gain
that knowledge of the intimate constitution of radiant bodies
which an acquaintance with the vibratory period of their
molecules can usually alone afford us. It is this considerable
end—the attempt to open up more fruitful means of research
in the whole unexplored region of infra-red energy, not only
from celestial but from terrestrial sources—which will, we
h0pe, justify the labour devoted to the following determina
tions. It may be hoped that wider interest will attach to our
task of demonstrating the character of a certain curve ; when
 it is seen that a knowledge of its true form has ceased to be a
 matter of abstract speculation only, but will, in connection
 with what has already appeared, now introduce to us such
large regions of research as we have just indicated. Over and
 above this, however, we shall <U+FB01>nd our results also affecting
 opinion on the theoretical considerations regarding the relation
 of wave-length and dispersion just alluded to.

  ‘In previous communications I have given a representation
of the solar-heat spectrum terminating near 2W7 or 2"'8, and
I have stated that while there were feeble indications of solar
heat below this point, yet that the solar radiation beyond
seemed sensibly cut off, as though below this were a nearly
unlimited cold band.       I do not mean then, in saying that
solar heat sensibly ceases below this point, to say that abso
lutely none can exist, but that none, at any rate, does exist
sensible to the delicate apparatus with which these <U+FB01>rst deter
minations were made, and that none in any case exists of an
order in the least comparable with the smaller portions of that
already described.
   The reader will gather a more clear conception of the dif<U+FB01>
culty of decision and of the almost in<U+FB01>nitesimal amount of this
solar heat,if itexist, by looking at Plate IV.<U+FB01>g. 1 ,in connection
with the statement that if there be any solar heat at 4" the
highest ordinate representing it, on the same scale as that
shown on the left of the Plate, would at any rate not occupy
the thickness of the horizontal line which represents the axis
of abscissae. However, since we are rather inclined to admit,
from our <U+FB01>nal experiments with our latest and most sensitive
apparatus, that heat of some kind reappears here (near 4"),
whether from the atmosphere of the sun, or elsewhere, insen
sible to the most delicate thermopile, and in any case, if it be
real, almost in<U+FB01>nitesimal in degree, or of the same order of
intensity with that in the lunar spectrum, our statement that
no sensible solar heat exists in this part of the spectrum must
be taken under this quali<U+FB01>cation.
                         NEW APPARATUS.
   The apparatus for the determination of wave-lengths in
connection with the <U+FB02>int-glass prism has been already
described'.     The following is the same in principle, with
certain chan es to adapt it either to the solar or electric
heat. Let 1 be the <U+FB01>rst slit (see Plate V). For solar
 heat it has doubly-moving jaws, controlled by a micro
meter-screw, while in the case of the electric arc we use a
 special form of slit surrounded by water, to be directly de
 scribed. G is the large concave grating. The massive beam A
carries the large rock-salt train 8,, L1, P, L,, B. G is <U+FB01>xed
at the extremit of the beam, so that its collimating axis
coincides with t at of L1; and by means of an automatic ap
paratus, not shown here, the slits S; S, are caused to lie always
in the same straight line at right angles to G S1.           Under

                    unrecognized Wave-lengths.                151
these-circumstances, it has been demonstrated by Prof. Row
land that the wave-length of light, passing through the slit S1
to fall upon the grating and there be diffracted to S2, is
directly proportional to the distance S1 S2. Accordingly,
owing to this extremely simple relation, we are able to state
at once what invisible ray or rays are at any moment passing
through the slit into our rock-salt train. Our engraving
represents the arrangement as <U+FB01>tted up for the heat of the
electric arc, which is placed immediately in front of the special
nozzle n carrying the slit S1. We wish to employ the arc
chie<U+FB02>y in the extreme infra-red beyond the solar heat, and
where any heat is exclusively minute. The hottest part of
the electric arc is found in the pit or crater of the positive
carbon, concealed from direct vision, and occupying a space
of only 3 or 4 millim. square, even in large arcs. The car;
bons, then, must be inclined in order that a horizontal beam
may escape from this almost hidden crater, which, owing to its
small size, should be brought nearly in contact with the slit,
in order to utilize the whole of its very minute area, while in
this case the inclination of the carbons will prevent such
approach. Experiments with various forms of incandescent
strips and carbons, directed by clockwork in the ordinary
position, have proved the necessity of adopting the special
device by which we have <U+FB01>nally, overcome these dif<U+FB01>culties.
Figure 3, Plate V., shows in section and in front view a
special slit, conical in form, around which a current of water
is forced to circulate. Figure 2 shows the carbons on a
smaller scale and the apparatus which permits them to be set
at any height, inclined at any angle to the vertical, drawn
back or approached to any distance. They are usually placed
almost in contact with the special slit $1; and the need of the
water circulation is obvious, were it only to prevent the sides
of the jaws of the slit from melting, as they would otherwise
soon do. There is, however, another necessity for this water
circulation. The need of a slit which may be arti<U+FB01>cially
cooled for measurements in the extreme infra-red of the spec
trum from the electric arc, is rendered evident when we state,
that for these extreme wave-lengths the arc radiation is com
paratively so small, that the heat from the hottest part of the
dazzling bright carbon does not very greatly exceed that from
a piece of melting ice. If, then, we are to. distinguish here
between the radiation which passes through the open slit from
the incandescent carbon, and that which comes from the
adjacent edges of the slit, which inevitably mingles more or
less with the former, the difference between the two tempera
tures must be made as great as possible.

152                   Prof. S. P. Langley on
   Following now on Plate V. the course of the ray from this
electric are, we observe that it falls on the grating G (to be
presently described), which spreads it out into not one but
many superposed spectra, distributed along the circumference
of a circle whose centre is at O equidistant from G, S1, and
S,. For clearer illustration, let us suppose ourselves about to
measure the heat in some ray of the visible spectrum such as
that near D, (whose wave-length is nearly 0‘6), and that the
line S, S, is a scale of equal parts. In this case, the beam A
will be moved so that, while the grating remains at the inter
section of N S and GA and normal to the latter, the slit S,
will be brought close to S1 in the position 0P6 on our scale of
equal parts, whose zero is at S1. Here (if we suppose sun
light to be employed) we shall see a brilliant spectrum <U+FB01>lled
with Fraunhofer lines crossing the front of the plate of the
slit 8,. Beyond this, the second, third, and other higher
orders of s ectra are distributed on the circumference of the
circle in w ich S, always lies. Were it our only object to
discriminate the heat in this particular visible ray, we should
not in this case need the slit S, or the prismatic train, but
could place the bolometer directly at S,. Since we make the
ordinary use of the slit S, however, we su pose ourselves to
be determining the prismatic dispersion <U+FB01>n a given wave
length; that is, it forms with the prismatic train an approxi
mately homogeneous spectral image at B, which can be viewed
or measured with the bolometer, giving the value of n for a
known value of 7t.      For the mere purpose of measuring the
heat in the ray, or determining its wave-len th here in the
visible part, where there is but a single sensible eat-spectrum,
we do not need slit S, at all; while the refractive index for a
  lass prism could be as easily determined as that for rock-salt.
Besides this, we should <U+FB01>n here a relatively abundant heat,
and could use so narrow a bolometer as to <U+FB01>x the position by
the heat alone quite accurately. Very different, however, are
all the conditions if we wish to measure, for example, a wave
length correspondin to 3" or 4" in the invisible spectrum and
in the new region w ich we are for the <U+FB01>rst time exploring.
Glass is impermeable to this kind of heat, but with our rock
salt train and with the delicate apparatus previously described,
there is little diiiiculty in discriminating it by the bolometer,
where the prism alone is employed, and in mapping the
deviation of each spectral ray, as shown in plate vi. (Phil. Mag.
May 1886). But now that we wish to determine wave-lengths,
the conditions are altogether different; for now not only does
the grating enormously expand this part of the spectrum and
diminish the heat correspondingly,just where that heat is itself

                      unrecognized Wave- lengths.                        153
feeblest (so that the heat in parts of this region is something
like 1—010-6 part of that in the corresponding prismatic spectrum),
but instead of one visible, we have now to deal with numerous
invisible spectra, overlapping each other.
   Here, then, the slit 82 has an additional function to ful<U+FB01>l,
namely, with the aid of the prism, to discriminate these
invisible spectra from each other. Thus in the position
actually shown in the drawing, which corresponds to a wave
length of 3"'5341, i. e. of 35,341 of An str'om, we should see
the slit covered by a bright spectrum ue to several of the
higher orders, while we know that energy of the wave-length
we are seeking is wholly invisible. If we place a pellet of
sodium in our electric are, we shall see the two sodium-lines
on the slit-plate, of which D, will fall exactly on the slit, if it
be in adjustment, but this sodium-line evidently does not
belong to the wave-length we are seeking.
   There are, in fact, passing through the same slit and lying
superposed on one another by an unavoidable property of the
grating, an in<U+FB01>nite number of spectra in theory, of which in
this case nearly 20 are actually recognizable by photography,
by the eye, or by the bolometer; and of which, to consider
only those where the wave-length is equal to or greater than
that of the sodium-line Df", we have six spectra as follows :—

It is in this invisible underlying 1st spectrum, buried, so to
speak, beneath <U+FB01>ve others, of which three are themselves in
visible also, that lies the wave-length we are seeking ; conse
quently there are (to consider no others) at least six qualities
of heat, of six distinct refrangibilities, whose wave-lengths are
equal to or greater than that of D2, which pass simultaneously
through the slit S2. They pass through the prism,and on lookin g
through a telescope occupying the position of the bolometer
tube, we shall, by suitably directing the arm of the spectroscope,
see the light from the sixth one at a.         Its wave-length will be
OF'5890, corresponding to a measured deviation (in the case
of the rock-salt prism of an angle of 60° 00’ OO” and a tem

 perature of 20° O.) of 41° 0540”.           Now, on replacing the
 telescope by the bolometer, the bolometer-wire will feel this
 same ray which the eye has just recognized by its li ht; and,
 if the galvanometer be in a sensitive condition, t 0 image
 will be thrown by the heat off the scale, while a little on either
 side of this position no indication will be given. The beam
 and the slit S2 remaining in the same position, let us next
 suppose that the bolometer-arm is carried towards b, in the
 direction of B. There will be no sensible de<U+FB02>ection until it
 reaches the position b in the red, corresponding to a wave
 length of OF'7068, and in the prism to an angle of 40° 33’
 nearly; .for there is no sensible heat except in the successive
 images of slit S, formed by the prism P in the line PB.
 Passing further toward B we come into the heat in c, and next
 to the heat in d, which is less than T256 that in the direct
 prismatic image, when no grating is employed.
    This was the utmost limit of our power of measurement in
 1883, beyond this point radiations from the grating being then
absolutely insensible, and the radiation at the point d itself
 being excessively minute, even in the solar spectrum, where
 the heat, so far as any is found, is as a rule far reater than
that in the spectrum of the arc. Accordingly                   have else
 where observed that these measures could be carried on as well
 by a large electric are as by the sun ; but in fact, owing to
the dif<U+FB01>culties attendant on bringing the are, which must be
of immense heat, close to slit S1, and to other causes, the sun
light would be preferable wherever it could be used.
   Our observation of June 7, 1882, gave the value of the
index of refraction corresponding to 7t=2w356, which was
the lowest possibl attainable by our then apparatus. Inces
sant practise an study, resulting in improvements already
referred to, have enabled us <U+FB01>nally to measure down to a
wave-length of 9x7xD2, corresponding to a position much
below       We may add that in doin so, it is sometimes con
venient to employ a bolometer wi e enou h to overlap the
images in the other adjacent spectra of t e higher orders,
which we may usually do without confusing them, owing to
their feebleness compared with that of the <U+FB01>rst spectrum in
which we are searching.
   We usually, however, employ a bolometer of not more than
1 millim. aperture, and this demands excessive delicacy in the
heat-measuring apparatus, since the heat here is, approxi
mately speaking, about 5735—0 of that in the region between the
sodium-lines in the direct spectrum of a rock-salt prism.

This is near the limit of our present measuring-powers with
the grating, even when every possible device is used to increase
the extremely feeble heat in this part of the spectrum.
    We commenced by using an electric arc with carbons 12
millim. in diameter in the position indicated. These were
supplied by an engine of three-horse power ; but even in this
case the pit'of the crater did not nearly cover the very short
slit (its length is 8 millim.).   For these last and most dif<U+FB01>cult
measurements we have been obliged to procure the use of an
engine of twelve-horse power and carbons 25 millim. in
diameter. With this enormous current the hottest part is not
easily maintained in place. To keep it directly in front of the
slit we have tried various plans, such as boring out the carbons
lengthwise so as to form hollow cylinders of them, and <U+FB01>lling
the core with a very pure carbon tempered to the requisite
 solidity.    Ordinarily it will be su<U+FB01>icient, however, to <U+FB01>rst
form the central crater by a drill. This gives us a persistent
crater, whose light, in the position shown in the engraving,
<U+FB01>lled a slit whose vertical height is 8 millim.     It is probably
 the intensest arti<U+FB01>cial heat ever subjected to analysis.
                            BOLOMETEB.
    The changes in the bolometer since it was <U+FB01>rst described
(‘ Proceedings American Academy,’ 1881) are su er<U+FB01>cial
 rather than radical, and refer chie<U+FB02>y to the form of the case,
 and facilities for its accurate pointing. The linear bolometer
 is now made to expose to the radiant heat a vertical tape or
 wire of platinum, iron, or carbon. This is usually about
 10 millim. long and only from T6156 to “1,6 millim. thick; but
 according to its special purpose it is made from 1 millim.
  to 0'04 millim. wide. In the latter case it a pears like the
 vertical strand of an ordinary reticule in the ocus of a posi
 tive eyepiece attached to the case, and is movable by a
 micrometer-screw. It is in fact in appearance a micrometer
  thread, controlled in the usual way, but which is connected
 with the galvanometer and endowed with the power of feelin
 the radiations, visible or invisible, from any object to whic
  it is directed. For very feeble sources of heat, such as those
  with which we are here concerned, the strip is made as much
 {as               in width,

  positions are read by the divided circle of t e spectrometer
 to 10” (ten seconds of arc). It is this simple form of the
 instrument which has been used in the present investigation,
 andwhichlis shown in Plate IV. <U+FB01>g. 2. The bolometer is shown
  in position in the middle of the case, where its central strip

156                » Prof. S. P. Langley on
is accurately self-centred in the cylinder. For protection
from air-currents, since the obscure heat studied will be
stopped by a glass cover, we must make use of the special
device I have described in the memoir just referred to, of
successive chambers or drums separated by diaphragms with
a common central aperture.
   With these precautions, and with the special adjuncts
before described, a bolometer with a strip 215 millim. wide
can be set by the invisible heat alone to within 10” of arc,
while in the ordinary use of the linear thermopile we are
liable to errors of a considerable fraction of a degree. Even
with a bolometer 1 millim. wide, it will be subsequently seen,
we can set to one minute of arc. This refers only to the
precision of pointing attainable ; we will consider the sensi
tiveness of the instrument later in connection with the
galvanometer.
                         GALVANOMETER.
   It must be remembered that while the nominal sensitive
ness of a galvanometer can be increased to any extent by
increasing the astaticism of the needle (quite as nominal
power can be multiplied to any extent on a telescope by
altering lenses at the eyepiece), that the real or working
capacity depends upon the ability to always obtain a like
result under given conditions. Accordingly we have con
tinued to devote great pains to extend our original concep
tion, so as to make the galvanometer, as well as the bolometer,
not merely an indicator of heat, but a real “meter,” which
shall distinctly answer the question “how much ?” as to almost
in<U+FB01>nitely minute amounts of energy.
   For the bene<U+FB01>t of any physicists who may desire to repeat
these experiments, we may observe that we have found the
bolometer capable of almost unlimited delicacy of perception
of heat, but that our chief trouble has arisen from the dif<U+FB01>
culty of constructing a galvanometer suitable to develop its
full capacity for exact measurement. We have been unable
to <U+FB01>nd among galvanometers ordinarily constructed one
capable of indicating with precision changes in the amount
of current of much less than m6 of an ampere. It was in
the construction of a galvanometer designed to measure the
heat in the spectrum of the moon, that we acquired the ex
perience which we have utilized in the present researches.
   A re<U+FB01>ecting-galvanometer of the form devised by Sir
William Thomson has been used for the basis of our construc
tion and altered as follows.      (For several of the changes
described I am indebted for suggestions due to the great

                      unrecognized Wave-lengths.                        157
kindness of Sir William Thomson and Professor Rowland.)
First, the short suspending <U+FB01>bre supplied by the makers has
been replaced by one 33 centim. in length, stretched and pre
pared with particular care. Next, since the effect of a given
minute change of current is proportionable (other things
being equal) to the magnetic moment, and to the minuteness
with which the angular de<U+FB02>ection of the needle can be read,
we have reconstructed the mirror and needles as follows :—
For the magnets* soft sheet steel 216 of a millim. thick is
rolled up into minute hollow cylinders, each about 8 millim.
long and about 1 millim. diameter. These are hardened and
made to take a permanent charge of nearly 900 Gaussian
units.       Ten of these are placed behind the back of the mirror
 and ten below, making twenty in all. The re<U+FB02>ecting mirror
 is accurately concave, being specially worked for the pur
 pose, 9'5 millim. in diameter, 1 metre radius of curvature,
 weighing 63 milligrammes, and platinized on the front face
 by the discharge in vacuo of platinum electrodes, by the
 process of Prof. WrightT, of Yale College. The stem which
 unites the upper and lower system of the magnets is a hair
 like and hollow tube of glass, while it occurred to me to re~
 place the aluminum vane of the ordinary instruments by the
 wings of a dragon-<U+FB02>y (Libellula), in which nature offers a
 model of lightness and rigidity quite inimitable by art.
     The glass plate which encloses the front of the galvanometer
 has optically plane and parallel sides, and the screen, placed
 at 1 metre distance from the mirror, is a portion of a cylinder
  1 metre in radius, divided into 500 divisions of 1 millim. each.
 The optical arrangements for illuminating and forming an
 image of the wire form one of such precision that a motion
 of 1%, of one of these divisions can be distinctly noted. There
 is an independent provision, by means of which the image of
 a second opaque and inverted scale can be viewed by the
 observer through a telescope, not, as in the ordinary construc
 tion, directed onto a <U+FB02>at attached to the needles, but in which
 the concave mirror, already described, becomes the mirror of
 a Herschelian telescope itself. Ordinarily the condition of
  astaticism of the needle is such that, without any damping
 magnet, it will execute a single vibration in not less than 15
 nor more than 30 seconds. Much greater sensitiveness can
 be given to it, of course, but without, as we have found, cor
 responding advantage.
     ’ The design and construction of the hollow magnets is due to Mr. F.
 W. Very of this Observatory.
    '1' Prof. Wright has had the goodness to platinize these delicate mirrors
 for us himself.                                                              ‘

 158                 Prof. S. P. Langley on
   For the purpose of forming an estimate of the sensitiveness
of the instrument it may be statedthat, when making a single
vibration in 20 seconds, a de<U+FB02>ection of 1 millim. division of
the scale is given by a current of 0'000,000,000,5 amperes ;
and, as we have just remarked, a tenth of one of these divi
sions can be discriminated. That this degree of sensitiveness
is associated with a real, and not nominal corresponding degree
of accuracy, is shown by the fact that many series of accord
ant measurements have been made when the maximum de
<U+FB02>ection did not exceed three such divisions ; and that similar
measures have been made in the invisible spectrum given by
ice melting in a dark room, when the maximum de<U+FB02>ection
observed was 1'6 millim., and most de<U+FB02>ections less than one
millimetre. On the other hand the exposure of the same
bolometer to ordinary direct sunlight with only T0156 of the
current passing, 1'. e. with the galvanometer shunted 1000
times, would drive the needle immediately, and with violence,
of? the scale.
    Our experience has shown us that this galvanometer, in
 conjunction with such a bolometer as we have described, is
 capable of recording a disturbance of rather less than 1,000,300,”,
 part. To attain corresponding accuracy in gravity determi
 nations we should need to have a balance capable of weighing a .
 kilogramme, which would give atthe same time an unequivocal
 de<U+FB02>ection for a difference of one one-thousandth of a milli
 gramme in either pan. A de<U+FB02>ection of 1 millim. corresponds,
 in the case of such a bolometer as we have used in the lunar
 spectrum, or in that of melting ice, to a change of temperature
 in the bolometer-strips considerably less than m of a degree
 Centigrade, and we have just seen that about filof this can
 be shown. In other words, about one one-milliont of a degree
 can be indicated by it, and a quantity less than one one
 hundred-thousandth of a degree, not only indicated, but
 measured. It will be obvious to the practised observer that
 this degree of accuracy will not be in reality reached unless
 the bolometer-strips are perfectly protected from all extra
 neous radiations and air-currents, and especially unless the
 image is <U+FB01>xed upon the scale when the bolometer is not ex
 posed to heat. This degree of precision we believe ourselves
 to have actually obtained.
                            GRATINGS.
   Of the concave gratings we have three, of the very largest
size. These magni<U+FB01>cent instruments we owe, not only to the
skill, but to the special kindness of Prof. Rowland, who has

                       unrecognized Wave-lengths.                       159
been good enough to execute them for us of the very short.
focus and open ruling necessary for our particular work.
    Let us designate them as rating No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3.
The dimensions of grating o. 1 have been given in a prior
memoir, but we repeat them here with some other data, for
the reader’s convenience. The limit of precision imposed by
the use of the bolometer makes it super<U+FB02>uous to introduce
any temperature-correction, or to give the <U+FB01>gures with more
exactness than we here do.

    The ruled portion of each of these truly superb instruments:
occupies from 100 to 150 centim. On their exquisite de<U+FB01>ni
tion we need not enlarge, since su<U+FB02><U+FB01>cient of them are now in.
the hands of physicists to make our commendation super
 <U+FB01>uous.
    We have already described the action of the grating.                The
 essential feature, for our purpose is that, under the stated
 conditions, we can in theory be absolutely sure of the wave
 length of the invisible ray under examination by choosing it
 a multiple of the wave-length of some visible line in the
 superposed spectrum which is coincident with slit 8,.
  . Thus in the case of our illustration, we have supposed the
 sodium-line to be used, since this is conspicuous in that of
 the sun and easily reproduced in that of the arc. The wave
 len th we are in search of is always a times the wave-length
 of g, (a being some aliquot number). In practice we thus for
 greater certainty always form the image of some line in the
 visible spectrum on slit S,, although, as already explained, its
 mere position on the line S1 S, is, if the apparatus be in ad
 justment, a guarantee that none but the exact ray and its
 multiples come under examination.
     ‘                       Lnxsns AND PRISMS.
     The rock-salt lenses L, L, are of di<U+FB01>'erent focal lengths for
 different occasions. For the extremely feeble heat we are
 considering, we are using very clear and perfectly <U+FB01>gured

  160                   Prof. S. P. Langley on
 salt-lenses of 75 millim. aperture and 350 millim. focus ; this
 small ratio of aperture to focus in the lenses bein required
 to economise the feeble heat as much as possible. {The prism
 used with them is <U+FB01>rst set to minimum deviation on some
 visible line, and then automatically kept there for the invisible
 ray under consideration.
     We owe these specimens of rock-salt to the particular kind
 ness of Prof. Hastings, of Yale College, and their extremely
 exact surfaces to Mr. Brashear, of Allegheny, the maker of
 the surfaces on which the Rowland gratings are ruled. On
 this portion of the apparatus alone very great labour has been
 expended.
     We have procured, through Mr. Brashear’s skill, by means
 previously described, a rock-salt prism having a <U+FB01>eld <U+FB01>lled
 with Fraunhofer lines, and showin             distinctly the nickel line
between the D’s.         This is when        rst polished as it comes
 from the maker’s hands, but owing to the deliquescent nature
 of the material, with the utmost care, the surfaces rapidly
 deteriorate. As it is necessary for the precision of these re
 searches to determine the refracting angle of the prism, and
 also the indices of refraction of some of the principal lines in
 its visible and invisible spectrum, with a high degree of
 accuracy, and as all these labours have to be repeated when
 the prism is repolished, some idea of the labour in this portion
 alone may be understood, when it is stated that the prism
 has been sent to the maker and entirely re<U+FB01>gured, and its
principal constants redetermined by us no less than thirteen
times in the past fourteen months, or since the let of January
 1885 *.
    We now give two examples of actual measurement of wave
lengths ; the <U+FB01>rst, that in sunlight in a <U+FB02>int prism, which we
have designated as No. 2 ; the second in the rock-salt prism
just mentioned.

   Making the galvanometer-de<U+FB02>ections ordinates, and the
prismatic deviations abscissae, a smooth curve through the
points of observation gives in the <U+FB01>rst case a maximum at
48° 54'.      The image of the slit has a certain size, and so has
the bolometer-strip. The latter feels the heat before the
centre of strip and image coincide ; and it is this point of the
coincidence of centres which gives the maximum as denoted
by the above <U+FB01>gures.
  ' It must be understood that this is the total current of the battery.
The differential current which passes through the galvanometer is of an
altogether different order of magnitude, in this case probably not ex
ceeding O‘OO0,000,01 am ere.

    We now make a Second Series, and though the two series
 follow each other at a brief interval on a day described as
 “clear,” the values of the de<U+FB02>ections in the second series
 on the same points indicate nearly twice the heat in the
<U+FB01>rst.    The change is due to the altered diathermancy of
the'apparently clear sky in the brief interval. It is one of
the dif<U+FB01>culties already signalized by the writer and by others *,
and is to be eliminated only by repeated observation. The
second series, however, gives the same value as the <U+FB01>rst, and
hence we conclude (as far as this day’s observation goes)
that this was the index of refraction, for the wave-length in
question and for a certain <U+FB02>int prism. Such observations
must generally be repeated on many days before a reliable
result is reached; and in the case of the glass prism, which
grows rapidly athermanous just beyond the limit of the solar
spectrum, they are limited by the nature of the substance to
little more than the wave-length in question.
   We now consider, as our second example, a measurement
at 5x7tD2, where glass can hardly be used, and where its
place is supplied by the rock-salt prism, and that of the sun
  y the arc.

   The preceding examples will suf<U+FB01>ciently indicate the means
used in making the following measurements of wave-length
with the grating, which have been carried on continuously
from December 1885 to April 1886. As a rule, each of the
sixty-two determinations in the following Table represents
one or more da 's’ labour, thongh in some cases two or more
determinations have been secured in the same day.

   They have been taken under the following conditions:—
   (1) In the case even of the very lowest wave-lengths in
the feeblest heat we have been able to use a linear bolometer
of not more than 1 millim. width.
    (2) About an equal number of observations were intended
to, have been taken with the prism placed so as to throw the
spectrum east and west. In doing this a minute systematic
error, amounting, at the greatest, to less than 1' of arc, was
found to be caused by <U+FB02>exure of the arm, due to the weight
of the bolometer cable, and a correction for this has been
applied. Otherwise the observations are given as originally
made; and as the “probable error” includes all the more
or less systematic differences, due to the use of different
gratings and different positions of the apparatus, it may be
considered to be in this case a. fair indication of the amount
of error to be actually expected.
    We do not know of any determination of the change pro
duced in the refractive power of a rock-salt prism by varying
temperature. A rough comparison of the deviations of
Fraunhofer lines, incidentally measured in the progress of
                                                                Q
the work at different seasons, during which the temperature
has varied nearly 30° 0., together with the results of a single
day’s measures at temperatures differing by 17° 0., have con
curred in indicating a diminution in the deviations through
out the visible spectrum of about 11” for a rise of temperature
of 1°- C.
    We do not doubt that a temperature-correction is also
required for the invisible spectrum; but not having yet been
able to satisfactorily determine any, we think it best to leave
all the observations as they stand, uncorrected for tempera
ture, and offer them under this reserve now, with the inten
tion of returning to them hereafter.
    1n the following Table we repeat, for convenience, the
 results of certain optical measures made on September 14th,
 1885, by Mr. J. E. Keeler with the rock-salt prism, whose
refracting-angle was on that date 59° 57' 54”, and which we
 have reduced to 60° by the formula given in this Journal
 for May 1886. The wave-lengths are those due to Peirce’s
and Rowland’s corrections of Angstrom, with which we have
 been obliged by the authors before their formal publication.
     In the succeeding portion of the Table we have the re
 sults of measures made with the bolometer in the invisible
 spectrum.     The <U+FB01>rst column ives the source of heat; the
 second the wave-length selecte    for measurement; the third
 the grating employed; the fourth the refracting-angle of the
 prism on the day of observation; the <U+FB01>fth the temperature

                                 unrecognized Wave-lengths.                                         165
   of the apparatus; the Sixth the observed deviation; the
   seventh the mean deviation corrected for <U+FB01>exure error and
   reduced to a refracting-angle of 60° ; the eighth the resulting
   index of refraction for rock-salt.

   In Plate VI. we have graphically constructed the relations
between n and 7t for the rock-salt prism, as far as the above
wave-length of 5“'3011 or 0'0053 millim. The ordinates are
  roportional to the indices of refraction given on the axis of
T, the abscissae to the wave-lengths on the axis of X.            The
two vertical dotted lines carry the eye down to the corre
sponding portion of the spectrum, which is visible. Between
these lines lie the points of the visible spectrum observed,
and the dotted curves show the results of extrapolations by
various formulae.                                                  '
    The actual points settled by observation are certain mul
tiples of the wave-length D2 (0'0005890 millim.), and a small
circle whose diameter equals a unit in the third decimal
place of the scale of ordinates (indices) gives the position
<U+FB01>xed by observation, while the distance from the centre at
which the smooth curve cuts the little circle furnishes a
graphic representation of its difference from observation. The
labours of the past year, then, have enabled us to absolutely and
directly measure the index of refraction of rays whose wave
lengths are greater than O'OO5 millim., or, more exactly, which
reach 53011 of Angstriim’s scale ; and to do so with an error
which is probably in most cases con<U+FB01>ned to the fourth decimal
place of the index. As we shall see more clearly by Plate VL,
the relation between n and )t has changed from that appa
rently complex one we see in the visible spectrum, so that 1:
becomes almost a simple linear function of 7t, and the results
of extrapolation grow to a higher order of trustworthiness
 than when made from points in the visible spectrum alone.
     It appears to us that no formula of dispersion with which
 we are acquainted* gives entirely correct results on extra
polation, but that among the best are Briot’s and Wiillner’s.
We have computed the wave-lengths corresponding to indices
 of refraction from observed deviations in the visible s iectrum
 according to these formulae. The curve from auchy’s
 formula we do not give, because (at least when not more than
 three terms are taken from observations in the visible part of
 the spectrum) its results are here of little value, since it
 declares all the radiations we are now actuall dealing with
 to be impossible of discrimination at all. ftedtenbacher’s
 formula we have also shown in a previous memoir to be
 scarcely worth further consideration. The graphically con
 structed values are obtained by applying the formula of
 Briot,
    ’ That proposed by Ketteler has come _to the writer’s knowledge too
 late for trial here.

                 H,(>.=0»-3968, n=1-56833).
    All these are in the visible spectrum, and from them the
 constants a, b, c, k, P, &c. are determined. With their aid
 we next inquire by the formula what wave-lengths correspond
 to certain given indices, and the resultant values in the infra
 red are then plotted from these computations.       Itis, however,
 only just to observe that the wide departure from observation
 here shown is by no means to be wholly attributed to error
 in the formula ; for minute errors of measurement, such as are
 always present even in the observations in the visible spec
 trum, are immensely exaggerated by extending the curve
 through extrapolation. Wiillner’s formula, for instance,
 would give a line closely coincident with our curve in the
 infra-red if we took all our points for computation from that
 part of the spectrum. A similar remark may be made of
 Briot’s equations, whose actual tracing, however, with the
 constants we obtain from the visible spectrum, shows that
 beyond a certain point the, curve, which is its geometrical
 representation, from being concave to the axis of X, becomes
 convex, so that the relation between n and 7» would, according
 to it, be represented by a sinuous line; and this is not so
  within the limits of these observations. Its fair agreement
  with observation, then, within the limits of the visible spectrum
 and the upper part of the solar infra-red are all that can be
 claimed for it. Our conclusion is that all theories of disper
 sion known to us prove inadequate to predict the relation
 between wave-length and refraction. The actual relation
 from direct investigation is here given for the <U+FB01>rst time from
 the observations of the past year, which, it will be seen, thus

con<U+FB01>rm and greatly extend the results of 1882 and 1884.
Their most salient feature is still perhaps that already noted,
i. e. while the curvature, as far as we can follow it, grows less
and less, at the last point at which we can view it the curve
is not only all but sensibly a straight line, but one making a
very de<U+FB01>nite angle with the axis of X. This obviously means
that beyond this point n is nearly a linear function of 7\., or
that the simple equation n=a7t would very closely represent
this portion of the curve. It means also that, as far as these
observations extend, we <U+FB01>nd scarcely any limit to the index
 of the ray which the prism can transmit except from its own
 absorption. I do not, it will be observed, undertake to
advance without limit beyond observation, or to discuss what
would happen with wave-lengths so great that the index be
 came 0 or negative, as it would with an inde<U+FB01>nite prolonga
 tion of the curve, if its direction remain unaltered. An
 intelligible physical meaning might perhaps be attached to
 these cases ; but I here con<U+FB01>ne myself to the results of
 direct observation and to the now established fact that the
 increase of the crowding together of the rays at the red end,
 which is so conspicuous a feature in the upper prismatic
 spectrum, has almost wholly ceased, and that the dispersion
 has become approximately uniform, the action of the prism
 here being assimilated to that of the di<U+FB01>'raction-grating itself.
 I shall not venture to treat of the theoretical import of this,
 further than to remark that the ordinary interpretation of
  Cauchy’s theory will apparently lead us to conclude that dis
 persion must sensibly cease at the point where the wave is so
 long that the size of the components of matter is negligible
 in comparison. In other theories, also, there appears to be a
 point below which the index of refraction should never fall ;
 and we might anticipate that the curve would accordingly
 tend to become parallel to the axis of X. Of course we
 cannot assert from observation that it will not <U+FB01>nally do so ;
  but within the very extended limits in which we have fol
  lowed it the contrary happens, and the curve presents a
  continuously increasing angle with that axis.                       ‘
      These results, then, in some material points are in contra
 diction to what has usually hitherto been believed *.
      Let me repeat that one consequence of the fact that the
     it I am very desirous that they should be veri<U+FB01>ed by physicists, and I
 have therefore given particulars in some detail of my methods and appa
 ratus here. 1 have requested the skilful artists (Mr. William Grunow,
 Mechaniciau to the U. S. Military Academy, West Point, N.Y., and Mr.
 .T. A. Brashear, Allegheny, Penn.) who have so successfully constructed
 this apparatus to place at the command of physicists all or any details
 of it.

170                  vProf. S. P. Langley on
curve is approaching a straight line is that, unless there is
some immediate change in its character, such as we have no
right to expect, extrapolation considerably beyond the point
to which we have measured will be comparatively easy and
safe. I am aware of the danger attending all extrapolation,
but I must insist upon the fact that the old ones, which we
have seen falsi<U+FB01>ed by experiment, rested on an extremely
limited region of the curve, that namely for the visible region
of the spectrum, in which the relation between n and 7t is also
wholly different; while those on which we now brie<U+FB02>y enter
depend upon far greater material for induction (about eight
times that included in the visible spectrum), which we can
also use under much more favourable conditions.
    Since the curve still presents a slight convexity to the axis
of abscissaa, unless its character changes in a way which we
have no ground to expect, a tangent at any point will meet
that axis sooner than the curve itself will. Accordingly, if
we now ask what wave-length corresponds to any point in the
hitherto unexplored region, for instance the maximum in the
 spectrum of boiling water, whose index * for the 60° rock-salt
 prism is 15145, or that of melting ice, whose index is 15048,
 we can answer as follows: <U+FB01>rst, this unknown wave—length
 is at any rate greater than 5‘3, since to this point we have
 investigated by direct measurement; second, since the tangent
 to our curve, even at the point 5", meets the line correspond
 ing to the index of the maximum heat in boiling water at
 over 7", and a line corresponding to the maximum ordinate
 in the spectrum of melting ice at over 10 , and since the
 curve without some change in its essential character cannot
 meet these lines, save at still greater wave-lengths, it follows
 that the wave-length of the maximum of the spectrum from
 boiling water is probably at least '0075 millim., and that of
 the maximum in the spectrum from melting ice is over 0'01
 millim. In an article in the Comptes li’endus of the In
 stitute of France, Jan. 18, 1886, and in preliminary memoirs,
 we deferred giving the actual values, but gave (explicitly as
 minimum values which we believed much within the truth)
 5“L to 6". That our caution led us to understate the, even
 then, most probable value, may be seen from the statements
 just made, which are founded on still later observations.
    As we proceed further out, extrapolation becomes, of
course, more untrustworthy. We can only say that if the
curve maintains its present inclination to the axis of X, the
wave-lengths of the extreme radiations recognized in the
rock-salt prism must inde<U+FB01>nitely exceed 0'03 millim.              '

   We have shown that the various complex formulae founded
on theoretical considerations differ from observation ; and as
we have remarked, they have the minor objection also of
being extremely di<U+FB02>icult of application to practical uses,
owing to the inordinately tedious numerical computations
involved where many places are to be calculated.
    Struck by the resemblance of the actual curve of observa
tion, as viewed in a large graphical construction, to a hyper
bola, I was therefore led some years ago to use the equation
of the hyperbola as an empirical one for interpolations in the
infra-red without attaching any physical meaning to it. The
further the investigation has been pushed in that part of the
spectrum, the more exact the resemblance has become. That
it is notable will be seen on consulting Plate VI.*, where the
hyperbola does not appear as a distinct curve, because its
variation from the smooth curve of observation cannot be
recognized on this scale.
    In obtaining this we have proceeded as follows z—Having
<U+FB01>ve disposable constants, we have taken <U+FB01>ve nearly equidistant
point-s on the smooth curve of observation, remembering that
if the axis of Y is not exactly asymptotic to the curve thus
described, we are not necessarily to impute the difference to
a fault in the equation chosen, since the condition that the
curve of observation shall be rigorously asymptotic to this
axis can in any case only be satis<U+FB01>ed by in<U+FB01>nite exactness of
measurement.
   It will be observed that my estimates of the extreme wave
lengths are in no way founded on the rise of this hyperbola,
and that I do not assert that it has any physical meaning.
    I have elsewhere observed that, while Herschel in 1840,
 Draper in 1842, Fizeau and Foucault in 1846, Lamansky in
 1870, with others since, had observed bands in the infra-red
prior to 1881, yet that nothing was exactly known as to the
wave-lengths of these bands, even to those who discovered
them. It is very likely that the (probably telluric) absorp
tion-band in the solar spectrum placed on our chart (Comptes
 Rendus, Sept. 11, 1882) at 1"'38 has been recognized by
more than one of the above-mentioned observers, yet so little
was known as to its actual position even a few years since,
that we <U+FB01>nd the elder Draper, in reviewing these discoveries
in 1881, and speaking with the authority of one who was
himself a discoverer, expressing his doubt as to the possibility
of any wave-length so great as 1"'08 having really been

computations are founded have been added Since this drawing was pre

    Broadly speaking, we have learned, through the present
measures with certainty, of wave-lengths greater than 0005
millim., and have grounds for estimating that we have recog
nized radiations whose wave-length exceeds 0'03 millim. ; so
that while we have directly measured to nearly 8 times the
wave-length known to Newton, we have probable indications
of wave-lengths far greater, and the gulf between the shortest
vibration of sound and the longest known vibration of the
 ether is now in some measure bridged over.

XXI. Notes on Magnetism—I. On the Energy of lMagnetized
             Iron. By Lord RAYLEIGH, Sec. R.S.*
THE splendid achievements of the last ten years in the
       practical application of Magnetism have given a re
newed impetus to the study of this subject which is sure to
bear valuable fruit. Especially to be noted are two memoirs
recently published in the ‘ Philosphical Transactions’ of the
Royal Society, by Prof. Ewing‘l', and by Dr. Hopkinsoni,
in which are detailed very important data derived from labo
rious experiment, accompanied by much interesting and sug
gestive comment.
   The results of observation are usually expressed, after the
example of Rowland and Stoletow, in the form of curves
showing the relation between 5B and 8?, the magnetic induc
tion and the magnetizing force. It may be well here to recall
the convention in accordance with which 85 is measured.                   At
any point in air, the magnetic force is de<U+FB01>ned in an ele
mentary manner, and without ambiguity, but when we wish
to speak of magnetic force in iron, further explanation is
needed. The continuity of the iron is supposed to be inter
rupted by an in<U+FB01>nitely thin crevasse in the interior of which
we ima ine the measurement to be effected. If the crevasse
is para lel to the direction of magnetization, the force thus
found is denoted b 31 and is independent of free magnetism
on the walls of the crevasse. If, however, the crevasse be
perpendicular to the lines of force, there is a full development
of free magnetism (3) upon the walls, and the interior force is
now 58, equal to @+4n-S.         In the estimation of {b (as well
as of 23) the in<U+FB02>uence of all free magnetism, not dependent
upon the imaginary interruption of continuity, is of course to
be included. On this account the value of g in the interior,
and even at the centre, of a bar of iron placed in an otherwise
uniform magnetic <U+FB01>eld, is greatly reduced, unless the length
of the bar be a very large multiple of the diameter.
   Experiment shows that the relation of 23 to .\§ is not of a
determinate character.       In a cycle of operations, during
which .9 is <U+FB01>rst increased, and is afterwards brought back to
its original value, the induction 23 is always greater on the
descending than on the ascending course. This phenomenon,
which is exempli<U+FB01>ed familiarly by the retention of magnetism
in a bar after withdrawal of the magnetizing force, is

cable to very soft iron, conducted
round a cycle from strong nega
tive to strong positive magneti
zation and back again. The
“residual magnetism” or“ re
tentiveness ” (OE) amounts to a
large fraction (sometimes to 93
per cent.) of the maximum.
   The work spent in carrying
the iron round a magnetic cycle
is represented by — S3 d@, as
was <U+FB01>rst shown by Warburg *,
who supposes the magnetic force
operative upon the soft iron to
be due to permanent magnets,
and variable with their position.
The work required to carry the
permanent magnets through the              A
proposed cycle of motions is then
proved to have the above written value, applicable to the unit
of volume of the soft iron.       If 3 were proportional to b, or
even related to it in any determinate manner, the integral
Would vanish; but on account of hysteresis it has a <U+FB01>nite
value.
   So long as we limit our attention to complete cycles, we

 When, however, we wish to consider incomplete cycles, espe
cially with reference to the behaviour of soft iron, it is more
suitable to take 3‘ as independent variable. We are led
naturally to this form if we suppose that, as in the more im
portant practical applications, the varying magnetizing force
is due to an electric current, upon which the magnetized iron
 reacts inductively‘l'.

      ut it is by no means a matter of indifference whether we
take <U+FB01> d-b or .@ (1%. The difference between the two modes of
reckoning may be exempli<U+FB01>ed in the case of iron already
nearly “ saturated,” and exposed to an increasing force.
Here 528 d@ is large, while Sb (12') is small ; so that the latter
corresponds better with the changes which we suppose to be
taking place in the iron, as well as to the circumstances of
ordinary practice.
    Let us now consider a little more closely the cycle of <U+FB01>g. 1.
 From A to B, @ is negative, while (123 is positive; so that
along AB the inductive electromotive force is in aid of the
current, and work is received from the iron of amount repre
sented _by the area ABM. From B to D, .9 is positive as well
as d23, and work represented by BDN B may be supposed to
be ut into the iron. From D to E, work, represented by
NE , is received from the iron, and from E to A work, repre
sented by AME, is expended. From this we see that not only
is work, represented by the area ABCDEA, dissipated in the
complete cycle, but that at no part of the cycle is there more
than an insigni<U+FB01>cant fraction of work recovered. The case is
not one of a storing of energy recoverable with a small rela
tive loss, but rather one of almost continuous dissipation.
    And here the question is forced upon us, whether it is true,
 as is usually supposed, that the strong residual magnetism at
   Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 22. No. 135. August 1886.          N

178                    Lord Rayleigh on the
E is really a store of energy. From the fact that the mag
netism may be got rid of by very moderate tapping, we may
infer, I admit, that some energy is necessarily dissipated in
passing from the magnetized to the unmagnetized condition,
but the dissipation may be exceedingly small ; and the argu
ment is not conclusive, since the mechanical energy of the
vibrations may be involved in the process. If we attempt to
demagnetize the iron in a straightforward manner by the
application of a reversed force, following the course indicated
by EFGO, then, so far from recovering, we actually expend
energy—that, namely, represented by the area EFGOE. For
practical purposes, at any rate, it would seem that magnetized
iron cannot be regarded as the seat of available energy.
    The opposite Opinion, which is widely entertained, appears
to depend upon insuf<U+FB01>cient observance of the distinction, vital
to this subject, between closed and unclosed magnetic circuits.
It is not disputed that available energy accompanies the mag
netization of a short bar of iron, but this is in virtue of the
free polarity at the ends. The work stored is in fact that
which might be obtained, were the bar <U+FB02>exible, by allowing
the ends to approach one another, under their mutual attrac
tion. When this operation is <U+FB01>nished, so that the bar has
become a ring, there is no longer any work to be got out of
it, though it remains magnetized.
    In further illustration of this matter, reference may be -
made to some interesting observations by Elphinstone and
Vincent * on closed magnetic circuits. As is well known, the
armature of a horseshoe electromagnet remains strongly
attracted after cessation of the battery-current. If, even after
a considerable interval of time, the coils of this electromagnet
were connected with those of a second electromagnet also
provided with an armature, and the <U+FB01>rst armature were then
violently pulled away, attraction set in and persisted between
the second armature and its electromagnet, the magnetism of
the original circuit being as it were transferred to the second.
Or, if a galvanometer were substituted for the second electro
magnet, a de<U+FB02>ection followed the forcible withdrawal of the
armature. In these experiments the necessary energy is
obtained, not from the magnetism of the closed circuit, but
from the work done in opening it, that is in pulling away
the armature.
 . These considerations lead me to differ from Prof. Ewing
when he says T :——“ In connection with ‘ secondary generators’
and induction-coils generally, the bearing of the <U+FB01>rst part of

this paper should be noted, as showing the enormous advantage
which a ring-shaped core, or core forming a complete ma -
netic circuit, possesses over a short bar-core with ends. §n
an ordinary induction-coil, so long as the current in the
primary circuit is merely made and broken, a short core is
necessary, since a ring-core would lose but a small percentage
of its magnetism at each brake, but Where reversal of the
magnetizing takes place, a core approximating to the con-'
dition of endlessness has an advantage in respect of power.
which <U+FB01>g. 3 makes obvious.”             I confess that I do not follow
this. It seems to me, on the contrary, thata closed magnetic
circuit is above all things to be avoided, as leading to waste of
the greater part of the power transferred.
   A like objection applies to the use of a closed electroé
magnet as a “throttle ” in an alternate-current circuit.
   When we know, as from Prof. Ewing’s results, the be-'
haviour of a iven sample of iron under the in<U+FB02>uence of
various forces‘éactually operative, we can deduce by means of
Poisson’s theory the magnetism assumed by ellipsoids of any

In order to <U+FB01>nd the points Q, Q’ appropriate to the ellipsoid
(50:1) from P, P’, we have merely to measure PQ, P’Q'
equal to RM. We thus obtain the curve AQEQ’FO, on
which the points of zero magnetization are the same as on
the original curve *. We see that a much stronger <U+FB01>eld is
now required to produce the higher degrees of magnetization,
and that there is less hysteresis—the ma netic state is more
nearly a de<U+FB01>nite function of the externa <U+FB01>eld. A similar
construction might be used reversely to pass from observed
results relative to ellipsoids of moderate elongation to the
curve appropriate to ellipsoids of in<U+FB01>nite elongation, on which
alone we can base our views of the real character of magnetic
media.
   Prof. Ewing has traced by experiment the in<U+FB02>uence of
various degrees of elongation on the magnetism of c lindrical
rods. Results of this kind are exhibited in his                  . 3, but
they are not strictly comparable with those obtained above,
not only because the latter relate to ellipsoids, but also on
account of the different character of the magnetic operations
represented. His curves begin at a condition of zero <U+FB01>eld
and zero magnetization.
   The work expended in producing a small change of mag
netization of the ellipsoid, acted upon by a uniform <U+FB01>eld, is
Edi) simply per unit of volume. This we may see, perhaps
most easily, by supposing the iron to be replaced by an electric
current of equal magnetic moment. The element of work
done then depends upon the coef<U+FB01>cient of mutual induction
M of the two circuits, and M may be regarded as the number
of lines of force due to the original current which pass through
the <U+FB01>ctitious circuit.      The whole work is thus

The <U+FB01>rst part is that already considered, and s<U+FB01>gwn to be
 almost entirely wasted ; the second, which in most cases of
 open magnetic circuits is much the larger, is completely
 recovered when the iron is demagnetized.
    Thus in <U+FB01>g. 2, since QQ’ =PP’, the areas of the two curves
are the same, which indicates that the same amount of work
is dissipated in a complete cycle.          But the work absorbed
during one part and restored during the remainder of the

which is applicable to large plates magnetized perpendicularly
to their surfaces. This is the form to which the iron must be
reduced in order that a given magnetization of a given volume
may store“ the largest amount of energy. In this case the
energy is nearly all recoverable; but we must remember that
no practicable <U+FB01>eld would carry the magnetization very far.
   In the theory of alternating currents the neighbourhood of
of iron is often treated as if its only effect were to increase
the self and mutual induction of the circuits. A writer con
versant with experiment usually guards himself by a reference
to the currents induced in the iron considered as a conductor.
The latter effect may be in great measure eliminated by a
proper subdivision of the iron, with intervening non-conduct
ing strata; but a glance at <U+FB01>g. 2 shows at once that, apart
altogether from internal currents, the in<U+FB02>uence of the iron is
of a more complicated character.          If the curve connecting 3‘
 (or ii) and J<U+FB01> were a straight line, the same on the upward as
on the downward course, then the presence of iron would
simply increase the self-induction. When the iron constitutes
a closed magnetic circuit, this is very far from being true.
 Indeed it would be nearer the mark to say that the iron in
creases the apparent resistance of the electric circuit, leaving
the self-induction unchanged. In so far as the curve of <U+FB01>g. 2
can be identi<U+FB01>ed with an ellipse, the reaction of the iron can
be represented as equivalent to a change in the apparent re
sistance and self-induction of the circuit. Which of the two
is the more important depends somewhat upon the other .cir
‘cumstances of the case; but with closed electromagnets the
magnetic work dissipated during the period (corresponding to
increased resistance) is always greater than the work spent
during one part and recovered during the remainder of the
period (corresponding to increased self-induction). On this
account, the resistance of an iron wire to variable currents is
greater than to steady currents, even though the current be
constrained to be uniformly distributed over the section. In
the absence of such constraint, the resistance undergoes a
further increase in consequence of the tendency of the cur

 rent to concentrate itself towards the exterior‘.               In general
 both causes must cooperate to produce an apparent increase
 of resistance to variable currents.
      When the magnetic circuits are open, as with bars of iron
 of moderate length, the reaction of the iron manifests itself
 mainly as increased self-induction. This happens also in the
 case of closed magnetic circuits, when the magnetic changes
 are very small.
      In general, since the curve of <U+FB01>g. 2 differs widely from an
ellipse, the reaction of the iron cannot be fully represented as
equivalent to a change in the resistance and self-induction of
the magnetizing circuit. In any case of strict periodicity the
reaction may, however, be analyzed, in accordance with
Fourier’s theorem, into harmonic components with periods
which are submultiples of the original period. The nei -
bourhood of iron may thus introduce overtones into w at

XXII. On the Salts of Tetrethylphosphonium and their .De
      composition by Heat. By Prof. E. A. LETTS, Ph.D., &c.,
      Queen’s College, Belfast, and NORMAN COLLIE, Ph.D.,
      Science Lecturer, The Ladies’ College, Cheltenham‘l'.
ONE of us (in conjunction with another chemist) has already
          pointed out the very striking analogies which exist
between the elements phosphorus and sulphur and their com
pounds 1, and we were anxious to continue our experiments
in connection with this question.
     The action of heat on methyl—sulphine compounds has been
studied by Crum Brown and Blaikie §, who have shown that
they decompose in a perfectly simple and de<U+FB01>nite manner.
We were accordin ly desirous of ascertaining whether
the analogous phOSI<U+FB01>lOl'llS derivatives, namely the salts of
tetrethylphosphonium, would behave similarly.
     We had already investigated the action of heat on some of
the salts of tetrabenzylphosphonium II, but the results were

not very satisfactory, owing to the tendency of the benzyl
radical to split into hydrocarbons at the high temperature at
which the decomposition occurred.
   We thought it probable that the salts of tetrethylphospho
nium would decompose at a lower temperature, and would
therefore be better suited for investigation. Several of the
salts of tetrethylphosphonium which we investigated had
already been described by Hofmann * ; one or two, however,
we prepared for the <U+FB01>rst time.
         Preparation of Iodide of Tetrethylphosphonium.
    As this salt was the starting-point for the preparation of
the other compounds of the phosphonium, we devoted con
siderable care to its manufacture in the pure state.
    When triethylphosphine is added to iodide of ethyl, the two
combine rather suddenly and with considerable evolution of
heat, so that unless care is exercised loss of material may easily
occur. Hofmann suggests that the iodide of ethyl should be
 diluted with ether before the addition of the phosphine, and
 at <U+FB01>rst we acted on this suggestion; but subsequently we
 found that, by carefully cooling the mixture and using excess
 of iodide of ethyl, the reaction could be kept completely under
 control, and that the addition of ether was unnecessary. The
 <U+FB01>rst quantity of the phosphonium iodide was prepared in
 etherial solution: 30 grms. of triethylphosphine were added
 to a mixture of 43 grms. of pure iodide of ethyl and 500
 grms. of ether. The mixture was left for a night, when 30
 grms. of feathery white crystals separated. These were
 washed with dry ether, and dried in vacuo over sulphuric
 acid ; the determination of iodine in them was made volume
 trically.
    0'600 grm. required 21'9 cubic centim. decinormal nitrate
 of silver solution=0'27813 grm. iodine=46'36 per cent.
    From the ether mother liquors a further batch of crystals
 was obtained.
    The next quantity of the phosphonium iodide was prepared
 by the direct addition of 30 grins. of triethylphosphine to a
 large excess (200 grms.) of iodide of ethyl, which was con
 tained in a <U+FB02>ask, <U+FB01>tted with an upright condenser and placed
 in water. After a short time violent ebullition occurred, and
 a considerable quantity of iodide of ethyl volatilized into the
 condenser. On distilling off the excess of this from a water
 bath, a snow-white mass of crystals remained.
    These were recrystallized by dissolving them in alcohol and
 precipitating with ether. A determination of iodine in the

    As regards the properties of this salt, we have nothing to
add to the description given by Hofmann and Cahours *.
      Action of Heat on the Hydrate of Tetrethylphosphonium.
     Hofmann and Cahours 1' had already studied the behaviour
 of this compound when heated, and had found that it decom
 posed in the following manner :—
                   (O2H5)4POH= (02H5)3P0 + GsHe ;
 but as they did not make any exact determination of the
 quantity of phosphine oxide, nor of the ethane produced, and
 as we were particularly anxious to ascertain whether the
 above equation expresses the whole change which occurs, we
 determined to repeat the experiment.
     10 grms. of pure iodide of tetrethylphosphonium were con
 verted into the hydrate by adding excess of oxide of silver to
 its aqueous solution. The liquid <U+FB01>ltered from the resultin
 iodide of silver was transferred to a distilling <U+FB02>ask, connecte
 with an apparatus for collecting gas, and heated. At <U+FB01>rst no
 change occurred except simple ebullition ; but when the solu
 tion grew concentrated effervescence occurred, and eventually
 from 780—800 cubic centim. of gas were collected. The
 temperature of distillation slowly rose to 240—243° G., and
 the distillate crystallized in the condenser. It was identified
 as triethylphosphine oxide, both by its boiling-point, appear

  822 cubic centim.—a quantity which is suf<U+FB01>ciently near to

    We have already shown that the hydrate of tetrabenzyl

 ence of heat, *
              (C7H7)4POH = (07117) 3P0 + O7H8.
  Action of Heat on the Sulphate of the Tetrethylphosphonium.
    25 grms. of pure iodide of tetrethylphosphonium were
 dissolved in water and converted into the corresponding
 sulphate by the action of sulphate of silver.         The solution
 was <U+FB01>ltered and treated with hydrochloric acid and sulphur
 retted hydrogen to remove the dissolved silver.       It was again
 <U+FB01>ltered and concentrated to a small bulk over the water-bath.
 During the concentration, a strong smell of triethylphosphine
 became manifest, showing that decomposition had commenced,
 and this increased as the concentration was proceeded with ;
 and even when the solution was removed from the water-bath
 and placed in vacuo over phosphoric anhydride, the smell of
 triethylphosphine was still apparent.
     After remaining under these conditions for some time the
 solution solidi<U+FB01>ed to a highly deliquescent crystalline mass,
 which could not-be obtained in a <U+FB01>t state for analysis owing to
its hygroscopic nature. It was accordingly transferred to a.
distilling <U+FB02>ask and heated in an oil-bath.          In a short time
gas was evolved whilst a colourless liquid distilled, and there
remained behind in the <U+FB02>ask a charred mass. The distillate
solidi<U+FB01>ed on cooling, and from its appearance we were led to
the conclusion that it contained sulphide of triethylphosphine,
in addition to the oxide.
    A simple method suggested itself for separating the two
bodies, depending upon their different solubility in water, the
oxide being soluble in all proportions, whilst the sulphide
readily crystallizes from a hot saturated solution.      The distil
late was accordingly dissolved in hot water, and as the solu
tion cooled, beautiful needle-shaped crystals of considerable
length separated. They were collected on a <U+FB01>lter, washed
with cold water, and recrystallized from boiling water.             '

Caustic soda was then added to the solution, and the oily

with a luminous <U+FB02>ame. The wash-water contained traces of
sulphurous acid.
   Another experiment was performed in order to see whether
any other substances besides the oxide and sulphide of
triethylphosphine could be isolated.
   14 grms. of the iodide of tetrethylphosphonium were con
verted into sulphate, and the latter submitted to the action of
heat.    3'5 grms. of sulphide, and 3'0 grms. of oxide of
triethylphosphine were obtained ; the theoretical yield [on the
assumption that
      {(02H5)4P}2SO4 gives (02H5)3PS’ and.         (02H5)3PO],
is 3'8 grms. of the former and 3'4 grms. of the latter.         No
other substances could be isolated, so that there can be little
doubt that most of the phosphonium salt is decomposed into

oxide and sulphide of triethylphosphine, gaseous hydrocarbons,
and oxidized products. As, however, a strong smell of
triethylphosphine became manifest during the concentration
of the salt, another reaction probably occurs, though to a very
small extent. Its exact nature we had no means of ascer
taining.
   Action of Heat on the Carbonate of Tetrethylphoaphonium.
   Hofmann and Cahours had already investigated the action
of heat on this salt, and state that it decomposes into triethyl

    This reaction appeared to be of peculiar interest: <U+FB01>rst
because of its analog with the behaviour of the compounds
of triethylsulphine w en heated *, and, secondly, because it
ought to afford an easy and simple method for preparing
triethylphosphine from tetrethylphosphonium salts. Unfor
tunately, however, this decomposition of the carbonate by
heat does not occur in the simple manner we anticipated, as
the following experiments show.
    A considerable quantity of the rather impure carbonate
was submitted to distillation. It yielded a large quantity of
the oxide of triethylphosphine, but only a small amount of
the phosphine itself.
    In view of this result we determined to investigate the re
action more carefully, and to employ the carbonate in as
complete a state of purity as possible. An aqueous solution
 of 40 grms. of the pure iodide of tetrethylphosphonium was
treated with an excess of recently precipitated carbonate of
 silver. The solution was <U+FB01>ltered from the resultin iodide of
 silver and concentrated on the water-bath, until a sii ht smell
 of triethylphosphine became manifest. It was then well
 shaken with ether to dissolve out any oxide of triethylphos
 phine that might be presenti, and placed in wave over phos
 phoric anhydride, where, after some time, it solidi<U+FB01>ed to a
 mass of highly deliquescent needle-shaped crystals. This
 was transferred to an ordinary distilling <U+FB02>ask, which was

  Tetrethylphosphonium and their Decomposition by Heat.        189
connected with a Liebig’s condenser, to which an apparatus
for collecting gas was attached. On applying heat to the
<U+FB02>ask the crystals fused, and soon began to decompose with
e<U+FB02>‘ervescence. A few grammes of liquid passed over at a. low
temperature, but the thermometer (in the distilling <U+FB02>ask)
soon rose to 240°, between which temperature and 250° the
bulk of the contents of the <U+FB02>ask distilled.
   The distillate consisted of two layers, the lower of which
was simply an aqueous solution of oxide of triethylphosphine;
the upper layer (which amounted to only a gramme or two)
had a strong odour of triethylphosphine. When shaken with
hydrochloric acid about two thirds of it was absorbed; the
remaining third was not attacked, even when boiled with
strong hydrochloric acid. This latter had a distinct and cha
racteristic odour, and its boiling-point lay between 90—100° C.
As it was not attacked when boiled with hydrate of barium
or caustic soda, and as carbonate of ethyl boils at 126° C., its
 identity with that substance was clearly negatived.
   The gas evolved during the experiment caused a turbidity
with lime-water, and was in part absorbable by caustic potash
 (to the extent of about one third the total volume). It there
 fore contained carbonic anhydride. The residue was not
 acted upon by bromine ; and as it burnt with a luminous
 <U+FB02>ame, it probably consisted of a paraf<U+FB01>n hydrocarbon, pre
 sumably butane.
    In order to ascertain the nature of the volatile liquid, which
 accompanied the triethylphosphine, another experiment was
 performed with a larger quantity of the carbonate. On sub—
 mitting it to the action of heat the same phenomena were
 observed as before, and a quantity of the volatile liquid (freed
 from   triethylphosphine), amounting to two
 obtained.                                     U grammes, was

 to be between 95°—102° C. Now this boiling-point agrees

 of which, along with the phosphine oxide, could be accounted
 for by the equation—

  compound with bisulphite of soda, we were not surprised to
  <U+FB01>nd that the body in question would not unite with the bi
  sulphite. As its quantity was only small we decided to
  submit it to oxidation. Accordingly it was digested for some
  time with bichromate of potash and sulphuric acid, and the
  mixture then submitted to distillation, when an acid distillate
  was obtained. This was warmed-with oxide of silver, <U+FB01>ltered
  and concentrated. On cooling, a white crystalline silver salt
  separated, in which, when dry, a determination of silver
  was made.

       These results indicate that the product of oxidation con
  sisted of a mixture of acetic and propionic acids T. The
  formation of which further proves that the volatile liquid was
  in reality diethylketone.
       We consider, therefore, that part at least of the phospho
  nium salt decomposes in the manner indicated above.
       But another and totally different reaction also occurs, in
  which triethylphosphine, carbonic anhydride, and a gaseous
  hydrocarbon are produced.              The following equation probably

  Tetrethylphosphonium and their Decomposition by Heat.       191
are thus forced to the conclusion that Hofmann and Cahours
were mistaken in their explanation of the change which it
suffers when heated.
            Action of Heat on the Acid Carbonate of
                       Tetret/lylphosphonium.
    When a solution of the hydrate of tetrethylphosphonium
is saturated with carbonic anhydride, the solution is faintly
acid, and solidi<U+FB01>es when evaporated over sulphuric acid in
vacuo to a mass of highly deliquescent needle-shaped crystals.
These, on bein subjected to the action of heat, decomposed
at about 140° ., yielding carbonic anhydride gas, and the
salt in the distilling <U+FB02>ask turned alkaline in its action on
litmus paper; on further heatin , large quantities of gas
were evolved between 140° and 150‘ C. The thermometer then
rapidly rose to 240° (1., when it was moved up into the neck
of the <U+FB02>ask; and between this temperature and 250° C. the
whole of the contents of the <U+FB02>ask distilled.
    5 grms. of salt yielded when thus distilled 560 cub. centims.
of gases, and a distillate consisting of a little free triethyl
phosphine, some ketone insoluble in hydrochloric acid, and
with a boiling-point about 100° 0.; but the chief product
was the oxide of triethylphosphine. As in the case of the
normal carbonate, we could not detect any carbonate of ethyl.
The gases were composed of equal volumes of carbonic an
hydride, and a hydrocarbon not absorbable by bromine, which
burnt with a luminous <U+FB02>ame, and was presumably ethane or
butane.
    These results show that the decomposition of the acid
carbonate occurs in the same manner as that of the normal
carbonate, into which it is probably <U+FB01>rst converted.
     Action of Heat on the Acetate of Tetrethylphosphonium.
    The interesting and unexpected results obtained with the
carbonate induced us to study the action of heat on the
acetate of tetrethylphosphonium, as we thought it very pro
bable that it would also yield a ketone, as one half of a ketonic
group exists ready formed in the acetyl group.
    The acetate was prepared both by acting on the pure
iodide of tetrethylphosphonium with acetate of silver, and by
neutralizing the hydrate with acetic acid.      In both cases the
solution of the salt was <U+FB01>rst evaporated on the water-bath to
a small bulk and then laced over sulphuric acid in vacuo,
and eventually yielded a highly deliquescent crystalline mass.
    Some of the salt was dried in vacuo over sulphuric acid
till constant in weight, and then a combustion was made.

   About 24 grms. of the salt were transferred to a distilling
<U+FB02>ask connected with a Liebig’s condenser and an apparatus
for collecting any gases that might be formed.
    On applying heat to the crystals they fused, but no appa
 rent change took place until the temperature reached 230 (3.,
when an effervescence occurred and liquid began to distil.
Eventually 500 cub. centims. of gas were collected and a large
 quantity of liquid distillate. This distillate when fractionated
yielded two products—one boiling at 80—100° 0., the other
 at 230—250° C. The <U+FB01>rst had a strong odour of triethyl
phosphine. It was therefore shaken with hydrochloric acid
to remove that body. There remained a volatile insoluble
liquid smelling of acetic ether. This was warmed for some
time with caustic potash solution until the odour of the ether
disappeared. As the liquid suffered scarcely any change in
volume when thus treated, the quantity of acetic ether present
could only have been very small.
   Puri<U+FB01>ed by these processes the liquid now had a slight
pleasant odour and a boiling-point which lay between
80—90° 0., but as the quantity at our disposal was very small
we could not determine it exactly. The boiling-point of
ethylmethylketone is 81° C, and yields on oxidation acetic
acid only. To establish the composition of the liquid under
examination it was submitted to oxidation with bichromate of
potash and sulphuric acid, and yielded an acid distillate. The
latter was saturated with oxide of silver, and the mixture
warmed and <U+FB01>ltered ; on cooling, a considerable quantity of a
silver salt separated out, which had all the appearance of the
acetate. The salt was dried and a determination of silver
made.

   The composition of the salt was further veri<U+FB01>ed by warm
ing a portion with sulphuric acid, when the odour of acetic
acid became apparent.
   The other fraction of the distillate boiling from 230—2503 C.
  'elded on redistillation a considerable quantity of oxide of

with the phosphine oxide some substance boiling at a higher
temperature than 245° 0., but we did not succeed in isolating
it in a <U+FB01>t state for examination.
   The triethylphosphine was identi<U+FB01>ed in the hydrochloric
acid extract of the <U+FB01>rst fraction (of the original distillate) by
the addition of potash in excess, which at once caused the
separation of an oily layer. This had the odour of the phos
phine, and when warmed in air inflamed. On mixing a
portion with iodide of ethyl, heat was developed, and a crys
talline compound formed, which analysis showed was iodide
of tetrethylphosphonium.

   In another experiment 10 grms. of the acetate gave, when
similarly heated, a distillate composed of 6'5 grms. oxide of
triethylphosphine, half a gramme of ketone, and 1—1'2 grm.
of triethylphosphine, together with 370 cub. centims. of as,
which consisted of nearly equal volumes of carbonic an y
dride (9O cub. centims.), an ole<U+FB01>ne (100 cub. centims.), and
a paraf<U+FB01>n (110 cub. centims.) ; the remaining (70 cub.
centims.) gas being the air displaced from the condensing
apparatus.
   In order to ascertain which member of the paraf<U+FB01>n series
the hydrocarbon was which was not absorbable by bromine,
some of the acetate was heated in an apparatus <U+FB01>lled with
pure carbonic anhydride. The gases evolved during the dis
tillation were therefore free from air ; and by subsequent
treatment with bromine and caustic potash successively, all
the carbonic anhydride and ole<U+FB01>ne were absorbed, leaving any
hydrocarbon of the CnH,"+2 series. The gas which remained
after this treatment burnt with a faintly luminous <U+FB02>ame,
and a rough analysis gave the following results :—

      Action of Heat on Benzoate of Tetretlzylp/zosphonium.
    The benzoate was pre ared by neutralizing hydrate of
 tetrethylphosphonium wit benzoic acid. The solution was
 evaporated in vacuo over sulphuric acid, and eventually gave
 a solid mass of radiating deliquescent crystals. 10 grins. of
 the salt were heated. After the crystals had melted at 160°
  0., white fumes of triethylphosphine appeared in the dis
 tilling <U+FB02>ask. The thermometer was then raised out of the
 liquid (when the temperature had risen to 200° (1., and de
 composition had bcgun). The temperature of distillation
 was higher than usual, the thermometer rising ultimately to
 above 300°, the liquid which condensed in the receiver
 being of a yellow colour ; slight charring also occurred. 450
 cub. centim. of gases were collected, consisting of equal
 volumes of carbonic anhydride and a hydrocarbon of the
 ole<U+FB01>ne series, probably ethylene. The liquid distillate was
 composed of about 5 to 5'5 grms. of oxide of triethylphosphine,
 about '5 grm. of free triethylphosphine (soluble in hydro
 chloric acid), and about 3 grms. of a liquid insoluble in the

   Tetrethylphosphonium and their Decomposition by Heat.        195
 acid, and not changed when warmed with caustic soda.            As
 this liquid seemed to consist of at least two substances, more
 of the benzoate was decomposed, in order to obtain enough of
 the mixture to be separated satisfactorily by fractional dis
 tillation. This did not prove dif<U+FB01>cult, as one of the constituents
 boiled below 1000 C., while the other possessed a boiling
 point slightly above 200° C. Eventually two liquids were
 obtained, one boiling from 80°—85°, and the other boiling from
 210°—215° C. The former had an aromatic sweet smell, and
 was insoluble in water. A combustion gave the following
 results :—
    0'286 grm. gave '960 002 and '213 H20.
                        C=91'54,     H=8'27.

                  H = 7'69        .  . .  .    8'27
Thus indicating that the substance was the hydrocarbon
benzol.
    The liquid possessing the high boiling-point of 210°-215°
0. had a sweet pleasant odour, and bearing in mind the results
obtained when the acetate was heated, we expected to <U+FB01>nd
phenylethyl ketone, which boils at 210° (1., and yields on
oxidation acetic and benzoic acids. The liquid was therefore
boiled for some time with bichromate of potash and sulphuric
acid, and then distilled. The <U+FB01>rst portions of the distillate
were strongly acid, and were neutralized with ammonia. The
ammonia salt thus obtained gave with nitrate of silver a
crystalline salt, which was recrystallized and analyzed.
      0'360 grm. gave 02% Ag. . =62'5 per cent. Ag.
            Ag(C2H302) . . . . =64'6 per cent. Ag.
   The low percentage of silver found is possibly due to benzoate
of silver being present. The chromic-acid solution remaining
after the distillation was shaken out with ether, and the etherial
solution evaporated. A crystalline acid remained, possessing
the characteristic odour of benzoic acid. It was neutralized
with ammonia, and precipitated with nitrate of silver solution.
The resulting silver salt on analysis gave the following
numbers :—
   0'345 grm. salt gave '165 Ag. . =47‘82 per cent. Ag.
         Ag(G-,HBO,). . . . .            =47'16 per cent. Ag.
   As the ketone seemed to be formed in fair amount by this
reaction, a considerable quantity of the benzoate was prepared
and subjected to the action of heat. In one experiment
10 guns. of salt gave 500 cub. centims. of gas (consisting

were obtained, boiling from 205°—210° C.               On combustion

    These results show that the supposed ketone is by no means
 separated from impurities by simple distillation, and the sub
 stance most likely to be formed, and lower the percentage of
 carbon at the same time, is the ethyl benzoate. As the hen
 zoate could be removed by decomposing it with caustic potash,
 the remainder of the liquid (B.P. 205°—210° O.) was boiled
 with a solution of hydrate of potassium, washed with water,
 dried, and redistilled. The boiling-point still remained the
 same (205°-210° 0.), but a combustion gave a much larger
 amount of carbon—

     Another quantity of the benzoate was prepared by the
 action of benzoate of silver on the iodide of tetrethylphos
 phonium.      On heating the salt, the same phenomena were
 observed as with the benzoate prepared by the action of
 benzoic acid on the hydrate.         On fractionating, however, the
  portion of the liquid distillate which was soluble in water, a
  quantity boiling from 120°—140° C. was obtained. On re
  moving the triethylphosphine by shaking with dilute hydro
  chloric acid, an aromatic-smelling liquid remained, which had
  an odour somewhat like that of cymol, and a boiling-point
  130°—140° O.
     Whether this liquid was ethyl benzol or not we were un
able to determine, as the quantity at our disposal was too
  small. The next fraction collected boiled at 200°—215° O.,
  and was insoluble in water; and on oxidation with chromic
  acid yielded acetic and benzoic acids. The last portions of
  the distillate were pure oxide of triethylphosphine.
     As this result was slightly different from those at <U+FB01>rst ob

     Tetretkylphosphonium and their Decomposition by Heat.             197
' tained, still another experiment with considerable quantities
   (40—50 grms.) of the benzoate was made. It was prepared
   by treating a solution of the hydrate with benzoic acid. The
   solution was evaporated as far as possible on a water-bath,
   transferred to a distilling <U+FB02>ask, and heated. Slight decom
  position occurred before 200° C.. but it did not become brisk
  until the thermometer rose above 300°. The products of the
   reaction consisted of an aqueous solution of oxide of triethyl
  phosphine, above which <U+FB02>oated a yellow oil. On distilling
   the former, eight grammes of triethylphosphine oxide were
  obtained ; the oily liquid weighed about 32 grammes. It
  was shaken with hydrochloric acid to remove triethylphos
  phine (which, when separated by potash, weighed nearly 8
  grammes). The oil, after this treatment, was distilled, and
  yielded 4—5grammes of benzol boiling from 78°—90° C., and suf
  <U+FB01>ciently pure to solidify in a freezing-mixture. The higher
  boiling portions consisted chie<U+FB02>y of a liquid smelling strongly
  of benzoic ether, and boiling from 2OS°~220° C.            On treating
  this with ammonia gas it almost solidi<U+FB01>ed into a crystalline
  mass of benzamide. This was removed by boiling water, and
  the oily liquid which remained once more fractionated, when
  it all passed over between 208o—214° C. A combustion gave
  the following results :—
     0'3347 grm. gave 0'952 grm. CO2 and 02235 grm. H20.
     Carbon = 7 7'5 per cent. Hydrogen = 7'4 per cent.
     The hydrocarbon ethyl benzol was carefully looked for in
  this experiment, but could not be detected.
     The production of triethylphosphine, its oxide, ethylene,
  benzol, ethylphenyl ketone, and carbonic anhydride, indicate
  that the benzoate decomposes when heated in a similar manner
  to the acetate and suffers two distinct changes—the one yield
  ing the free phosphine, the other yielding the oxide. The
  two reactions may be represented by the following equa

198             Drs. Letts and Collie on the Salts of
     Action of Heat on the Oxalate of Tetrethylphosphonimn.
    This salt was prepared by the action of oxalate of silver on
a solution of the iodide of tetrethylphosphonium. The <U+FB01>ltered
solution was evaporated over a water-bath, and the residue
dried in racuo over sulphuric acid. It solidi<U+FB01>ed to a mass
of <U+FB01>ne crystals. Some of these were allowed to remain in
vacuo till of constant weight, and then a combustion was
made.

    Another quantity of the solution of the oxalate was evapo
rated in a distilling <U+FB02>ask, and <U+FB01>nally the temperature of the
solution was raised to 160° 0., when no decomposition oc

    This salt, therefore, appears to be stable, and can be heated
 to 160° (J. without any change. Decomposition, however,
 begins slowly at about 200° 0., and at 230° 0. gas is rapidly
 evolved.
     6'5 grms. salt when subjected to the action of heat gave
 650 cub. centims. of gases ; and the whole of the contents of
 the <U+FB02>ask distilled without charring. The distillate was chie<U+FB02>y
  oxide of triethylphosphine, together with some triethylphos
 phine, and a liquid insoluble in water and hydrochloric acid,
  which possessed a boiling-point 95°—105° (l, and which gave
  on oxidation acetic acid. It resembled in smell and pro
  perties the diethyl ketone, obtained when the carbonate was
  heated, but it was formed only in small quantity.
     The 650 cub. centims. of gases were <U+FB01>rst treated with bro
 mine, when 100 cub. centims. were absorbed; caustic potash
 further reduced these by 100 cub. centims., leaving 450 cub.
 centim. The remaining gases burnt with a bluish and
 scarcely luminous <U+FB02>ame.
  - Several analyses were made of the gas evolved by the
 decomposition of the oxalate, two of which are subjoined.

   Several attempts were made to prove the existence of
ethane in the carbonic oxide gas, and numerous analyses of

200           Drs. Letts and Collie 0n the Salts of
the gas were made without success; thus proving that any
of the ethyl groups which are split off from the phosphorus
atom, if they do not form diethyl ketone, lose a hydrogen atom
and are evolved as ethylene gas.
   An interesting reaction was noticed between free sulphur
and the oxalate. The salt, when fused and heated gently to
about 1600 0., gives, with free sulphur, a splendid deep indigo
blue colour, which turns green and <U+FB01>nally yellow on cooling.
The colour, however, reappears on heating ; but if too strongly
heated the sulphide of triethylphosphine is formed, and total
decomposition of the oxalate occurs. Many substances con
taining sulphur, such as vulcanized indiarubber, gunpowder,
&0. give this blue colour when even the smallest particles
are heated with the oxalate on a porcelain crucible lid. Most
of the other salts of tetrethylphosphonium give this colour
with free sulphur when warmed, but none gave it in such a
marked manner as the oxalate.
   It is remarkable that the oxy-salts of tetrethylphosphonium
should so easily give sulphide of triethylphosphine when fused
with sulphur, while the Oxide of triethylphosphine itself is
totally unacted upon by sulphur under similar conditions.
    Action of Heat on the Cyanide of Tetrethylphosphonium.
   As all the preceding experiments were performed with
salts of the phosphonium derived from oxy-acids, and as in
each case part of the oxygen was eliminated in the form of
oxide of the tertiary phosphine, we considered that it would
be of interest to study the action of heat on some of the salts
of the phosphonium which contained no oxygen, and which
 therefore could not yield that body. '
    We <U+FB01>xed upon the cyanide to commence with as being
likely to decompose at a lower temperature than any other
 haloid compound.
    The cyanide of tetrethylphosphonium was obtained in solu
 tion by double decomposition between the iodide and cyanide
 of silver. It was found that when this solution was concen
 trated on a water-bath partial decomposition occurred, and
 hydrocyanic acid was evolved together with an in<U+FB02>ammable
 gaseous hydrocarbon. This decomposition being no doubt
  ue to the action of the water on the cyanide, probably in the
 following manner :—
      (0.H.).P<821§5 +H20= (0,H.).Po +HON+02H6.
    The solution was transferred to a distilling <U+FB02>ask and heated,
 when hydrocyanic acid, cyanogen gas, a little free triethyl

  Tetretlzylpkosphonium and their Decompoeition by Heat.    201
phosphine, and some oxide of triethylphosphine were pro
duced. Probably also a gaseous hydrocarbon was evolved.
Mixed with the triethylphosphine and insoluble either 1n
water or hydrochloric acid were a few drops of a liquid smell
ing of acetonitrile, and evolving ammonia when boiled With
caustic potash. The production of free phosphine and aceto
nitrile indicate that part of the cyanide at least decomposes
according to the equation
                                 .
              (C.H.>.P<8iqH5=<<J.H.>.+    .
                                         t.H.0N.
   The decomposition, however, is complex, owing to the high
temperature at which it occurs.
   We may mention that the cyanide when heated with cold
caustic-potash solution is not changed, and appears to be
quite insoluble if the solution is strong. On warming the
mixture a copious evolution of in<U+FB02>ammable gas occurs, and
the whole of the cyanide decomposes according to the
equation.
      (02H,)3P<8§I5 + KOH: (O2H5)3PO + KON + 0,136.
   The action of heat on the iodide was also investigated: it
<U+FB01>rst fuses, but does not suffer any further change until the
temperature has risen above the boiling-point of mercury.
It then turns brown and splits up into hydriodic acid, free
phosphorus, and gaseous products, and a charred residue
remalns.
   The decomposition is therefore complex, and cannot be ex
pressed by an equation.
   Although the iodide is not attacked by an aqueous solution
of caustic potash, yet when boiled with a concentrated alco
holic solution it slowly decomposes in the same manner as
the cyanide.
    Action of Heat on the Chloride of Tetrethylphosphonium.
   After <U+FB01>nding that neither the cyanide nor the iodide of
the phosphonium when heated yield triethylphosphine in large
quantities, it was hardly thought probable that by the action
of heat on the chloride the tertiary base would be produced.
The results obtained were, however, of the most unexpected
nature. 13'5 grms. of the phosphonium iodide were con
verted <U+FB01>rst into hydrate, and then, by careful addition of
hydrochloric acid till the solution was neutral, into the chlo
ride. The solution was evaporated on the water-bath until

 202             Drs. Letts and Collie on the Salts of
 it became concentrated, and was then transferred to a desic
 cator and allowed to remain there till it became a mass of
 solid very deliquescent crystals.
      A chlorine determination was made with some of these crys
 tals, which were dried in vacuo till constant in weight.

     7 grms. of this solid chloride were heated in a small <U+FB02>ask
connected with the ordinary apparatus used for collecting
any gases evolved. The thermometer in the liquid rose to
300° C. before any decomposition of the salt began.               It was
 then raised into the neck of the <U+FB02>ask. As the decomposition
continued a white p0wdery crystalline substance condensed
in the neck of the <U+FB02>ask, and great dif<U+FB01>culty was found in
preventing the exit-tube from becoming completely choked
by this salt; for on attempting to melt it with a gas-<U+FB02>ame it
 only sublimed onto another portion of the tube. Eventually
the whole of the chloride was distilled out of the <U+FB02>ask, and
  fielded, besides this solid distillate, 800 cub. centim. of gases.
   his gas was completely absorbed by bromine, yielding a
liquid smelling like ethylene bromide and boiling between
130°-140° C.
     Some of the white crystals were quickly scraped out of the
condenser and weighed and analysed.
      0'310 grm. took 21 cub. centims. of decinormal nitrate
                          of SllV<U+FB02>l‘ solution=22'99 per cent. 01.
     The solution of the crystals in water was just acid to lit
mus paper, and when treated with caustic-soda solution
gave free triethylphosphine. From the above results and
from the above analysis there was, therefore, no doubt that the
substance was the [zydroc/zlorate of triethylphosphine which
contains 2298 per cent. of chlorine, and which, when treated
with caustic soda, yields the free base.               The decomposition
therefore is expressed by the equation,

            (02H5)3P<gf92'§i=(0131033101 + C2H4:

800 cub. centim., agreeing with the amount demanded by
theory, 860 cub. centim.           '
   The remainder of the distillate was dissolved in water, and
had a faintly acid reaction; on addition of caustic soda an oil
separated, which by its properties and boiling-point, 125°~133°
C., was triethylphosphine. The amount of free tertiary base
obtained was about three grammes. The hydrochlorate of tri
ethylphosphine obtained by this reaction is a white cystalline
powdery solid, which scarcely melts when heated to about
210° C., at which temperature it sublimes or probably dis
sociates, for if any air be in the tube dense white clouds are
formed of the oxide of triethylphosphine. As this reaction is
the only one which will yield considerable quantities of the
tertiary base from the phosphonium salt, another experiment
was made, with every precaution to see whether the yield was
quantitative.
    A solution of chloride was quickly evaporated, and <U+FB01>nally
heated in a weighed distilling-<U+FB02>ask till the temperature of the
liquid had risen to 180° C.; suddenly the whole frothed up and
 solidi<U+FB01>ed in the <U+FB02>ask to a mass of white crystals. The amount
 of salt thus obtained was 8 gi'ms. This solid mass of crystals
 did not melt till the temperature was about 270° C., and no

 perature of 3400 C., and gaswas not rapidly evolved till the
 liquid was above 360° C.; 910 cub. centims. of gases were
 evolved, and the same white distillate was obtained. There
 was no charring, and the whole of the salt was distilled out of
 the <U+FB02>ask.
    The distillate was washed out of the condenser with a little
 water and transferred to a <U+FB02>ask, through which a current of
 hydrogen was passed; excess of caustic soda was added, and
 the triethylphosphine which separated was distilled in a current
 of steam ; 4'3 gyms. were obtained, the boiling-point of which
 lay between 120 ~135° C., and when added to ethyl iodide gave
 the iodide of tetrethylphosphonium.
    Part of the gases were treated with bromine, when they
 were completely absorbed, giving dibromide of ethylene,

    From these results it will be seen that the chloride of
 tetrethylphosphonium, when heated, decomposes nearly quanti
 tatively into the hydrochlorate of triethylphosphine and ethylene
 qas.
' 8 grms. of the salt should yield theoretically 980 cub. centim.
 of ethylene gas and 5 grms. of triethylphosphine; the amounts
obtained were 910 cub. centim. of pure ethylene and 4'3 grms.
 of the free phosphine. This reaction we consider to be of
 great interest, as affording a ready method for obtaining a
 tertiary phosphine from a phosphonium derivative.
    Some of the other salts of tetrethylphosphonium with in
 organic acids were prepared, and the action of heat on them
 was also investigated.
    The sulphide and hydrosulphide of tetrethylphosphonium
were obtained by the action of sulphuretted hydrogen on a
solution of the base in water. The solutions were strongly
alkaline, and when evaporated in vacuo over sulphuric acid
gave highly deliquescent needles. Their solution in water
precipitated metals like potassium sulphide, and the sulphides
of arsenic and antimony were soluble in excess of the solution.
Sulphur also dissolved easily, with a yellow colour, forming
most probably a persulphide.       When a concentrated solution
of the sulphide was warmed with ethyl iodide, double decom
position occurred, sulphide of ethyl being produced and iodide
of the phosphOnium.
    When the aqueous solution was concentrated in a distilling
<U+FB02>ask, as soon as all the water had distilled, th'e sulphide for a
moment at 150°—160° C. turned a beautiful deep indigo-blue
colour. This disappeared on further heating ; at 220° C. gas
being evolved, together with triethylphosphine and sulphide of
triethylphosphine. Charrin g also occured.
    The hyposulphite of tetrethylphosphonium crystallizes well
from a concentrated solution in plates, and when heated the
same deep indigo-blue colour was noticed as with the sulphide.
The decomposition is complex, as much charring occurs : sul
phide and oxide of triethylphosphiue are among the products
of the distillation.
   The sulphocyanate of tetrethylphosphonium crystallizes in
highly deliquescent needles, and when heated does not decom

 pose to any extent till the temperature has risen above 300° 0.;
 it then slowly chars, yielding gases and sulphide of triethyl
 phosphine.
     The nitrate of tetrethylphosphonium, when evaporated in
 vacuo over sulphuric acid, is deposited from its solution in
 deliquescent needle-shaped crystals. These, when heated,
 suddenly puff, yielding large quantities of gases and some
 oxide of triethylphosphine.                                -
                                Conclusion.
     From the foregoing experiments it appears that the salts of
 tetrethylphosphonium with organic oxyacids suffer, as a rule,
 at least two, and occasionally three, different and distinct
 changes under the in<U+FB02>uence of heat.
      In one of these the molecule splits up into three new groups,
 consisting respectively of carbonic anhydride, a paraf<U+FB01>n
 hydrocarbon, and a tertiary phosphine. In another, two
  hydrocarbons are formed, namely, an ole<U+FB01>ne and a paraf<U+FB01>n, in
  addition to carbonic anhydride and the tertiary phosphine.
  Whilst in the third, a totally different change occurs, in which
  only two products are formed, namely, the oxide of the tertiary
  phosphine and a ketone.
                          c H an = Ear + 002 + 02H, + RH.

                             023R =Et3PO + 0,115. 00 . R.
     4 It is possible, if not indeed probable, that the third reaction
   occurs subsequently to the <U+FB01>rst, and that it really depends
   upon the reducing action of the triethylphosphine upon the
   carbonic anhydride, at the high temperature at which the de
   composition usually occurs, whereby carbonic oxide is liberated,
   which combines with the hydrocarbon radicals in statu nas
   cendi, forming a ketone :—
             Et3+P+CO2+ (120+ (R)=Et,PO+EtOO R
          (or Et3P+ (GOO—R) + (Et) =_Et3PO+Et 00 R).
       If we merely consider the third kind of decomposition
   alone, it appears to be, to a certain extent, analogous to the
   decomposition which a sulphine compound suffers when
   heated, the difference depending on the far more powerful
   attraction which phosphorus has for oxygen, than sulphur has
   for the same element. In both cases a hydrocarbon group is

206                     Mr. J. Aitken on Dew.
detached from the molecule, and also the residue of the acid,
but whilst with the sulphur compounds these two simply com
bine (forming a compound ether), and leave a hydrocarbon
sulphide, in the case of the phosphonium salt the acid residue
is reduced by the tertiary phosphine, and the group thus left
combines with the hydrocarbon radical, forming a ketone.
    Thus :—
                 Et2S<éggC R=Et2S + Et 000 a.
                Et3P<iggG R =Et3PO +Et 00 a.
   A result of this kind is in perfect harmony with the views
already expressed by one of the authors“ regarding the analo
gies and differences existing between phosphorus and sulphur
and their compounds.
    As regards the action of heat on the hydracid salts of tetr.
ethylphosphonium, the chloride and cyanide alone afforded in
 teresting results. In the case of the cyanide these, however,
 were complicated by the presence of water, which attacked the
 compound and converted it into hydrocyanic acid, phosphine
oxide, and ethane. A small quantity of it, however, appeared
 to behave like a sulphur compound, as it was apparently con
verted into cyanide of ethyl and’ triethylphosphine. The
action of heat on the chloride seems to be anomalous, and
as it is the only method by which the tertiary phosphine can
 be obtained in any quantity from a (phosphonium salt, the
decomposition of phosphonium chlori es containing various
hydrocarbon radicals has been the subject of a separate re
search, the results of which one of the authors hopes soon to
be able to publish.
             XXIII. 0n Dew.           By JOHN AITKEN.
   T0 the Editors of the Philosophical [Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
     HAVE read the “Remarks on a new Theory of Dew,”
       by Mr. Charles Tomlinson, F.R.S., in your Journal for
June ; I have also read the paper there referred to, and written
by the same author in the ‘Edinburgh New Philosophical
Journal,’ “ On the Claim of Dr. Wells to be regarded as the
Author ofthe ‘ Theory of Dew.’ ” In certain respects and up to
a certain point, these two papers bear a strong resemblance to
      ‘ E. A. Letts, Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin. vol. xxx. part 1, p. 285.

                      Mr. J. Aitken on Dew.                   207
each other. The aim and object of the greater part of the <U+FB01>rst
of these two papers appears to be to detract from the merit of
Dr. Wells’s great work, by endeavouring to show that almost
all the facts observed by him had been previously noted by
other investigators. As Mr. Tomlinson, however, just at
the end of his paper, reinstates Dr. Wells in the position he
previously occupied, perhaps nothing further need be said on
that part of the subject; but as he has not been equally
generous to me, I must undertake the uncongenial task of
trying to put myself right with your readers. I will take Mr.
 Tomlinson’s remarks in the order of his paper, and as your
space is valuable, will make my reply as short as possible.
   At the very outset Mr. Tomlinson, by raising a false con
tention, attempts to place me in opposition to recognized
authorities, by entitling his paper “ Remarks on a new Theory
of Dew.” The results of my investigation are in no sense
entitled to be called, and never have been called by me, a
“ New Theory; ” nor was this so-called “ new Theor of Dew”
“ promulgated in opposition to that of Dr. We] 3.” My
work has not resulted in a new theory ; it is only an extension
of the work the foundations of which were laid by Dr. Wells.
The great fundamental principles established by that authority
are unaffected by anything contained in my paper.
   When Dr.-Wells wrote his celebrated “Essay on Dew,” he
must have been quite aware of the uncertainty as to the
source of the vapour. Although he appears to have thought
that but little of it could rise from the ground while dew was
forming, yet with admirable caution he adds, “He was not
acquainted with any means of determining the proportion of
this part to the whole,” thus clearly recognizing the soil as a.
possible source of the vapour. Wells’s theory, however, has
principally to do with the condensation of the vapour after it
is in the air, and but little with its source.
   While quite agreeing with the author as to the difference
between “literary work” and “scienti<U+FB01>c work,” and while
he in his comparison would extol the literary, I would rather
be inclined to consider the difference between literary and
scienti<U+FB01>c work to be so great that they cannot be compared.
Both are useful in their way. Mr. Tomlinson no doubt has
had suf<U+FB01>cient experience as a thinker, a writer, and an in
vestigator to have seen many a fair theory, ap arently perfect
in all its parts, and consistently thinkable all t rough, vanish,
under the light of experimental test, like the baseless fabric
of a dream at the <U+FB01>rst touch of day.
   At pages 485—6 Mr. Tomlinson clearly states the chief
points, established by Dr. \Vells, under six heads, and then

  208                  Mr. J. Aitken on Dew.
  with equal clearness gives under ei ht heads what he calls
  Mr. Aitken’s theory of dew.     If he Tad entitled these last as
  eight points contended for in my contribution to the theory of
  dew, no fault could be found with this part of his paper, as
  he states the points with clearness and precision. But unfor
  tunately he still looks on these eight points as rivals to the
  previous six of Dr. Wells, and so continues hostile to them.
  “ Such,” he says, “is the new theory of dew, which, if ac
 cepted, must go far to render nugatory the results obtained
 by some of the most celebrated observers.” After reading
 Mr. Tomlinson’s paper, however, I do not <U+FB01>nd that he adduces
 any results of previous observers that are in any way ren
 dered nugatory by the results set forth in my paper. It has
 already been stated that the “ new theory ” is not in opposition
 nor-are the results contrary to the teaching of Dr. Wells;
 nor are they, so far as I know, contrary to those of any of the
 “ celebrated observers.”
    In continuation, my critic then, in place of sustaining his
 accusation by giving examples in which my teaching is at
 variance with recognized authorities, gives an example in
 which my observations agree with recognized authority. At
 the foot of p. 486 he objects to the statement in my paper
 that “ the ground at a short distance below the surface is
 always hotter than the air over it,” because it is not a new
observation, Pictet in 1779 having previously observed the fact.
 I am, however, puzzled to understand what hearing this has on
 the subject, or what conclusion he wishes to be deduced from
this statement. To compare small things with great: more
than one person had seen an apple fall to the ground before
Newton made such good use of the observation. Pictet, when
he made this observation, was working at another subject, and
did not draw [any conclusion which would be rendered nuga
tory by the acceptance of my conclusions.
    Mr. Tomlinson proceeds to say, “ that dew rose out of the
ground is a very old notion.”~ I was well aware that the idea
was an old one, and it is distinctly stated in my paper. It is
dif<U+FB01>cult to understand what impression my critic wishes to
convey by this remark. If it is that the idea does not possess
the merit of novelty, having been already expressed, my reply
is that it has been already said that dew was caused by the
moon-beams, that it descended from the stars, &c. ; and each
and all of these ideas were supported by about the same
amount of evidence, namely the ipse dixit of the theorist.
   The same answer applies to the footnote, p. 486, regarding
the exudation of moisture by plants. Though “ Muschen
broeck regarded dew as a real perspiration of plants,” yet

                       Mr. J. Aitken 0n Dew.                 209
  beyond the bare statement I am not aware of anything he
  advanced to support his idea. His theory thus fails to explain
 the difference between-the dew-drop on plants and true dew.
  Nor does it account for dew on dead matter. On these his
  torical matters I am, however, open to conviction, as it is
 extremely dif<U+FB01>cult to get access to all that has been written
  on this very popular subject.                  ‘
     As I nowhere say that vapour may not be condensed out of
  air under conditions other than those where dew is forming,
  the two paragraphs at the foot of page 487 have no bearing
  on the subject.
     I am unable to see the relation between the observations
  made by Wells and Six and myself, which Mr. Tomlinson
  brings together by the footnote at page 488. In the investi
  gations made by the two former observers, the difference
  remarked was between the readings of thermometers placed
  on the grass and other substances, and thermometers hung
  above them ; while in my experiments some thermometers
  were placed on and others under the grass. The only like—
  ness in the two sets of observations is a similarity in the
  amount of the difference in the readings of the respective
  sets of thermometers.
     It is unnecessary to follow Mr. Tomlinson through the
 natural processes as described in pages 489, 490, further than
  to say that the cooling he there describes as taking place on
  grass at night is not correct. At the middle of page 490 he
  says :——“ We may imagine three layers of air—one in contact
  with the points of the grass; the second immediately below
  it, where the blades are more numerous, and more or less ex
  posed to the zenith; and the third entangled in the matted
  portion, which is entirely sheltered from the sky.” He then
   describes the manner in which he supposes these layers to get
  cooled, one after the other, beginning at the upper, till “in
  the end the 10wer stratum will be colder than the <U+FB01>rst, so that
  the blades and stems which are least exposed to the aspect of
   the sky will be colder than the points of the blades, and the
   thermometer buried in the grass will mark a lower tempera
 »ture than one in contact with the surface.” If Mr. Tomlinson
   had read my, paper carefully, or practically put the question
   to nature, he would not have ventured such an opinion, as he
   would not, I expect, ever have found the “thermometer buried
   in the grass mark a lower temperature than the one in contact
   with  the surface.”
I the lower                  the contrary,
                         On remains
               thermometer           warmerallthan
                                               through  the night
                                                   the upper one.
   Mr. Tomlinson, in describing the progress of cooling, appears
   to have forgot to take into account the supply of heat given
      Phil. May. S. 5. Vol. 22. No. 135. August 1886.      P

210                 Mr. J. Aitken on Dew.
off by the earth. This supply is quite suf<U+FB01>cient under all
conditions, so far as I have observed, to maintain the soil and
the thermometer over it at a temperature much above that at
the top of the grass ; and while the thermometer at the top
of the grass falls quickly at night and falls a good deal, the
one “ buried in the grass ” falls comparatively little, the upper
one remaining much the colder throughout the night. It is
not till day arrives and the temperature rises that the upper
thermometer gets heated and rises to the temperature of the
lower one.
    With regard to the remarks about dew in “Persia” and
“ the African desert,” I have nothing to say, as they do not
bear on my paper, it being distinctly stated there that my
remarks apply only to this climate. I may, however, add
here that I wait for further information before forming any
opinion as to what takes place in other and unknown con
ditions.
    At page 493, Mr. Tomlinson says, “There is such a vast
consensus of scienti<U+FB01>c opinion in favour of the received theory
of dew, that any attempt to set it aside in favour of another
must be supported by the strongest experimental evidence.”
Now, as 1 have already said, I have never made any attempt
to set aside Wells’s theory; and as all my work has tended to
con<U+FB01>rm and extend his, I hope Mr. Tomlinson will, on recon
sideration, give my contribution to this subject a more favour
able reception ; and might I also ask a more careful consider
ation of that part referred to by him in this same paragraph,
where he says, “ Mr. Aitken exposes a turf six inches square
to the air in a scale-pan”! I This misconception of the essen
tial conditions of the experiment has iven rise in his mind
to the objection to the conclusion Iiave drawn from the
experiment, and has also given rise to the confusion Mr. Tom
linson has made in comparing my experiment with other
 previous ones.
    If Mr. Tomlinson had delayed till he had seen thecomplete
paper, he probably would not have found the dif<U+FB01>culty he has
experienced in reconciling the two sets of observations referred
 to in the <U+FB01>rst paragraph, page 494, of his paper. The paper
containing the account of my experiments, on which Mr.
 Tomlinson fonnds his criticism, being in abstract was made as
short as possible, and does not contain suf<U+FB01>cient information
 to make the conditions of the experiments clear to Mr,
 Tomlinson.    The edges of the trays were, as he supposes, in
 contact with the ground; one slate and one weight were.
 also in contact with the ground. But, in referring to the
 latter, they were simply described as they appeared without

                     Mr. J. Aitken on Dew.                    211
touching them, that is without lifting them from the ground;
 whereas it is the condition of the undersides or insides of the
trays that are specially referred to. The slate and weight
 resting on the ground were of course quite wet on their under
sides, which were invisible except when moved, while their
exposed parts were dry ; whereas the elevated slate and weight
were wet all over. With this explanation I have no doubt
Mr. Tomlinson will see the importance of the contact with the
ground in keeping the temperature of the slate and weight
above the dew-point; while the wetness of their undersides,
which are invisible, brings these experiments into harmony
with the experiments with the trays.
    In the second last paragraph of Mr. Tomlinson’s paper he
seems to object to that part of the “ new theory “which relates
to the excretion of liquid by plants, principally because it is
“startling” and not in keeping with preconceived opinions,
and he asks, “for what purpose are plants endowed with such
high radiating powers?” I scarcely think he can expect me
to answer that-question, as it forms no part of my theory. If
any one, surely he is the proper person to give the reply.
But are plants really such good radiators ? Take even the
<U+FB01>gures given by Mr. Tomlinson for the different substances
named. In none of these is the di<U+FB01>'erence of any importance;
indeed the differences are not more than might easily arise
from errors of observation by the method used by Melloni,
except in the case of vegetable mould. So far as my own
measurements go, by the method used by me, I have not
found any difference in the radiating powers of grass and soil
at night. If there is any difference, it must be very small.
One result of recent investigations is to show that plants with
leaves like those of grass are very badly adapted for collecting
dew, the blades being little narrow strips placed at right angles
to the direction of the air-currents; the slightest movement of
the air prevents the surfaces of the blades being cooled by
radiation much below the temperature of the air. In illus
tration of this I may mention that narrow strips of glass or
other material exposed at night will sometimes collect no
dew, while a sheet of the same material will be running with
water, the windward edges being of course dry. Plants with
large leaves have quite an advantage over grass in dew-collect
ing powers; but, on the other hand, grass has the advantage
during sunny days, on account of its narrow blades being but
little heated by the sun. This may be one reason, though not
the only one, why grass so seldom <U+FB02>ags under a scorching
heat.
   If I might be allowed to make a slight explanation here,
                               P2

212                   Mr. J. Aitken on Dew.
perhaps it would help to remove a dif<U+FB01>culty some have felt in
accepting some of the conclusions contained in my paper.
One of the results contended for is, that dew on grass and on
bodies near the ground is formed from vapour rising from
the ground during night ; the reason given for this conclusion
being that grass-land is always in a condition to give off
vapour during dewy nights. The vapour that rises from the
  round after sunset will thus displace the vapour that rose
during the day, and the latter will di<U+FB01>'use itself into the drier
air over the grass. The stems and blades of the grass during
night will thus be surrounded by the vapour that has risen
most recently from the ground. Another reason given is,
that at night the temperature of the air among the stems is
much higher than that of the air at the tips of the blades,
and being in contact with moist soil is nearly saturated. The
vapour-tension of this hot air, rising among the stems, is thus
much higher than that of the air over them, and is thus in a
much more favourable condition for forming dew than the air
higher up.
   These are the reasons given for concluding that dew on
grass is formed from vapour rising at the time from the
ground and not from that which rose during the day.          The
principal dif<U+FB01>culty experienced by some in accepting this
conclusion, seems to have arisen from extending this con
clusion to the source of the dew deposited on bodies placed
some distance from the ground. Now, when we consider
what takes place in these higher positions, it is easy to see
that the conditions are much more complicated, and we can
now say very little about the vapour, either as to the place of
its evaporation or as to the time when it changed its state.
Whenever the vapour coming from the ground rises above the
grass and mixes with the drier air over it, we get an entirely
different and much more complicated condition of matters.
No doubt some of the vapour molecules in this upper air will
have risen from the ground only a short time before, but some
of them will certainly, if there is the slightest wind, be mole
cules which have risen during the day, and no doubt some of
them will have risen into the air many days previously; and
while some will have risen from the ground immediately
underneath, others will have come from lands and oceans far
away. But while this may be so, it in no way affects the
conclusion that vapour is almost constantly, night and day,
given off by the soil, and that dew on grass is part of this
rising vapour trapped by the cold blades.

 XXIV. On the Electromotive Force of Voltaic Cells having an
      Aluminium Plate as one Electrode.          By A. P. LAURIE,
      B.A., B.Sc.*
    N a former number of this Journal‘l' I have given an ac
       count of some experiments undertaken with the view of
 testing whether the E.M.F, ofa cadmium-iodine cell was really
 due to the combination of cadmium and iodine. As there
 explained, these experiments were made on account of m
 feeling an increasing distrust of measurements of E.M.F.
made in the usual way with in<U+FB01>nitely small currents,—a dis
trust not of the measurements themselves, but of our right
to assume that the E.M.F. of a particular cell was due to a
 particular chemical reaction. This doubt is obviously justi<U+FB01>ed
when once we realize that impurities far out of reach of
analytic detection could easily produce suf<U+FB01>cient current for
 the measurement of E.M.F. in the usual way.
    On reading the papers published by Dr. Alder Wright in
this Magazine in 1885, I was very much struck by the results
 of his experiments on aluminium-zinc cells, in which he found
 an E.M.F. actually opposed to that calculated from the thermal
 data. To quote his <U+FB01>gures, given on p. 28, vol. xix. of the Phil.
 Mag. for 1885, he <U+FB01>nds that zinc-aluminium cells, with the
 metals immersed in sulphate of zinc and potash-alum re
spectively, have an             of '538 volt. According to the
 thermal data, there should be an E.M.F. of '982 volt in the
 opposite direction, so that we have a difference of 1'519
 volt between the E.M.F. calculated from thermal data and
 that obtained by actual measurement.
    Dr. Wright’s experiments with other aluminium cells give
 similar results.
    Now observe that the             calculated from the thermal
 data is obtained by taking the heat of formation of sulphate
 of zinc and sulphate of alumina respectively, and subtracting
 the comparatively small heat of formation of sulphate of zinc
 from the large heat of formation of sulphate of alumina ; that,
 therefore, the assumption is made that this cell is similar to a ‘
 Daniell cell, and that sulphate of alumina will be formed and
 sulphate of zinc decomposed, by the passage of the current.
    The E.M.F. measurement, however, shows an               in the
  opposite direction to that calculated on this assumption.
  How is this to be accounted for? Dr. Wright accounts for
 it by assuming a “thermo-voltaic constant” of 1'519 volt.
  By this I understand him to mean that he believes that sul
                  “‘ Communicated by the Author.

214       Mr. A. P. Laurie on the Electromotive Force of
phate of zinc is formed and sulphate of alumina decomposed
during the passage of a current, and that an enormous ab
sorption of heat takes place to enable this reaction to go
forward.
    If we believe that we are dealing only with metallic alu
minium, sulphate of alumina, sulphate of zinc, and metallic
 zinc, then we must make the above assumption, and un
doubtedly chemical analysis would con<U+FB01>rm such a belief.
    I think, then, I have said suf<U+FB01>cient to show that we have
here a point of some importance,—-that if we have only
the above substances to deal with, Dr. Wright has made a
surprising discovery.
    It was to test whether we really had these substances
present that I have made the following experiments.            '
    Before describing the experiments, however, I must say a
 few words about aluminium itself. It is a metal with some
very peculiar and contradictory properties. Though having
a very high heat of combination with oxygen, it does not
tarnish in the air or decompose water at ordinary tempera
tures, nor is it soluble in nitric acid. If used as the electrode
at which oxygen is set free by the passage of a current
through dilute sulphuric acid, it opposes a very considerable
resistance to the passage of the current. This resistance has
been called “ polarization,” and stated as high as six volts.
   On amalgamating the metal (which can only be done by
immersing <U+FB01>rst in strong caustic) it becomes capable of de
composing water; and its oxidation in the air is so rapid that
if left at rest it becomes covered with a growth of oxide in a
few minutes, resembling some fungus growths in appearance.
   Now all these properties seem to me to be very easily ex
plained by supposing aluminium to become rapidly coated
with a <U+FB01>lm of oxide, whether in air or water, which, being
very insoluble, protects it from all further action, and practi
cally for chemical purposes converts an aluminium plate into
an aluminium-oxide plate, unless some solvent of the oxide is
present.
   Starting with this view, I prepared a solution ofalnminium
sulphate and of zinc sulphate, enclosing one in a porous pot,
and immersed a zinc rod in the zinc sulphate and an alumi
nium wire in the aluminium sulphate. I did not note the
strength of the solutions, as the experiments were merely
qualitative.
   I obtained a de<U+FB02>ection on connecting this cell with the
electrometer, amounting to about '54 volt in the same direc
tion as that obtained by Alder Wright. On removing the
aluminium wire, cleaning it with sandpaper, and immediately

        Voltaio Cells with Aluminium Plate as one Electrode.    215
plunging it into the liquid and connecting with the electro
meter, a de<U+FB02>ection was obtained in the same direction, but
 only amounting to '14 volt. After ten minutes it had risen
to '35 volt. This seemed to show that the complete forma
tion of the oxide <U+FB01>lm took some time. The introduction of a
 little caustic potash also brought the E.M.F. nearly to zero,
 of the
but       cell.not as yet obtained an actual reversal of the
       I had
    I next amalgamated the wire and plunged it in the solu
tion. I at once obtained a de<U+FB02>ection of about '46 volt in
the opposite direction. At the same time hydrogen was given
off, and the wire above the solution became coated with the
growth of oxide already referred to.
    The next experiment was an obvious one. I plunged two
aluminium wires, one cleaned, the other amalgamated, in a.
solution of sulphate of alumina, and obtained a de<U+FB02>ection of
 1'08 volt, showing a remarkable difference in chemical pro
perties between the amalgamated and cleaned aluminium
Wires.
    In order to test the effect of short-circuiting on the cell, I
left a zinc-aluminium cell short-circuited for some days, but
the aluminium plate, except for a slight darkening of the
surface,“remained unchanged, showing that to whatever re
action the E.M.F. of the cell was due, it was of so tempo
rary a kind, or the internal resistance of the cell was so
ggeat, that no perceptible chemical change had been brought
a out.
    These experiments are, I think, suf<U+FB01>cient to show that
 there is no evidence that the reactions in the cell are simply
the formation and decomposition of the sulphates of zinc and
aluminium respectively, but that there is strong evidence to
 show that we are not in the cell dealing with aluminium at
all, but with aluminium oxide supported on an aluminium
plate. It is therefore more probable that the                of the
 cell is due to the heat of formation of zinc sulphate, — the
 heat of formation of aluminium sulphate,+the heat of for
mation of aluminium oxide, — the heat-formation of water.
These reactions would result in an E.M.F. in the direction
actually observed. It may be noticed that even the amalga
mated aluminium ives too low a value for the reactions of
the formation and ecomposition of the sulphates. As, how
 ever, the water is being decomposed by the metal, we can
'hardly tell what the actual source of E.M.F. may be.
    I do not know if Dr. Wright attached any de<U+FB01>nite mean
ing to the term “ thermo-voltaic constant” in the case of
these particular cells, as the assumption that the reactions are

216 '            Prof. S. P. Thompson on a Mode of
the formation and decomposition of the sulphates is evidently
questionable, even from the results he obtained.
    This paper is not of course meant as a criticism on Dr.
Wright’s work, which I have always admired for its accuracy,
 but merely gives a new interpretation of certain of his
 experimental results.
 XXV. Note on a Mode of maintaining Tuning Forks by
              Electricity. By Prof. S. P. THOMPSON".
      LL who have worked with self-maintained electric tuning
         forks have met with the fact that these instruments as
ordinarily arranged give a very irregular note, the pitch of
which is continually slightly altering, and even those which
are fairly constant in pitch are continually changing the phase
of their vibrations. These changes of phase and of. pitch
render the electrically-sustained tuning-fork as usually con
structed almost useless for acoustic work, and diminish the
usefulness of the instrument for chronoscopic and electric
applications. They appear to be due to a fact which is toler
ably obvious to any one acquainted with the fundamental
 principles of the vibrations of. elastic bodies, namely, that the
impetus given by the electromagnet at each vibration is given
at the wrong instant of the motion, namely at some other
instant than that during which the fork is passing with maxi
mum velocity through the position of zero displacement. In
the older forms of clectro-diapason constructed by Fessel and
by KoenigT, the electromagnet was of horseshoe form, having
  oles outside the prongs of the fork ; whilst in the more recent
instruments by Koenig the electromagnet is of short cylin
drical form, and placed between the prongs of the fork. The
latter arrangement, which is preferable for several reasons
electrical and mechanical, seems to have been <U+FB01>rst suggested
by Lord Rayleighi.         In the earlier form contact was made
by a stylus, carried by the prong of the fork, dipping into the
mercury cup : in the later form the stylus usually makes con
tact against a platinum-headed screw, almost exactly as does
the interrupter of Wagner so common in electric bells. In
either case contact is made at a very brief interval before the
prong of the fork reaches its extreme elongation away from
the pole of the electromagnet, and is broken at a slightly
longer interval after the prong has passed its extreme elonga-'

tion, the difference arising from the elasticity of the stylus,
and the necessary imperfection of the contact until a certain
actual contact-pressure has been attained. There is also a
certain retardation in the electro-magnetic pull behind the
instant of greatest current, owing to the self-induction of
the circuit and the mutual induction between the coil and its
core. But if the core be short, and laminated, and of good
iron, and if the resistance of the circuit be considerable in
proportion to its coefficient of self-induction, the retardation
of phase in the periodic electromagnetic impulses will not be
of any great importance. Lord Rayleigh remarks* that if
the magnetic force depended only on the position of the fork
the phase might be considered to be 180° in advance of that
of the fork’s own vibration. That is to say, considering a
displacement of the fork toward the electromagnet positive,
the maximum force occurs when the displacement is a nega
tive maximum. But, adds Lord Rayleigh, the retardation due
 to self-induction and imperfect contact reduces this advance.
 Lord Rayleigh further remarks that if the phase-difference be
 reduced to 90° the force acts in the most favourable manner,
 and the greatest possible vibration is produced. He might
 have added that in this case the tendency to produce phase
 change is the least possible. He suggested as a means of
 producing any desired retardation, the use of a stylus attached
 not to the prong itself, but to the further end of a light
 straight spring carried by the fork.
    It seems to the present writer, that a better way to secure
the proper timing of the impulses is to be found in the sug
 gestion which he now makes, and which arose in his mind
 after considering the difference of phase which exists between
 two dynamo-electric machines associated together. Let two
 forks in unison with one another he provided, and let each act
 as interru ter to the other, but not to itself; the electromag
 net of each) being included in the circuit of the other’s contact
 points. One battery will suffice for the two, as they will not
 both make contact at the same time.
    Fig. 1 shows the proposed arrangement. The forks when
 started will settle down to a difference of phase corresponding
 to an almost exact quarter of a period.
    Fork B is arranged, as shown in fig. 1, so that it makes
 contact at the inward stroke at the point when its displace
_ment is at the positive maximum ; fork A makes its contact
 at the outward stroke when its'displacement is at the negative
 maximum.

pulse just as B has phase 0°. A quarter of a period later B
makes contact (b1), and gives an impulse to A just when A’s
phase is 0°. The arrows indicate the instant and direction of
the forces. It is assumed that the retardation due to self
induction is small, as compared with the period of the forks ;
and this may easily be made so, <U+FB01>rstly, by employing only
short internal electromagnets with laminated cores, and,
secondly, by interposing suf<U+FB01>cient inductionless resistance in
the circuit.
   Another point of some importance in the construction of
electrically sustained forks is that the contacts should be ver
<U+FB01>rm, and should be made much nearer the hilt of the fork
than is usual in these instruments. When the stylus is near
the outward end of the prong there is much greater amplitude
 of motion at the contact than is really requisite. A pin of
platinum secured to the prong at about 5 centimetres from the
 point of bifurcation, making contact against a platinum-faced
 strip of German silver, half a millimetre in thickness, to serve
 as a spring, will answer the purpose for forks of ordinary size.
    A common imperfection in the electro-diapason as usually
 constructed is the method of mounting the fork. Its shank
is held with nut and washer to a block of wood or metal,
 which is then secured to a stand by a single bolt or screw
 which runs at right angles to the shank and to the planes of
vibration of the prongs. The defect of this mounting is that
 the fork can shift a little round the bolt, and is liable to
 become set with one prong nearer one face of the electromag
 net than the other prong is to the other face. This often
 results in the occurrence of actual rattling contacts between
 the fork and the electromagnet, as well as in derangements of
 the adjustment of the working contacts. It also gives rise to
 another kind of dif<U+FB01>culty : if one prong is nearer to the
 electromagnet than the other is, there will be a tendency for
 the fork to vibrate as a whole around the bolt or frame upon
 which it is mounted, and this will give rise to slow alternations
 of good and bad contacts, producing 0n the sound an effect
 not unlike that of beats. Either the bolt which secures the
 fork to its mounting should lie in the plane of the vibrations,
 or else it should be replaced by a more substantial species of
 mounting.

THE following communications were read :—
       1. “On some Perched Blocks and associated Phenomena.”
By Prof. T. M°Kenny Hughes, M.A., F.G.S.
   The Author described certain groups of boulders which occurred
on pedestals of limestone rising from 3 to 18 inches above the level
of the surrounding rock. The surfaces of these pedestals were stria
ted in the direction of the main ice-<U+FB02>ow of the district, while the
surrounding lower rock in no case bore traces of glaciation, but showed
what is known as a weathered surface.
   He inferred that the pedestals were portions of the rock protected
by the overhanging boulder from the down-pouring rain, which had
removed the surrounding exposed parts of the surface. When the
pedestals attained a certain height relatively to the surrounding rock
the rain would beat in under the boulder, and thus there was a
natural limit to their possible height.
    He referred to the action of vegetation in assisting the decompo
sition of the limestone, and considered that there were so many
causes of different rates of waste and so many sources of error, that
he distrusted any numerical estimate of the time during which the
surrounding limestone had been exposed to denudation.
   Considering the mode of transport of the boulders, he thought that
they could not have been carried by marine currents and coast-ice,
 as they had all travelled, in the direction of the furrows on the rock
 below them, from the parent rock on the north. Moreover, marine
 currents would have destroyed the glaciation of the rock and <U+FB01>lled
the hollows with débris. '
    Furthermore, the boulders and strise are found in the same district
 at such very different levels and in such positions as to preclude the
 possibility of their being due to icebergs.
    Nor could the boulders represent the remainder of a mass of
 drift which had been removed by denudation, for the following
reasons :—
    1. They were all composed of one rock, and that invariably a
 rock to be found in place close by.
    2. Any denudation which could have removed the clay and
 smaller stones of the drift would have obliterated the traces of
 glaciation on the surface of the rock.
    3. The boulder which had protected the <U+FB01>ne glacial markings
 below it from the action of the rains would certainly in some cases
 have preserved a portion of the stiff Boulder-clay.
    4. The margin of the Boulder-clay along the <U+FB02>anks of Ingle
 borough was generally marked by lines of swallow-holes, into which

                           Geological Society.                    221
the water ran off the Boulder-clay; and when the impervious beds
overlying the limestone had been cut back by denudation, a
number of lines of swallow-holes marked the successive stages in
the process ; but there was not such evidence of the former exten
sion of the drift up to the Norber boulders.
   5. The boulders themselves were not rounded and glaciated in
the same way as the masses of the same rock in the drift, but
resembled the pieces now seen broken out by weathering along the
outcrop of the rock close by.
   Having thus shown the improbability of these boulders having
been let down out of a mass of drift the <U+FB01>ner part of which had
been removed by denudation, or of their having been masses <U+FB02>oated
to their present position on shore-ice, he offered an explanation of
their peculiar position, which he thought was not inconsistent with
the view that they belong to some part of the age of land-ice.
   That they were to be referred to some exceptional local circum
stances seemed clear from the rarity of such glaciated pedestals,
while boulders and other traces of glaciation were universal over
that part of the country. He therefore pointed out, in explanation,
that they occurred always where there was a great obstacle in the path
of the ice :—at Cunswick the mass of Kendal Fell curving round at
the south and across the path of the ice; at Farleton the great
limestone escarpment rising abruptly from Crooklands; at Norber
the constriction of the Crummack valley near Wharfe and the great
mass of Austwich grit running obliquely across its month. In all
these cases the ice had to force its way up hill; and there would be
a time when it would just surmount the obstacle after a season of
greater snowfall, and fall back after warm seasons, until it fell back
altogether from that part. During the season of recession, boulders
would be detached below the ice-foot ; during the seasons of advance
they would be pushed forward ; and in those exceptional localities.
of isolated hills from which the drainage from higher ground was
cut off, the boulders were left on a clean furrowed surface of lime
stone, which was then acted upon by rain-water and the vegetation,
except where protected by the boulders.
   2. “On some derived Fragments in the Longmynd and newer
Archaean Rocks of Shropshire.” By Dr. Charles Callaway, F.G.S.
    Further evidence was added to that given in the Author’s previous
 paper (Q.J.G.S. 1879, p. 661), to show that the Longmynd rocks of
 Shropshire were chie<U+FB02>y composed of materials derived from the
 Uriconian series, and that the Uriconian series itself (Newer
 Archsean) was partly formed from the waste of pre-existing rocks.
 This evidence consisted of (1) the presence, throughout the greatly
 developed Longmynd conglomerates and grits, of purple rhyolite
 fragments, recognized by microscopical characters as identical with
 the Uriconian rhyolites of the Wrekin, and the occurrence of grains,
 probably derived from the same rhyolites, in the typical green slates
 of the Longmynd; and (2) the existence of conglomerate beds con
 taining rounded fragments of granitoid rock in the core of the -

    222                     Geological Society :—
    Wrekin itself, whilst the Uriconian beds of other localities, and
    especially those of Charlton Hill, contained waterworn pebbles,
    chie<U+FB02>y metamorphic. These pebbles appeared to have been derived
    from metamorphic rocks of three distinct types. The views put
    forward were founded on microscopical evidence, of which some
    details were given in the paper, and were supported by the views of
    Prof. Bouncy, who had furnished notes on the microscopical charac
    ters of the rocks.
       3. “ Notes on the Relations of the Lincolnshire Carstone.” By
    A. Strahan, Esq., M.A., F.G.S.
       The Lincolnshire Carstone has hitherto 'been supposed to be
   correlative with the upper part of the Speeton series, and to be quite
   unconformably overlain by the Red Chalk (Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.
   vol. xxvi. pp. 326—347). But the overlap of the Carstone by the
   Red Chalk, which seemed to favour this view, is due to the northerly
   attenuation, which is shared by nearly all the Secondary rocks of
   Lincolnshire.     Moreover, the Carstone rests on different members
   of the Tealby group, and presents a strong contrast to them in litho
   logical character, and in being, except for the derived fauna, entirely
   unfossiliferous. It is composed of such materials as would result
   from the “ washing ” of the Tealby beds.
      In general it is a reddish-brown grit, made up of small quartz
   grains, <U+FB02>akes and spherical grains of iron-oxide, with rolled phos
   phatic nodules.    Towards the south, where it is thick, the nodules
   are small and sporadic.     Northwards, as the Carstone loses in thick
   ness, they increase in size and abundance, so as to form a “ coprolite
   bed,” and how yielded specimens of Ammonites spoetoneneis, A. plie
   omlohalas, lamina, &c. When the Carstone <U+FB01>nally thins out, the
   conglomeratic character invades the Red Chalk, similar nodules
  being then found in this rock.
      The presence of these nodules, with Neocomian species, taken in
  connexion with the character of the materials of the Carstone, points
  to considerable erosion of the Tealby beds. On the other hand,
  there is a passage from the Carstone up into the Red Chalk. It
  would seem, then, that the Carstone should be regarded as a “ base
  ment-bed ” of the Upper Cretaceous rocks.
     The Lincolnshire Carstone is probably equivalent to the whole of
  the Hunstanton Neocomian, the impersistent clay of the latter being
  a very improbable representative of the Tealby Clay. It therefore
  follows that the whole Speeton series is absent in Norfolk, and also
  in Bedfordshire. The unconformity at the base of the Carstone
  becomes greater southwards, and the nodules have been derived
  from older rocks. Similarly north of Lincolnshire, where the Spee
  ton series is overlapped, the nodules in the Red Chalk, marking the
  horizon of the Carstone, have been derived from oolitic rocks.
     In the South of England it would seem that equivalents of the
  Speeton series reappear. The Ather<U+FB01>eld clay contains an indigenous
  Upper Speeton fauna, while a pebble-bed near the base of the Folke—
- stone beds is described by Mr. Meyer as containing derived oolitic

                   On somev Well-sections "in lkfiddleserc.       223
pebbles, and being probably the representative of the Upware
deposit, and presumably, therefore, also of the Lincolnshire Car
stone.

 Edwin Gilpin, Esq., Jun., A.M., F.R.S.C., Inspector H.M’s. Mines.

geology, the author stated that the various formations found in the

    He then proceeded to give an account of each system and its sub
 divisions in order, commencing with the most ancient and adding a
 few detailed sections of the rocks belonging to some of the principal
series. He described the distribution and relations of the several
 divisions.
    The paper concluded with a few notes on the super<U+FB01>cial geology
of the island.     There is a general absence of moraines and of the
fossiliferous Post-Pliocene marine clays of the Lower St. Lawrence.
The older beds are generally exposed, but deeper soils and deposits
 with erratic boulders are found overlying the Carboniferous beds.
Marks of recent ice-action are found on the shores of some of the
 lakes, and are due to the ice being driven by the wind.

    Accounts of many well-sections and borings having been received
 since the publication of vol. iv. of the Geological Survey Memoirs,
 the Author now gave more or less detailed descriptions of <U+FB01>fty-six
 of these, all in the Metropolitan county, and all either un<U+FB01>nished or,
 in a few cases, with further information as to published sections.
 The depths range from 59 to 700 feet, more than half being
 300 feet or more deep. Nearly all pass through the Tertiary beds
 into the Chalk, and most have been carried some way into the latter.
 Papers descriptive of like sections in Essex, Herts, and Surrey have
 been sent to Societies in those counties.

   7. “ On some Cupriferous Shales in the Province of Houpeh,
China.” By H. M. Becher, Esq., F.G.S.
   This communication contained some geological observations made
during a visit to a locality on the Yangtse river, near I-chang, about
1000 miles from the sea, for the purpose of examining a spot
whence copper-ore (impure oxide with some carbonate and sulphide)
had been procured.
   The principal formations in the neighbourhood of I-chang were
said to be Palaeozoic (probably Carboniferous) limestones of great
thickness, overlain by brecciated calcareous conglomerate and reddish
sandstones, which form low hills in the immediate vicinity of the
city. About <U+FB01>fty miles further west the (limestones pass under a
great shale-series with beds of coal, the relations of which to the
sandstones are not clearly ascertained.
   The copper-ore examined by the writer came from the shales,
which contained <U+FB01>lms and specks of malachite and chrysocolla, and
in places a siliceous band containing cuprite, besides the oxydized
minerals, was interstrati<U+FB01>ed in the beds.                     Occasionally larger
masses of pure copper-ore are found imbedded in the strata. The
ground had not been suf<U+FB01>ciently explored for the value of the de
posits to be ascertained.
   8. “ The Cascade Anthracitic Coal-<U+FB01>eld of the Rocky Mountains,
Canada.”    By W. Hamilton Merritt, Esq., F.G.S.
   The coal-<U+FB01>eld named occurs in the most eastern valley of the
Rocky Mountains, that of the Bow river, and, like other coal-<U+FB01>elds
of the country, consists of Cretaceous rocks, which lie in a synclinal
trough at an elevation of about 4300 feet above the sea. The
underlying beds, of Lower Carboniferous or, possibly, Devonian age,
rise into ranges 3000 feet higher.
   Further to the eastward the Jurassic and Cretaceous coal contains
a large percentage of hygroscopic water and volatile combustible
matter, and has the mineral composition of lignite. The average
composition is :—

   As the mountains are approached, the amount of hygroscopic
water is found to diminish by about one per cent. for every ten
miles, and <U+FB01>fteen miles from the range the percentage is about <U+FB01>ve.
In the foot-hills the lignites pass into a true coal, with 1'63 to 6'12
per cent. of hygroscopic water, and 50 to 63 per cent. of <U+FB01>xed carbon.
In the Cascade-river Coal-<U+FB01>eld the average character of the coal is
that of a semianthracite, with the following composition :—

    I ON SOME EXPERIMENTS RELATING TO HALL’S PHENOMENON.
                           BY PROF. BOLTZMANN.
  FROM the general equations which Maxwell and Rowland had
         given for the movement of electricity, Lorentz (Wiedelnann’s
  Beibla'tter, viii. p. 869) deduced the following equations for the
  movement of electricity in a plane plate at right angles to the lines
  of force of a magnetic <U+FB01>eld, provided that the Hall’s de<U+FB02>ection of
_ the current by magnetism is taken into account :
                 u=—Kg§—lw,               v=—K%+hu;
  a, 0,1), x are the components of the current, the electrical tension,
  and speci<U+FB01>c conductivity, and h a constant which is probably nearly
  proportional to the strength of the magnetic <U+FB01>eld. From these
  equations I have deduced certain conclusions which seem to me
  worthy of being experimentally tested. The following integral
  corresponds to Hall’s observations :
                     p=_ax+hay,         u=|ctl,     11:0.
  In an iron strip with the bounding lines y=0 and y=b, and the
  thickness 5, a. current J =Kab5 <U+FB02>ows in the direction OX.        The
  north pole is on the positive Z side. The hands of a watch the
  face of which is turned towards OZ, run from OX towards OY.
  In a Hall circuit, which from its great resistance does not mate
  rially alter the condition of the strip, a current is driven by the
  electromotive force e=hab, which <U+FB02>ows in the iron strip, against
  the positive y-direction. By rotatory power R Hall understands
  the quotient eE/JM, so that h=RhTm I may observe that the
  absolute values which Hall gives for R are far too small; possibly
  owing to a confusion of the ohm with the resistance-unity they
  should be multiplied by 10”. From the above equations follows:
                  u+lw=——K@,            u=-k(d£_h@),

    For a circular plate it follows that when one electrode of the
 primary current is in the centre, and the entire periphery is the
 second electrode:
10= —-A log nat r, u=lcA(a:—hy) l 1", v =kA(y+lw) l r“, p=kA[r;
 the stream-lines are logarithmic spirals with the equation
                        8;: h 10g nat r+ const. ;
 r and 8 are the polar coordinates, p the components of the current
 in the direction of 1'. Similarly found stream-lines were observed
 in Geissler’s and Hittorf’s tubes under the in<U+FB02>uence of magnets.
 The <U+FB02>ow in an in<U+FB01>nite plate with two or more point-shaped
 electrodes is obtained by superposition. The equation of the
 stream-lines is then
                     h log net (1" | 2")=$—$'+const.
 for two electrodes to which the polar coordinates r, 3, r’, 8' refer.
    Leduc (Journal de Physique, 2nd series, vol. iii. p. 366) has sug
 gested the hypothesis that the changes of resistance which mag
 netism produces in bismuth are merely apparent, and caused
 by the fact that the currents are forced into longer paths by Hall’s
 phenomenon.      In this case, from what has been above said, no
 changes in resistance are to be expected in a rectangular strip
 in the entire extent of which the currents <U+FB02>ow parallel to two
.sides which lie opposite.     For the circular plate the strength of
 the current i=21rrp8=21rkA5, the resistance s is therefore
                    log nat (r.2 : r,)  1 + h2         r

 in which r, is the radius of the plate, 1', that of the central electrode.
 Hence it would be increased in the ratio 1+h2:1 by the mag
 netism. If E is the electromotive force of the battery, 10 the
 difference of potentials of the electrodes of the plate, then
                           {ALI—L1? _ l
                               s _ w — s+w’
 in which w is the resistance of the rest of the circuit. Prof. Ettings
 hausen found for a bismuth disk corresponding to these conditions, in
 two experiments with the magnetic <U+FB01>elds 6364 and 4810, the values
 1'257 and 1-180, which agree tolerably with the formula, since
 with bismuth from another source it is true R varied from 8 to 10,
 On the other hand, it seems dif<U+FB01>cult to explain the great difference
 in resistance which was found with rectangular bismuth strips as
 arising from want of homogeneity, or from the fact that the
 current was led, and taken away from individual points, and
 not at the entire breadth. The integral p: -aw+cy corresponds
 to a rectangular strip of thickness 5, at whose shorter sides I) the
 primary current enters and leaves, while the longer sides I are

       ON THE GOLD-LEAF ELECTROSCOPE.            BY FR. KOLACEK.
     In the following way we get at a relation between the angle of
  divergence ¢ and the di<U+FB01>erence of potential P between the leaves
  and the envelope (base-plate metal-case). Let C be the capacity
  of the electroscope, considered as a condenser, which depends on 'p ;
  E = PC, the quantity of electricity 0n the inner coating; l, g the
  length and weight of one of the leaves, which are assumed to be
  quite equal; EQ/QC the electrostatic, and 2l/29(1 — cos ¢/2) the
  ordinary energy of mechanical origin corresponding to a rise of
  the centre of gravity of the leaves. If the electroscope has been
  left to itself and insulated, the variation of the entire energy
  E2/2C + g . l(1 - cos ¢/2) equal to zero of a virtual de<U+FB02>ection d¢ is
  imparted to the leaves. If we consider that C, but not E, is a<U+FB01>ected
  by the variation, the following equation results between <p and P:—
                                      sing
                             P2: .9 l 76-.
                                       6‘»
  For an in<U+FB01>nitely small ¢, (dC/B¢)¢=O is to be considered constant,
  and the de<U+FB02>ection in this case indicates magnitudes, which are pro
  portional to the square of the above difference of potential. For a
  greater 4; an expansion in series must be made. The formula with
  two constants a¢+b¢2=P’ may be experimentally con<U+FB01>rmed to a
  divergence of about 18°.
     The leaves, 8 centim. in length, were projected in <U+FB01>fteenfold

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              229
magni<U+FB01>cation on a scale divided into centimetres. Notwithstanding
that the images were imperfect, the error of reading was within
the tenth of a division. The reading of the distance was made
about twenty seconds after the <U+FB01>rst impulse; for the leaves were
driven beyond the new position of equilibrium, and only attained it
after some seconds. It will be seen that this difference of potential
measured after twenty seconds, with equally good insulation, is a
measure of this magnitude at the time of the impulse. The insu
lation was sufficiently good, for in 100 seconds the de<U+FB02>ection sank
for instance only from 103 to 8'9. In order to test the above
formula, one of the poles of one, two, three Daniella was connected
with a condenser-plate, the other with the earth and the second
movable plate. It is clear that the charge arising from the dif
ference of potential of 1, 2, 3 H Daniells is again a measure for the
magnitude P. Hence we have to test the formula a8 + 689=I1’, if 8
is the de<U+FB02>ection determined in double centimetres. The actual
distance of the leaves x, expressed in centimetres, is then 25 : 15. i
   The condenser consisted of two copper plates, 7 centim. in dia
meter, in which only that screwed on the electroscope was varnished.
Each experiment was repeated ten times and the mean taken.
Probably owing to the formation of a residue in the shellac, the
<U+FB01>rst de<U+FB02>ections were a few percentages too small compared with
the later very regular values.
    Measurement gave for 8 the value 1'91, 5'46, 9'48, corresponding
to the value H=1, 2, 3 Daniells. With the latter two values of 5
and l], a=0'438, b=0'0539. In this case the potential-difference
corresponding to 8 = 1'91 represents 1'016 Daniell instead of
 1 Daniell.
    5=5'13 corresponds to a zinc-carbon element in potassic bichro
 mate to which some sulphuric acid was added; hence H=1'914
 Daniell compared with 1'86 Daniell with the electrometer.
    According to the formula the de<U+FB02>ection 17'5 represented this
 and the three Daniell elements, and thus 11 =4'914, which measure
 ment gave 183. The unvarnished copper plate was replaced by a
 zinc plate of the same size cleaned with emery-paper, the metallic
 connection established with the condenser, and a de<U+FB02>ection of 0'95
obtained from two distinct series of observations, each containing
ten readings. With 5=0'94 the formula gives
                         Zn/Cu=0'677 Daniell.
If 4: is the constant ratio between H and P, and if in the above
formula 5=15x/2 and H=P/¢, it passes into the formula
                      P=¢ V3'825x+3'032.z3,
 which is independent of the magnitude and choice of the condenser.
   was determined by connecting the electroscope with a Beetz’s dry
 pile of 144 elements. Of course the second pile was put to earth.

of potential due to 144 elements is not produced in the electroscope.
   When no current could be ascertained in the battery, even with
a re<U+FB02>ecting-galvanometer which gave ten-millionths of an am
pere, the above condition seems to have been ful<U+FB01>lled. For if one
pole was insulated, and the other connected with an electroscope,
and if it was charged with an ebonite rod, an instantaneous dis—

   The small divergence of the gold leaves was determined with
suf<U+FB01>cient certainty by viewing it at a distance of 1'605 metre with
a powerfully magnifying spectrometer-telescope, the micrometer
screw of which was provided with a. milled head divided into 100
parts, in which six parts represented a minute. As a mean of
several values, the smallest of which differed from the largest by
about 4 per cent, the number of divisions was found to be 129; so
that w=0'1004 centim., and thus ¢=240'O.           By the aid of the
electroscope used and of the formula

or, still better, of a curve on coordinate paper, differences of poten
tial of considerable amount may be determined with an error
amounting to perhaps 5 per cent., in which, instead of reading by
projection, the far simpler method of reading by a glass micrometer
in the eyepiece of the telescope may be used. The upper limit of
the di<U+FB01>erences of potential to be ascertained may be determined by
means of an electroscope with heavy leaves.
    I might mention, in conclusion, that in the absence of a
Beetz’s dry pile, ¢ might be ascertained if the de<U+FB02>ection of an elec
troscope connected with a Leyden jar is noted, when the jar is
discharged with a given length of spark. For this the knowledge
of the di<U+FB01>erence of potential corresponding to a given striking dis
tance is required. An experiment gave a very close agreement for
the value p.—Wiedemann’s Annalee, No. 7, 1886.
APPLICATION OF THERMODYNAMICS TO CAPILLARY PHENOMENA.
                             BY P. DUHEM.
   Gauss and Laplace have founded a theory of capillary phenomena.
 on molecular considerations, in which they assume that the forces
 with which the smallest parts act on each other possess a function
 of force in the ordinary mechanical sense. Poisson and several
others have shown that this theory holds also when the density
near the surface varies; the <U+FB01>rst supposition has been generally
adopted.
   This, however, is no longer admissible if we are compelled to
 take into account virtual displacements which changes of tempera—
ture bring about, and such changes of temperature, as Thomson has
shown, are in general necessarily connected with changes of the
capillary surface.

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.          231
    Properly to treat this subject, and to bring Thomson’s investiga
tions into connection with the older ones, we must no longer adopt
the ordinary mechanical treatment, but- must have recourse to
general thermodynamical methods. The considerations arising
from this point of view form the contents of the present research.
    It is <U+FB01>rst of all shown, that for a system of bodies touching each
other we are not to seek the potential at a <U+FB01>xed temperature, but
the thermodynamical potential, which contains the changes of
energy for varying temperature. The only assumption made is
that the densities and the actions of the molecular forces of bodies
vary only in in<U+FB01>nitely thin layers at the surfaces.
    It is seen that this supposition is sufficient to prove that the
thermodynamical potential consists of two parts, one of which is
a. linear function of the content of the various bodies, the other a
linear function of the surface in contact. This easily furnishes a
proof of the admissibility of the older view. From the formulae
obtained, the laws of Gauss and Laplace for the shape of the sur
faces are explicitly deduced; the same formulae render it possible
to investigate the capillary changes which occur in thermal changes.
New results are thus not obtained, but the old ones are brought
into connection with each other.
    The general equations are then applied to the two special pro
cesses of evaporation and supersaturation.—Ann. Ecole Normale

               OF PELTIER’S PHENOMENON IN LIQUIDS.
                   BY E. NAOCARI AND A. BATTELLI.
    Two glass cylinders, 16 centim. in width, were placed near each
 other in a vessel of water, and a paper disk fastened in each half
 way up. At the bottom of each cylinder was a copper disk 13 cen
tim. in diameter, Solution of blue vitriol was poured in up to the
 disk, and on this solution of zinc sulphate; in each of these solu
tions a zinc plate perforated in the centre was suspended. Both
 zinc plates were connected by a copper wire and a current passed
 through the apparatus, the intensity of which was determined by
a re<U+FB02>ecting—galvanometer, one division of the scale of which repre
 sented an ampere. A very thin perforated glass plate was brought
 in the centre of each of the paper disks. In this aperture was
 accurately <U+FB01>tted the bulb of a thermometer, which was surrounded
 by a caoutchouc tube as far as the part in the aperture.     The cur
rent of one or two Bunsen elements was sent through the apparatus
in either direction, and the course of the thermometer observed
 every minute. If i and i, are the intensities of the current, y and y,
 the corresponding thermal effects, the magnitude of the Peltier
phenomenon is given by the formula
                         h = (Zita—WV(171” +51?)
 Only those experiments were taken into consideration in which i
 and i, were not greatly different from each other. With the

 following intensities were obtained :—
                      i . . . . 63     123     148      187
               106 h . . . . 71         64      72       67
     The value of h is therefore almost independent of i, and thus
 Peltier’s phenomenon proportional to the intensity of the current.
    If when solutions of Glauber’s salts of various concentration
 were superposed on each other, and the bulb of the thermometer
 was not at the surface of separation of the liquids, or if the same
 liquid was above and below the diaphragm, no appreciable value
 was obtained for h, so that the above results are not limited by
 other in<U+FB02>uences of heat.
    From the experiments as a whole, the value of h is obtained
 when solutions of the following sulphates are combined with solu
 tion of CuSO4 of speci<U+FB01>c gravity s, and in like manner the solutions
 of the chlorides with solution of cupric chloride of sp. gr. 1'10. The
 values of h are positive, when the greater heating e<U+FB01>ect takes
 place, i. e. when the current passes from the lower and more con
 centrated solution to the one above it.                        .

    If the entire apparatus was <U+FB01>lled with water, and the thermo
meter was surrounded by a semicircle which was half of iron and
half of zinc wire, and the current was passed through, the mean of
ten experiments was found to be h=18 ; so that the Peltier pheno
menon between liquids is not of aless order of magnitude than
between metals. As according to Bellati the electromotive force
between zinc and iron is 00024 volt, the absolute value of Pel
tier’s phenomenon may be calculated from this for the liquids
investigated.—Atti della R. Ace. di Torino, vol. xx. 1885; Bei

XXVIII. On the Physical Structure of the Earth. By HENRY
   HENNESSY, F.R.S., Professor of Applied Mathemtics in
   the Royal College of Science for Ireland?“
     HE structure of the Earth as a mechanical and physical
       question is closely connected with the origin and for
mation of its satellite, and of the planets and satellites belong
ing to the same solar system. The brilliant results obtained
during the present and preceding century by the aid of
mathematical analysis, whereby the motions of these bodies
have been brought within the grasp of dynamical laws, may
have led to the notion that by similar methods many obscure
problems relating to the planet we inhabit might be accurately
solved. But, although the general con<U+FB01>guration of the Earth
and planets has been treated mathematically with results
which leave little to be desired, when applications of analy
tical methods are attempted to questions of detail in terrestrial
structure, the complication of the conditions is so great as to
impose the necessity on some investigators of so altering
these conditions as to make their results perfectly inapplicable
to the real state of the Earth. Physical Geology presents
problems the solution of which undoubtedly calls for mecha
nical and physical considerations 3 but these may in general,
under the complex nature of the phenomena, he often better
reasoned out without the employment of the symbolical
methods of analysis. In most cases the conditions are totally
unlike those above alluded to, which admit of precise nume

234                   Prof. H. Hennessy on the
rical computations. The heterogeneous character of the rocks
composing the Earth’s crust, and the probably varied nature
of the matter composing its interior, render mathematical
applications rarely possible, and sometimes misleading. Such
views seem to be gradually gaining strength among geologists
who pay attention to questions of a general nature, and no
one has better expressed them in recent times than Professor
M. E. Wadsworth".
    The principle upon which I have ventured to found all my
researches on terrestrial physics is this : to reason on the
matter composing the globe from our knowledge of the phy
sical and mechanical properties of its materials which come
under our notice. Of these properties the most important
are density, compressibility, contraction or dilatation from
changes of temperature. Newton and other philosophers
have already adopted the same principle to a limited extent,
when assuming for the mass of <U+FB02>uid composing the Earth in
its primitive condition those speci<U+FB01>c properties which have
been assigned to all kinds of <U+FB02>uids observed at the surface.
It is impossible to frame any statement more erroneous and
misleading than that I have endeavoured to render the ques
tion more hypothetical than it was. On the contrary, I have
discarded the invariable assumption of mathematicians who
treated the question, namely, the hypothesis of the invaria
bility of positions of the particles composing the solidifying
earth. The speculations of all rational inquirers upon the
Earth’s internal structure must necessarily start from the same
general principle as above.       Some investigators have disre
garded that principle, and made the problem thereby a purely
mathematical exercise.
    In order to reason upon the Earth’s <U+FB01>gure, we must assume
that the laws of <U+FB02>uid equilibrium apply to the inner portions
of the <U+FB02>uid as well as the outer.        There is nothing hypothe
tical in reasonings as to the formation of the solid shell and
the law of increase of ellipticity of its inner surface as a re
sult of the transition of the formerly <U+FB02>uid matter to the state
of solidity. On the contrary, the assumptions of Mr. Hopkins
and other mathematicians, that this transition created no
change in the law of density of the matter composing the
Earth, and in the ellipticity of the strata of equal pressure, are
not merely hypothetical; they are directly opposed to well
established physical and mechanical laws.
    On the other hand, those who have concluded that nothing
can be known of the form of the <U+FB02>uid nucleus, seem to deny

that the reco nized laws of matter apply to the internal con
dition of the Earth.     The shape of the nucleus and the <U+FB01>gures
of its strata of equal density follow from physical and me
chanical laws, just as the forms of the isothermal surfaces
within the spheroid follow from the known laws of conduction
of heat. Some of the mechanical reasonings regarding the
strata of the nucleus and the structure of the solid shell can
be presented without employing mathematical symbols, and
in what follows I have as far as possible avoided the use of
such symbols.
    This course, moreover, possesses the advantage of making
many parts of the reasonings more clear to geologists and
observers of the stratigraphical features of the Earth, who are
in reality the ultimate judges of the matter, and not mathe
maticians. The necessity under which the latter are con
strained when dealing with problems, of throwing the pre
liminary propositions into simple well-de<U+FB01>ned shapes,admitting
of de<U+FB01>nite deductions, obliges them to overlook the most
essential conditions of the very questions at issue,and they
thus arrive at results which may be precise, but which are
totally inconclusive with reference to the Earth’s structure.
        The Mechanical and Physical Properties of the Matter
                         composing the Earth. '
     (1) The materials of the Earth 'must manifestly in<U+FB02>uence
its general structure, and no inquiries with this structure can
be usefully made if the physical properties of these materials
are not kept in view. If the interior of the Earth is in a <U+FB02>uid
state it is reasonable to believe that the <U+FB02>uid is not the ideal
 substance called by mathematicians a perfect liquid, namely
 a substance not only endowed with perfect mobility among
 its particles but also absolutely incompressible. It is more
 reasonable to believe that the <U+FB02>uid in question resembles the
 liquid outpourings of volcanoes, or at least some real and
 tangible liquid whose properties have been experimentally
 studied. 1 have already shown that by overlooking this
 simple principle certain untenable conclusions, which assert
 the exclusively solid character of the Earth,have been deduced.
 Here I propose to develop some additional arguments re
 lative to one of the properties of liquids which has an essential
 bearing upon the internal structure of the Earth.

   236                     Prof. H. Hennessy on the
   facts were not clearly put forward, I underrated the com
   pressibility of liquids as compared with solids. The in<U+FB02>uence
   of the imperfect experiments of the Academia del Cimento
   has long injuriously operated in de<U+FB01>ning liquid and solid
   matter, and has produced a remarkable con<U+FB02>ict of opinions.
      On taking the results of the best experimental investiga
   tions, it appears that, although liquids are but slightly com
   pressible as compared with gases, they are highly compres
   sible as compared with solids. In many treatises on Physics
   and Mechanics which have a high reputation matter is divided
   into solids, elastic <U+FB02>uids or gases, and incompressible <U+FB02>uids
   or liquids. Hence the erroneous inference seems to have
   arisen that liquids are incompressible, not only in comparison
   with gases, but also in comparison with solid bodies. I was
   surprised to <U+FB01>nd this remarkably misleading proposition for
   mally stated long after the decisive experiments of Oersted,
   Colladon and Sturm, Regnault, Wertheim, and Grassi, in such
   a work as Pouillet’s Elements de Physique, and also in the
   German translation by Miiller. The greater compressibility
   of liquids as compared with solids is seldom a<U+FB02>irmed as a dis
   tinct general proposition in books on Physics. It occurs,
   however, in Deschanel’s treatise, both in the original and in
   the English edition. Daguin states, in vol. i. of his Traite'
   de Physique, 2nd edition, p. 40, that the compressibility of
   liquids was long considered doubtful, but nevertheless they
   are more compressible than solids.
      Lame also pointed out the great compressibility of liquids
   as compared to solids. I have before now referred to the
   statement of the same proposition in the comprehensive work
   of the late Professor 0. F. Naumann, the Lehrbueh der
   Geognosie, vol. i. p. 269, 2nd edition".
      Although in many physical questions the compressibility
- of liquids may be neglected as well as the compressibility
   of solids, we are not entitled to assume at any time that the
   latter are relatively more compressible than the former. In
   questions where the pressure of columns of liquid of great
   magnitude comes under consideration, we can no longer treat
   the liquid as incompressible. In the problem of oceanic tides
  the incompressibility of the water has been assumed, but if a
  planet were covered with water to a depth of one hundred
  miles it would be scarcely correct to make such an assump_
  tion. The compressibility is negligible in a small mass of
  water, but it cannot be neglected in a large mass. Such an
  assumption is equally unwarrantable with regard to properties
     “ “ Fliissige Korper sind aber mit einer weit starkeren Compressibilitat

 of matter which, though negligible in some problems, are
-not in others. Thus in the common hydraulic questions,
 liquids are assumed to be incompre5sible ; it Would be more
 correct to say the compressibility is neglected. In small
 problems connected with limited portions of the atmosphere,
 the compressibility of air may be also neglected, but we could
 not neglect it for a high column of the atmosphere. If, as
 before remarked, the Earth were surrounded with an ocean
 100 miles deep, the compressibility of the water could not be
 well overlooked in tidal questions; then, 81 fortio'r'i, compres
 sibility cannot be neglected in such a problem as the tides of
 a liquid spheroid having a radius nearly equal to that of the -
 Earth. This is immediately made manifest by expressing the
 compressibilities of liquids, not in terms of the amount due
 to a single atmosphere of pressure, as is done in most tabu
 lated groups of results, but by some very much greater
 standard, such as one or two thousand atmospheres. In the
 experiments of Perkins* the highest pressure employed was
 two thousand atmospheres, and with this he reduced a column
 of water by nearly 11; of its volume. The results of experi
 ments with great pressures such as this are highly illustrative
 of the force by which a <U+FB02>uid may be compressed in the Earth’s
 interior. The actual coef<U+FB01>cients of cubical compressibility,
 on which calculations could be based, may be part1 obtained
 from the more exact researches of Regnault, rassi, and
 other recent experiments, or from special investigations on
 <U+FB02>uid matter conducted with precautions such as these ob
 servers have employed. By then comparing the moduli of
 compressibilities calculated from pressures of 1000 or 10,000
 atmospheres, there could be no possibility of overlooking the
 consequences as to the relations of liquid and solid bodies in
 any case where they would be subjected to pressures of ab
 normal magnitude.
    (3) The propagation of sound in solids and liquids gives
 further proof of the greater compressibility of liquids.
    The rate 1: of transmission of sound in solids and liquids is
 a function of their compressibilities. In solids,
 where E is the modulus of elasticity and p the density.        In
 liquids,

where [s is the coef<U+FB01>cient of cubic compressibility, H the

  ut, as in solids, the modulus of elasticity is inversely as the
compressibility k, we have

                          "1      V kpHa'
   Both in solids and liquids the velocity of sound is inversely
as the square roots of the densities and compressibilities.
Although such solids as metals and rocks are denser than
most liquids, the limits of their elastic compressibility are so
much less, that sound is propagated far more quickly through
such solids than through liquids. In steel and metals gene
rally this has been long since established. In rocks the
velocity of sound has been computed from direct experiment
by Mallet, and has been found to be greater in continuous
homogeneous rock than the velocities observed in liquids*.
   (4) If we had not the results of direct experiment on the
compressibilities of liquids and solids to assure us that these
properties in liquids are in excess of those obtained for solids,
we might fairly infer this conclusion from the relative dilata
bility of such substances under differences of temperature'l'.
The construction of our common thermometers is based on
the greatly superior dilatability of the liquids enclosed in the
thermometer-tube over the material of the tube itself. The
dynamical theory of heat clearly establishes that the expan
sion of solids and liquids is a mechanical action as much as
their compression under the action of force, and the substances
which contract least by coolin are precisely those which con
tract least under pressure. @ases which contract most by
pressure are also the most dilatable by heat. Liquids occupy

an intermediate place between solids and gases, in relation
both to the dynamical effect of pressure and the action of loss
of heat. If, instead of the experiment of the Academia del
Cimento, with globes of porous metals, an experiment with
equally strong but impervious vessels had been made, the de
formation of each lobe would have been unaccompanied by the
exudation of the liquid, and the totally false statement that
solids are more compressible than liquids would not have so
long injuriously in<U+FB02>uenced physical science.
       The Rotation of the Earth considered as partly Fluid
                          and partly Solid.
    (1) The problem of the precessional motion of the Earth,
considered as a solid shell <U+FB01>lled with liquid devoid of viscidity
 and friction, has been elaborately investigated by Mr. Hopkins
 in his ‘ Researches of Physical Geology’ iu the ‘ Philosophical
 Transactions’ for 1839, 1840, and 1842, and the result ob
 tained by him has been often quoted as extremely remarkable.
 Before treating the same question, it may be necessary to state
 that on the continent of Europe the application made by Mr.
 Hopkins of his result to Geology is not generally admitted,
 and views such as I have always <U+FB01>rmly upheld seem to be
  more generally adopted ; but some confusion appears to exist
  as to Mr. Hopkins’s results and those to which 1 have been led.
  Thus in a recent treatise on Systematic Geology, the author
  says, with reference to the thickness of the solid crust of the
  Earth, there are plainly only four possibilities to be thought
 of :—
     1. The Earth is through and through solid.
     2. The Earth is through and through <U+FB02>uid, with a solid
  crust.
     3. The Earth has a solid nucleus and a solid crust, with a
  fluid stratum lying between.
     4. The Earth is solid but furnished with cavities which are
  <U+FB01>lled with <U+FB02>uid.
      The <U+FB01>rst and last of those possibilities are not admissible,
   according to astronomical observations. According to the
   investigations of Hopkins the action exercised by the Sun and
  Moon on the position of the Earth’s axis in s ace, by which
   Precession and Nutation are produced, would 0 different ac
   cording to the structure we attribute to the Earth. The values
   established by observation compel us to regard the Earth as for
   the most part in a <U+FB02>uid state, in order that the results may
   harmonize with calculation (Pfaff, Grundriss der Geologic).
   This is the reverse of what Hopkins has concluded, and is
   precisely what I have long since enunciated, which I have

240                 Prof. H. Hennessy on the
always continued to maintain, and which forms the cumulative
result of the investigations in the text of this paper. In a
Re ort t0 the Royal Irish Academy on “ Experiments on the
In uence of the Molecular In<U+FB02>uence of Fluids on their Motion
when in Rotation,” p. 57*, I referred to a proof obtained by
me of the result alluded to, and I now may be allowed to
submit this proof to those interested in the question.
    (2) Let us suppose the earth to consist of a solid spheroidal
shell, composed of nearly similar spheroidal strata of equal
density, and having the ellipticities of the inner and outer
surfaces small and nearly equal. The shell is supposed to be
full of liquid and to rotate around its polar axis. Under these
conditions the attraction of an exterior body would tend to
produce pressure between the <U+FB02>uid nucleus and the inner
surface of the shell. Whatever may be the direction of this
pressure, it can be resolved into a force normal to the shell’s
surface and into forces in its tangent plane.         The normal force
might be effective in causing a deformation of the shell, or, if
the latter were rigid, it would be destroyed by the shell’s re
sistance. If friction existed between the materials of the
shell and the <U+FB02>uid of the nucleus, the resolved forces in
the tangent plane would tend to change the motion of the
shell from the motion it would have if empty. But if no
friction and no adhesion existed between the particles of the
liquid and the shell’s nearly spherical surface, and if the
particles of the liquid are free from viscidity and internal
friction among themselves, this purely tangential component
could exercise no in<U+FB02>uence on the motions of the shell. If
the solid envelope containing <U+FB02>uid was bounded by planes
such as a prismatic vessel or box, it is manifest that unequal
normal pressures on the faces of such prism would tend to
  reduce couples, and thus possibly rotations. Such a case has
been considered by Professor Stokes, and he has shown that
a rectangular prism <U+FB01>lled with <U+FB02>uid will have the same motion
as if the <U+FB02>uid was replaced by a solid having the same mass,
centre of gravity, and principal axes, but with much smaller
moments of inertia corresponding to these axes. But in a
continuously curved and nearly spherical vessel, the normal
pressure arising from disturbance of the liquid could not pro
duce the same results. The tangential components of the
forces acting at the surface of the liquid could, in this case, be
alone effective, and if no friction or viscidity existed at this
surface such tangential action would totally disappear. The
conclusion of Mr. Hopkins’s <U+FB01>rst memoir is, that if the ellip
ticity of the inner and outer surfaces of the solid shell were
        “ Proceedings of R. I. A., 2nd series, vol. iii. Science.

the same, the procession would be unaffected by the <U+FB02>uid, and
any small inequality of nutation would be totally inappreciable
to observation, p. 423, Phil. Trans. 1839. This may be ren
dered more manifest by recalling the general equations for the
surface of a <U+FB02>uid obtained by Poisson, Navier, Meyer, and
other mathematicians, when the internal friction of the <U+FB02>uid
is taken into account. If a, 18,7 be the angles made by the
normal to the curved surface of the <U+FB02>uid, X, Y, Z the compo
nents parallel to the rectangular axes of w, y, and z, it appears
that we shall have at the <U+FB02>uid surface, when nearly spherical,

where u, a, w are components of velocity parallel to the
coordinate axes, and where k is a coef<U+FB01>cient depending on
friction and viscidity. If no viscidity and no friction exists
we must have lc=0, and hence also
                        X=0, Y=O, z=0.
   Now as X, Y, and Z are the effective components with
which the nearly spherical mass of <U+FB02>uid acts at its surface
when each of them is separately equal to zero, it follows that
the <U+FB02>uid can do no work at the surface, and the motions of the
shell would take place quite independently of the contained
mass of <U+FB02>uid when the latter is totally devoid of friction and
viscidit .
   (3) it has long since been clearly shown that the motion of
the axis of the earth, considered as a solid body, may be de
termined by the differential equations

at any time depends upon O and V.

    (4) Mathematicians, during the past two centuries, have de
voted much attention to the question of the <U+FB01>gure of a rota
ting mass of <U+FB02>uid, with especial reference to the explanation
of the spheroidal <U+FB01>gures of the Earth and her sister planets.
 Solutions of this problem have been presented, especiall by
 Clairaut, Legendre, Laplace, Gauss, Ivory, Jacobi, and iry;
and it is not a little remarkable that in applying these solu
tions to the case of the Earth every one of these investigators
has not only supposed the Earth to have been originally in a
 <U+FB02>uid state, but that the particles of the mass retained the same
 positions after solidi<U+FB01>cation had taken place. This tacit or
 openly expressed assumption of the unchangeable position of
 the particles of the original <U+FB02>uid mass on their passage to a
 complete or partial state of solidity lies at the root of the whole
 question of the Earth’s structure. For the <U+FB01>rst time in the
 treatment of the physico-mathematical problem, I distinctly
 discarded this assumption, and I af<U+FB01>rmed that the position of
 the particles of matter, on passing from the state of <U+FB02>uidity to
 solidity, must assume positions in conformity with mechanical
 and physical laws. In this way the hypothesis of the Earth’s
 primitive <U+FB02>uidity became more simple and much more
 rational ,- for it was as manifestly absurd to assume that the
 particles of the <U+FB02>uid mass, on passing into a solid state of con
 sistence, retained their original positions, as it would be to
 assume that if the whole Earth became liqui<U+FB01>ed the positions
 of its particles would be unchanged. The corrected and sim
 pli<U+FB01>ed hypothesis is also fruitful in important results; but it is
 singular that, as far as I am aware, no mathematician seems
 to have understood or appreciated its bearing on the physical
 structure of the Earth, except M. Plana, by a remark in a
 memoir published by him towards the close of his career.

                Physical Structure of the Earth.               243
    (5) Before presenting my conclusions on the shape of the
inner surface of the solidi<U+FB01>ed shell and Plana’s remark relative
to the same subject, it is necessary to recall some results esta
blished by Clairaut, and frequently put forward by mathema
tical investigators of the Earth’s <U+FB01>gure.    It seems to be uni
versally admitted that if a mass of heterogeneous <U+FB02>uid com
posed of strata of equal density, each increasing in density
from the surface of the mass to its centre, is set in rotation,
the several strata will be spheroidal, but their ellipticities will
not be equal. The ellipticities will decrease from the outer
surface towards the centre. This law of decrease of ellip
ticity towards the centre is not a hypothetical result, but a
necessary deduction from the properties of <U+FB02>uids. As all
known <U+FB02>uids are compressible, such an arrangement of strata
 of equal density as that referred to must follow from the
 supposition of the existence of any mass of <U+FB02>uid of such
 magnitude as the whole Earth. The increase of the Earth’s
 density from its surface to its centre is, moreover, a fact
 clearly revealed by the mean density of the Earth being
glpuble that of the materials composing the outside of its solid
   ell.
    If the increase of density, in going from the surface to the
 centre of a large mass of <U+FB02>uid, is due to compression exer
 cised by the outer upon the inner strata, it follows that the
               total quantity
   reater thebetween
 (gli<U+FB01>'erence                  of <U+FB02>uid
                      the density  at itsthe greater
                                          surface andwill  be the
                                                       its centre,
 and the less the quantity of <U+FB02>uid the less will be this dif
 ference. With a small spheroid of compressible <U+FB02>uid, the
 variation of density might be neglected, and the mass re
 garded as homogeneous.       Suppose such a small mass of <U+FB02>uid
 to be set in rotation, its surface will become spheroidal, and
 it will have the well-known ellipticity 1} m, where m is
 the ratio of centrifugal force to gravity at the equator of the
 spheroid. If, new, this original spheroid be supposed to be
 overlaid with masses of the <U+FB02>uid, one after another, the inner
 portions will be sensibly compressed, and the whole mess will
 begin to vary in density in going from centre to surface. The
  outer surface will now present an ellipticity less than 2 m.
  If fresh layers of <U+FB02>uid are continually applied to the outer
 surface, the variation of density will continue, and the differ
 ence between the density at the centre and surface will increase.
 The ellipticity of the outer stratum of <U+FB02>uid will at the same
 time diminish to a value corresponding to the law of density.
 Let us now reverse this operation, and suppose a great mass
 of liquid in rotation, its outer stratum will be less dense than
 those beneath, and its greatest density must be at the centre.

244                   Prof. H. Hennessy on the
Let the outer strata of equal density be successively removed,
 so as to leave a succession of free <U+FB02>uid surfaces, until a spheroid
 is reached in which the difference of density is insensible. It
 is manifest that, with each successive removal of the upper
 stratum of liquid, the compression in the remaining strata be
 comes reduced, and also the variation in density from surface
 to centre, until this variation becomes altogether extinguished.
 With the same velocity of rotation, the ellipticities of the sur
 faces of liquid thus successively exposed would increase up to
 the limiting value, 2 m.
     If at any time of the Earth’s solidi<U+FB01>cation we sup ose
 a nucleus of <U+FB02>uid to be enclosed within the solid shell,
 the successive increasing of thickness of the shell, from the
 congelation of the <U+FB02>uid matter of the nucleus, must be accom
 panied by the removal of successive outer strata from the
 nucleus. From what has been seen already, the nucleus will
 tend to acquire an increase of ellipticity, and therefore to mould
 the semi<U+FB02>uid pasty matter about to pass into a solid state into
 a shape different from what it would have if no change what
 ever in the positions of the particles had taken place. As the
 nucleus is supposed to be in a state of fusion from heat, the
  successive additions to the inner surface of the shell from the
  matter of the nucleus must proceed at a very slow rate. The
  congelation of the surface-stratum of the nucleus must be a
 process of the same order of slowness as the <U+FB02>ow of heat
 through the shell; and the mathematical theory of conduc
 tion established by Fourier shows that this cannot proceed
 otherwise than slowly. The changes in shape of the surface
 of the nucleus would be correspondingly slow and gradual.
 When once a comparatively rigid outer crust had been formed,
 the process of moulding additional strata of solidi<U+FB01>ed matter
 against the inner surface of the crust from the nucleus would
 proceed in a slow and gradual order, so that the resulting
 solid strata would conform to the shape impressed upon them
 by the moulding forces. A remarkable illustration of the way
 in which fused matter ejected from the Earth’s interior may,
 while turning on its centre and at the same time cooling,
 mould itself against a solid crust formed upon it has been ad
 duced by Charles Darwin, and has been already quoted by me
 on a former occasion. From these considerations Ihave been
led to conclude, that the ellipticity of the shell’s inner surface
may exceed, but cannot be less than, the ellipticity of its outer
surface *; and, referring to the same question, Plana used the
 words, “ La loi des ellipticités a subi dans le passage de l’état
   "‘ See the subjoined representation of a section of the shell and
nucleus.

liquide a l’état solide une alteration sensible par laquelle
toutes les couches se sont constitueés de maniere a avoir un
méme applatissement et lus grand que le précédent.” M.
Plana. has further stated is views in the same volume of the
Astronomische Nachrichten for 1852, thus :—“ Il est permis de
penser que ces couches (de la <U+FB02>uide intérieuse) en se consoli
dant, ont subi des modi<U+FB01>cations a la verité fort petites, mais
assez grandes pour nous empécher de pouvoir dériver, avec
tout l’exactitude que l’on pourrait souhaiter, l’état de la Terre
solide de son état antérieure de <U+FB02>uidité.”
    This para raph gives a distinct adhesion to the im roved
form of the hypothesis of the original <U+FB02>uidity of the arth ;
and this concurrence on the part of M. Plana is the more im
portant, as it is possible that he had formed his conclusions
independently. He refers to a letter written by him on the
 subject to Humboldt ; and it is remarkable that, in the <U+FB01>fth
and last volume of ‘Gosmos,’ published not long before the
author’s death, some adjacent notes allude to Plana’s views,
and contain references to the investigations of Mr. Hopkins
and to my early researches. At this period Humboldt could
 scarcely have had time to examine the mechanical and physical
reasonings, and he merely quoted the papers in the ‘ Philo
phical Transactions’ as if he had seen them for the <U+FB01>rst time.
   am not aware of any evidence as to whether Plana had
known their contents; and it is possible that his conclusions
as to the forms of the strata of the shell and nucleus had been
formed independently, though published a short time after my
investigations.
   The annexed <U+FB01>gure may assist
in making clear the results of
the preceding paragraphs. The
outer ellipse represents the out
line of the exterior surface of the
Earth’s crust, which is shaded
and bounded inwardly by a sur
face slightlymore elliptical. The
<U+FB02>uid nucleus included within the
shell is represented with strata
decreasing in ellipticity towards
the centre. This arrangement
is necessarily followed by a mass
of <U+FB02>uid under such conditions
as the nucleus, or under the conditions of the entirely <U+FB02>uid
Earth. If the matter comp0sing the Earth underwent no
change in passing from the fluid to the solid state, instead
of the arrangement here represented, the inner surface of the

246              >  Prof. H. Hennessy on the
shell would have a smaller ellipticity than its outer surface,
and the strata of the shell, as well as those of the nucleus, would
be less oblate in going from the outer surface.
   (6) It is important to distinctly bear in mind that the con
stitution of the shell and nucleus indicated by the foregoin
reasonings is not based on any hypothesis of a speci<U+FB01>c law 0%
density of the interior strata of the Earth. It is a deduction
from the established properties of <U+FB02>uids quite as rigorous as
the conclusions regarding the spheroidal shape of a mass of
rotating liquid. On the other hand, the supposition tacitly
or openly made by Mr. Hopkins and his followers, that the
ellipticity of the inner stratum of the solid shell is precisely
the same as that which this stratum had when <U+FB02>uid, is not
merely a hypothesis—it is an assumption which is directly
contradicted by the recognized physical properties of all
known liquids, and even contradicted by the fundamental
principles of hydrodynamics. Upon this assumption was based
the calculation of the ratios of the inner and outer ellipticities
of the shell which would correspond to the observed value of
the precession of the Earth’s axis, and hence the limiting value
of the thickness of the shell. But when the fundamental
assumption on which this ratio is calculated is shown to be in
contradiction to physical and mechanical laws, the whole of
the conclusions drawn from such a calculation must fall to the
ground.
   In the Me’canique Celeste, Laplace, following Clairaut,
proved that if the density in a <U+FB02>uid spheroid decreases from
the centre to the surface, the ellipticity of the strata of equal
density must decrease from the surface towards the centre.
This result forms the groundwork of some of the arguments
employed in the present inquiry. Legendre and Laplace also
deduced a law of density from the properties of compressible
<U+FB02>uids, and from this law the latter unfolded a law of ellip
ticity of the strata of equal density. The results arrived at in
my present inquiry are manifestly totally independent of the
                    A sin qa
law of density p =            , deduced by Legendre and Laplace.
                        a
In order to apply this law to the strata of the solidi<U+FB01>ed shell,
the assumption must necessarily be made that the particles of
the <U+FB02>uid underwent no change in position on passing to the
solid state. This was assumed by Mr. Hopkins and Arch
deacon Pratt; and, as we have seen, such an assumption
is not only unwarranted, but is absolutely contradicted by the
established laws of hydrodynamics. My conclusions are not
only in harmony with those laws, but necessarily require them
to be kept constantly in view throughout the whole investi
gation.

   (7) The result obtained in section (3) allows of an imme-i
diate and easy application to the inquiry before us, if we admit
that the strata of equal density in the shell have all equal
ellipticities—an admission which has been already shown to
be a particular case of a rigorous and exact deduction from
hydrodynamical principles. In this case let us consider the
ratio of the difference of the moments of inertia of any sphe
roidal stratum to its greatest moment of inertia. It will
readily appear that the difference of the greatest and least
moments of inertia, of all the strata divided by the sum of the
greatest moments of inertia will be the same as that for a.
homogeneous shell whose inner and outer ellipticities are
equal.

 Consequently the precessional motion of such a shell would
 be the same as that of a homogeneous spheroid of the same
 ellipticity.    If e: 3(1.)—0, it appears that the value of precession
 for such a spheroid would be 57", while its observed value is
 50"‘1‘. Now, as it is impossible to admit such a difference
 where the result of observation is so well established, we must
 conclude that the solid shell of the Earth, composed of nearly
 equielliptic strata, cannot extend to its centre—in other words,
 that the Earth cannot be altogether a solid from its surface to
 its centre. On the other hand, the <U+FB02>uid nucleus contained
 within the shell cannot be devoid of friction and viscidity, but
 must possess these properties in common with all <U+FB02>uids that
 have ever been observed on the Earth’s surface.              These pro
 perties of the liquid may, as I have long since announced,
 cause the shell and fluid nucleus to rotate together as one solid
 mass. The same conclusion has been afterwards put forward
 by M. Delauney ; and experiments made under his direction,
 and afterwards, at the instance of the Royal Irish Academy,
 by me, show that, in rotating glass vessels <U+FB01>lled with water,
 the amount of friction and viscidity is such as to render any
 difference of slow motion between the liquid and its contain
 ing vessel insensible. With liquids so viscid that water is in
 comparison limpid, such as pitch, honey, and especially vol
 canic lava in a fused state, the results would be absolutely
 decisive. To this class of liquids the <U+FB02>uid matter of the Earth’s
 interior, so far as it has come under observation, undoubtedly
 belongs ; and hence the overwhelming certainty of our general
 conclusions as to the connexion between the Earth’s structure
 and its rotation.
     (8) If the tendency of the solid crust is to become more
 elliptical at its inner surface as it increases in thickness, some
 interesting consequences appear to follow. If the shell were
unaccompanied by the nucleus, or if no friction existed at
 their surfaces, the chan es in the relations of the principal
moments of inertia of the shell might be supposed to cause
   it A revision of the numerical data. from recent astronomical results
leads me to conclude that the precession for the solid spheroid would be a,
little less and about 55" instead of 57”. This I propose to rove in a short
paper, entitled “Note on the Annual Precession calculate on the hypo
thesis of the Earth’s Solidity.” This note leaves the general conclusions
of the present paper unaltered.

 which might result in a change of the axis of rotation. It is
 easy to show, on the most favourable suppositions, that this
 could not occur. The increasing ellipticity of the inner sur
 face of the shell would be due to the increasing oblateness of
 the surface of the <U+FB02>uid nucleus, and this would be at its maxi
 mum if the nucleus approached a state of homogeneity. But
 the <U+FB02>uid cannot approach this state unless the radius of the
 nucleus is so small that the variation in density due to pres
sure becomes insensible, whence all its strata would possess
the same density. This condition, with a certain thickness of
the solid shell, may bring about equality in the two principal
moments of inertia of the shell. The most favourable case
would be for a homogeneous shell; hence we have only to
solve the very simple problem :—Given the thickness of a
homogeneous spheroidal shell at its pole, required its thick
ness at the equator so as to make its principal moments of
inertia equal. We have from the expressions for 01 and Al

 XXIX. On the Magnetic Torsion of Iron and Nickel Wires.
            By SHELFORD BIDwnLL,
IN a paper published in the Phil. Mag. for July 1886, p. 50,
      Prof. G. Wiedemann refers to his well-known experi
mental researches into the relations between the torsion and
magnetization of iron wires. Let a longitudinally magne
 tized wire NS, be <U+FB01>xed at the south end S, the other end N
 being free, and let a battery current be passed through it
 from S to N, then the free end will be observed to twist in
 the direction of the hands of a clock as seen from the <U+FB01>xed
 end.
    Maxwelli' explains the phenomenon thus. The wire being
 magnetized both circularly and longitudinally, the resultant
 magnetization is in the direction of a right-handed screw round
 the wire. Now Joule found that an iron bar when longi
 tudinally magnetized was increased in length, its transverse
 dimensions being at the same time contracted. We should
 expect therefore that a spirally magnetized wire would expand
 in the direction of the magnetization and contract in directions
 at right angles to the magnetization. And thus the twisting
 would be produced.
    This explanation assumes that the torsional effect is simply
 secondary to and dependent upon the phenomena observed
 by Joule, and Prof. Wiedemann, for reasons given in his
 paper, appears not to be satis<U+FB01>ed with it.
    Some additional light may perhaps be thrown on the
 subject by a few experiments which I made at the beginning
 of the present year: They were intended to be merel)r of a

252           Mr. S. Bidwell on the Magnetic Torsion
preliminary nature, and I had hoped to be able to carry them
further; but so far as they go they appear to be conclusive, and
a short account of them may be of interest at the present time
in connection with the recent publication of Prof. Wiedmann.
    In two papers communicated to the Royal Society *, I
have pointed out that the effect of magnetization upon the
dimensions of an iron rod is not so simple as it had previously
been believed to be. Joule enuciated the law that the
elongation in a given bar is at <U+FB01>rst proportional to the
magnetic intensity, and that it ceases to increase after the
iron is fully “saturated.” My own experiments show that
if the magnetization is carried beyond the point at which the
elongation reaches a maximum, the length of the rod, instead
of remaining unchanged, steadily diminishes, until, when the
magnetizing current has attained a certain strength, the
original length of the rod is unaffected, and if this strength
be exceeded actual retraction is produced.                  From some
further experiments, details of which are not yet published, it
appears that effects of the same character occur when rings
are used instead of straight rods. The diameter of an iron
ring surrounded by a coil of wire was found to be increased
when a comparatively small current was passed through the
coil and diminished when the current was strong.
   I have also carried further Joule’s experiments regarding
the effects of magnetization upon the length of iron wires under
tension and ascertained, among other things, that a wire when
stretched by a weight attains its maximum elongation with a
smaller external magnetizing force than when it is free,
retraction apparently beginning at an earlier stage of magneti
zation.
   Lastly, I have repeated and con<U+FB01>rmed the experiments of
BarrettT upon nickel.         Barrett discovered that the length of
a nickel bar when longitudinally magnetized was diminished.
So far as appears from his published papers on the subject,
which are very brief, he worked only with comparatively
strong magnetizing currents, and it seemed to me possible
that, as in the case of iron, weaker currents might cause
elongation. But on trying the experiment I found that this
was not so. Magnetizing forces which were so small as to
produce no sensible effect whatever upon iron caused con
siderable diminution in the length of the nickel bar, and the
curve of retraction given in my paper (p. 131) clearly passes
through the intersection of the axes, and shows quite con

clusively that elongation cannot occur at any early stage of
the magnetization.
    Here then we have three classes of phenomena, which if
Maxwell’s explanation were correct would enable us to predict
certain variations in the torsional effects observed by Wiede
mann.
    Let us consider <U+FB01>rst the case of nickel. According to
Maxwell, a spirally magnetized iron wire is twisted in a cer
tain manner, because the iron expands in the direction of the
magnetization. Since, then, nickel contracts in the direction
of the magnetization, we should expect a nickel wire to twist
oppositely to an iron wire under similar conditions. This
I found to be so. Whether the magnetizing currents were
strong or weak, the twist of the nickel wire was always in
the direction opposite to that given by Wiedemann for iron.
     I was not aware until I read Wiedemann’s recent paper
that this experiment had been performed previously *.
Wiedemann discusses it fully and admits that the facts
accord with Maxwell’s explanation (p. 54). But he appears
to consider that it is a case of merely accidental coincidence :
 it is true that when longitudinally magnetized, iron expands
 while nickel contracts, and it is true that, when spirally
 magnetized, iron and nickel twist oppositely ; but the
 two sets of phenomena are quite independent and are
 not related to one another as cause and effect. The
torsion is to be explained, he thinks, by supposing that “the
 obliquely spiral direction which the molecules take up in con
 sequence of the two. magnetizations at right angles to each
 other ” is, owing to intermolecular friction, “ accompanied by
 a displacement of the longitudinal <U+FB01>bres and [of the] sections
 of the wires.” In iron the friction of the longitudinal <U+FB01>bres
 is the greatest, and thus the torsion in the observed direction
 is accounted for. In nickel the friction of the sections pre
 dominates ; a nickel wire is therefore twisted oppositely to an
 iron wire. For a more complete statement of Wiedemann’s
 views reference must be made to the paper 1'.
    * Knott, Proc. Ro . Soc. Edin. 1882—3. Quoted by Wiedeniann.
    1‘ I confess that I 0 not <U+FB01>nd it easy to follow the sug ested explanation.
 Passing over preliminary dif<U+FB01>culties, and assuming that the friction between
 the polar ends of adjoining molecules is different from that between their
  sides, it seems to me that the observed torsions could only be accounted
  for by assuming that in iron the friction of the ends is greater than the
 lateral friction, while in nickel the lateral friction is greatest. This appears
  to be directly opposed to Wiedemann’s statement; but though I have
  considered the question carefully and from several oints of view, I can
  arrive at no other conclusion. It is, however, possible that I may have
  altogether misunderstood the argument, the more so as the paper referred
  to is a translation.

251      On the Magnetic ll'oriiohiof‘fron kind Nickel Wires.
    The behaviour of nickel then, though in a moment with
Maxwell’s hypothesis, is not accepted by               iedemann as
affording con<U+FB01>rmation of it.
    But we have further means of testing the hypothesis. It
has been said that an iron rod when very strongly magnetized
is contracted instead of being elongated. Moreover, when the
rod is stretched by a weight contraction occurs with smaller
magnetizing forces than when it is unstretched. In accordance
with Maxwell’s explanation, therefore, an iron wire spirally
magnetized by very strong currents should twist (just as if
it were a nickel wire) in the opposite direction to that indi
cated by Wiedemann for iron ; and this reversal of the twist
 should take place at an earlier stage of the magnetization if
 the wire were stretched. Now this is exactly what I have
 found to be the case. The free end of an iron wire, through
 which a constant current is passing, can be made to twist in
 either direction byvarying the current through the surrounding
 helix, while with a certain medium strength of current there
is no movement at all. And again, when the wire is loaded
 with a weight, the current which produces no torsion is con
 siderably diminished, the reversal of the torsion also, of course,
 occurring with smaller currents.
    It is not easy to see how Wiedemann’s theory could fairly
 be made to explain these phenomena. He would be compelled
 to assume that when the iron is more intensely magnetized,
 that is, when the molecules are more completely turned in the
 same direction, the excess of longitudinal over transverse mo
 lecular friction, instead of becoming more marked, as might
 naturally be expected, would be decreased, and, with a suf<U+FB01>
 cient degree of magnetization, even converted into a de<U+FB01>
 ciency. It would also be necessary to assume that when the
 molecules of a wire are drawn apart by stretching the friction
 between their ends is nevertheless greater. Such assumptions
 would, I think, be highly unscienti<U+FB01>c.
     On the other hand, Maxwell’s explanation, which does not
 seek to go behind the magnetic elongations and retractions
 detected by Joule and others, <U+FB01>ts the newly observed facts
  easily and naturally.
                       Note on the Experiments.
    It seems desirable to give a few details of the experiments above
 referred to, though too much importance must not be attached to
 the quantitative results :—
    The iron wire used was '7 mm. in diameter and 20 cm. long. It
 was suspended in an upright position from a <U+FB01>xed clamp, and
 passed through a helix consisting of 876 turns of copper wire' in

              Tests of Herschel’s Ethereal Physics.            255
 12 layers.  To the lower end of the suspended wire was <U+FB01>xed a
 small plane mirror which re<U+FB02>ected an indicating beam oflight upon
an ordinary galvanometer-scale 127 cm. distant from it. 'Each
scale-division was equal to '64 mm. A steady current of about
1 ampere was passed through the iron wire from the clamp to the
free end, which dipped into a mercury-cup. The magnetizing coil
was in circuit with a battery of 7 Grove cells, a box of resistance
coils, a tangent galvanometer, and a. contact key.
   The de<U+FB02>ections of the spot of light when various currents were
passed through the coil are given below :—

    The current which produced no de<U+FB02>ection was obtained tenta
 tively by varying the resistance; a current slightly stronger or
weaker than that indicated caused a perceptible de<U+FB02>ection in one
 direction or the other. It will be seen that when the wire was
 loaded with a weight of 6'3 kilogrammes the current causing no de
<U+FB02>ection was reduced to one half of its former value. The de<U+FB02>ections
given above are those produced by the second and subsequent
 currents of the strength denoted. That due to the <U+FB01>rst current
 was uncertain, depending probably upon the previously existing
 permanent magnetism of the wire. This point, amongst others,
requires further investigation.

 square inch of surface must be about 17,000,000,000,000, 0r
 seventeen billions of pounds ; yet we live and move without
 appreciable resistance through this medium, inde<U+FB01>nitely harder
 and more elastic than adamant. All our ordinary notions
 must be laid aside in contemplating such an hypothesis ; yet

   Fiske (‘ The Unseen World,’ p. 20) cites the numerical por
tion of the above statement, and explains, in a footnote, that
“The <U+FB01>gures, which in the English system of numeration read
as seventeen billions, would in the American system read as
seventeen trillions.”
   Prof. De Volson Wood (Phil. Mag. [5] xx. p. 390) says :—
“Computations have been made of the density, and also of
the elasticity, of the tether, founded on the most arbitrary,
and in some cases the most extravagant, hypotheses.        Thus
Herschel estimated the stress (elasticity) to exceed
      17 X 109: (17,000,000,000) pounds per square inch ;
and this high authority has doubtless caused it to be widely
accepted as ap roximately correct. But his analysis was
founded upon t e assumption that the density of the aether
was the same as that of air at sea-level, which is not only
arbitrary, but so contrary to what we should expect from its
non-resisting qualities, as to leave his conclusion of no value.
That author also erred in assuming that the tensions of gases
 were as the wave-velocities in each, instead of the mean square
of the velocity of the molecules of a self-agitated gas; but
this is unimportant, as it happens to be a matter of quality
rather than of quantity. Herschel adds, ‘ considered accord
ing to any hypothesis, it is impossible to escape the conclusion
that the asther is under great stress.’ ”
   The mistakes which I will endeavour to point out in the
foregoing paragraphs seem to have widely prevailed. They
are the more remarkable on account of the especial pains
which were taken by Herschel to guard against them, and on
account of some of the results, which Prof. Wood supposes to
be new, being identical with those of Herschel and having
been obtained by precisely the same methods.
   Herschel discussed the question of aetherial intensity, <U+FB01>rst,
 on the corpuscular (‘Familiar Lectures,’ pp. 271—4), secondly
on the undulatory hypothesis (ibid. pp. 274—82) ; the second
portion of his discussion being made fuller and more satisfac
tory, on account of the resent general adoption of the theory
on which it rests.       His procedure was substantially as
follows :—
   Let h = height of Earth’s homogeneous atmosphere;
       v, = velocity of sound ;
       m = velocity of light ;
       g = gravitating acceleration at Earth’s equatorial
               surface ;

   Accordingly, he says :—“ Let us suppose now that an
amount of our aetherial medium equal in quantity of matter to
that which is contained in a cubic inch of air (which weighs
about one third of a grain) were enclosed in a cube of an inch
in the side. The bursting-power of air so enclosed we know to
be 15 lb. on each side of the cube. That of the imprisoned
aether, then, would be 15 times the above immense number
(or upwards of 17 billions) of pounds. Do what we will, adopt
what hypotheses we please, there is no escape, in dealing of
the phenomena of light, from these gigantic numbers; or
from the conception of enormous physical force in perpetual
exertion at every point, through all the immensity of space.”
    The italics in the above extract, which are Herschel’s, show
that the “bursting-power” referred to is not that of simple
aetherial elasticity, assumed to be “the same as that of air at
 sea-level,” but is that which is represented by the ratio of the
 elasticity to the density, or that which would be exerted if
 the air and the aether were reduced to the same density.
    The identity of Herschel’s and Wood’s methods is shown
by the following extract* :-—“ It may be asked, Can the
 kinetic theory, which is applicable to gases in which waves
 are propagated by a to-and-fro motion of the particles, be
 applicable to a medium in which the particles have a trans
 verse movement, whether rectilinear, circular, elliptical, or
irregular? In favour of such an application it may be stated
 that the general formulae of analysis by which wave-motion
 in general, and refraction, re<U+FB02>ection, and polarization in par
 ticular, are discussed, are fundamentally the same; and in
 the establishment of the equations the only hypothesis in
 regard to the path of a particle is—It will move along the
 path of least resistance. The expression V” oce+5 is gene
 rally true for all elastic media, regardless of the path of the
 individual molecules. Indeed, granting the molecular consti
 tution of the aether, is it not probable that the Kinetic theory
 applies more rigidly to the aether than to the most perfect of
 the known gases?” The identity of results is shown by Prof.
 \Vood’s statement (I. c. p. 416) that “ In a pound of the aether
 there is some 100,000,000,000 times the Kinetic energy of a
                           “ Phil. Mag. l. c. p. 392.

    The following paragraph (1. c. p. 415) filrnishes another
evidence :—
    “The ratio ofthe elasticity to the density in the tether is
exceedingly large compared with the same ratio in air. The
temperature of air being taken at 60° F. and the either at

Herschel’s result, calculated upon the same basis (op. cit.
p. 282), was 811,801,000,000. Through an inadvertent
transposition, Maxwell (Enc. Britan., English edition, article
“ Ether”) gave 8428, instead of 4828, for the quotient of

           XXXI. Bars and Wires ofvarying Elasticity.
   By C. CHREE, B.A., 'Fellow of King’s College, Cambridge*.
IN a previous paper'f I considered some cases of bars and
-       wires whose elastic properties, though constant over a
cross section, varied from point to point of their length.     In
the present aper a similar treatment is applied to certain
cases wheret e elastic properties vary with the distance from
the centre of the circular cross section, but are independent
of the distance of the cross section from the ends. Before
entering on this question, however, I wish to make some
remarks on the trustworthiness of the method employed in my
last and in the present paper.
     The mathematical determination of stress as a function of
strain is based upon a consideration of the molecular forces
operating at points in the interior of a solid. A difference
of opinion as to the nature of these forces has separated
elasticians into two schools, who differ as to the number of
independent elastic constants. Both schools, however, appear
to agree in assuming the same relation between stress and
strain to hold at the surface of a solid body as in its interior.
On this assumption, generally tacitly made, are based the
 ordinary surface-equations whose validity seems to have been
 seldom questioned.
     The phenomena existing at the common surface of two
 distinct elastic solid media have not been considered by many
  mathematicians. Green, however, in his celebrated papers on
  light, and others have supposed the same relations between
  stress and strain to exist in the surface-layers of each medium
  as in its interior, and this was assumed without comment in
  my previous paper.
     It is, however, apparent, that there will be in, say the <U+FB01>rst
  medium, a surface-layer of molecules within the range of
  molecular action of the molecules of the second medium.
  Thus, when one of these molecules in the <U+FB01>rst medium is dis
  placed, the change in the molecular force acting on it will be
  due partly to the action of the molecules of that medium, and
  partly to the action of those of the second medium. It is
  thus by no means obvious that the resultant change of mole
   cular force (i. e. the stress) will depend only on the elastic
   constants of the <U+FB01>rst medium. We may in fact imagine two
   surfaces constructed, the one in the <U+FB01>rst medium and the
   other in the second, between which the molecules are sub
  jected to forces which have their seat in both media,- and to
   this, extremely limited, region the strict applicability of the
                    * Communicated by the Author.

260             Mr. C. Chree on Bars and Wires
ordinarily accepted equations seems to me liable at least to
criticism.
   Since, however, the range of molecular action, and thus the
distance between these two imaginary surfaces, must be ex
tremely small, the elastic stresses over these surfaces must
form equilibrating systems ; and these systems of stresses are,
without any assumption, each expressible by the ordinary
formulae. It would thus appear that the ordinarily accepted
equations between the stresses at the common surface of two
media are, on the whole, as trustworthy as the three equations
usually given for the stresses at the surface of a single medium.
   In the case of media of <U+FB01>nite thickness, the equations I have
applied would thus appear as reliable as the ordinary equations
for a single medium; but their extension to a continuously
varying medium is open to objection. If, however, as in the
cases worked out in my previous paper and in the present, the
change be so gradual as to be inappreciable at distances of the
same order as the range of molecular action, the results ob
tained should be, at least forpractical purposes, comparatively
satisfactory.                                                  I
   If, as in the present paper, the surfaces of separation be not
plane, but cylindrical, no fresh dif<U+FB01>culty is introduced, as the
range of molecular action may be regarded as vanishing
 compared to the radii of curvature.
   There are a great variety of structures whose elastic pro
perties vary with the distance from a central axis, though the
same at corresponding points in all cross sections. Such a
condition of matters is sometimes intentionally produced ; as
when a bar, solid or hollow, is protected from the action of
certain <U+FB02>uids or gases by a coating of some other material.
The effect may also be due to the gradual operation of natural
agents, as when girders are exposed to the action of air or
 water. Sometimes the process of manufacture involves such
 variation in the material. Thus the process of drawing in
 creases the density and tenacity of the surface portions of a
 wire, which form a sort of rind to the inner and softer por
tions. Again, in metal casts of large cross section, it is well
known that the surface-portions differ very markedly from
 the interior, and that in particular the strength does not by
 any means increase as fast as the cross section.
    It thus seems desirable to <U+FB01>nd a solution for the equilibrium
 of a cylindrical bar exposed to longitudinal traction or pres
 sure, or to torsion, the bar being composed of two or more
 materials, or of one continuously varying material, such that
 surfaces of equal elasticity are cylinders coaxial with the outer
 and inner surfaces of the bar.

   For this end the fundamental equations of my previous
paper will suf<U+FB01>ce, and a reference to them will be denoted by
the letter a attached to the number of the equation. The
notation of that paper is also followed in the present.
   Let us, then, suppose a straight bar, of length l and uniform
cross section, to be composed of two different materials ; the
elastic constants of the inner material being m, n, and those of
the outer m1, n1. For greater generality we may suppose the
bar to be hollow, its inner surface being the cylinder 'r=b ;
the surface of separation and the outer surface are coaxial
cylinders whose radii are al and a respectively.
   From (4a), (12a), (13a), and (14a) we see that suitable
solutions are, in the case of longitudinal traction or pressure,
for the inner material,

where B, A, A’, A], A1’ are constants to be determined from
the surface-conditions. We shall suppose the bar <U+FB01>xed at the
end z=0 so that w and w, both must vanish with 2.             It is
then obvious that if the materials are to stick together through
out, B must be the same in the expressions for w and for w.
At each of the three surfaces r=b, r=a1, r=a we have to
satisfy the equations (10 a), putting}: 1 and a: 11:0. Now
the only stresses corresponding to t e solution (1) are

 normal forces such as atmospheric pressure, which can, how

At this last surface also the radial displacements in the two

the condition

   It should be noticed that, strictly, F should be distributed
so that there should be at every point of the terminal section
in the one material the traction R, and in the other the trac

occur; but if the traction be applied symmetrically so that its
resultant acts along the axis of the beam, and if the radius of
the cross section be small compared to the length of the beam,
the above solution may be regarded as suf<U+FB01>ciently correct,

   From (15), (16), and (17) all the constants of the solu

   According to many foreign elasticians, following Poisson,
m=2n for any elastic solid ; if this were correct, then neces
sarily 0:01, and the simple solution (19) would be true for
any combination of two elastic materials forming a cylinder,
whether hollow or not. This theory, however, seems to be
contradicted by experiment; still if, as in the case of wire,
both materials are of the same metal but have been exposed
to different treatment, it seems by no means unlikely that the
variation of the elastic constants m and n will follow the same
law, in which case a=¢rl obviously. In actual wire, of course,
there is no strict surface of demarcation answering to the
cylinder r=al of the above problem ; but in many cases the
transition is very rapid, and the absolute amount of change
considerable, and in such cases the previous solutions should
give results comparing favourably with those obtained by
neglecting the change altogether, as is usual.
   The same method will apply to any number of materials in
contact, the surfaces of separation being coaxial cylinders.
Thus, suppose there to be i+ 1 materials whose elastic con
stants, proceeding outwards, are in order (m, 11), (ml, 11]), . . .
(mi, 11,). Let the surfaces of separation be in order r=al . . .
r=a.-, the outmost surface of all being r=a, and the inmost,
if the cylinder be hollow, r=b. Employing also suf<U+FB01>xes to
distinguish the constants for the several materials, we may
take as the solution for the (s+1)th material, following (1),

    At each of the i surfaces of separation there are two equa
 tions of the types (21) and (22). At the outmost surface
 r=a, neglecting atmospheric pressure as before, we have
                 (m; —n,-) B + 27715Ai _ %Ali =0 ;        .  o
 and at the inmost surface r=b a similar equation, writing I;
 for a and dropping the suf<U+FB01>x. If the cylinder be not hollow
 this last equation does not exist, but in its place we obviously
 have A’ =0. Thus there are 2i+ 2 or 2i+ 1 equations accord
 ing as the cylinder is hollow or not, to determine the constants
_of types A and A’ in terms of B.        Of these constants each
 medium possesses two, except when the cylinder is solid,
 when the central medium has only one constant, viz. A.
 Thus, whether the cylinder be hollow or not the equations are
 the same in number as the constants, which thus may all be
 directly expressed in terms of B. The values of the constants
 can be at once written down under the form of determinants.
 To determine B, we have
       F=7r[(a12—1)2)R + (agz—a12)R1       . . . (a2—a;2)R,-].
     For the special case 7%“ = constant for all values of s, of
 which we have previously sseen the importance, a very simple
 solution holds.    In fact it is obvious from (21), (22), and
 (23) that all our conditions are then satis<U+FB01>ed by
                 A,’=A’,_1=...=0,
                 A, =A._, =...= —%B=—a B                       . (24)
 in our previous notation, a being, in accordance with this
 hypothesis, the same for all the media.      In this case the equa
  tion for B is simply
  F=qrB[(a12—b2)M+(a22—a12)Ml+...+ (a2-a.2)M.],... (25)
  where M, M1, &c. denote Young’s moduli for the several media.
  Also the solution (19) applies to all the media.
     The equations (21) and (22) have been established inde
  pendently of the absolute thickness of the layers : thus, under
  certain limitations to be presently considered, they may be
  supposed to hold when the thickness is inde<U+FB01>nitely reduced, and
  thus in the limit to apply to a continuously varying medium.
  Thus, dropping the suf<U+FB01>xes and writing r for a,+,, we get in
  place of the constants of types A and A’ certain functions of

 Being given the law of variation of m and n, we can from
 these equations get a differential equation in A or in A’ as is
 desired. To determine the constants of the solution, we have

                     2mA+(m—n)B—2n-r7 =0;
 when r=a, and also when r=b if the cylinder be hollow ; if
 it be solid, instead of the latter equation we have A’ =0 when
 r=O. In obtaining these equations we have, it seems to me,
 tacitly assumed that the force at any point is the same as if all
 the neighbouring material, at least on one side of a plane
 through the point, within the distance at which molecular
 forces are sensible, were the same as at the point considered.
 Thus, if the variation in the material were very rapid, the
 validity of deductions from these equations might be questioned.
    As an example of the use of (26) and (27), let us consider
the case of a solid cylinder of which the material has elastic
constants given by
                         m=mo(1 + pr),

    The chief use of the preceding investigations would pro
bably be in assigning the limit to the traction, pressure, or
torsion which could be applied with safety to a structure of
the kind considered.        Unfortunately there seems no general
agreement among practical men as to how the limits of safety
may be <U+FB01>xed for a material when exposed to any system of
force, except perhaps longitudinal traction. One theory that
seems to meet with considerable approval is that, whatever
the system of forces may be, the structure is safe so long as
the greatest positive strain does not exceed a certain limit, to
be determined experimentally for each separate material, pre
sumably by uniform traction. As to the correctness of this
limit for the case of uniform traction no doubt need be
entertained. It does not follow that rupture will ensue as
soon as this limit is passed; but the nature of the material
itself will‘be altered, and rupture will follow sooner or later.

                        of varying Elasticity.                  269
 In the case of traction the only positive strain is 3—1: or B,
 which is the same for all the media of which the bar may
 consist. If, then, the traction F be increased till B exceed
 the limit of safety of any one material, that material will
 <U+FB01>nally give way. Theoretically, of course, this material might
 give way uniformly all round, with the result that the traction
 F would then have to be supported by the remaining mate
 rials.   This would lead to increased strain in all these; but
 the structure as a whole would still be safe if this new strain
 were less than the limit of safety for each of the materials left.
 If the increased strain exceeded this limit then a second rup
 ture would occur, and so on. In practice, owing to some want
 of symmetry in the distribution of the traction, or to slight
 inequality in the material. the <U+FB01>rst yielding material would
 probably crack and give way only in the neighbourhood of
 one point. This would alter the distribution of the traction,
 and might bring it to bear most largely on the strongest
 materials. If, however, the result were that the line of action
 of the resultant of the tractional forces got displaced to a <U+FB01>nite
 distance from the axis of the cylinder, the strain would be
 considerably lessened at some points and considerably increased
 at others. It is obvious that such local increase of strain
 would be extremely dangerous. Thus the traction to be ap
 plied with safety to a composite bar of this kind should be
 calculated on the basis of the resultant strain not exceeding
 the limit of safety of the material for which the limit is least.
    In the case of longitudinal pressure B is negative, and for
 a bar of one isotropic material the other two principal strains
        du       '
 (viz.     and     are each equal to —0B. In accordance with
        dr
"the theory recently referred to, —0B should not exceed the
 limit of safety as determined for the material by longitudinal
‘traction. Others hold that the compression            e. B taken
 numerically) should not exceed a certain independent limit
.obtained from pressure experiments. The results we have
 obtained will enable the greatest pressure to be calculated
 which can be applied to a composite bar, without passing the
 limit of safety, for any one of the materials, determined in
 accordance with either of the above theories.
    In the case of torsion the only existent strain is the shear
 do
 Jz =Er, which is shown in any treatise on elastic solids to be
 equivalent to an equal extension and compression in directions
 making each an angle of 45° with the direction of shear, the

270           Mr. C. Tomlinson’s Further Remarks
numerical measure of either being ElEr. Thus, according to
the theory <U+FB01>rst mentioned, in the case of torsion of a compo
site circular bar, if the couple of torsion be such that §Er
exceed at any distance from the axis the limit of safety, as
determined by tractional experiments, for the material at that
distance rupture will ensue. The rupture would at <U+FB01>rst be
limited to the single material ; and if it proceeded right round
would merely produce an increased strain in the remaining
media, which might or might not, according to circumstances,
produce further rupture. In practice, rupture would in all
probability be at <U+FB01>rst limited to a small region, and the bar
would undoubtedly tend to become warped. Direct experi
ments on the rupture of isotropic bars by torsion may disprove
the above theory, but it is fairly obvious that the true law must
depend on the state of strain and stress in the material. Thus
the preceding solution will in any case supply the data that
may be necessary in determining the limit of safety of a
composite bar under torsion.
 XXXII. Further Remarks on Mr. Aitken’s Theory of Dew.
               By CHARLES TOMLINSON,:F.R.S.”’
     HAD no idea that the innocent title of my paper,
      “Remarks on a New Theory of Dew,” had a guilty
meaning ; but according to Mr. Aitken I “ was raising a false
contention,” and so attempting to place the author“ in oppo
sition to recognized authorities” ; that the results of his
investigation “are in no sense entitled to be called new ;”
and be repeatedly states that his investigation was not promul
gated in opposition to the theory of Dr. Wells, but “ in
extension of the work, the foundations of which were laid by
Dr. Wells.” Again, he says the new theory “is not in oppo
sition, nor are the results contrary to the teaching of Dr.
Wells.” Once more, the author “ never made any attempt to
 set aside Wells’s theory.”
    And yet it is curious to notice that ‘Chambers’s Journal’
 for May 29th last contains an article headed “A New Theory
 of Dew,” in which the writer, after giving an accurate outline
 of Wells’s theory, goes on to say that Mr. Aitken “ has brought
 forward many observations, and the results of numerous
 experiments, which appear to prove that Dr. Wells’ theory of
 dew is not, after all, correct.” We are further informed that
                 * Communicated by the Author.

                on Mr. Aitken’s Theory of Dew.                  271
“ the essential difference between the old and the new theories
is as to the source of the moisture which forms the dew.
Instead of being condensed from the air above by the cool
vegetation, Mr. Aitken maintains that it comes from the
  round.”
   Again the Chambers’s article, referring to Wells, says :—
“ The points of the grass, small twigs, and all other good
radiating surfaces are cooled the most; and accordingly we <U+FB01>nd
the dew-drops most abundant on these bodies ; whilst on metal,
or hard stone surfaces, which are poor radiators, we seldom or
never <U+FB01>nd any dew.” This is the Wells picture ; the writer
now turns to the Aitken picture. “ A closer observation
reveals the fact that these so-called ‘ dewdrops ’ are formed at
the end of the minute veins of the leaves and grass, and are
not now recognised as dew at all, but moisture exuded from
the interior of the plants themselves.”
    And yet Mr. Aitken is angry with me for calling his theory
 new, and for asserting that, if true, it will supersede the labours
 of previous observers. He says :—“I do not <U+FB01>nd that he
 [Mn Tomlinson] adduces any results of previous observers
 that are in any way rendered nugatory by the results set forth
 in my paper.”
    If Mr. Aitken would condescend to study the classical
 memoir of Melloni (an abstract of which occupies the greater
 part of my paper), I should be much surprised if he did not
 become a convert to its experimental methods and conclusions.
  But at present he sees through the spectacles of his own theory,
 and therefore cannot appreciate the force of Melloni’s singular
  care with which he protected his thermometers from sharing in
  the radiation of the surrounding bodies, whose temperature
  they had to indicate; for while other observers get differences
  of temperature between their two thermometers, amounting in
  some cases to as much as 16° or 18° F., Melloni is satis<U+FB01>ed
  with a difference of only 2° or 3° 0., and his theory of convec
  tion justi<U+FB01>es this modest difference, and also accounts for
  many other phenomena, including the inverted trays and other
  objects which Mr. Aitken found wetted only on their under
  surfaces.          I
     In like manner Mr. Aitken does not see the force of the
  observations made in Persia and the African Desert, seeing
  that his remarks “ apply only to this climate.”         Surely the
  great forces of Nature rule as impartially in Persia and in
  Africa as in Scotland ; and where no aerial vapour exists,
  there is no deposit of dew. The cases given were intended to
  show that in the arid regions there was no dew ; but that long

272 Further Remarks on Mr. Aitken’s Theory of Dew.
before the travellers reached any considerable body of water,
nocturnal dews were abundant, and they were deposited from
the air, and did not rise out of the ground.
   Mr. Aitken also remarks that my notice of the Florentine
Academicians, of Robert Boyle, and Le Roi have no bearing
on the subject. The bearing is that these early observers
proved that the moisture which forms dew and hoar frost
exists in the air, and does not exhale from the ground.
    Mr. Aitken is also “ puzzled to understand ” what bearing
Pictet’s observation has on the subject. In the abstract in
‘ Nature ’ of Mr. Aitken’s memoir, it appears as an original
discovery that “ these observations made at night showed the
ground at a short distance below the surface to be always
hotter than the air over it.” Pictet observed the same fact in
1779. So also in my account of the weighed turf, I certainly
did not wilfully form a “ misconception of the essential features
of the experiment,” when I compared it to objects which, when
exposed on Patrick Wilson’s scale-board, gained weight, while
in Mr. Aitken’s case the turf lost weight. It is true that my
observations were founded on the abstract of the memoir
contained in ‘Nature.’ In January last I wrote for a copy
of the memoir, which was promised as soon as the ‘ Edinburgh
Transactions’ were published. I waited until May and did
not receive it. I inquired for it at the Royal Society in June,
but it had not arrived, nor have I yet had the privilege of
reading it.    Mr. Aitken is therefore entitled to any advantage
that may arise from my use of the abstract instead of the
original memoir.
    As I do not intend to write again on this subject, I conclude
by assuring Mr. Aitken that I have no unfriendly feeling
towards him; but on the contrary freely admit that he has
achieved much good scienti<U+FB01>c work, which I cannot but
admire ; but as regards his new theory of Dew I think he has
gone astray, and in the interests of scienti<U+FB01>c truth I have
ventured to criticise it. The subject is one that has occupied
a great deal of my attention, and there is no doubt in my mind
that, if this theory be accepted, a large amount of excellent
fwork on the part of <U+FB01>rst-rate observers must be set aside as
 alse.

depends upon the position of the dielectric, the primary seat
of the transfer of energy. The expression for H1, the mag
netic force at distance 1- from the axis, will now be
          H1:{J1(s,r)—(J1/K1)(sla0)K1(s1'r-)}A1; . . (49)
instead of the former A1J1(s1r), of the <U+FB01>rst of equations (18);
if we impose the condition H1=O at the inner boundary of
the wire (as we may still call the inner tube).      This means
that there is to be no current from r=0 to r=a0 ; we there
fore ignore the minute longitudinal dielectric current in this
space, just as we ignored that beyond r=a3 previously. If
we wish to necessitate that this shall be rigidly true, we may
suppose that within r=a0 and beyond r=a3 we have not
merely h=0, but also 0:0, thus preventing current, either
conducting or dielectric. In any case, with only lc=O, the
dielectric disturbance must be exceedingly small. On this
point I may mention that my brother, Mr. A. W. Heaviside,
experimenting with a wire and outer tube for the return,
using a (for telegraphic purposes) very strong current, rapidly
 interrupted, and a sensitive telephone in circuit with a parallel
 outer wire, could not detect the least sign of any inductive
action outside the tube, at least when the source of energy
 (the battery) was kept at a distance from the telephone. In
explanation of the last remark, we need only consider that,
although the transfer of energy is from the battery along the
tubular space between the wire and return, yet, before getting
to this con<U+FB01>ned space, there is a spreading out of the disturb
ances, so that in the neighbourhood of the battery the disk of
a telephone may be strongly in<U+FB02>uenced by the variations of
the magnetic <U+FB01>eld. On the other hand, the induction between
parallel wires whose circuits are completed through the earth,
is perceptible with the telephone at hundreds of miles distance,
or practically at any distance, if the proper means be taken
which theory points out. His direct experiments have, so far,
only gone as far as forty miles, quite recently ; but this may
easily be extended.

274                 Mr. O. Heaviside on the
   Corresponding to (49) we shall have
       477F1=81{J0(81’I‘)—(J1/K1)(8100)K0(811')} A1 ;     .   (50)
omitting, in both, the z and tfactors. Now, to obtain the
corresponding develop‘ment of the general equation (22), we
have only to change t e J0(sla1) in it to the quantity in the
{} in (50) and the J1(sla1) to that in the {} in (49), with
'r=a1 in both cases.
   The method by which (22) was got was the simplest pos
sible, reducing to mere algebra the work that would otherwise
involve much thinking out ; and,in particular, avoiding some
extremely dif<U+FB01>cult reasoning relatively to potentials, scalar
and vector, that would occur were they considered ab inizio.
But, having got (22), the interpretation is comparatively easy.
Starting with the inner tube, (49) is the general solution of
(14), with the limitation H1=O at r=a0, if, in 8, given by
                     —8§=41w1k11>+m’,
we let 10 mean d/dt and 112“ mean -—d2/dz2, instead of the con
stants in a normal system of subsidence, and let Al be an
arbitrary function of z and t. Similarly, (50) gives us the
connection between P and A1. From it we may see what A1
means. For, put 1-=ao in (50) ; then, since
                   (J0K1_J1KO)       = -—$_l,
we see that A1: —41ra0K1(s1a0)F0, if F0 is the current-density
at r=a0. When the tube is solid, A 1 = 41rFO/s1. But, without
knowing A1, (49) and (50) connect HI and [‘1 directly, when
A, is eliminated by division. Also H1=Cl X(2/r), if 01 be
the total longitudinal current from 'r'=a0 to 9" ; hence

connects the current-density and the integral current.
   Now pass to the outer tube. Quite similarly, remembering
that H3=O at r=a3, we shall arrive at

connecting F3, the longitudinal current-density at distance 1
in the outer tube, with C3, the current through the circle of
radius r in the plane perpendicular to the axis.
   Next, let there be longitudinal impressed electric forces in
the wire and return, of uniform intensities el and eg, over the
sections of the two conductors. We shall have
             P1P1=el+E1J PaP3=ea+Es; - . . . (53)

at the place considered ; the positive direction in the circuit
being along the wire in the direction of increasing z, and
oppositely in the return.
   If in (51) we take r=a,, and r=a2 in (52), and use them
in (54), then, since C, becomes 0, the wire current, and 03
becomes the same plus the longitudinal dielectric current, if we
agree to ignore the latter, and can put El—Es in terms of C,
 (54) will become an equation between e and O.           r=a2
    To obtain the required El—Ea, consider
a rectangular circuit in a plane through
the axis, two of whose sides are of unit
 length parallel to z at distances a1 and a,            0
 from the axis, and the other two sides
parallel to r, and calculate the E.M.F. of

which establishes the equivalence.
    Particular attention to the meaning of the quantity V is
needed. It is the line-integral of the radial force in the
dielectric from r=a1 to r=a2.       ()r it may be de<U+FB01>ned by
                          SV=27rala=Q,
if Q be the charge per unit length of wire. But it is not the
electric potential at the surface of the wire. It is not even
the excess of the potential at the wire boundary over that at
the inner boundary of the return. For, as it is the line
integral of the electric force from end to end of the tubes of
 displacement, it includes the line-integral of the electric force
 of inertia. It has, however, the obvious property of allowing
us to express the electric energy in the dielectric in the form of
a surface-integral, thus, éVa per unit area of wire surface, or
 §VQ per unit length of wire, instead of by a volume integra
tion throughout the dielectric. Hence the utility of V. The
 possibility of this property depends upon the comparative
 insigni<U+FB01>cance of the longitudinal current in the dielectric,
 which we ignore.       It may happen, however, that the longi
 tudinal displacement is far greater than the radial ; but then
 it will be of so little moment that the problem could be taken
 to be a purely electromagnetic one. We need not use V at
 all, (58) being the equation between e and 0 without it. It
 is, however, useful in electrostatic problems, for the above
 mentioned reason. Again, instead of V, we may use a- or Q,
 which are de<U+FB01>nitely localized.
     The physical interpretation of the force —dV/dz, in terms
 of Maxwell’s inimitable dielectric theory, a theory which is
 spoiled by the least amount of tinkering, confusion and
 bemuddlement immediately arising, is suf<U+FB01>ciently clear, espe
 cially when we assist ourselves by imagining the dielectric
 displacement to be a real displacement, elastically resisted, or
 any similar elastically resisted generalized displacement of a
 vector character. When there is current from the wire into
 the dielectric there is neceSsarily a back electric force in it
 due to the elastic displacement; and if it vary in amount
 along the wire, its variation constitutes a longitudinal electric
 force.
     (58) being a differential equation previously, let in it m2 be
 a constant. Then R,” and R2” may be thus expressed :—

    The assumption above made is, in general, justi<U+FB01>able.
    Let us now compare these equations with the principal
ways that have been previously employed to express the con
ditions of ropagation of signals along wires. For simplicity,
leave out t e impressed force e. First, we have Ohm’s system,
which may be thus written :—
                dV             d0              J‘V       .
Here the <U+FB01>rst equation expresses Ohm’s law.                  0 is the wire

                     Self-induction of Wires.            '     279
current, R the resistance per unit len th, and V is a quantity
whose meaning is rather indistinct in O m’s memoir, but which
would be now called the potential. The second equation is of
continuity.    Misled by an entirely erroneous analogy, Ohm
supposed electricity could accumulate in the wire ina manner
expressed by the second of (70), wherein S therefore depends
upon a speci<U+FB01>c quality of the conductor. The third equation
results from the two previous, and shows thatV, or C, or Q: SV
diffuse themselves through the wire as heat does by differences
of temperature when there is no surface loss. This system
has at present only historical interest. The most remarkable
thing about it is the getting of equations correct in form, at
least approximately, by entirely erroneous reasoning.
    The matter was not set straight till a generation later, when
Sir W. Thomson arrived at a system which is formally the
same as (70), but in which V is precisely de<U+FB01>ned, whilst S
changes its meaning entirely. V is now to be the electro
static potential, and S is the electrostatic capacity of the con
denser formed by the opposed surfaces of the wire and return
 with dielectric between. The continuity of the current in the
wire is asserted; but it can be discontinuous at its surface,
 where electricity accumulates and charges the condenser. In
 short, we simply unite Ohm’s law (with continuity of current
 in the conductor) and the similar condenser law. The return
 is supposed to be of no resistance, and V=0 at its boundary.
    The next obvious step is to bring the electric force of inertia
 into the Ohm’s law equation, and make the corresponding
change in that of V ; that is, if we decide to accept the law of
 quasi-incompressibility of electricity in the conductor, which is
implied by the second of (70), when Sir W. Thomson’s mean
 ings of S and V are accepted. Kirchhoff seems to have been
 the <U+FB01>rst to take inertia into account, arriving at an equation
 of the form        div/dz? = (R + Lp)SpV.
 I am, unfortunately, not acquainted with his views regarding
 the continuity of the current, so that, translated into physical
 ideas, his equation may not be conformable to Maxwell’s ideas,
 even as regards the conductor. Also, as his estimation of the
 quantity L was founded upon Weber’s hypothesis, it may
 possibly turn out to be different in value from that in the next
 following system. In ignorance of Kirchhoff’s investigation,
 I made the necessary change of bringing in the electric force
 of inertia in a paper “ On the Extra Current” (Phil. Mag.
 August 1876), getting this system,
     ; =(R+ L100, - dC
  - dV                      7,; =31”, d2V  37 =(R+LP)SPV, (71)

280                   Mr. O. Heaviside on the
wherein everything is the same as in Sir W. Thomson’s system,
with the addition of the electric force of inertia —LpO, where
L is the coef<U+FB01>cient of self-induction, or, as I now prefer to
call it, for brevity, the inductance, per unit length of the wire,
according to Maxwell’s system, being numerically equal to
twice the energy, per unit length of wire, of the unit current
in the wire, uniformly distributed. Coming after Maxwell’s
treatise, there is of course no question of any important step
in advance here, except perhaps in the clearing away of
hypotheses involved in Kirchhoff’s investigation.
   The system (71) is amply suf<U+FB01>cient for all ordinary pur
poses, with exceptions to be later mentioned. It applies to
short lines as well as to long ones ; whereas the omission of L,
reducing (71) to (70), renders the system quite inapplicable
to lines of moderate length, as the in<U+FB02>uence of S tends to
diminish as the line is shortened, relatively to that of L. An
easily made extension of (71) is to regard R as the sum of
the steady-<U+FB02>ow resistances of wire and return, and V as the
quantity Q/S, Q being the charge per unit length of wire.
 Nor are we, in this approximate system (71), obliged to have
the return equidistant from the wire. It may, for instance,
be the earth, or a parallel wire, with the corresponding changes
in the formula for the electrostatic capacity and inductance.
   But there are extreme cases when (71) is not suf<U+FB01>cient.
For example, an iron wire, unless very <U+FB01>ne, by reason of its
high inductivity ; a very thick copper wire, by reason of
thickness and high conductivity ; or, a very close return
current, in which case, no matter how <U+FB01>ne a wire may be,
there is extreme departure from uniformity of current dis
tribution in the variable period ; or, extremely rapid reversals
of current, for, no matter what the conductors may be, by
sufficiently increasing the frequency we approximate to
surface conduction.
   We must then, in the system (71), with the extension of
meaning of R and V just mentioned, change R and L to R’
and L’, as in (67), and other equations. In a S.H. problem,
this simply changes R and L from certain constants to others,
 depending on the frequency. But, in general, it would I
imagine be of no use developing R1" &c. in powers of 1), so
that we must regard (R1'+L1’p) &c. merely as a convenient
abbreviation for the R,” &c. de<U+FB01>ned by (56) and (55).
   A further re<U+FB01>nement is to recognise the differences between
R’ and L’ in one m system and another, instead of assuming
m=0 in ELL. And lastly, to obtain a complete development,
and exact solutions of Maxwell’s equations, so as to be able to
fully trace the transfer of energy from source to sink, fall

                       Self-induction of Wires.               281
~back upon (57), or (22), and the normal systems (18) of
 Part I.
    Now, as regards our obtaining the expansions of R'1 &c. in
 powers of p”, we have to expand the numerators and the
 denominators of R1” and R,” in powers of p, perform the
 divisions, and then separate into odd and even owers.
 When the wire is solid, the division is merely of 12%         by
 J1(w), a comparatively easy matter. The solid wire R’ and
 L’ expansions were given by Lord Rayleigh (Phil. Mag.
 May 1886). I should mention that my abbreviated notation
 was suggested by his. But in the tubular case, the work is
 very heavy, so, on account of possible mistakes, I go only as
 far as 112, or three terms in the quotient. The work does not
 need to be done separately for the inner and the outer tube,
 as a simple change converts one R’ or L’ into the other.
 Thus, in the case of the inner tube, we shall have

    As for Ll', it is simply the inductance of the tube per unit
 length (of the tube only), as may be at once veri<U+FB01>ed by the
 square of force method. The <U+FB01>rst correction depends upon
103. But Rf gives us the <U+FB01>rst correction to El, which is the
 steady-<U+FB02>ow resistance, so it is of some use. To obtain R2'
 and L2’ from these, change R1 to R3, M and k1 to [4,3 and k3,
 a0 to as, and al to 11;.   Or, more simply, (72) and (73) being
 the tube-formulae when the return is outside it, if we simply
 exchange a0 and a1 we shall get the formulae for the same
 tube when the return is inside it.
    If the tube is thin, there is little change made by thus
 shifting the locality of the return. But if a,/a0 be large,
 there is a large change. This will be readily understood by
 considering the case of a wire whose return is outside it, and
 of great bulk. Although the steady resistance of the return
 may be very low, yet the percentage correction will be very
 lar e, compared with that for the wire.

     The high-speed tube formulae are readily obtained.       Those
 for the inner tube are the same as for a solid wire, and that
 for the outer tube depends not on its bulk, but on its inner
 radius. That is, in both cases it is the extent of surface that
 is in question, next the dielectric, from which the current is
 transmitted into the conductors. Let Go(.r)=(2/1r)Ko(.z),

    It is clear that the thinner the tube, the greater must be
the frequency before these formulae can be applicable. For
the steady-<U+FB02>ow resistance is increased inde<U+FB01>nitely by reducing
the thickness of the tube, whilst the high-speed resistance is
independent of the stead -<U+FB02>ow resistance, and must be much
greater than it.      In (75) then, 9 must be       reat enough to

The L may be taken as Lo, except in the case of iron.
    I will now give the S.H. solution in the general case,
subject to (58). Let there be any distribution of e (longitu
dinal, and of uniform intensity over cross sections). Expand
it in the Fourier series appropriate to the terminal conditions
at z=0 and l. For de<U+FB01>niteness, let wire and return be joined
direct, without any terminal resistances.     Then, e0 sin at being
e at distance .2, the proper expansion is
              eo=e00 +e01 cos mlz + e02 cos mgz+ . . . ,
where m1=vr/l, m,=21r/l, &c. [It should be remembered that
e is the el—e, of (54) and (53). Shifting impressed force
from the wire to the return, with a simultaneous reversal of
its direction, makes no difference in 0. Thus two e’s directed
the same way in space, of equal amounts, and in the same
plane 2 = constant, one in the inner, the other in the outer
conductor, cancel.      This will clearly become departed from
as the distance of the return from the wire is increased.] Then,

    I have already spoken of the apparent resistance of a line
 as its impedance (from impede). The steady <U+FB02>ow impedance
 is the resistance.    The short line impedance is (R2+L2n2)§l

or (R'2+L'2n2)!l, at the frequency n/27r, according as current
densit differences are, or are not, ignorable. The impedance
accor ing to the latter formula increases with the speed, but
is greater or less than that of the former formula (linear
theory) according as the speed is below or above a certain
   eed. if the speed is suf<U+FB01>ciently increased, even on a short
spBut
line, the formula ceases to represent the impedance, whilst, if
the line be long it will not do so at any speed except zero.
According to (82) we have
                   (BI2 + Lmn2)}
          vo/co=                  (62P‘+e'2P‘-2 cos 2Ql)’, (83)
                       2(sn)‘k
 as the distant end impedance of the line. That is, we have
 extended the meaning of impedance, as we must (or else have
a new word), since the current-amplitude varies as we pass
 from beginnin to end of the line. (83) will, roughly
 speaking, on t e avera e, give the greatest value of the
 impedance. It is what t e resistance of the line would have
 to be in order that when an S.H. impressed force acts at one
 end, the current-amplitude at the distant end should be,
 without any electromagnetic and electrostatic induction, what
 it really is. The distant end impedance may easily be less
 than the impedance according to the electromagnetic reckon
 ing.   What is more remarkable, however, is that it may be
 much less than the steady-<U+FB02>ow resistance of the line.         This is
 due to the to-and-fro re<U+FB02>ection of the dielectric waves, which
 is a phenomenon similar to resonance.
    To show this, take R' =0 in the <U+FB01>rst place, which requires
 the conductors to be of in<U+FB01>nite conductivity. Then L'=L0,
 the dielectric inductance. We shall have, by (83) and (78),
                    Vo/Co=Lovsin(nl/v),         .   .  .  .  .   (84)
 where v: (LOS)'*=(/t,cg)'5, the speed of waves through the
 dielectric when undissipated. The sine is to be taken positive
 always. If nl/v=vr, 271', &c., the impedance is zero, and the
 current-amplitude in<U+FB01>nite.        Here nl/v='n' means that the
 period of a wave equals the time taken to travel to the distant
 end and back again, which accounts for the in<U+FB01>nite accumu
 lation, which is, of course, quite unrealizable.

    and the Equations of the Dynamo. By Professor SILVANUS
    P. THOMPSON, 1180., B.A.*
                    1. The Lamont-Frolich Formula.
DR. 0. FROLIOH has done me the honour of replying't
          to a certain point in my former communication to the
Physical Society, “ On the Law of the Electromagnet and the
Law of the Dynamo”1. In that communication I pointed

       Electromagnet and the Equations of the Dynamo.       289
out that Lamont had in 1867 published a rational theory of
the electromagnet, based upon the assumption that the per
meability of the iron was at every stage of the magnetization
proportional to the de<U+FB01>cit of saturation, leading him to an
exponential expression,
                         “Mo—er).
where m is the magnetism present at any stage, M its maxi
mum value, k the ratio of the permeability to the de<U+FB01>cit of
saturation, and a: the magnetizing force proportional (approxi
mately) to the number of ampere-turns of the magnetizing
current. This formula more correctly expressed the facts than
either of the commoner formulae of Lenz and Jacobi and of
Miiller.
   I further pointed out that Lamont had himself* given, as a
suf<U+FB01>cient approximation to the formula, the simpler expression,
                          m_ aMa:
                            _ M +am’
which formula is mathematically identical with that now
commonly attributed to Dr. Frolich. For, writing a=lcM,
we get at once
which is the formula claimed by Frolich.
   Lamont having developed his exponential expression in a
series of ascending powers of hat, I did the same for the
simpler formula for the purpose of comparison, and showed
that, neglecting the fourth and higher terms of each series, the
expansions are very nearly equal for all values of km except
for very large ones, and are identical for the value kw=§.
 Dr. Frolich, overlooking the words I have above italicized,
commits the mistake of supposing that I had said that La
mont’s exponential expression is identical in value with the
simpler formula when kx=15i. I have said nothing of the
kind.
   Further, when Dr. Friilich says, “ Hiernach ist die Aussicht
vorhanden dass nicht die Lamontsohe sondern die von mir
benutzte Formel die wahre Gesetz der Elektromagnete ent
h'alt,” he is forgetting that the formula used by him is also
 Lamont’s. He has proved, in his most recent communication,
 that the differences between the calculated and the observed
 values are about half as great when calculated by the simpler
 formula. The second and simpler formula suggested by
 Lamont appears therefore to be better than the <U+FB01>rst and more

  290           Dr. S. P. Thompson on the Formula: of the
  complex formula which he suggested. It has been recently
  shown by Mr. Bosanquet“ that if we take as expressive of the
  permeability, not the instantaneous value dm/dw, but the
  integral value m/a', and treat this on Lamont’s plan as pro
  portional to the de<U+FB01>cit of saturation,
                              m
 we deduce at once theE formula in question.                  Dr. Friilich’s
 researches upon the dynamo have given us the most complete
 and perfect proofs of the adequacy of the formula to represent
 the facts of the electromagnet as it is used in practice. My
 former communication was indeed mainly written to point
 out the extreme value and interest of Dr. Friilich’s work
 from this point of view.
         2. Fro'lich’s simplified Formula of the Electromagnet.
      Since my former communication to the Physical Society
 was made, a further work on the theory of the dynamo by
 Dr. Frtilich has appeared‘l'. In this work he carries the sim
 pli<U+FB01>cation of the formula of magnet and of dynamo one stage
 further by introducing considerations somewhat closely con
 nected with those which entered into my own work of 1883-4.
      The form adopted by me in 1883 for the Lamont-Frolich
 formula was
                                 _ GKS'l
                                 _ 1+o'Si5
Where H is the resulting average intensity of the magnetic
<U+FB01>eld (in which the armature rotates), 1c the initial value of the ‘
 magnetic permeability, G a coef<U+FB01>cient depending upon such
purely geometrical quantities as the form and size of core,
 pole-pieces, and coils, S the number of windings of the mag
netizing coil, and 0' the “saturation-coef<U+FB01>cient.” This can be
transformed at once to Frtilich’s form by writing M=Glc/a';
lc=a' ; .re=Si. In 1884 I pointed outi the nature of this
 saturation-constant and its importance in the resulting equa
tions of the dynamo. It is the reciprocal of that number of
ampere-turns which, to mark its importance, I ventured to
 term “ diacritical,” namely that number of ampere-turns which
will reduce the instantaneous value of the magnetic permeability
to half its initial value, or which, in the formula used, will give

to the magnet exactly half its maximum magnetism. I further
pointed out in my lectures on the dynamo that year, that, if the
number of windings of the coil S is given, there will be a “ dia
critical” current, namely a particular value of current which
will exactly half-saturate the magnet. Dr. Friilich has inde
pendently made use of this conception, and has applied it to
the formula of the electromagnet.          The argument is his, but
I retain the notation I have used.
     Writing (Si)’ for the diacritical number of ampere-turns,
we have (as I showed in 1884) (Si)’ =1/a-.

we have
                                   Si
                        H — Y Si + (Si) '
where Y is obviously the limiting maximum value of H when
the excitement is in<U+FB01>nitely great. If S is given, then i’ is
the diacritical current, and the expression becomes
                                     'L
                           H_Yuw’
which is true for every electromagnet excited by a single
 current.    Two observations made on any electromagnet will
determine the two constants Y and i’. Further, if r be the
 resistance of the magnetizing coil, since ir=e (the potential
requisite to send the current through the coil), we may
 obviously write the equation
                                    e
                          H—Ye + e’ ’
 Where e’ is the diacritical difference of potential, namely that
 difference of potential which, applied to the coil of resistance
r and of S convolutions, will half-saturate the core.
      The extreme convenience of this form of the law of the
 electromagnet must be at once apparent, since it enables the
 equation of a given magnet to be instantly adapted to the case
 of any given current or potential, and is equally applicable to
 express either the intensity of the <U+FB01>eld or the magnetic moment
 of the magnet. To put the matter in a more general way, let
 1},- represent current, or potential, or ampere-turns, and let 4/

292        Dr. S. P. Thompson on the Formula of the
be the diacritical value of the same for the given magnet ; let
¢ be the intensity of the <U+FB01>eld, or the strength of the pole, or
the magnetic moment, or the integral of the magnetic induc
tion, and (I) its maximum value; then
                              _ _\"_.
                                      +1?!
This being the general equation of the electromagnet, it
remains to be shown how excessively simple become the
equations of the various kinds of dynamo.
            3. Equations of the Series-wound Dynamo.
   If A is the “ equivalent area ” of the coils of the armature,
and H the average strength of the <U+FB01>eld in which it turns, the
number of lines of force out in each quadrant is AH ; hence
the average electromotive force at the speed it is
                              E=4nAH..           .   .   .   .   .   .  (1)
But                            H=Y._i_T/’
                                       i+i
and, writing B=4AY, and rememberin that, if 2R be the
sum of the resistances in the circuit, %/2R=i (by Ohm’s
law), we get
                              ._" nB      ,
                             z_ 2R       i.
But Y being the maximum value of H, it is obvious that nB
is the maximum value that E could possibly have (at that
speed.) even if the magnets were separately excited to satura
tion. Hence nB/ZR is the maximum value that i could have
if the magnets were thus separately saturated and the arma
ture, driven at speed n, were in a circuit the total resistance
of which was equal to ER. Adopting Friilich’s notation here,
we will write as ithis current; and as it is important to
distinguish the current generated under such conditions, I
propose to call it the “maximal” current“.               The equation of
the series dynamo now becomes
                                i=i_—i’;     .   .   .   .   .   .   .  (2)

   * The maximal current must not be confused with the maximum cur
rent.  The latter would be obtained by rotating the armature in the
saturated <U+FB01>eld at a very high speed in a circuit of resistance so small that
the current did just not fuse the conductors. The maximal current is that
obtained at speed it in circuit of resistance 2R when the magnets are
separately excited to saturation.

        Electromagnet and the Equations of the Dynamo.             293
where E is the “maximal” value of E at that speed with
saturated magnets. And, again, writing e for the differ
ence of potentials at the terminals of the machine, since 0,
multiplied by the external resistance R=i under all circum
stances, we have
                                 e=e—e/. . . . . .                  (4)
   It appears, then, that in the case of the series-wound
dynamo, each of the single electrical quantities is equal to the
difference between the “ maximal” value which that quantity
could have at that speed if the <U+FB01>eld-magnet were separately
saturated and the “diacritical” value of the same quantity.
This important result was announced by Fr61ich*‘ in 1885.
   It may be remarked that, since we may write
                                        E
                             H=Y m,
we may deduce from (1) the result
                             E =nB -E’,
and from this derive equation (3).
   It may be noted, in passing, that B is the electromotive
forces that would be generated in the armature at speed = 1
if the <U+FB01>eld-magnets were separately excited to absolute satu
ration. It is the maximal value of E at unit speed.
               4. Expressions for the “Dead Turns.”
    It is known that in every dynamo the current (with a given
resistance) is not proportional to the speed, but is proportional
to the speed less a certain number of revolutions per second.
 This latter number is known familiarly as the “dead turns.”
 It is also known that (with given resistance) there is a certain
 speed below which the dynamo does not excite itself. This
least speed of excitement (with given resistance) is the same
 as the “ dead turns.” It is called by some the “ critical”
 speed ; though that name is preferably reserved for the speed
t at is critical for self-regulation, and which is (unlike the
least speed of excitation) independent of the resistance.
    We can <U+FB01>nd an expression for the dead turns as follows :—
    Taking the expression for the current,
                             i—L—i’
                               _EB ,
 equate it to zero; the current of the machine (series-wound)
 being nil when n is reduced suf<U+FB01>ciently to n’ (= the dead

294        Dr. S. P. Thompson on the Formulae of the
turns). Then
                          I_<U+FB01>
                         Z—2R7

                         my?“ . . . . . . . (5)
It appears, then, that the dead turns are proportional to the
diacritical current and to the resistance ; and inversely pro
portional to A and Y, the factors of B. It will be noted that
i’2R=E’, the diacritical electromotive force.
   Again, we have found
                           E=nB—E’;
and as E’ = ’B, it follows that
                           E=(n--'n’)B. .       .   .   .   .   .  (6)
   This result is interesting in itself, and might have been used
as a starting-point for the equations of the dynamo, inasmuch
as it is readily found by experiment as a fundamental relation
between speed and electromotive force. Following the ana
logy and the nomenclature adopted, we may regard n' (the dead
turns) as the diacritical speed. In other words, it is that speed
at which, with magnets separately excited to saturation, the
induced electromotive force will be diacritical, and will, with
the given resistances 2R, give the diacritical current. This
equation (6) gives by far the best method of determining the
important constant B.      Two experiments to observe a pair of
values of E and n will suf<U+FB01>ce to determine both n’ and B.
               5. Equations of the Shunt Dynamo.
   Here we use 7*, and i, for the resistance and current of the
shunt-coil, and r, and i“ for those of the armature. We may
then calculate the potential at terminals as follows. Writin

which is the general equation of the self-exciting dynamo.
   It may here be pointed out that the two terms on the right
 hand side of this equation—the “ maximal” and “ diacritical ”
 values of the quantity on the left—possess certain properties.
 In a given dynamo the “ diacritical ” term is a constant, whilst
 the “maximal” term is a variable which increases with the
 speed of driving. The maximal term when representing a
 current varies also with changes of resistance, in an inverse
 way, but differently in shunt dynamos from series dynamos:
 when it represents an electromotive force it does not vary
 with changes of resistance. A year ago Dr. Frelich sought
 to divide the equation of the dynamo into two parts—an

296        Dr. S. P. Thompson on the Formulae of the
armature part and a <U+FB01>eld-magnet part. This does not quite
correspond to the case. The “ diacritical “ term appertains to
<U+FB01>eld-magnet primarily ; but since the number of ampere
turns of current that will produce a half-saturated magnetic
<U+FB01>eld depends also on the quantity and quality of the iron in the
machine, it is impossible to regard it as independent of the iron
masses of the armature. The “ maximal” term is proportional
both to A, the total effective area of the armature-coils, and to
Y, the maximum value of the magnetic <U+FB01>eld. The “ diacritical”
term for currents is lowered by increase in the number of
magnetizing coils, and for potentials is raised by increase in
the resistance of the magnetizing coils. The “ maximal”
term is not altered by altering the magnetizing coils, but
increases with an increase in the number of coils of the arma
ture, and, for currents, decreases with increasing resistance.
If the iron parts of a dynamo be given of a certain form, size,
and quality, then it may in general be said that \[r' depends
only on the windings (and, for currents, on the resistance) of
the <U+FB01>eld-magnet, and \Ir depends only on the windings of the
armature (and, for currents, on its resistance) and not upon
the windings of the <U+FB01>eld-magnet, or on their resistance except
(and this only for currents) so far as their resistance contri
butes to the resistance of the whole circuit through which the
current generated in the armature <U+FB02>ows.
     7. Conditions OfSelf-regulation for Compound-wound
                           Dynamos.
   In this case we write the formula of the electromagnet in
terms of the ampere-turns ; Si,l for the excitation due to the
coils in the armature part of the circuit, Zi, for that due to
the shunt, and ¢’ as the diacritical number of ampere-turns.
Then, writing
      E=4nAH;
      e =E—(r..+rm)ia;
        _      Z584. Si,  _    Zi,+ Si“            .             .
     H_Ymm _Y                      a     , by equation (11) ante,
      B=4AY ;
we have
       e¢'=i,Z(nB—c) +'t',,{b'(nB)—e)— (r,,+r,,,)d_>l> . . (12)
The condition sought is to be such as to make 6 constant.
Now ¢’ is a constant, so is i, if e is, and n may be made con
stant at any value we please. Hence, as ia is a variable, the
condition of constancy can only be attained by giving the

         Electromagnet and the Equations of the Dynamo.                297
 dynamo such a speed n, that the coef<U+FB01>cient of i“ shall be zero,

                       S(nlB—e) =(r,,+r,,,)¢. . . . . (13)
 But ¢, the maximal number of ampere-turns, is not itself a con
 stant, since it contains as one of the three terms in its sum the
 quantity Si... Hence we gather that absolute self-regulation
 is physically impossible; and it approaches to perfection as
 Zi, + d)’ are great as compared with Si“.             In other words,
 there must be so much iron in the machine that the diacritical
 excitement is very great, and it must have a small armature
 resistance ; otherwise S (and Si“) cannot be small as compared
 with Z (and Zis). This is known already to electric engineers.
 Assuming that the dynamo is well designed in these respects,
 4: will be very nearly constant, and the equation of condition

XXXV. Electromagnets.——V. The Law of similar Electro
    magnets. Saturation, de. By R. H. M. BOSANQUET,
    St. John’s College, Oay'ord.
    To the Editors of the Philosophical llIagazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
IN previous papers on Electromagnets I have (1)* indicated
       the general nature of a formula for the moment and in
duction in electromagnets, and in subsequent papers'l' given
the details of the complete examination of the permeabilities
of many specimens of iron and steel, together with an attempt
at a molecular formula for these permeabilities worked out in
some detail. In the present communication I propose to give
as shortly as possible an abstract of the results of a great
number of experiments having special reference to the mag
netic resistance of cylindrical bars of length equal to twenty
times their diameter, with and without pole-pieces.
   The datum in question (magnetic resistance) is that needed
to de<U+FB01>ne the magnetism under given electromagnetic exci
tation.
   The experiments cover the whole region from small mag~
netic inductions up to saturation, or what would be commonly
called so.
   The experiments have been made on bars of different sizes
of the proportions in question, so as to furnish for the <U+FB01>rst
time an experimental examination of the law of the magnetism
of similar solids. It appears to be of great interest to ascer
tain how far this law can be depended upon in practice.
   The result is that, while in the main the law is conformed
to, the irregularity shown by different specimens, especially
in the extreme regions of small inductions and saturation, is
very great. General deductions therefore, such as have been
recently published, depending on the behaviour of single

  specimens, cannot be accepted as having more demonstrative
  force than belongs to preliminary investigations. So far as
  work of this description goes, my own paper in Phil. Mag.
 June 1884 (xvii) p. 531, showed in detail the properties of
  bars ; and specially pointed out that the course of the values
 did not at all indicate any de<U+FB01>nite limit to the magnetism,
 and that the existing idea of saturation was a complete mis
 take (p. 535). This is now being published as a new discovery.
     In subsequent papers I have shown that rings do not ex
 hibit the same behaviour; and though some ring specimens
 admit of the magnetism being forced up very high, yet others
 do not.
     Further, where the magnetism is forced up very high in
 rings, the whole magnetization function appears to change
 under the in<U+FB02>uence; and the values thus obtained are not
 generally capable of being satis<U+FB01>ed by the same expression,
 which represents the behaviour of the specimen under induc
 tions less than %=18,000.
     The difference in this respect between rings and bars is
 already indicated in my paper, Phil. Mag. 1885 (xix.) p. 79 ;
 and it is there pointed out that the cause is probably the dif
 ference in distribution, i. e. that in bars the lines of force are
 crowded closely only at the equatorial section.
     The law of similar solids is easily deduced from the fact
 that magnetic resistance (quotient of potential by induction)
 is of linear dimensions. Hence, in similar electromagnets,
 where the inductions are the same, the number of current
 turns required is proportional to the linear dimension*.
     The present two series of experiments were made on cylin
 drical bars having the following dimensions:—The pole-pieces
 of the second set were circular, had a diameter <U+FB01>ve times that
 of the bar, and thickness equal to the diameter of the bar.
 The object of the experiments on the bars with pole-pieces
 was mainly to obtain numbers which might assist to serve as
 bases for a knowledge of the behaviour of the <U+FB01>eld-magnets of
dynamos.
   it I have long been under the ina§ession that this law was enunciated
in substance by Sir W. Thomson.        ut after carefully goin through the
reprinted papers, the nearest I could <U+FB01>nd to it is at p. 435 (‘ ‘lectrostatics
and Magnetism’). But this statement does not include the proposition
that the number of current-turns is roporticnal to the linear dimensions.
And I am therefore doubtful whet er the law is really due to Sir W.
Thomson.

   The determinations of bar II . with pole-pieces were puzzling
 and anomalous, and were excluded. Determinations for small
 inductions were in all cases made in the <U+FB01>rst instance by
 reversing the effect of the horizontal component of the earth’s
 magnetism. The bars were then wound uniformly from end
 to end, and the inductions determined by the effect on coils
 placed equatorially.
    In many cases great discrepancies occurred even between
 bars of the same measurement (they were all in pairs). In
 these cases the determinations were repeated, and in several
 cases the whole of the magnetizing coils were rewound.
     The results were then plotted on a large <U+FB01>gure for each bar,
 and a curve was drawn by hand to represent the values as well
 as possible ; 93 was abscissa, and p (magnetic resistance)
 ordinate.
     It was at once evident that in all cases, almost without ex
 ception, the curve did not show p=oo for any <U+FB01>nite value of
 i3, but rather indicated the existence of an asymptote inclined
 at a moderate angle to the axis of p.
     The values of p corresponding to 23:0, 1000, 2000, &c.
 were then measured off, and all divided by the lengths of the
 bars, so as to reduce them to data for bars I centim. long,
 according to the above law of similarity.
    These values, with the resulting means, form the two fol
 lowing Tables.

 ‘ It will be noticed that the numbers of windin s are not
exactly proportional to the linear dimensions.        t was not
practicable to carry this out ; and of course it does not matter
whether a given number of current-turns is made up one way
or the other (by current or turns).
   In the <U+FB01>rst three entries of the bars with pole-pieces, the
initial discrepancies being very great, the means of selected
values were adopted.
   The discrepancies between the numbers in any one column
are those in which any deviation from the law of similars
would appear. While the values (particularly at beginning
and end) are capricious in the extreme, it is certainly not
possible to detect any systematic difference between the
numbers belonging to the large and small bars.
   Before proceeding to calculate with these numbers, I will
now exhibit in a small <U+FB01>gure the nature of the relation between
the magnetic resistances due to
   (l) the permeability of the metal, as derived from rings ;
   (2) the bars with pole-pieces (P.P.); and
   (3) plain cylindrical bars.
    1000        5000          10,0.0       15,000          20,000
   The resistance in each case is supposed to be due to a leiwth
of metal: 1 centim., and p is expressed in decimals               a.
centimetre, though drawn to a different scale for convenience.
The lowest curve is made up of the values from rings E, F

304         Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet on Electromagnets.
(Phil. Mag. xix. p. 76), so as to show the wide limits within
which specimens vary. The middle curve is that of the bars
with pole-pieces. The initial mean and adopted value are
both traced. The upper curve is that of the plain bars.
   This <U+FB01>gure illustrates, and indeed proves, for approximate
purposes the rule I enunciated (Phil. Mag. xvii. p. 534), and
shows how the rule includes bars with pole-pieces, and where
it fails, viz. in the region spoken of as in the neighbourhood
of saturation. The rule is :—“ The magnetic resistance of any
bar can be expressed as the sum of a resistance due to its form,
 and a quantity formed by dividing the length by ,u, the per
 meability of the metal.”
   In the <U+FB01>gure the lowest curve represents the resistance due
to the imperfect permeability of the metal. The two upper
curves obviously admit of derivation from the lower one by
addition of constants due to the respective shapes of the bars.
 allowing for the capriciousness of the values in different
 specimens, and for the difference in the region of saturation
 (is: 18,000 and thereabouts).
    As to the amount:—The analogy of the resistance to a <U+FB02>uid
 <U+FB02>owing from the end of a pipe would give 2 x '6 of the radius,
or inrthe present case'012 centim., for: the shape-resistance.
The fact that magnetism issues all along the bar, more or less,
diminishes this resistance ; so that we <U+FB01>nd in fact that in the
plain bar the addition for shape is somewhat over '005 centim.,
as we can see in the <U+FB01>gure.
    Again, the pole-pieces still further facilitate the <U+FB02>ux of the
 magnetic induction through the ends, and the shape-resistance
 in this case is somewhat over '002 centim.
    I proceed to a more detailed examination of the numbers.
    For the plain bars, the shape-resistance calculated from the
 formula at Phil. Mag. xvii. p. 534 exactly satis<U+FB01>es the require
 ments of the numbers. Hence the <U+FB01>rst step is to subtract
 the value thus calculated from the number to be dealt with ; so
                     I
 that '37r10—'°°6'¥=-00528 is subtracted, and p-'00528= ’1‘
 gives the calculated values of u.      These are then <U+FB01>tted to
 formula: in accordance with the theory of Phil. Mag. xix.
'p. 92. With one exception, which is as follows :—Since the
 saturation-curve approximates to an inclined asymptote, it is
 impossible that 23 can have <U+FB01>nite maximum values; and the
 best way of making allowance for this has appeared to be, to
 substitute for the de<U+FB01>nite maximum 33“, a sum made up of
a constant B and a term proportional to the magnetizing

            Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet on Electromagnets.            305
force, whose coef<U+FB01>cient was determined from the observed
.values.
    In the <U+FB01>gure which follows, the crosses show the observed
values ; the dotted line shows the best representation by means
 of a maximum value of the induction 33w, <U+FB01>tted to the highest
 value ; and the dashed line shows the representation by means
 of the constant B and the term proportional to the magne
 tizing force.

     The two following Tables give the complete numerical
  results of the representation of the numbers for plain bars;
  <U+FB01>rst, according to the calculation with a <U+FB01>xed maximum induc
  tion, and, secondly, where the maximum induction is made to
  contain a term proportional to the magnetizing force. The
  extraordinary gain in the representation of the saturation
  region in the latter case will be noticed.

  The representation of the numbers derived from the bars
with pole-pieces affords results of a similar character. It is
not necessary to present the <U+FB01>gure showing the nature of the
gain in accuracy by introduction of the term proportional to
the magnetizing force, as it is precisely similar in character to
that already given for plain bars.   The two following Tables
give the representation of these numbers in the same way as
the two last. The coef<U+FB01>cient of the magnetizing force in the
second table is 12-1 nearly.

   Many rings have been completely examined in my various
papers. It is a matter of interest to what extent these sup
port the position that there is an absolute saturation limit,
and to what extent they oppose it.
   First, as to Bowland’s own measures of the one ring which
he examined completely. I have reduced them according
to my formula at Phil. Mag. xix. p. 340. Although the
magnetism is not carried very high, and the <U+FB01>tting has not
been as perfectly accomplished as in my more recent calcu
lations, yet it is clear that there is no indication of variation
of the saturation limit. This generally shows itself in an
excess of the calculated values of a in the region 33: 15,000
_16 000.                                                 I
  Iii all my own determinations the magnetism has been carried
up much higher; and I think in some of the rings discussed
at Phil. Ma . xix. pp. 76—79 there is some appearance of this
kind, But% have repeatedly submitted nearly all of these to
calculation, with the result that the introduction of the variable
saturation limit, so as to <U+FB01>t the region in question, invariably

              Intelligence and ll<U+FB01>scellaneous Articles.           309
unsettles the general representation of the values. So that in
every case, without exception, the general representation of
the behaviour of rings, furnished by calculation on the basis
of a <U+FB01>xed saturation limit, has been far better than any ob
tained by using a variable saturation limit. At the same
time it must be admitted that experiment sometimes shows a
heightening of the apparent saturation limit as it is approached .
The change, however, resembles rather a change in the pro
perties of the metal than a continuation according to the same
laws which successfully represent the general course of the
values.
   I must reserve for another occasion some considerations as
to dynamo machines, founded on the numbers here obtained
for bars with pole pieces.
    It must be noticed that the bars here dealt with are only of
one de<U+FB01>nite shape, viz. diameter : length : : 1 : 20 or there
abouts. And the object of the investigation was to get a.
series of reliable data with respect to this one shape, which
 might afford a sound starting-point for the investigation of
other proportions.
         XXXVI. Intelligence and Mscellaneous Articles.
         MEASUREMENT OF PITCH BY MANOMETRIC FLAMES.
                           BY M. DOUMER.
 MANOMETRIC <U+FB02>ames have hitherto only been used as a
         means of demonstration, and for studying the quality of
 vowel sounds. They are, however, susceptible of more varied
 applications, and may in particular vie with the graphical method
 in studying the height of sounds.
    For this purpose two adjacent manometric <U+FB02>ames are taken, one
 of which is due to a sound of known height, the other to a
 sound the height of which is to be determined, and then by means
 of a rotating mirror it is ascertained how many vibrations of the
 sound under investigation correspond to a known number of vi
 brations of the chronograph. A simple proportion gives the desired
 hei ht.
   'lghis method, which is very simple in theory, is in practice com
plicated, and almost impossible from the want of centering of the
 mirror.    But it retains all its simplicity, and a certain elegance
 moreover, it we substitute a sensitiVe plate for the rotating mirror ;
 in other words, if the two manometric <U+FB02>ames are simultaneously
 photographed on the same plate.
    The camera obscura used is a broad one, provided with a lens of

310           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
very short focus, and with a suitable shutter devised by M. Duboscq.
The focussing is easily effected, either by moving the object—glass,
or, better, by moving the manometric <U+FB02>ames.
   The motion of the <U+FB02>ames to be photographed is so rapid that we
should have recourse to the most sensitive plates. Those of Monck
hoven have given very good results; I prefer, however, the very
sensitive plates prepared with silver iodide by Frank’s formula.
   But whatever be the plates used, the negatives will always be
too weak if we do not take the precaution of using a lens
of short-focus, and of making the <U+FB02>ames as bright as possible.
This is attained if we carbonize the gas by passing it through
pumicestone impregnated with benzole, and burning it in pure
oxygen. By suitably regulating the supply of gas and oxygen, we
obtain a <U+FB02>ame of great lustre.
   The plates are developed by the ordinary photographic methods;
they have then two rows of parallel dentations. one of which cor
responds to the vibrations of the chronographic <U+FB02>ame, and the
other to the vibrations of the <U+FB02>ame worked by the sound whose
height is to be measured.
   The comparison of the two <U+FB02>ames is then an easy matter. It
may be made in two ways; either by the measurement of the
number of vibrations and Emotions of vibrations comprised within
equal lengths, or by the determination of the space occupied by
known whole numbers of vibrations.
   If the height of the <U+FB02>ame has been suitably adjusted, so as to
give images of 1'5 to 2 millim., these measurements are made with
great facility and remarkable precision.
   This method, devised for the purpose of lengthened researches
on the vowel sounds, has been veri<U+FB01>ed with great care for the
sounds corresponding to the scales Ut,, Ut,, Uta, and Ut4 by the
aid of the chronograph Uta, of sliding diapasons, and of open pipes
constructed by M. Kiinig with his usual care.
   The following table shows the certainty and accuracy of the
method, since the distances between the heights found and the
heights indicated do not exceed a double vibration :—

recourse to two chronographic diapasons, one giving 100 vibrations

the velocity to be given to the plate to photograph the most acute
sound spreads out the image of the deeper one, and the measure'

ON A NEW METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE VERTICAL INTENSITY
              OF A MAGNETIC FlELD.        BY R. KBiiGER.
    The methods hitherto used for measuring the vertical intensity
of a magnetic <U+FB01>eld depend on the electromotive action which it
exerts on a spiral which rotates about a horizontal axis. If, more
over, the spiral turns about a vertical axis, the ratio of the currents
 induced in the two rotations gives the inclination of the magnetic
 lines of force to the horizon.   If, again, the current induced by a
 rotation about a horizontal axis be determined in absolute measure
 by a galvanometer, the vertical intensity of the <U+FB01>eld is determined
 from the contents of the surface enclosed by the windings of the
 spiral, and from the absolute resistance of the circuit formed by the
 spiral and the galvanometer. Ina <U+FB01>eld of small extent the rotation
 must be replaced by a parallel displacement of the spiral in its
 plane. In any case the determination of a vertical intensity by
 these means is a dif<U+FB01>cult and tedious operation.
    In contrast with this, the de<U+FB02>ection which a disk suspended
 horizontally by means of a vertical wire in a solution of copper
 sulphate experiences when traversed in a radial direction by a cur
 rent, forms a very convenient means of determining the vertical
 magnetic force which produces that de<U+FB02>ection.
    In order to test the capability of this method, it was used to de—
 termine the vertical intensity of the terrestrial magnetism, or rather
 the magnetic inclination.
    The value of the vertical intensity was thus found to be
                            V=2'2903 x T,
 in which T is the horizontal intensity.     Simultaneous observations
 with the terrestrial inductor gave
                           V=2'2899 XT;
 while the vertical intensity deduced from the formula for variations
 given by Prof. Schering* would be
                            V=2-2895 T.

      ON THE CONSTANT OF THE SUN’S HEAT.             BY M. MAUREE
     The author compares the values for this constant, obtained pre
 viously by Pouillet, Hagen, Grova, Violle, and Langley; those given
 by Violle and Langley appear too great. This seems to arise from
 the fact that Langley and Violle have found too high a value for
 the amount of the solar radiation on the Earth’s surface, while the
 methods of other observers, to which those of Rcntgen and Exner,
 and Desains must be added, agree very well with each other.
     Actinometric measurements have recently been made with a
 new apparatus of F. Weber’s, under remarkably good atmospheric
 conditions. Six of them were made on the terrace of the Polytech
 nicum at Ziirich, two on the top of the St. Gothard pass (2100
 metres), and one on the Pizzo Centrale (3000 metres). According
 to these, the maximum heat from the Sun at midday, which a
 surface of a square centimetre receives in a minute under perpen
 dicular radiation, is :—

       ON THE INCREASE OF TEMPERATURE PRODUCED BY A
                    WATERFALL.          BY M. KELLER.
    The slight increase of temperature in a waterfall is powerfully
a<U+FB01>ected by the sources of error which the author discusses. His
observations at the waterfall at Terni should have given a differ
ence of temperature of 0°~37 ; the measured ones varied between
0°‘08 and 0°“73. The author considers these numbers an evidence
of the transformation of via viva into heat in this waterfall.——-Atti

XXXVII. Turbines. ByJ.LESTERWoonBRmeE,B.S.,ME.*
I PROPOSE to discuss the action of turbines in general.
     Consider <U+FB01>rst the water after it has entered the wheel
and is passing along its vanes. Conceive the water to be
divided into an in<U+FB01>nite number of <U+FB01>laments by vanes similar
to those of the wheel, but subjected to the condition that, at
each point, their width, ac (<U+FB01>g. 1), measured on the arc whose
centre is 0, shall subtend at the centre a constant angle d9.
Conceive each <U+FB01>lament to be divided into small prisms whose
bases are represented by the shaded areas a'b'e'd’, d’e'd'd”, and
abcd, by vertical planes normal to the vanes, making the
divisions ae, ef, intercepted on the radius by circles passing
through the consecutive vertices on the same vane 11', d', d”, &c.,
equal. The variable height of a prism represent by w, and let
p be the variable distance from the centre.

     For the element of time, dt, we will take the time occupied
 by one of the liquid prisms in passing along the vane through
 a distance equal to its own length, or outwardly a distance dp,
 thus making t a function of p, the latter being considered the
 independent variable.     We have

    The mass m will have two motions; one along the vane,
 the other with the wheel perpendicular to the radius. By
changing its position successively in each of these directions,
 both its velocity with the wheel and its velocity along the
vane may suffer changes both in amount and direction, and
 will give rise to the following eight possible reactions ;—
   I. By moving from a to a' in the arc of a circle.
    1. mp may be increased or diminished ;
    2. mp may be changed in direction ;
    3. 0 may be increased or diminished ;
    4. u may be changed in direction.
  II. By moving from a' to d' along the vane.
    5. mp may be increased or diminished ;
    6. mp may be changed in direction ;
    7. 0 may be increased or diminished ;
    8. v may be changed in direction.
    By the conditions imposed, 1 and 3 are zero.         For the
others we have :—
    No. 2. By moving from a to a', the velocity mp is changed
in direction from ale to a'k’ in the time dt. The momentum

of these, and the rate of change will be the sum divided by dt,
which result multiplied by the momentum, mu, will give the

   This completes the reactions. Next consider the pressure
in the wheel. The intensity of the pressure on the two sides
ab and ed differs by an amount (#1:? dp. The area of the
face is do x w=a~pd0 sin '7, and the force due to the difference
of pressures will be                   d

   If dp is positive, which will be the case when the pressure
 on do exceeds that on ab, the force acts backwards, and the
preceding expression will be minus along the vane.
   In regard to the pressure normal to the vane, if a uniform
pressure p existed from one end of the vane VW to the other,
the resultant effect would be zero, since the pressure in one
direction on VW would equal the opposite pressure on XY.
If, however, the pressure at a exceeds that at d by an amount
 —dp, since Va is longer than Xb, the pressure on Va, due to
this -dp, will exceed that on Xb by an amount

al the entire area of all the ori<U+FB01>ces at the entrance of the wheel
 (=21rp1x1), and as those at exit (=21rp2wg), we have
                     Q=a1v1sin71=agvgsinrym . . . . (9)
 which reduces this number of unknown quantities to one.
    Equation (6) is the equation of the motion of the water in the
 wheel. Besides the velocities v, and 1),, it contains p1 and 1),.
    Let
      Pa=the atmospheric pressure,
       h =the mean depth of the wheel below the surface of
                the tail-race,
      p, =89h=the pressure due to <U+FB02>ooding in the tail-race ;
 then
                              P3 =Pa '1'?!
    The pressure p, where the water passes from the guide
 plates into the wheel is unknown. Another condition is
 necessary, which may be found by considering the passage
 of the water from the guide-plates into the wheel. In <U+FB01>g. 2
 let A G be the tangent to the guide- late at its extremity, V
 the actual velocity of the water on Taming the guide-plate,
 wp,=A D the velocity of the initial rim of the wheel ; then

320             Mr. J. L. Woodbridge on Turbines.
will A B be the velocity of the stream relative to the wheel.
Now if A B does not coincide with the tangent to the vane at
A, the stream cannot suddenly be made to change its direction
into that of the vane, or <U+FB02>oat ; and the water, by cushioning in
the angles, will make its own angles, as roughly shown in <U+FB01>g. 3.
                   Fig. 2.                      Fig. 3.

              D        A
It is impossible, either practically or theoretically, to determine
the new angles, and probably they are not constant ; neither
is it possible to determine the loss of energy due to eddying ;
we therefore make the hypothesis that the <U+FB01>nal direction of
the guide-plates, the initial direction of the vanes, the angular
velocity of the wheel, and the velocit of the <U+FB02>ow, are so
related that the water on leaving t e guide-plates shall
coincide in direction with the initial elements of the vanes.
Any three of the four quantities above mentioned being <U+FB01>xed,
the fourth becomes known by this relation. 1V0 will leave
the angle of the guide-plates to be determined later.
   Let
V=the actual velocity of the water on leaving the guide-plates.
v1=the velocity relative to the vane, as before.

an     articular case before making the substitution.
      e will now use these equations to show some errors made
by Rankine and Weisbach.         Rankine, in his ‘ Steam-Engine
and other Prime Movers,’ discusses a special wheel of the
Fourneyron type, in which he assumes
                      a, = a1 and 71 = 90°.
   These in equation (15) give
                v,=sin ry, x/wgpf—2w9p1'+2gH. .       .    .    (25)
   This velocity is radial along the vane, and is called by
Rankine the “velocity of <U+FB02>ow.” The tangential component
of the actual velocity must, in this case, be mp1, and this, b
Rankine, is called the velocity of whirl (v) ; and his value of
v on page 196, equation (9) of the ‘Steam-Engine’ is not only
incorrect but meaningless, even for the turbine he is con
sidering.
  From equation (15a) we also have
                   17,: Vm’pga—2m9pli-l-29H.       . . . (26)
  The expression for the efficiency becomes
 E =-g—H [wpf — mp,“ + ,0, cos 7, Vw’p,*— 209,)? + 29H]. (27)

   This expression differs entirely from Rankine’s equation
(10), page 196. But running this wheel at the same speed
as Rankine does his, Art. 175, that is, making the <U+FB01>nal
velocity of whirl zero, we shall have
                         1’2 00$ '72 = “P2,

which is the same as Rankine’s equation (3), Art. 175.            Sub
stituting these in (27), we have
                      E—             2P”
which is Bankine’s equation (4), Art. 175.
   We thus see that Rankine’s equations not only do not <U+FB01>t
any wheel except the one he is considering, but they apply to
that only at one particular speed. These conclusions :1 rec
with those in an article on Turbines, by Professor WoocI, in
the Journal of the Franklin Institute for June 1884.
   In regard to the speed for maximum ef<U+FB01>ciency, Rankine,
in the ‘ Steam-Eugine,’ Art. 173, says, “ In order that the
water may work to the best advantage, it should leave the
wheel without whirling motion, for which purpose the velocity
of whirl relative to the wheel should be equal and contrary to
that of the second circumference of the wheel.” Plausible
as this appears, it is true only for special cases even for his
wheel. Also Weisbach makes the erroneous statement that
the velocity of the second rim of the wheel should equal the
relative velocity of discharge.         Thus in ‘ The Mechanics of
Engineering and of Machinery,’ vol. ii. page 400 (Wiley and
 Sons) he says (substituting my notation for his)
 w = “‘02P; + 1’252 — 202a”): 005 '72 = \/(wP2 —v1) 2 + llciipgv2 sin2 %2,

equal al, which is not generally true, and is true only when
72:0, or when 172(0/72 and (mp2—v2)2 happen to be a minimum

   This satis<U+FB01>es equation (29) only when 13:1), and (29a)

a parallel flow wheel, or of an in<U+FB01>nitely narrow wheel, in

XXXVIII. The Expansion of Mercury between 0° C. and
   —39° C. By Professors W. E. AYRTON, F.R.S., and JOHN
  PERRY, F.R.S.*
AT a meeting of the Physical Society in November 1885,
       Mr. G. Whipple gave the Society the results of the
examination of thermometers down to the meltin -point of
mercury. There was, however, no evidence as to whether the
contraction of the mercury was uniform, as the thermometers
were only compared with mercurial ones, and as, in' addition,
we were not able to <U+FB01>nd the results of any experiments made
on the expansion of mercury between 0° and —39° 0., its
temperature of solidi<U+FB01>cation, we thought it desirable to make
a series of comparisons of a mercury-thermometer, the stem of
which had been accurately subdivided into equal volumes, with
an air-thermometer, both immersed in a bath of frozen mer
cury which was allowed to gradually become warm. For
this purpose we borrowed a mercury-thermometer from Mr.
Whipple, which he was so kind as to lend us, and one of our
assistants (Mr. Mather) constructed a very simple form of
constant-volume air-thermometer, shown in the diagram.

 326     Expansion of Mercury between 0° C. and —39° C.
 by an india-rubber stopper through which passes tightly the
 glass stem of an air-thermometer, AA. The bottom of the
 air-thermometer is attached bya piece of india-rubber tubing,
 I I, to a vertical glass tube, T T; and the thermometer being
 <U+FB01>lled with dry air, some mercury is introduced into the tube
 so as to stand at about the same height in the two limbs
 when the air in the bulb b is at atmospheric pressure. The
 height of the level of the mercury can be varied by turning
 the nut, N, which causes the clamp, C, turning on the hinge H,
 to squeeze the india-rubber tube more or less tightly, and so
 to alter its internal capacity ; and in this way the level of the
 mercury in the left-hand tube can be kept quite <U+FB01>xed, and
 therefore the volume of air in the bulb I) quite constant, while
 its temperature is altered, the corresponding pressure being of
 course measured by the difference between the levels of the
 mercury columns in the two limbs.
    To perform the experiment, the box B B was <U+FB01>rst <U+FB01>lled with
 mercury and frozen by stirring carbonic-acid snow and ether
 up with it; and when suf<U+FB01>cient of the mercury was frozen,
 the bulb of the mercurial thermometer, t t, was introduced into
 the pasty mercury, and the thermometer <U+FB01>xed in position by
 means of the clamp, C'. The nut N was now turned by one
 observer until the level of the mercury in the left-hand limb
came opposite a <U+FB01>xed mark on the tube which is only just
below the bottom of the box, when the height of the mercury
in the right-hand tube was read by a cathetometer made by
the Cambridge Instrument Company, and the position of the
mercury in the mercury—thermometer was read by a third
observer. In this way several series of simultaneous observa
tions were taken, during the course of some weeks, of the
pressure to which the air in the air-thermometer had to be
subjected to keep its volume constant, as the mercury in the
box B B varied in temperature from about —39° C. to 0° C.
 Plotting these results, it was found that they lay in so nearly
a straight line that we may conclude that mercury expands
regularly below 0° C. as it is known to do above 0° C. ; and
that there is no critical point for mercury, as there is for water,
above the freezing-point.
    When the mercury freezes it contracts still further, as may
be seen from the following extract from page 6 of the second
volume of Nordenskiold’s ‘Voyage of the Vega,’ which Mr.
Whipple has kindly looked up for us :—
    “ When mercury freezes in a common thermometer, it con
tracts so much that the column of mercury suddenly sinks in
the tube, or, if it is short, goes wholly into the ball. The
position of the column is therefore no measure of the actual
degree of cold when the freezing takes place.”

          0n the Expansion produced by Amalgamation.              327
   We have to express our thanks to Messrs. Chatterton,
Humphrey, and Martin, three of the students of the Central
Institution, for assistance rendered in the carrying out of this
experiment.
XXXIX. On the Expansion produced by Amalgamation. By
   Professors W. E.AYRTON, F.R.S., and Jonu PERRY,F.R.S.*
ON amalgamating the edge of a brass bar, nearly three
        quarters of an inch thick and about a foot long, for the
purpose of enabling the edge to make good electric contact
with a plate, we were surprised to <U+FB01>nd that the bar rapidly
curved, the amalgamated edge becoming convex, exactly as
happens when one side of a piece of paper is wetted. On
hammering the bar to straighten it, the curvature became
instead greater. Seeing that to bend a short brass bar more
than half an inch in thickness to the extent produced by the
 amalgamation of the edge requires the exertion of very con
 siderable stresses, it follows that very great forces must be
 produced by amalgamation.
    \Ve think it possible that this bending by amalgamation
may be an important cause in the production of the Japanese
 “magic mirrors,” the re<U+FB02>ecting surface of which is polished
 with a mercury amalgam. Japanese mirrors are made of
 bronze and have a raised pattern cast on their backs; and
although the eye can detect no trace of the pattern on looking
 at the polished re<U+FB02>ecting surface, yet when certain of these
 mirrors are used to re<U+FB02>ect a divergent beam on to a screen,
 the pattern at the back can be seen as a bright image on a
 dark ground. In a paper communicated, some years ago, to
 the Royal Society, we showed that this peculiar e<U+FB02>'ect arose
 from the fact that, while the re<U+FB02>ecting surface was generally
 convex, the portions corresponding with the pattern or thicker
 parts were less convex (that is, more concave) than the rest ;
 and this conclusion we veri<U+FB01>ed by <U+FB01>nding that when a conver
 gent, instead of a divergent, beam of light was allowed to fall
 on the mirror the image on the screen was reversed ; that is,
 the pattern was seen as a dark image on a bright ground.
    This inequality of curvature we considered at that time was
 due partly to the pressure of the “distorting-rod” used to
 make the surface convex, and partly to the pressure exercised
 on the subsequent polishing ; but we now think that, in ad
 dition, the action of the mercury-amalgam employed by the
 polisher may assist in making the thin portions of the mirror

XL. Note on the Annual Precesslon calculated on the Hypo
   thesis ofthe Earth’s Solidity. By HENRY HENNESSY, F.R.S.,
   Professor of Applied Mathematics 'in the Royal College of
   Science for Ireland *.
   N discussing the in<U+FB02>uence of the internal structure of the
      Earth upon precession, it has been frequently assumed
that with the ellipticity % the annual precession of a homo
geneous solid shell or completely solid spheroid would be 57’'.
This was the result of Mr. Hopkins’s calculations; and the
difference,amoun_ting to between six and seven seconds, between
it and the observed value, formed the basis of all his con
clusions relative to the Earth’s internal condition. Hitherto
I have not seen any reason for doubting the above numerical
result; but on looking more closely into the question, it appears
probable that we must reduce the precession for the hypo
thetical solid spheroid to about 55”. If the Earth were a
spheroid perfectly rigid, the amount of precession can be
calculated from formulae given in Airy’s ‘ Tracts,’ Pratt’s
‘Mechanical Philosophy,’ Pontécoulant’s Théorie Analytigue
du Systeme du Monde, or Resal’s Traite' de Me’canique Celeste.
In the two latter works, Poisson’s memoir on the rotation of
the Earth about its centre of gravity is very closely followed,
and the formulae are those which I have generally employed.

    Precession 0n the Hypothesis of the Earth’s Solidity.    329
where i is the inclination of the Moon’s orbit to the ecliptic, y
the ratio of the Earth’s mass to that of the Moon.
   In all these formulae, or in any others by which the pre
cession can be calculated, the Moon’s mass enters directly or
indirectly.   When Mr. Hopkins made his calculation, more
than forty years ago, he appears to have taken the value of
the Moon’s mass and all his other numerical data from the
early editions of Airy’s ‘Tracts.’ He uses 36626 for the
Earth’s period, 2732 for the Moon’s. He makes 1: 23° 28’,
i=5° 8’ 50”, and the Moon’s mass = ,%) of the Earth’s mass.
All of these values require revision; and it may be remarked
that Sir George Airy has more recently expressed the opinion
that glo may be taken as the value of the Moon’s mass.
(Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Decem
ber 1878, p. 140).    On this question, I may be permitted to
remark that there are three different phenomena from which
the Moon’s mass has been determined :—1, the perturbations
of the Earth’s motion in its orbit around the Sun by the
action of the_Moon ; 2, the Tides ; and 3, the Nutation of the
Earth’s axis.   The largest mass, or $1?) nearly, has been ob
tained from the <U+FB01>rst, and the smallest from Nutation. But
the values obtained from Nutation are not very accordant, and,
moreover, the close connection between Nutation and Preces
sion makes it a doubtful matter to calculate the amount of
one from a quantity depending on the other.        The Moon’s
mass obtained from the Tides is that which has been employed
by Laplace, Poisson, and other mathematicians as the most
probable. It appears that a recent discussion of the Tides in
the United States, made by Mr. Ferrel, has given the same
value as that found by Laplace. This circumstance, as well
as the fact that the value so obtained lies between the values
found by the other methods, give us reason to place much
con<U+FB01>dence in the result. If we call P1 the precession for a
homogeneous spheroid whose ellipticity is E, then from (1)

If we take the value of the Moon’s mass given by the tides
or rather the ratio of the Moon’s action to that of the Sun,
thus given, we shall use the value of 7 employed by Poisson,
Pontécoulant, and Resal: if we also employ for E the value
which Colonel Clarke shows good grounds for deeming the

   Consequently, instead of admitting Mr. Hopkins’s result of
7” for the difference between the precession of a homogeneous
spheroid with the Earth’s ellipticity and the precession actu
ally observed, we may af<U+FB01>rm that this difference is probably
not more than 4” or 5”.
   With the best values for the numerical elements the dif
ference is, however, too well ascertained to be overlooked, and
it leads to the conclusion that the Earth cannot consist of an
entirely solid mass composed of equielliptic strata, and that
it is therefore partly composed of a solid shell bounded by
surfaces such as I have elsewhere indicated, with an interior
mass of viscid liquid, such as is seen <U+FB02>owing from the volcanic
openings of the shell, arranged in strata conforming to the
laws of hydrostatics, or, in other words, with strata of equal
density decreasing in ellipticity towards the Earth’s centre.

        XLI. On the Self-induction of Wires—Part III.
                     By OLIVER HEAVIsmn‘.
 THE subject of the decomposition of an arbitrary function
       into the sum of functions of special types has many
 fascinations. No student of mathematical physics, if he possess
 any soul at all, can fail to recognize the poetry that pervades
 this branch of mathematics. The great work of Fourier is
 full of it, although there only the mere fringe of the subject
 is reached. For that very reason, and because the solutions
 can be fully realized, the poetry is more plainly evident than
 in cases of greater complexity. Another remarkable thing to
 be observed is the way the principle of conservation of energy
 and its transfer, or the equation of activity, governs the whole
 subject, in dynamical applications, as regards the possibility
 of effecting certain expansions, the forms of the functions in
 volved, the manner of effecting the expansions, and the possible
 nature of the “terminal conditions ” which may be imposed.
    Special proofs of the possibility of certain expansions are
 sometimes very vexatious. They are frequently long, com
plex, dif<U+FB01>cult to follow, unconvincing, and, after all, quite
special ; whilst there are in<U+FB01>nite numbers of functions equally
deserving. Something of a quite general nature is clearly
wanted, and simple in its generality, to cover the whole <U+FB01>eld.
This will, I believe, be ultimately found in the principle of
energy, at least as regards the functions of mathematical
physics. But in the present place only a small part of the
question will be touched upon, with special reference to the
physical problem of the propagation of electromagnetic dis
tur ances through a dielectric tube, bounded by conductors.
    It will be, perhaps, in the recollection of some readers that
Professor Sylvester, a few years since, in the course of his
learned paper on the Bipotential, poked fun at Professor
Maxwell for having, in his investigation of the conjugate pro
perties possessed by complete spherical-surface harmonics,
made use of Green’s Theorem concerning the mutual energy
of two electri<U+FB01>ed systems. He said (in effect, for the quota
tion is from memory) that one might as well prove the rule
of three by the laws of hydrostatics, or something similar to
that. In the second edition of his treatise, Prof. Maxwell
made some remarks that appear to be meant for a reply to
this; to the effect that although names, involving physical
ideas, are given to certain quantities, yet as the reasoning is
purely mathematical, the physicist has a right to assist himself
  y the physical ideas.                              .

    Certainly; but there is much more in it than that. For
 not only the conjugate properties of spherical harmonics, but
 those of all other functions of the <U+FB02>uctuating character, which
 present themselves in physical problems, including the in<U+FB01>
 nitely undiscoverable, are involved in the principle of energy,
 and are most simply and immediately proved by it, and pre
 dicted beforehand. We may indeed get rid of the principle
 of energy, and treat the matter as a question of the properties
 of quadratic functions ; a method which may commend itself
 to the pure. mathematician. But by the use of the principle
of energy, and assisted by the physical ideas involved, we are
 enabled to go straight to the mark at once, and avoid the un
necessary complexities connected with the use of the special
functions in question, which may be so great as to wholly
prevent the recognition of the properties which, through the
principle of energy, are necessitated.                            ‘
    Considering only adynamical system in which the forces of
reaction are proportional to displacements, and the forces of
resistance to velocities, there are three important quantities—
the potential energy, the kinetic energy, and the dissipativity,
say U, T, and Q, which are quadratic functions of the variables
or their velocities. When there is no kinetic energy, the
 conjugate properties of normal systems are U12=0 and (212:0;
 these standing for the mutual potential energy and the mutual
dissipativity of a pair of normal systems. When there is no
potential energy, we have T12=0 and Q12=O. When there
is no dissipation of energy, Um=0 and T12=0. And in
general, U19=Tm which covers all cases, and has two equiva
lents, éQI, + U,,=0, and §Q12+T12=0 ; for, as the mutual
potential and kinetic energies are equal, the mutual dissipa

 in ‘The Electrician,’ November 27 and December 11, 1885,
 with special reference to the dynamical system expressed by
 Maxwell’s electromagnetic equations.
    The following applies to Maxwell’s system, using the equa
 tions (4) to (10) of Part 1. (Phil. Mag. August 1886). A
 comparison with the above is instructive. Let E,, H1 and

                        = E,c,+n,i),+n,i3,/41r. . . . (92)

         conv. VE2H1/4'rr=E201+E2111+H1132/41r.      . . (93)
Addition gives the equation of mutual activity.      And, sub
tracting (93) from (92), we <U+FB01>nd
        conv. (VEJI2 -VE2H1) /41r =(E1112 - nail)
                                                     ;  s
since E102=E1kE2 = E2kE1 = E20,, if there be no rotatory
power, or C be a symmetrical linear function of E. ' Similarly
for D and E, and B and 11. Hence, if the systems are normal,
making d/dt =1), in one, and 122 in the other, (94) becomes
 conv. (VE1H2 —              = (P2 _P1)(E1Dg “'“H1B2/47T).
   Therefore, by the well-known theorem of Convergence, if
we integrate through any region, and U12, T12 be the mutual
electric energy an the mutual magnetic energy of the two
systems in that region, we obtain
            U12_T12=w,                                   _ (96)

where N is the unit normal drawn inward from the. boundary
of the region, over which the summation extends. And if the
region include the whole space through which the systems
extend, the right member will vanish, giving U12=T1,, when
these are complete.
   From (96) we obtain, by differentiation, the value of twice
the excess of the electric over the magnetic energy of a single
normal system in any region ; thus
               2(U-T)=2s (veg—g -vj_: H)/47r. . (97)
This formula, or special representatives of the same, is very
useful in saving labour in investigations relating to normal
 systems of subsidence.
   The quantity that appears in the numerator in (96) is the
 excess of the energy entering the region through its boundary
per second by the action of the second system on the <U+FB01>rst,
 over that similarly entering due to the action of the <U+FB01>rst on

  336                 Mr. O. Heaviside on the
  the second system. Bearing this in mind, we can easily form
  the correspondin formula in a less general case. Suppose,
  for example, we ave two <U+FB01>ne wire terminals, a and b, that
  are joined through any electromagnetic and electrostatic
  combination which does not contain impressed forces, nor
  receive energy from without except by means of the current,
  say 0, entering it at a and leaving it at b.   Let also V be the
  excess of the potential of a over that of I). Then V0 is the
  energy-current, or the amount of energy added per second to
 the combination through the terminal connections with, ne
 cessarily, some other combination. (In the previous thick
 letter vector investigation V was the symbol of vector product.
 There will, however, be no confusion with the following use
 of V, as in Part II., to express the line-integral of an electric
 force. One of the awkward things about the notation in Prof.
 Tait’s ‘ Quaternions ’ is the employment of a number of most
 useful letters, as S, T, U, V, wanted for other purposes, as
 mere symbols of operations, putting another barrier in the
 way of practically combining vector methods with ordinary
 scalar methods, besides the perpetual negative sign before
 scalar products.)    The combination need not be of mere linear
 circuits, in which differences of current-density are insen
 sible ; there may, for example, be induction of currents in
 a mass of metal not connected conductively with a and b, or
 the same mass may be in connection; but in any case it is
 necessary that the arrangement should terminate in <U+FB01>ne wires
 at a and b, in order that the two quantities V and C may
 su<U+FB01>ice to specify, by their product, the energy-current at the
 terminals; Even in this we completely ignore the dielectric
 currents and also the displacement, in the neighbourhood of
 the terminals, 2'. e. we assume 0:0, to stop displacement.
 This is, of course, what is always done, unless specially allowed
for.
    Now supposing the structure of the combination to be given,
 we can always, by writing out the equations of its different
 parts, arrive at the characteristic equation connecting the
terminal V and C. For instance,

    If the complete system depends only upon a <U+FB01>nite number
of variables, it is clear that the number of independent normal

(110) to be added for the terminal arrangements, except as
regards arbitrary multipliers, from the mere form of the Z

wherein the E’s may have any values. This must be done
separately for each terminal arrangement. The matter is
best studied in the concrete application, which I may consider
under a separate heading.
   It is also remarkable that, as regards the obtaining of cor
rect expansions of functions, there is no occasion to impose
upon R, S, and L the physical necessity of being positive
quantities, or real. This will be understandable by going
back to a <U+FB01>nite number of variables, and then passing to
continuous functions.
   Let us now proceed to the far more dif<U+FB01>cult problems con
nected with propagation along a dielectric tube bounded by
concentric conducting tubes, and examine how the preceding
results apply, and in what cases we can be sure of getting
correct solutions. Start with the general system, equations
 (11) to (14), Part 1., with the extension mentioned at the
commencement of Part II. from a solid to a tubular inner
conductor. Suppose that the initial state is of purely longi
tudinal electric force, independent of 2, so that the longitudinal
E and circular H' are functions of 1' only. How can we secure
that they shall, in subsiding, remain functions of r onlv, so
that any short len th is representative of the whole? Since
E is to be longitu inal, there must be no longitudinal energy
current, or it must be entirely radial.     Therefore no energy
must be communicated to the system at z=0 or z=l, or leave
it at those places.    This seems to be securable in only <U+FB01>ve
cases. Put in<U+FB01>nitely conducting plates across the section at
either or bOth ends of the line. This will make V=0 there,

                     Self-induction of Wire;-                 341
if V is the line-integral of the radial electric force across the
dielectric. Or put non-conducting and non-dielectric plates
there similarly. This will make O=O. Or, which is the <U+FB01>fth
case, let the inner and the outer conductors be closed upon
themselves. In any of these cases, the electric force will
remain longitudinal during the subsidence, which will take
place similarly all along the line. By (14), the equation of H _
will be
                   d 1 d               -      -
                  $ 17 a; rH=47rk/.LH+MOH;
and it is clear that the normal functions are quite de<U+FB01>nite, so
that the expansion of the initial state of E and H can be truly
e<U+FB01>'ected. In the already given normal functions take m=O.
    But if we were to join the conductors at one end of the line
through a resistance, we should, to some extent, upset this
regular subsidence everywhere alike. For energy would leave
the line; this would cause radial displacement, <U+FB01>rst at the end
where the resistance was attached, and later all along the
line. (By “ the line ” is meant, for brevity, the system of tubes
extending from z=0 to z=l.
    Now in short-wire problems the electric energy is of insig
 ni<U+FB01>cant importance, as compared with the magnetic. It is
 usual to ignore it altogether. This we can do by assuming
 0:0. This necessitates equality of wire and return current,
 for one thing ; but, more importantly, it prevents current
 leaving the conductors, so that O and H and I‘ the current
 density, are independent of z. There will be no radial electric .
 force in the conductors, in which therefore the energy-current
 will be radial. But there will be radial force in the dielectric,
 and therefore longitudinal energy-current. Since the radial
 electric force and also the magnetic force in the dielectric
 vary inversely as the distance from the axis, the longitudinal
 energy-current density will vary inversely as the square of
 the distance. But, on account of symmetry, we are only
 concerned with its total amount over the complete section of
 the dielectric.  This is
                  1    “120
                 a; “IT.E,.27r'rd1-=VO,            .  .  .  (118)
 if V is the line-integral of E, the radial force, and O the wire
 current. It is clear, then, that we can now allow terminal
 connections of the form V/O=Z before used, and still have
 correct expansions of the initial magnetic <U+FB01>eld, giving correct
 subsidence solutions.
    But it is simpler to ignore V altogether. For the equation

3-12                 Mr. O. Heaviside on the
of E.M.F. will be

the wire and sheath functions of equations (55) and (56),
Part II., on the assumption m=0, and Z0, Z, the terminal
functions, such that V/C=Z1 at z=l, and = —Z0 at z=0. It
does not matter how e0 is distributed so far as the magnetic
<U+FB01>eld and the current is concerned. Let it then be distributed
in such a way as to do away with the radial electric <U+FB01>eld, for
simplicity of reasoning. The simple-harmonic solution of
(119) is obviously to be got by expanding Z and Z1 in the
form R+Lp, where R and L are functions ofp’, and adding
them on to the l(R' +L'p) equivalent of l(Lop+R1” +132”), as
in equation (66), Part II.
   Regarding the free subsidence, putting e0=0 in (119) gives
us the determinantal equation of the p’s ; and as the normal
H functions are de<U+FB01>nitely known, the expansion of the mag
netic <U+FB01>eld can be effected. The in<U+FB02>uence of the terminal
arrangements must not be forgotten in reckoning A.
   In coming, next, to the more general case of equation (56),
but without restriction to exactly longitudinal current in the
conductors, it is necessary to consider the transfer of energy
more fully. In the dielectric the longitudinal energy-current
is still V0. The rate of decrease of this quantity with z is to
be accounted for by increase of electric and magnetic energy
in the dielectric, and by the transfer of energy into the con
ductors which bound it. Thus,

and EC and —FC would be precisely equal to the Joule heat
per second plus the rate- of' increase of the magnetic energy,
in the inner and the outer conductor, respectively. But as
there is a small radial current, there is also a small longitu
dinal transfer of energy in the conductors.        Thus, E, and EI

    To determine the effect of longitudinal impressed force,
 keeping to the case of uniform intensity over the cross section
 of either conductor. Let a steady impressed force of integral
 amount e0 be introduced in the line at distance z, ; it may be
 gartly in one and partly in the other conductor, as in Part H.
   y elementary methods, we can <U+FB01>nd the steady state of V, C
 it will set up. If, then, we remove e0, we can, by the prece
 ding, <U+FB01>nd the transient state that will result.  Let V0 be the
 steady state of V set up, and V1 what it becomes at time t
 after removal of e0 ; then Vo—Vl represents the state at time
 t after e0 is put on. So, if ZAu represent the V set up by the
unit impressed force at 21,
                         V = V0 — e02A1uiPt
will give the distribution of V at time t after eo is put on,
being zero ‘when t=0, and V0 when t=oo . No zero value of
p is admissible here.
    From this we deduce that the effect of eo lasting from t=t1
to t=t1+dt1 at the later time t is
                       — ZAupeodtlsP(‘- '1) ;
therefore, by time integration, the effect due to an impressed
force e0 at one spot, variable with the time, starting at time
t0 is

   To <U+FB01>nd A as a function of zl, we might, since ZAu is the
V set up by unit e at zl, expand this state by the former
process of integration. But the following method, though
unnecessary for the present purpose, has the advantage of
bein applicable to cases in which V0 is not zero at the ter
mina s, but V=ZC instead. It is clear that the integration
process, including the ener y in the terminal apparatus, would
be very lengthy, and woul require a detailed knowledge of
the terminal combinations. This is avoided by replacing the
impressed force at e, by a charged condenser; when, clearly,
the inte ration is con<U+FB01>ned to one spot. Let S1 be the capacity
and V0 t e difference of potential of a condenser inserted at zl.
If we increase Sl in<U+FB01>nitely it becomes mathematically equiva
lent to an impressed force V0, without the condenser.
   Suppose EAw'eP” is the current at e at time tafter the intro
duction of the condenser, of <U+FB01>nite capacity ; then, since — SIX-7
is the current leaving the condenser, or the current at z,, we

of the condenser and of the normal it’ corresponding to u/
must be
                 S1V0( —wl’/S1 p) = —Vow1' /p.
But since there is, initially, electric energy only at 2,, and
magnetic energy nowhere at all, the only term in the nume

    New to make some remarks on the impossibility of join'ng
on terminal apparatus without altering the normal functions,
the terminal arrangements being made to impose conditions
of the form V=ZC. It is clear, in the <U+FB01>rst place, that if the
quantity VG at z=0 and z=l really represents the energy
transfer in or out of the line at those places, then the equation
                     A1:
                            asit
                               ,dp w         0
will be valid, provided u and w be the correct normal func
tions. But to make VG be the energy-transfer at the ends
requires us to sto the longitudinal transfer in the conductors
there, or make t e current in the conductors longitudinal.
This condition is violated when the current function w is pro
portional to cos (mz+0), as in the previous, except in the
special cases, because the radial current 7/ in the conductors is
proportional to sin (mz+9), and y has to vanish. Not in the
dielectric, but merely in the conductors.
    We can ensure that V0 is the energy-transfer at the ends
 by coating the conductors over their exposed sections with
 in<U+FB01>nitely conducting material and joining the terminal appa
 ratus on to the latter. The current in the conductors will be
 made strictly longitudinal, close up to the in<U+FB01>nitely conducting
 material, and 7 will vanish in the conductors.      But y in the
 dielectric at the same place will be continuous with the radial
 surface-current on the in<U+FB01>nitely conducting ends, due to the
 sudden discontinuity in the magnetic force. Thus the energy
 transfer, at the ends, is con<U+FB01>ned to the dielectric.
    It is clear, however, that the normal current-functions in
 the two conductors must be such as to have no radial compo
 nents at the terminals, so that they cannot be what have been
 used, such that d2/d22= constant. They require alteration, of
 sensible amount may be, only near the terminals, but theore
 tically, all along the line. It would therefore appear that only
 the <U+FB01>ve cases of V=O at either or both ends, or 0:0 ditto,
 or the line closed upon itself, admit of full solution in the
 above manner. The only practical way out of the dif<U+FB01>culty
 is to abolish the radial electric current in the conductors,
 making (66) the equation of V, and VG the longitudinal
 energy-transfer, with full applicability of the V=ZC terminal
  conditions. With a further consideration of this system, and
  some solutions relating to it, I propose to conclude this paper.

  XLII. On Stationary Waves in Flowing Water.——-Part I.
                      By Sir WILLIAM Tnomson *.
THIS subject includes the beautiful wave-group produced
          by a ship propelled uniformly through previously still
water, but the present communicationT is limited to two
dimensional motion.
    Imagine frictionless water <U+FB02>owing in uniform regime
through an in<U+FB01>nitely long canal with vertical sides; and
bottom horizontal except where modi<U+FB01>ed by transverse ridges
or hollows, or slopes between portions of horizontal bottom
at different levels. Included among such inequalities we may
suppose bars above the bottom, <U+FB01>xed perpendicularly between
the sides. Let these inequalities be all within a <U+FB01>nite por
tion, AB, of the length, and let f denote the difference of
 levels of the bottom on the two sides of this position, positive
 if the bottom beyond A is higher than the bottom beyond B.
     Now, let the water be given at an in<U+FB01>nite, or very great,
 distance beyond A, perpetually <U+FB02>owing towards A with any
prescribed constant velocity u, and <U+FB01>lling up the canal to a
 prescribed constant depth a.               It is required to <U+FB01>nd the
 motion of the water towards A, through AB, and beyond B
 as disturbed by the inequalities between A and B. This
 problem is essentially determinate; and it has only one solu
 tion if we con<U+FB01>ne it to cases in which the vertical component
 of the water’s velocity is everywhere small in comparison
 with the velocity acquired by a falling body falling from a
 height equal to half the depth. Let b be the mean depth,
 and v the mean horizontal velocity at very great distances
 beyond B; and (to have w to denote wave-energy) let w be
 such that
                             (éve+%gb)b+w . . . . . . (l)
is the whole energy, kinetic and potential, per unit of the
 canal’s breadth and per unit of its length. In cases in which
 the water <U+FB02>ows away unru<U+FB01>ied at great distances from B, w
 is zero. But, in general, the surface is ruffled, and the water
 <U+FB02>ows “ steadily ” between the plane bottom and a corrugated
 free surface, as in the well-known appearance of water <U+FB02>ow
 ing in a mill-lead, or Highland burn, or in the clear rivulet

0n the east side of Trumpington Street, Cambridge, or in
the race of Portland or Islay overfalls.         The train of
diminishing waves which we see in the wake of each little
irregularity of the bottom would, of course, extend to in<U+FB01>nity
if the stream were in<U+FB01>nitely long, and the water absolutely
inviscid (frictionless); and a single inequality, or group of
inequalities, in any part AB of the stream would give rise
to corrugation in the whole of the <U+FB02>ow after passing the
inequalities, more and more nearly uniform, and with ridges
and hollows more and more nearly perpendicular to the
sides of the canal, the farther we are from the last of the
inequalities. Observation, with a little common sense of the
mathematical kind, shows that at a distance of two or three
wave-lengths from the last of the irregularities if the breadth
of the canal is small in comparison with the wave-length, or
at a distance of nine or ten breadths of the canal if the
breadth is large in comparison with the wave-length, the
condition of uniform corrugations with straight ridges per
pendicular to the sides of the canal, would be fairly well
approximated to; even though the irregularity were a single
projection or hollow in the middle of the stream. But the
subject of the present communication is simpler, as it is
limited to two-dimensional motion; and our inequalities are
bars, or ridges, or hollows, perpendicular to the sides of
the canal. Thus, in our present case, we see that the con
dition of ultimate uniformity of the standing waves in the
wake of the irregularities is closely approximated to at a
distance of two or three wave-lengths from the last of the
inequalities.
   Let SA, SB denote two <U+FB01>xed vertical sections of the canal
at in<U+FB01>nitely great distances beyond A and beyond B. It will
simplify considerations and formulas if we take SB at a node
(or place where the depth is equal to b, the mean depth), and
we therefore take it so; although this is not necessary for the
following kinematic and dynamical statements :—
   I. The volumes of <U+FB02>uid crossing SA and SB in the same
or equal times are equal; or, in symbols,
                          au=bv=M. . . . . . . (2),
where M denotes the volume of water passing per unit of time.
   II. The excess (positive or negative) of the work done by
p on any volume of the water enterin across SA, above the
work done by g on an equal volume of t e water passing away
across SB is equal to the excess of the energy, potential and
kinetic, of the water passing away above that of the water
entering. Hence, and by (1), taking the volume of water

Thus D will denote a mean depth (intermediate between a and
b and approximately equal to their arithmetic‘mean, when their
difference is small in comparison with either); and V will
denote a corresponding mean velocity of <U+FB02>ow (intermediate
between u and 'v, and approximately equal to their arithmetic

mately constant [much more approximately equal to 2,; (a + b) ] ,
and y is approximately in constant proportion to
    When the <U+FB02>ow is so gentle that V is small in comparison
 With V9 D, 9 D, is a small proper fraction, and y is approxi
mately equal to this fraction of
    Generally, in every case when V< V 9D the upper surface
of the water rises, when the bottom falls, and the water falls,
when the bottom rises. .
    On the other hand, when V > V 9D, the water surface
 rises convex over every projection of the bottom, and falls
concave over hollows of the bottom ; and the rise and fall of
the water are each greater in amount than the rise and fall of
the bottom ; so that the water is deeper over elevations of
 the bottom, and is shallower over depressions of the bottom.
    Returnin now to the subject of standing waves (or cor
rugations o the surface) of frictionless water <U+FB02>owing over a
horizontal bottom of a canal with vertical sides, I shall not at
present enter on the mathematical analysis by which the effect
of a given set of inequalities within a limited space AB of the
canal’s length, in producing such corrugations in the water
after passing such inequalities, can be calculated, provided the
slopes of the inequalities and of the surface corrugations are
everywhere very small fractions of a radian. I hope before
long to communicate a paper to the Philosophical Magazine
on this subject for publication. I shall only just now make
the following remarks :—
    1. Any set of inequalities large or small must in general

                     Waves in Flowing Water.                   357
give rise to stationary corrugations large or small, but per
fectly stationary, however large, short of the limit that would
produce in<U+FB01>nite convex curvature (accordingto Stokes’s theory
an obtuse angle of 120°) at any transverse line of the water
surface.
   2. But in particular cases the water <U+FB02>owing away from the
inequalities may be perfectly smooth and horizontal. This is
obvious because of the following reasons :—
   (i.) If water is flowing over plane bottom with in<U+FB01>nitesimal
corrugations, an inequality which could produce such corru
gations may be placed on the bottom so as either to double
those previously existing corrugations of the surface or to
annul them.
   (ii.) The wave-length (that is to say the length from crest
to crest) is a determinate function of the mean depth of the
water and of the height of the corrugations above it, and of the
volume of water <U+FB02>owing per unit of time. This function is
determined graphically in Stokes’s theory of <U+FB01>nite waves. It
is independent of the height, and is given by the well-known
formula when the height is in<U+FB01>nitesimal.
   (iii.) From No. ii. it follows that, as it is always possible to
diminish the height of the corrugations by properly adjusted
obstacles in the bottom, it is always possible to annul them.
   3. The fundamental principle in this mode of considering the
subject is that whatever disturbance there may be in a perpet
ually sustained stream, the motion becomes ultimately steady,
all agitations being carried away down stream, because the
velocity of propagation, relatively to the water, of waves of
less than the critical len th, is less than the velocity of <U+FB02>ow of
the water relatively to tie canal.
   In Part II., to be published in the November number of
the Magazine, the integral horizontal component of <U+FB02>uid
pressure on any number of inequalities in the bottom, or bars,
will be found from consideration of the work done in genera
ting stationary waves, and the obvious application to the work
done by wave-making in towing a boat through a canal will
be considered. The de<U+FB01>nitive investigation of the wave
making effect when the inequalities in the bottom are geo
metrically de<U+FB01>ned, to which I have just now referred, will
follow ; and 1 hope to include in Part II., or at all events in
Part III. to be published in December, a complete investiga
tion, illustrated by drawings, of the beautiful pattern of waves
produced by a ship propelled uniformly through calm deep
water.

 XLIII. On the Electrical Resistance of Soft Carbon under
               Pressure. By T. C. MENDENHALL.*
A PAPER by the writer on “The In<U+FB02>uence of Time on
       the Change in the Resistance of the Carbon Disk of
Edison’s Tasimeter,” was published in this Journal in July
1882 [PhiL Mag. for August, p. 115]. The object of the
paper, as its title indicated, was to present the results of some
experiments with the carbon disk which appeared to show
that, when pressure was applied, the entire diminution of
resistance did not take place at once, but that the reduction
continued with diminished rapidity through a considerable
period of time. At the conclusion of the paper brief refer
ence was made to investigations of the same subject by Mr.
Herbert Tomlinson and by Professors Sylvanus P. Thompson
and W. F. Barrett.
   Only the conclusion reached by some of these physicists
was at that time known to the writer, their verdict being that
the observed diminution of resistance was really due to the
better surface-contact of the electrodes, and not to any actual
change in the speci<U+FB01>c resistance of the carbon itself.
   The last paragraph in the paper contains the following :—
“ Without knowing anything about the nature of these experi
ments, the writer desires to record his belief that this theory
does not entirely account for the facts stated above.”
   This, certainly not too rash, declaration of belief in a true
pressure-effect was the subject of decidedly unfavourable criti
cism in the columns of one or two European scienti<U+FB01>c journals ;
and in this Journal of December 1882, Professor Sylvanus P.
Thompson published an article entitled “Note on the alleged
Change in the Resistance of Carbon due to Change of Pres
sure,” which was an exceptionally severe criticism of the pre
vious paper by the writer. In this article Professor Thompson
refers to the investigations of Mr. Tomlinson, Prof. Barrett, and
himself, and also to experiments made by Professors Naccari
and Pagliani and Mr. Conrad W. Cooke, and he declares that,
with the exception of Professor Mendenhall, all who have in
vestigated the point are agreed in their verdict “that this
alleged effect was due not to any change in the speci<U+FB01>c resis
tance of carbon, but to better external contact between the
piece or pieces of carbon and the conductors in contact with
them.” The truth of this statement is the question at issue.
It may be well to remark, however, that although Professor
Thompson makes this assertion in December, Mr. Tomlinson
had shown, nearly a year earlier, in a paper presented to the
Royal Society, on the 26th of the previous January, that the
      " From Silliman’s American Journal for September, 1886.

    Electrical Resistance of Soft Carbon under Pressure.    359
electrical resistance of hard 'carbon was diminished by pres
sure. The amount of the diminution is small, however, and
he afterwards expresses the opinion that in such instruments
as the microphone transmitter, the greater portion of the ob
served diminution in resistance is due to variation in surface
contact.ale Mr. Tomlinson’s experiments were made with hard
carbon, similar in character to that made use of in experi
ments to be described presently.
   In the summer of 1884, the writer communicated to the
American Association for the Advancement of Science a brief
account of experiments which satis<U+FB01>ed him that the opinion
which he had previously expressed concerning the nature of
the phenomenon was unquestionably correct. Within the
past year the subject has been taken up again, and by means
of improved methods and instruments all doubts seem to have
been removed.
    Innumerable experiments made by physicists of many coun
tries have established, beyond question, the fact that the elec
trical properties of matter are modi<U+FB01>ed by stress and strain.
In carbon the effect of pressure is to diminish resistance. For
hard carbon this was established by the investigation of Mr.
Tomlinson. In compressed lampblack, as seen in Edison’s
disks, the effect is very great, and that this is for the most
part a true pressure-effect is proved, it is believed, by the
experiments about to be described.
    In the beginning it was desirable to determine, roughly,
the magitude of this effect in the case of hard carbon. For
this purpose a copper-plated rod, such as is used in the arc
lamp, about 12 centim. in length and 1'5 centim. in diameter,
 was selected and its ends were ground <U+FB02>at at right anglmgé)
its axis. The plating was then removed, except that a ba
about '5 centim. in width was left near each end of the rod.
Two cork rings 1'5 centim. thick were <U+FB01>tted to the rod, after
 which they were tunnelled out on the inside, and a hole was
 made in each so that when they were in place over the copper
 bands, and mercury was poured in, it would <U+FB02>ow around the
 ring tunnel and make a contact with the carbon as satisfactory
 as could be desired. The ends of the rod were protected by
 thin plates of vulcanite, and it was placed between the jaws
 of a vice. The current from a battery of two or three gravity
 cells was passed through the red by plun ing wires into the
 mercury cups formed by the corks. By t is arrangement it
 was possible to apply pressure at the ends of the rod without
 in any way in<U+FB02>uencing the contacts through which the cur
 rent passed.
                     “ ‘Nature,’ March 16,1882.

360     Mr. T. C. Mendenhall on the Electrical Resistance
   The terminals of a re<U+FB02>ecting-galvanometer whose resistance
was about 5000 ohms were also introduced into these mercury
cups, and enough additional resistance was introduced to make
a convenient deflection of the spot of light upon the scale.
When all was adjusted and the spot of light was at rest, the
pressure was applied by turning the handle of the vice. In
every instance the de<U+FB02>ection decreased, showing diminished
resistance. This effect was not due to the heat produced by
compression, as experiment proved that cause to be inadequate.
It was found to be necessary to make the carbon rod decidedly
warm to the touch in order to lower the resistance by the same
amount ; besides the effect was not transient, as would have
been the case if it had been due to the change in temperature.
It was also found that compression at right angles to the
direction of the current produced a similar effect, but less in
magnitude. These facts had been already announced by
Mr. Tomlinson.
   These experiments with hard carbon or with other rigid
bodies are comparatively easy, as there is no dif<U+FB01>culty in
applying the pressure independent of the contact surfaces, so
that possible variation of the latter need not be considered.
Unfortunately it appears to be quite impossible to secure this
arrangement in the examination of soft carbon. It cannot
readily be obtained in forms different from the small disk or
button in which it originally appeared, and it is so fragile
that it requires the most careful manipulation. Under these
circumstances, the only thing to do is to secure the best
possible surface-contact of the poles to begin with.     Perhaps
the ideal arrangement would be a disk with its two opposite
faces electroplated with copper, through which a contact with
mercury can be secured. The electroplating of two opposite
 faces of a disk of compressed lampblack is a work of extreme
 dif<U+FB01>culty, and so far as known to the writer has not yet been
 accomplished, although he is greatly indebted to Mr. Edison
 for a serious and persistent effort to secure this result, none
 the less appreciated because, owing to the extremely fragile
 character of the disk, it proved to be unsuccessful.
    It was therefore necessary to depend upon the contact of
 mercury with the surface of the carbon itself. As this was
 the contact employed by Professor Barrett in the experiment
 which Professor Thompson considered “ crucial,” its use can
 hardly be objected to in this instance.
    The arrangements for the test of the soft carbon were as
 follows :—two glass tubes about 20 centim. in len th were
 bent at one end into a quarter of a circumference, so t at when
 the two were joined and the straight branches of the tube were

                  of Sq‘ft Carbon under Pressure.             361
in a vertical position the appearance was that of the letter “U,”
the height being about 15 centim. Near the lower end of
each a short tube was sealed in, over which rubber tubing
could be passed, and at the lower part of the curve, in each, a
platinum wire was passed through and sealed. The ends of
the tubes were ground <U+FB02>at, and they were mounted in such a
way that while one was <U+FB01>xed in position, the other could be
moved toward or away from it in one plane, and so that the
ground ends of the curved parts were always exactly opposite
to each other. The movable tube was then taken from its
place, the ground edge of its curved end was coated with glue,
and it was carefully brought down upon the upper surface of
a carbon disk which rested in a horizontal plane.       The glue
causing the disk to adhere to the tube, the latter could then
be secured to its sliding stand, ready to move into place. The
ground edge of the <U+FB01>xed tube was now coated with glue, after
which the movable tube holding the carbon disk was gently
moved up until the disk pressed against the end of the other
 tube, the glue forming the junction. In this way a carbon
 wall or partition was formed between the two halves of a “U”
 tube. When the lue had hardened, mercury was introduced
 on both sides to aieight suf<U+FB01>cient to entirely cover the faces
 of the carbon disk. The current was introduced through the
 platinum electrodes, which plunged into mercury cups on
 either side.
    In some of the earlier experiments variations of pressure
 were produced by the addition of mercury to the two branches
 of the tube, but vastly better than this was the method latterly
 used, in which the pressure of air was substituted for that of
 mercury.     Glass plates were sealed on the open ends of the
 two upright branches, thus enclosing a space on each side,
 except at the small side tubes, to which short pieces of rubber
 tubing were attached. These were joined by means of a T
 tube, so that equality of pressure on both faces of the disk
 was secured.
    The circuit consisted of the battery, the disk, and an addi
  tional resistance varying from 3 ohms to 10 ohms for purposes
  of comparison. The electric ends of the disk and of the resis
tance were joined to a specially arranged key, by means of
  which either could be connected with the terminals of a re<U+FB02>ect
  ing galvanometer Whose resistance was about 7000 ohms. By
  means of the de<U+FB02>ections of the needle of this galvanometer,
  the resistances were compared and variations noted, the
  arrangement being substantially the same as that previously
  used in the experiments with hard carbon. A pressure-gauge,
  sometimes of water, sometimes of mercury, was attached to

the apparatus to indicate variations in pressure, and these
variations were generally produced by blowing from the
mouth into a rubber tube about two metres in length.          Very
many experiments were made, all without exception showing
great diminution in the resistance of the disk by increase of
pressure ; and it will be sufficient to quote a few of the
results.
   The disk is suf<U+FB01>ciently sensitive to show very slight changes
in atmospheric pressure. On closing the open end of the
rubber tube, and slightly pressin any part of it between the
thumb and <U+FB01>nger, the spot of lig t instantly moved, showing
decrease of resistance. A pressure measured by 5 millims. of
water produced a decided effect. The resistance of the disk,
with its mercury and platinum wire connections, under ordi
nary conditions was slightly greater than 6 ohms. A pressure
measured by 5 centim. of mercury instantly reduced it to less
than 3 ohms. If the pressure was maintained, a slow fall of
resistance continued for a loner time, as found in the previous
investigation of the subject. {If the initial pressure was small
the recovery would be instantaneous on its removal ; but if it
was large, so as to greatly reduce the resistance, it was found
that the recovery would not be complete on the withdrawal
of the pressure, sometimes falling short by as much as ten per
cent., after which a slow rise would take place. This result is
not quite in agreement with the statement made in the <U+FB01>rst
 paper upon this subject, which was based, however, upon a.
 much less satisfactory series of experiments.
   An examination was made of the effect of the strength of
 the current upon the resistance of the disk. The weakest
 current used was a little less than '001 ampere, and the
 strongest Was about '37 ampere, so that one was approximately
 400 times the other.        Throughout this range no sensible
 differences in the resistance of the disk was observed, the
 agreement at the two extremes being within the errors of
 measurement. Under all conditions the effect of variations
 of pressure was the same.
    The faces of a soft carbon disk are always smooth and
 polished ; the surface of hard carbon, on the contrary, is gen
 erally more or less rough and irregular. It would appear,
 therefore, that, if the reduction of the resistance of soft carbon
 by increase of pressure is due to better surface-contact, this
 reduction of resistance should be much more marked with hard
 than with soft carbon. Experiments already described showed
 that the effect of pressure on hard carbon was very small; so
 small, in fact, that the pressure of a few centimetres of mer
 cury would hardly produce a sensible effect.

                    Mr. John Aitken on Dew.                    363
    The substitution of a disk of hard carbon for the soft, in the
apparatus described, ought to show, then, whether any con
siderable part of the resistance-variations observed could be
 attributed to variation of contact between mercury and carbon.
Adisk of hard carbon similar in dimensions to the soft disk
 previously employed was accordingly inserted between two
 similarly arranged tubes. The result of this experiment was
 to show, as had been anticipated, a small decrease of resistance
 when the pressure was increased. A pressure of about
 7 centim. of mercury reduced the galvanometer-de<U+FB02>ection
 from 36 to 35 divisions of the scale.   This indicates a change
 of less than 3 per cent., resulting from a pressure which with
the soft disk lowered the resistance by more than 60 per cent.
There can be little doubt that this small reduction is due almost
entirely to better surface-contact produced by pressure.
   Throughout all of the experiments with soft carbon, it ex
hibited more or less irregularity in its behaviour. The appli
cation of a pressure very largely in excess of the maximum
referred to above would sometimes result in a permanent
reduction of the resistance of the disk, indicating that a per
manent set had taken place. By the exercise of care, however,
what may be called the “normal” resistance may be main
tained fairly constant for a considerable length of time.
    Conclusimzs.— When carbon is prepared in the form of com
pressed lampblack, its electrical resistance varies greatly
with the pressure to which it is subjected. A small part of
this variation is doubtless to be attributed to change in sur
face-contact between the carbon and the electrodes through
which the current is introduced, but by far the larger part
(provided any effort is made to secure good surface-contact)
is due to a real change in the resistance of the carbon itself.
The resistance of carbon in this condition is <U+FB02>uctuating and
uncertain to a degree that seems to prevent its use as a factor
in any device for the accurate measure of pressure.
                        XLIV. On Dew.
  To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
IN the paper by Mr. Charles Tomlinson, F.R.S., in the
      September number of your Journal, entitled “Further
Remarks on Mr. Aitken’s Theory of Dew,” there is little of
scienti<U+FB01>c interest, the points advanced being mostly of a con
troversial character. As, however, the whole tone of his
                              2B2

364                 Mr. John Aitken on Dew.
remarks is antagonistic to my work, as he candidly admits
at the end of his paper, where he says, “ As regards his new
theory of Dew I think he has gone astray,” it is therefore
necessary that I reply to his criticisms.
   I sincerely trust Mr. Tomlinson does not think that I accuse
him of intentionally raising a false contention by entitling his
<U+FB01>rst paper “ Remarks on a New Theory of Dew.” The title,
however, indicated the attitude of the writer’s mind towards
my conclusions, and it could not be left unchallenged, as it
struck at the very root of the matter. Mr. Tomlinson thinks
it curious that I should in my last letter have so frequently
repeated, in different forms, the statement that my results are
not contrary to the teaching of Dr. Wells. If he will refer
to his “Remarks ” he will <U+FB01>nd that these repeated statements
are all replies to the contents of different paragraphs in his
own letter.
   Mr. Tomlinson attempts to justify the title of his paper by
sa ing that the author of an article on the same subject in
‘ hambers’s Journal’ used the same words. That we are
ri ht because we think with the majority is an argument
w ich is generally supposed to be a monopoly of the political
mind; to the scienti<U+FB01>c mind, I venture to say, it carries no
weight. Besides, in an article in a popular journal like
‘Chambers ’ the writer may be pardoned for selecting a
catching title, and we do not expect from him the scienti<U+FB01>c
accuracy of language we do from a writer in the ‘Philoso
phical Magazine.’ Though the writer in ‘ Chambers’s Journal ’
gives a misleading title, yet he very fairly states the position.
For instance, he says :—
   “ The essential difference between the old and the new
theories is as to the source of the moisture which forms the
dew. Instead of being condensed from the air above by the
cooled vegetation, Mr. Aitken maintains that it comes from
the ground.     The author of the original theory admitted that
some of the dew might come from below, but af<U+FB01>rmed that it
must be an exceedingly small proportion.        Mr. Aitken’s ex
periments, on the contrary, seem to prove that most, if not
the whole, comes from the ground.”
   From the above it will be seen that, as I have so frequentl
stated, my results do not touch on the teaching of Dr. Wells.
As every one knows, be concerned himself principally with
the condensation of the vapour after it is in the air, and but
little with its source, as he distinctly states in his Essay that
he had no means of investigating this latter point.
   At page 271 Mr. Tomlinson says:-——“Again the Chambers’s
article, referring to Wells, says:—‘ The points of the grass,

                    Mr. John Aitken on Dew.                     365
small twigs, and all other good radiating surfaces are cooled the
most ; and accordingly we <U+FB01>nd the dew-drops most abundant
on these bodies ; whilst on metal, or hard stone surfaces, which
are poor radiators, we seldom or never <U+FB01>nd any dew.’ This is
the Wells picture; the writer now turns to the Aitken pic
ture. ‘A closer observation reveals the fact that these so-called
‘dew-drops’ are formed at the end of the minute veins of the
leaves and grass, and are not now recognised as dew at all,
but moisture exuded from the interior of the plants them
selves.’ And yet Mr. Aitken is angry with me for calling
his theory new, and for asserting that, if true, it will supersede
the labours of previous observers.” My critic here shifts his
ground; when he <U+FB01>nds the contents of the <U+FB01>rst part of my
paper, regarding the rising of vapour at night, does not ustify
his title of New Theory, he cleverly seems to put me in oppo
sition to recognized authority on another point.        The above
quotations certainly are in opposition to each other, and great
credit is due for the very ingenious manner in which the case
is put. But, unfortunately for the critic, the words are not
the words of Dr. Wells, but are those of the writer in ‘ Cham
bers’s Journal,’ and can scarcely even be said to be founded
on the teaching of Wells ; so that, further than affording Mr.
Tomlinson a little mental gymnastics, his efforts are here
entirely thrown away.
   It does seem strange, considering how much is indirectly
attributed to Dr. Wells regarding the deposition of dew on
grass, that his ‘Essay’ really contains very little that is de<U+FB01>nite
either about the radiation from grass, compared with that from
other bodies, or about the amount of dew deposited upon it.
Towards the end of the <U+FB01>rst part of his ‘Essay,’ where he
gives “the results of some experiments which were made for
the purpose of ascertaining the tendencies of various bodies
to become cold upon exposure to the sky at night,” he
says :-—“ In the observations hitherto given by me on the cold
connected with dew, the temperature of the grass has been
chie<U+FB02>y considered, partly because my <U+FB01>rst experiments had
been made upon it, and partly from a wish, which arose after
wards, to compair my own experiments with those of M. Six,
which had been con<U+FB01>ned to that substance. I found it, how
ever, very un<U+FB01>t to furnish the means of compairing the degrees
of cold produced at night on the surface of the earth, at dif
ferent times and places; as its state on different nights, on
the same parts of the plat I commonly made use of, and in
different parts of the plat on the same nights, was often very
unequal in point of height, thickness, and <U+FB01>neness ; all of which
circumstances in<U+FB02>uenced the degree of cold produced by it."

366                 Mr. John Aitken on Dew.
    Near the end of the second part of his ‘ Essay’ he refers to
the dew on plants, but it is simply for the purpose of refuting
the opinion that “the dew found on growing vegetables is the
condensed vapour of the very plants on which it appears.”
He says :—“ This seems to be erroneous, for several reasons.
 (1) Dew forms as copiously upon dead as upon living vege
table substances. (2) The transpired humour of plants will
be carried away by the air which passes over them when they
 are not suf<U+FB01>ciently cold to condense the watery vapour con
 tained in it.” . . . . . I draw attention to these passages to
 show that the distinction between true dew and'the dew-drop
 was not recognized at the time Wells wrote his ‘ Essay.’ All
 his arguments are directed against the opinion that the dew
 formed over the whole surface of the blades of plants was
 produced by the condensation of the vapour transpired by the
 plants themselves, which he pointed out would be a small
 quantity at night on account of the absence of light. He
 makes no reference, so far as I am aware, to the dew-drop,
 which my investigations tend to show is the result of exuded
 liquid, and not of the transpired vapour to which Wells di
 rected his criticisms; so that my observations are in a different
‘<U+FB01>eld from those of Dr. Wells.
     But even supposing my conclusions regarding the source
 of the dew-drop to be correct and to be in opposition to recog
 nized authority, still, if we wish to be accurate, we shall not
 be entitled to call it a new theory of dew, as it is a theory of
 the dew-drop as distinct from dew.
     If Mr. Tomlinson will change his style of criticism, and
 will explain to us whence came the drops which formed on
 the plants experimented on when they were isolated in d
 air, and all supply of moisture out off except that which came
  up through the tissues of the plants ; and if he will show us
  that we have misinterpreted the teaching of the experiments
  made by weighing turfs and others, which we have adduced
  to show that vapour is given off from the ground while dew
  is forming at night, he will be entitled to be listened to ; but
  purely literary criticism is a mere jangling of words, and
  seldom leads to satisfactory conclusions.
     I fear Mr. Tomlinson has misunderstood the bearing of my
  remarks with regard to what takes place in Persia and the
  African Desert. The impression I wished to convey was, that
  we cannot conclude from experiments made in this climate as
  to what takes place in arid regions. I am happy to say I can
  assure my critic that “the great forces of Nature rule as im
  partially in Persia and in Africa as in Scotland ; ” is it
  not for this very reason that we cannot conclude from what

                  Mr. John Aitken on Dew.                     367
takes place in one country what will take place in the other,
unless the conditions are alike?
   All my experiments show that in our climate dew never
falls on the earth—though of course Mr. Tomlinson, if he is
consistent, must think otherwise—and dew is only deposited
on plants and other bodies not in good heat communication
with the ground. But it would be rash from this to conclude
that in arid countries, where the air is highly diathermatous,
and the ground dry and probably a bad conductor of heat,
the surface of the earth is never cooled by radiation below
the dew-point. But on this point I repeat, “ I wait for
further information before forming any opinion as to what
takes place in other and unknown conditions.” I observe
that Mr. Tomlinson does not observe the same caution, as he
states distinctly that, after passing through arid regions,
“long before the travellers reached any considerable body
of water, nocturnal dews were abundant, and they were de
posited from the air, and did not rise out of the ground.” Now
on what does he found this last statement which I have put
in italics? The fact that the dews were deposited out of the
air in no way proves that vapour did not rise from the ground
while the dews were being deposited.
   With regard to the bearing of the experiments of the F10
rentine Academicians, of Robert Boyle, and Le Roi, my critic
says, “ These early observers proved that the moisture which
forms dew and hoar-frost exists in the air, and does not exhale
from the ground.” It is a self-evident fact that the vapour
must be in the air before it condenses on the different surfaces ;
but, as has been already said in my previous letter, this fact
has “no bearing on the subject,” as it neither proves nor dis
proves that vapour “does not exhale from the ground.”
   Mr. Tomlinson is welcome to any consolation he can get
by shielding himself behind the word “ abstract ” to account
for his misconception of the essential conditions of the crucial
experiment made by weighing the turfs before and after “dew
fall.” As, however, my last letter gave no further information
on the subject, and as Mr. Tomlinson seems now to under
stand the conditions of this test, it may be presumed that the
abstract was complete enough on that point and did not give
rise to the misunderstanding.
   I may say I have carefully considered the observations of
Melloni, referred to by Mr. Tomlinson, and do not <U+FB01>nd any
thing in them that affect the conclusions I have arrived at.
To enter, however, into a detailed examination of his work
would extend the limits of this letter to an undue length.
   To many this discussion must have appeared extremely

368‘                 Mr. Thomas Gray on a New
unsatisfactory and unreal, too much attention having been
given to purely literary points, to the almost entire exclusion
of the realities connected with the phenomena of dew, and the
interpretation to be put on them. No one, I am sure, regrets
 the unfortunate direction the discussion has taken more than
 I do. It could not, however, be avoided, owing to the direc
tion from which the attack was delivered.
    After all this difference of opinion it is a comfort to <U+FB01>nd
 one point on which we are agreed, namely “ not to write again
 on this subject ;” and in closing the discussion I wish to
 thank Mr. Tomlinson for his criticisms, because I am sure his
 objections will be the objections of many others to my conclu
 sions; and though I fear I have not succeeded in making a
 convert of him, I may perhaps have been more successful
 with those whose ideas are not so de<U+FB01>ned and stereotyped by
 frequent writing on the subject. I think, however, I can
 assure Mr. Tomlinson that when he candidly and calmly con
 siders the result of my investigations, he will not <U+FB01>nd them so
 heterodox as he at present seems to think; nor do I think
 that my observations will entirely “supersede the labours of
 previous observers ” for whose work he has so much respect,_
 though some of their views will require modi<U+FB01>cation to meet
 the present state of our knowledge.
                                          Yours truly,

         XLV. On a new Standard Sine- Galvanometer.
               By THOMAS GRAY, B.Sc., F.R.S.E.‘*
    HE standard galvanometers commonly employed for the
       determination of currents in absolute measure consist
either of one bobbin of large radius, havin a groove of rela
tively small breadth and depth <U+FB01>lled wit wire, or of two
such bobbins mounted with their planes parallel and at a
distance apart equal to the radius of either coil. These coils
are suitably mounted for use either as sine- or as tangent
galvanometers. The object of making the coils of large
radius is twofold—<U+FB01>rst, in order that it may be possible to
measure it with suf<U+FB01>cient accuracy, and second, in order that
the magnetic <U+FB01>eld, produced by the current, may be of nearly
uniform strength near the centre of the coil.         So far as uni
formity of <U+FB01>eld is concerned, the double coil, or Helmholtz
arrangement, is all that can be desired ; but it introduces a
multiplicity of measurements, one at least of which, namely

                  Standard Sine-Galvanometer.          ‘       3 69
the distance between the mean planes of the coils, is difficult
to make with su<U+FB02>icient accuracy.
   The arrangement here proposed, and illustrated in <U+FB01>gures 1
and 2, consists of one layer of wire wound on a tube of com~
paratively small diameter, say 10 centimetres or less, and of
great length. The force at the centre of such a tube, produced
by unit current, is given by the equation
                                  41ml
                           f    \/'r2 + [2,
where l is half the length of the coil, r its radius, and n the
number of turns per centimetre of its length. When I is
very great compared with r the force becomes 41m, that is
to say, it depends wholly upon the number of turns n per
unit-length of the coil. The correction for the length of the
                                                         1 e

gives

    When l is ten times the radius, this series becomes

                                     + W_&G.),
which shows that for this moderate length the correction is
very small, and is amply obtained by taking in the second
term of the series. Any small error in the measurement of
the diameter of the coil is thus of little importance, and hence
the chief question becomes the degree of accuracy which can
be attained in the estimation of n, the number of turns per
centimetre. The total number of turns, or nl, can of course
 be obtained with absolute accuracy, and the length, I, can be
 easily measured to the tenth of a millimetre, which, on the
 assumption of uniformity of winding, gives n to one part in
 10,000. Providing that there exists no want of uniformity
 which will affect the average value of n, perfect uniformity is
 only important near the central part. Now an irregularity to
 the extent of one hundredth part of n, or one tenth of a milli
 metre, can be readily detected by simple measurement; and
supposing that this was due to an opening between the wind
 ings in the same plane as the needle (or at the most advantageous
 position), and that there was no compensation due to denser
 winding near the middle position, the effect would only amount
 to about one in 1200 of the total force. The determination of
 the value of n does not, however, depend altogether on the
 measurements here described ; the operation of winding a

coil uniformly is one to which mechanical appliances of great
precision can be readily applied. The wire can, for instance,
  e laid on by means of a self-feeding lathe with apitch which
is not only perfectly uniform, but which is also known with
minute accuracy from the pitch of the feed-screw. Any
slight irregularity which might remain can, if it be within
the sensibility of the instrument, be detected by moving the
needle along the axis by withdrawing the tube T1 and observ
ing the change of sensibility. The great advantage of the
arrangement is the simplicity and possible accuracy of the
measurements and the great uniformity of the <U+FB01>eld all round
the central point. The resistance of the coil is, when thin
wire is used, somewhat higher for the same sensibility than
it is in the ordinary form, but for a standard instrument this
is of little importance.
    Referring now to the sketches, the tube T, which carries
the coil, is mounted on a platform P, furnished with three
levelling screws L, L, L, and can be turned round a vertical
axis V, sliding at the same time on two feet f,            The
an le through which the coil is turned is measured by a
sc 0 S. In the centre of the tube a small plane mirror m is
suspended, and at one end of the tube a short scale s, illu
minated by means of an inclined mirror or prism, which
receives light through a small hole h, is <U+FB01>xed, and immedi
ately above it a plane mirror M.     The light from the scale s
is re<U+FB02>ected from the suspended mirror to the <U+FB01>xed mirror M,
and then through the telescope t <U+FB01>xed in the end of the tube
T1. The scale s here shown may be replaced by a narrow
slit, or a round hole with a wire across it, and the telescope
by a sheet of obscure glass. A lens placed in front of the
opening may then be used to focus an image of the slit or wire

<U+FB01>xed to the glass precisely as in Jacob’s well-known galvano
meter arrangement. The lens may be dispensed with, and an
ordinary Thomson’s spherical mirror substituted for the sus
pended mirror by <U+FB01>xing the obscured glass in the end of a
third tube, which can be telescoped out of and into the tube
Tl so as to adjust the focus. One end of the coil is attached
to the pin 11, and the other to the pin 10,, while the wire w
conducts the current back parallel to the axis of the coil to a.
third pin p3, <U+FB01>xed close to [21.      From p1 and p, the current is
conducted, by means of a pair of <U+FB02>exible electrodes twisted
to ether, to proper terminals on the platform P.
      n using the instrument, place it on a table in a well
 lighted room and level the platform P. Then turn the coil
 until the central division of the scale s coincides with the
 cross wires of the telescope, and take the reading on the scale
 S. Pass a steady current through the coil and note how far
 the tube has to be turned to bring the central division of 8
 again to the cross wire of the telescope. Repeat this reading
 with the current reversed, and move the scale S if necessary,
 until the angles on the two sides of zero are equal. The cur
 rent <U+FB02>owing through the coil is then given by the equation
                          0_      H sin 0

  where 6 is the angle through which the tube is turned from
  the zero position to bring the central division of s to the cross
  wire of the telescope. The degree of accuracy attainable in
  the determination of 0 is evidently very great, and can be
  pushed to almost any extent by <U+FB01>ne division of S and micro
  scope reading.

         are presented by the business of Banking‘l'. The pro<U+FB01>ts
  of the Banker depend upon the probability that he will not
  be called upon to meet at once more than a certain amount_of
   his liabilities. Assuming that the demands made upon him
   <U+FB02>uctuate, like so many other phenomena, according to the
   exponential law of frequency, we may employ the Theory of
     * Communicated by the Author.

  Errors to determine the probability that the demand will not
  exceed any proposed limit. The assumption just made has
  been defended elsewhere*; the mathematical constructions
  which rest upon that foundation are the subject of this paper.
      I. The <U+FB01>rst and main problem is : Given a series of Bank
  ing returns (e. g. of Notes in the hands of the Public, or
  of the Reserve), to <U+FB01>nd the probability that the next return,
  or the returns in the proximate future, will not exceed
  certain limits. The general method is to <U+FB01>nd the Mean'l' of
  the given series and the Modulus ; to put T for the ratio of
  the distance between the Mean and the proposed limit to the
  Modulus; to <U+FB01>nd \%_ (Y Te‘<U+FB02>dt from the usual tables, and put
                          7"» 0
  the value so found for the probability that the next observa
  tion on the same side of the Mean as the proposed limit will
  not exceed the limit, or put half that value for the probability
  that the next observation unconditionally will not exceed the
  limit.    The question here arises, What method is to be adopted
  in discovering the Mean and Modulus? I have elsewherei
  considered generally the relative advantages and disadvantages
  of the different methods. Here it will be su<U+FB02>icient to take
  account of what is special to the statistics under consideration.
  It is a peculiarity of Banking returns (as of some meteorolo
  gical records) that they cannot be regarded as so many inde
  pendent observations, like the different measurements of the
  same object, or like the heights of different individuals. Co'n
  sider, for instance, the weekly returns of Bank-of-England
  Notes in the hands of the Public between the years 1833 and
  1844. Every single return from January to September
  1834 is above the Mean of the whole series, which is about
  £18,400,000. Every single return from August 1839 to
  June 1841 is below that Mean. Such sequences are incon
  sistent with the hypothesis of independent observations. We
  must liken the series of returns, not to a series of numbers
  each one of which is the sum of, say, twenty digits taken at
  random (from pages of mathematical tables), but rather to an
‘ entangled series constituted in the following manner. Form
  a <U+FB01>rst term in the manner just described. Then, for the next
  term (instead of taking twenty fresh digits), remove one of
  the constituent digits from the <U+FB01>rst number and add a fresh
  digit taken at random. Repeat the process continually. Then
  you Will have an entangled series like the following :—

 where the <U+FB01>rst term and the last term are the only indepen
 dent observations; and where there occur twenty observations
 running above the Mean of the series (supposed inde<U+FB01>nitely
 prolonged). In case of such entangled series, I submit that
 the advantage of accuracy generally attaching to the Arith
 metic Mean and the determination of Modulus by way of mean
 square of error disappears. There is no set-off against their
 disadvantage of inconvenience. Accordingly the proper mode
 of reducing such observations is what may be called the
 Galton-Quetelet method, by way of Median and “ Quartile.”
     I have applied this method to <U+FB01>nd what was the probability
 in 1844 that the Notes in the hands of the public would not
 in the proximate future fall below the limit <U+FB01>xed in that year
 for uncovered Notes. The returns upon which the calculation
 is based* are the monthly returns from 1833—1884, and cer
 tain biennial returns from 1826-1844. I <U+FB01>nd that these
 returns conform pretty accurately to a probability-curve,
 whose Median is £18,400,000, and whose probable-error is
 £1,000,000.        The Modulus then is about £2,000,000.           And
 the proposed limit is £15,500,000T ; that is, at a distance from
 the Median of about 115 the Modulus. The probability, then, of
 the Notes not falling below the regulation-limit in the proxi
 mate future is about '981.                                 -
_ II. The problem becomes complicated if we suppose the
 number of (independent) observations to be not large, and
 seek to determine, by way of Inverse Probability§, the error
 due to that limitation.
     The error incurred by the Galton-Quetelet method depends
 upon the errors attaching to the assumptions that the point
  dividing the given set of observations into two equal groups
  is the real Median, and that the points dividin the given set
  of observations in the ratio of three to one aret e real “ Quar
 tiles.” The errors of these assumptions may be investigated
  by the following method, which was suggested by Laplace’s
  determination of the error incurred by his “Method of Situa
  tion ” (Theorie Analytique, Supplement 2, Sect. 2).

     I More exactly '98 is the probability of the next observation falling
  below the limit. Within what time the next observation must take
 place depends upon the number of (independent) observations assigned to
 the series. It would be safe, I think, to say—within six months.
    § Problem I. belongs to _the class termed d in my ‘Observations and
 Statistics ;’ Problem II. to d.

374      Mr. F. Y. EdgeWOrth’s Problems in Probabilities.
   Let n be the number of observations supposed to ran e
under one and the same curve y=qb(.z); whereof P ist e
(real) ordinate at the Median point; which point may be
taken as the origin. The probability of an error 2 being
committed by the apparent Median is equal to the proba
bility of half of the n observations falling on one side and
half on the other side of z. Now the probability of a single
observation falling outside z is
                           (liege).
And the probability of a single observation falling inside 2 is
                           (s +j:          dz).
Hence the probability of z being the apparent Median is

us consider the probability of the point (Q +z) dividing the
observations in the ratio of i to i. The probability of an

 Whence, as the law of facility for the error of the Quartile
 point, we have                        11111:,
                             3/=Je "‘2 ;
 where J is taken so that ydz between extreme limits =1.
    Thus we have found the error incident to both extremities
 of the line which we assume as the “ probable error ” of the
  curve under consideration. And it appears at <U+FB01>rst sight that
 we might calculate the error in the length of the line by adding
 together the Modulus-squared for each of the two errors on
 which the error of the line depends. There occurs, however,
  the dif<U+FB01>culty that these errors are not independent *. Adrift
  which shifts the Median in either direction is apt to shift the
  Quartile in the same direction, and vice versd. In view of
  this dif<U+FB01>culty, I see no way but to be contented with the sum
  of the Moduli-squared as a superior limit to the sought Modu
  lus-squared of error; and with the smaller of them as an
  inferior limit.    The superior limit of the Modulus-squared
                                                           2
  (for the error of the Quartile) is then nearly              The (supe
  rior limit of the) Modulus for the same error is \/7~7:c.            The
  error incurred in determining the Modulus (of the given set
  of observations) follows from the proposition that the Modulus
  is 2'097 x probable-error. The Modulus for the error in the
  determination of the Modulus of the given observations is
   found to be < 37%; ; where for c we may put the apparent
   Modulus (in the example above given, 2,000,000).
    * The same dif<U+FB01>culty attends the use of the “ Octiles ” and “ Deciles.”

376 Mr. F. Y. Edgeworth’s Problems in Probabilities.
   This error may be somewhat reduced, if we determine the
probable-error (for the given observations) not by the dis
tance between the apparent Median and the apparent Quartile
point, but by the distance between the two Quartile points.
The Modulus for the error of c is in this case        n
    We have so far been investigating the error incident to
reasoning up to the character of the curve from a not very
large number of observations. Let us now consider the error
incident to the complete process of reasoning up from the
given observations and down again to a new observation.
First, let us suppose the Mean given, and calculate the error
incident to the assumption that Q’, the apparent Quartile, is
the real one. Let it be required to determine the probability
that a subsequent observation will not exceed uQ'. Put 6(ar)

           0
the probability that an observation being in excess of the Mean
                                      I
will not exceed aQ’ is 0                          Now z occurs with
                                                                 ,2

the even terms may be neglected, involving the higher powers
of k2, i.e. of -.
                n
   In this reasoning we have supposed the Quartile to be
determined by taking the point which divides the whole set
of given observations into two groups whose numbers are to
each other as three to one. If we determined the Quartile
by taking the point which divided 7% observations above the
Median into two groups each numbering Z, the conclusion
would be much the same except that, instead of n, we must
put 3, and put 1'7 for 2 in the value of k.
   As an example of the last case, let us take 11:80; that
being, I think, the greatest number of independent observa
tions to which the series of returns of Notes in the hands of
the public between 1826—1844 can be re arded as equivalent.
And let a=4. Then the correction \Siich is to be made
upon the primd facie solution 0(4x '477) or '993 is '008,
or about '01.
   This conclusion may be roughly veri<U+FB01>ed by the following
table, in which the <U+FB01>rst column represents several hypotheses
as to the relation between Q' the length of the (apparent)
Quartile measured from the Mean (supposed given) and c
the Modulus of the given observations.
   These hypotheses are thus constituted. The central hypo
thesis corresponds to the case in which a single observation is
as likely to fall outside as inside Q'. According to the hypo
thesis immediately above the central one (Q'='60 c), the
probability of a single observation falling inside Q' is _'6.
According to the hypothesis next above, the corresponding
probability is '7. Conversely, below the centre the corre
sponding probabilities are '4, '3, &c. According to received
principles * it is allowable to regard each of these hypotheses
as d priori equally probable.
  * See my paper on a priori Probabilities Phil. Mag. 1884, Sept); also
that on “Observations and Statistics ” ( amb. Phil. Trans. 1885). It
might have seemed more natural, though not really, I think, preferable,
to take as the eqni-probable hypotheses the equations of Q' to equicr'escent
values of c (or of c to equicrescent values of Q'). I have done so in con—
structing analogous tables for the solution of problem iii. (below, p; 381).

    The <U+FB01>fth column is obtained by dividing each entry in the
fourth column by the sum of them all. The seventh column
gives the probability that, if any hypothesis is true, the effect
under consideration would follow from it. The eighth column
is obtained by multiplying each entry in the seventh column
by the corresponding entry in the <U+FB01>fth column. The sum of
the entries in the eighth column gives, very roughly of course,
the probability that the next observation above the Mean will
exceed 4Q'. The probability that the next observation above
the Mean will fall within that limit is '987, corresponding to
“985 *, as found by the approximative method.
    So far we have been supposing the Mean given; but we
must now investigate the error incurred in assigning the
probability that a subsequent observation will not exceed a
certain multiple of the probable-error measured not from
the real, but the apparent, Mean.            Let 0 be the real, 0' the
           o 0’                                    QQ.‘

apparent one, namely, that which separates the given obser
vations into two groups numbering respectively 5,1 n and i n.
Let O'P=aO'Q'.             Let us <U+FB01>nd the probability that the
(12+ 1)th observation 1' will fall outside P.
    Let z=OO’, §=QQ'. And let k be the Modulus for the
error of the Median, x for that of the Quartile point. It is
shown above that

For any particular values of z and K the probability that a
subsequent observation will exceed P is proportioned to
                            s [14(3)],

    The second portion of this addendum is the correction due
 to the error of putting the apparent Mean for the real Mean.
 The <U+FB01>rst part of the expression corresponds to the correction
which we obtained when we supposed the real Mean known.
 The present result differs from the former one in that its sign
 is negative, and its absolute quantity less by half; as it ought
 to do in view of the different enunciation of the problem.
 It should be added that in so far as 2 and §* tend to vary in
 the same direction, the correction is not accurate but of the
 nature of a superior limit.
    I have applied this correction to the question discussed
 under Problem 1., namely, what was the probability that the
limit <U+FB01>xed in 1844 for the uncovered Notes would not be
passed in the proximate future by the Notes in the hands of
 the public. The value found by Problem I., viz. '98, is
 reduced by Problem II. to '95.

Bank of England notes at £14,000,000; upon the ground
that the Notes in the hands of the public (less* by the Bank
Post Bills together with the lost notes) had never fallen below
that <U+FB01>gure. What is the probability that if M is the maxi
mum or minimum (measured from the Mean) of g observa
tions, a subsequent observation, the (g+1)th in excess (or
defect), will not exceed M, or more generally qM. If, like
the legislators, we are to ignore the grouping of the n obser
vations, and to utilize only the datum that M is the maximum
of n observations on one side of the Mean; then (‘1 priori one
ratio of the given maximum to the unknown modulus may be
regarded as about as likely as another. Consider the parti
cular ratio r. The probability that a single observation in
excess of the Mean will fall within M is 6(r); where, as before,
6(.z') is identical with 722§1 e—‘Zdt. The probability that n
                              '"‘ o
observations being in excess of the Mean should not exceed
 M is [6(r)]". Hence the aposteriori probability that the par
 ticular hypothesis considered is the true one is

 The probability that if the particular hypothesis is true the
next observation above the mean will not exceed 9M is 9(qM).

 hundreds to one. Again, suppose g=20. To obtain the

 degree of probability just mentioned it would be necessary to
 make the limit 2M. These and similar results may be used
 to <U+FB01>nd in a rough and ready fashion a superior (or inferior)
 limit to the <U+FB02>uctuations of any phenomenon; the Mean and
 the Maximum of a certain number of observations being
 given. Thus, consider the Registrar-General’s returns of the
 proportions of male to female children for the different
 counties and for several consecutive years, e. 9. Report 46,
 table 16. Omitting Lancashire, West Riding, Huntingdon
 shire, and Rutlandshire, we have 40 observations of pretty
 much the same weight in each of the <U+FB01>rst ten columns in the
 table referred to. Take any one of these, e. g. the fourth,
 and observe the difference between the maximum return in
 that column and either its own or the general Mean.                The
 Mean + twice that difference constitutes a fairly safe superior
 limit. In the case selected, the maximum return is 1089. And
 the Mean (both of this column and all the columns) is 1038.
 Hence for the superior limit we have 1140, which is not I
 think reached by any of the four hundred returns in the table.
 I have tested the proposed canons in the Art of Conjecturing
 by similarly applying them to various phenomena more or
 less obeying the law of error; such as" a series of <U+FB01>gures,
 each of which is formed by adding together a certain number
 of digits taken at random from mathematical tables; recordsT
 of temperature; statisticsi of the dactyls in Virgilian lines,

     IV. My fourth problem is : Given the Modulus of the law
 of error for a certain species of demand made upon a bank,
 to <U+FB01>nd what the Modulus becomes when the liabilities are
 increased in any proportion cwteris paribus. The general
answer is that the Modulus increases, not in the ratio of the
volume of business, but in the square root of that ratio. The
general rule and the exceptions may be illustrated by ex
amples taken from Vital Statistics. Consider§ a Table of
 Proportions of Male to Female children born in Registration
Counties. Form the sums of the columns. Compare the <U+FB02>uc
tuation of the fringe-row thus formed with the <U+FB02>uctuation of
the <U+FB01>gures in the ordinary rows.             It will be found that the
Modulus for the former is not n times, but about \/17 times,

  that of the latter.        But the general rule is not so well ful
  <U+FB01>lled when we similarly consider the Death-rates" in Regis
  tration Counties. The death-rates in different counties for
  the same year are not, as the theory requires, independent,
  but tend to increase or decrease all together. Accordingly
  the Modulus for the sums does not shrink in the regulation
  fashion. It will be less indeed than n times, but greater than
   A\/n times, the Modulus for the ordinary rows.
      A converseT exception may be illustrated by the following
  supposition. Suppose that, when there is a high death-rate
  from a particular disease in one year, there is apt to be a low
  death-rate in the following year or years. Form a table of
  the rates of deaths from such a disease for a set of counties
  (like the agricultural) not differing much in respect of healthi
  ness. Consider the <U+FB02>uctuation (not now of the horizontal
  but) of the vertical fringe of sums in such a table. In virtue
  of the compensatory action between the years the Modulus
  for the Vertical fringe of sums (or means) will shrink more
  than the general rule requires.
      Both these kinds of exception occur in Banking, as will be
 shown elsewherei. Here it need only be explained that in
 order to verify the rule, or to establish an exception, there is
 required a great number of observations. Suppose that Cf
 is a certain Modulus-squared, and that C,2 is another, double
 012. In order to prove that relation, it may fairly be required
 that 022 should be determined so accurately that its error
 should not exceed 31, or at most §, G12. In order that the
 error of 022 should not exceed g C12, the Modulus for 022
should not exceed 13‘; 0,2.         But the Modulus for C,” as deter
mined by n observations is Jf§.                   Hence 4/17 must be

greater 135 g”, > 10. And 11. must be greater than 100.
                 1
     The following <U+FB01>gures illustrate this theory. Every term
in the <U+FB01>rst series stands for one and the same quantity, a

  - It would be impossible to determine by inspection of these
measurements what is the real relation of the objects measured.
The Mean of the <U+FB01>rst series being 210, while that of the second
series is 162, those who look only to averages without testing
their signi<U+FB01>cance will conclude offhand that the <U+FB01>rst object
is greater than the second. But in fact the real value under
lying the <U+FB01>rst series is only half the corresponding value for
the second series ; the former being the twice-mean-square
of-error for aggregates of ten digits taken at random, the
latter for aggregates of twenty digits. The real relation
 would come out if we went on long enough. I have gone on
 long enough, in the case of the <U+FB01>rst series, to get within a
 thirty-<U+FB01>fth part of its theoretical value, namely 165. I obtain
 160 as the mean of two hundred and eighty terms of the <U+FB01>rst
 series—a number of observations which corresponds to a pro
 bable errror of about 5, the error which I have incurred. If
 I went on long enough with the second series I should,
 doubtless, get equally near its real value, which is 330._ But
 to the unitiated such statistics are hopelessly misleading.
 Blind palpation is sure to err.

   ,   ON THE MEASUREMENT OF VERY HIGH PRESSURES, AND THE
           COMPRESSIBILITY OF LIQUIDS.          BY M. F. AMAGAT.
  1N measuring very high pressures I have adopted the principle of
         the di<U+FB01>erential manometer; the conditions to be realized for
  obtaining exact measurements is that the pistons be completely
  mobile and at the same time perfectly tight.
       M. Marcel Deprez had the idea of dispensing with the leather of
  the small piston, and making the escape extremely small by a con
  venient adjustment. This device is insuf<U+FB01>cient for very high
  pressures, especially in the conditions of my experiments; this is
  also the case with the use of goldbeater’s skin, adopted by M.
  Cailletet.
       On the other hand, numerous experiments have shown me that
   the membrane, on which the large piston rests, introduces several
   sources of error. I have altogether dispensed with the leather and
   the membrane, and have solved the dif<U+FB01>culty by using a viscous body
   suitably chosen. The large piston, which only receives the reduced
   pressure, rests on a cushion of castor-oil, which transmits the pres
   sure to the mercury ; the small piston, which receives all the
   pressure at the top, becomes quite tight if, after being soaked in oil,
   and put in its place, it is wetted on its base with a suf<U+FB01>ciently viscous
   liquid, such as molasses, which answers perfectly. In these con
   ditions, the pistons being even somewhat free, there is no real leak,
   but only an extremely slow oozing, which does not a<U+FB01>ect the mea
     surements, and this up to pressures higher than 3000 atmospheres.

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.           385
     Nevertheless in these conditions the mercurial column rises with
  starts which cause considerable errors. They are completely de
  stroyed by giving a rotatory motion to the pistons, which is easily
  obtained.
     I have hitherto investigated only the compressibility of water
 and that of ordinary ether. The piece in which the piezometer is
 compressed is a steel cylinder 1'20 metre in height; it is hooped
 for its entire length except part of the breech; its internal dia
 meter is 3 centim., and its sides are 8 centim. in thickness. It was
 cast and hooped at the cannon foundry of Firminy. This cylinder
 is <U+FB01>xed vertically in a large copper reservoir, so that it can be
 worked with in melting ice, or in a current of water at a constant
 temperature.                ’
     The reading of the volumes of the compressed liquid was made
 by the following method, which was pointed out to me by Prof.
 Tait.   A series of platinum wires are soldered in the stem of the
 piezometer, as in <U+FB01>re-alarm thermometers; these wires are con
 nected by a metal spiral with a resistance of two ohms between each
 wire, and the prolongation of which passes through the short
 cylinder by means of a special insulated joint. The current of a
 battery reaches the mercury in which the stem is immersed through
 the steel cylinder. It will thus be seen how galvanometric indica
 tions may give the precise moment at which the mercury rising in
 the stem, owing to the compression of the liquid; successively
reaches each platinum wire.
    The liquid of the piezometer and the liquid which transmits the
pressure in which it is immersed become considerably heated by the
pressure; this makes the experiments very long; a considerable
time is required to counterbalance the mass, which is a bad con
ductor; the readings must be repeated until the indications of the
manometer are constant in contact. The series of observations
made with decreasing pressures produce the same effect in the oppo
site direction; the mean of the results is taken, and their general
agreement shows that the whole method leaves really little to be
desired.                                             ‘
    We see by this what gross errors may have been committed with
the other devices hitherto used for measuring volumes in analogous
conditions.
    Ether and water have been studied at zero and at two adjacent
temperatures, the one of 20° and the other of 40°.
    For both liquids the direction of the variation of the coef<U+FB01>cient
of contractibility with the temperature is the same under very
strong pressures as under very weak. Water continues to form an
exception; its compressibility diminishes as the tem erature in
creases, in the above limits ; the variation seems,        owever, to
diminish at the highest pressures.
( The coef<U+FB01>cient of the variation with the pressure, as was easily
to be foreseen, gradually diminishes as the pressure increases; and
this is the case throughout the entire scale of pressures, contrary

ON THE SPECIFIC INDUCTION CONSTANTS OF MAGNETS IN MAG
 NETIC FIELDS OF DIFFERENT STRENGTHS.                    BY HILMAR SACK.
   Lamont concluded from his experiments on the changes effected
by the earth’s magnetism on the magnetism of steel bars that the
change is greater when the force acts in opposition to the pre
vious magnetization than when it strengthens it. Kohlrausch has
recently shown (Wiedemann’s Annalen, vol. xxii. p. 415, 1884)
that such a di<U+FB01>erence does not exist, at any rate not for a <U+FB01>eld of
the strength of the earth’s magnetism.
   The object of the present investigation is to ascertain within
what limits this equality of the speci<U+FB01>c induction constants holds.
The investigation in question was made at the invitation and under
the direction of Prof. Kohlrausch in the Physical Laboratory at
Wiirzburg.
   After describing in detail the method of the investigation and
the data obtained, the author summarizes the results in the
following terms :—
   As respects hardened and powerfully magnetized steel bars,—
   1. The coef<U+FB01>cients of strengthening and of enfeeblemeut as
found by F. Kohlrausch were appreciably the same for <U+FB01>elds of the
same strength as the horizontal component of the earth’s magne
tism, that is 0'2.

               Intelligence and Mscellaneous Articles.          387
   '2. This principle holds also if the magnetic <U+FB01>eld does not
exceed 1'2.
    3. If the magnetic <U+FB01>eld is stronger, then the <U+FB01>rst coef<U+FB01>cient
of enfeeblement which is due to the current on opening, <U+FB01>rst of
all exceeds the following ones obtained in the same way by but
little, but afterwards by 5 or 6 per cent., if the magnetic <U+FB01>eld is
3 or 4. Hence in order to obtain a stable value for the strength
ening and the enfeeblement with these high values, a bar magnet
 should <U+FB01>rst of all be subjected to the same strengthenings and
enfeeblements.
    4. With powerful magnetic <U+FB01>elds the <U+FB01>rst closing of the current,
if this strengthens the magnetic moment of the bar, has a greater
constant than the following ones; but it does not attain the
magnitude of the constant of enfeeblement produced by the mag
netic <U+FB01>eld on closing.
    5. Magnetizing forces, even when they are ten to twelve times
as much as the earth’s magnetism, produced no considerable
durable changes of the permanent state. Forces which were
twenty times as strong as the horizontal intensity produced un
doubted changes in the moment of the bar.—-—Wiedemann’s Annalen,

  ON THE ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY OF GASES AND VAPOURS.
                          BY M. JEAN LUVINI.
    It follows from the experiments of Becquerel, Grove, Matteucci,
Marangoni, Agostini, and others, that gases and vapours are very
bad conductors of electricity. Grove demonstrated this proposition
for air at very high pressures; Becquerel and Matteucci for very
low pressures (1 to 3 millim.). MM. Mascart and Joubert lace air
and vapours and generally all gases in the class of bad con uctors ;
and Sir W. Thomson has stated that aqueous vapour is an excellent
insulator.
   Notwithstanding this we still read in treatises on Physics, and
it is repeated in lectures, that moist air and vapours conduct
electricity; and this very serious error is the base of several
theories.
   I have made several sets of experiments on this subject, the
results of which, combined with those of other experimenters, have
led me to conclude that gases and vapours, whatever be the pressure
and temperatures, are perfect insulators, and cannot be electri<U+FB01>ed
either by friction with each other or with solids or liquids.       '
   I arrange the experiment so that the <U+FB02>uids in which the electri
<U+FB01>ed bodies are introduced cannot be deposited as liquid on the
whole length of the insulating supports. In a large room along
thread consisting of seven cocoon <U+FB01>bres, without torsion and
without joints, is stretched. In its centre is suspended a hollow

  388            Intelligence and Mscellaneous Articles.
  brass sphere 5 inches in diameter.       A second thread, similar and
  parallel to the <U+FB01>rst, supports a pith ball pendulum, which, when not
  electri<U+FB01>ed, is in contact with the brass sphere.
     I usually electrify the sphere with the conducting disk of an
  electrophorus. The extent of the room and the purity of the air
  enable me to <U+FB01>ll the space about the electri<U+FB01>ed bodies with a con
 siderable quantity of the gas or vapour which I am investigating,
 without these <U+FB02>uids settling for a time on the long thread. In
 this way, apart from the small conductivity of the wires, and the
 losses due to dust in the air, any diminution of the electrical
 tension observed must have been due to the conductivity of the
 <U+FB02>uids experimented on.
     I always electri<U+FB01>ed the sphere almost to the same tension; I
 then observed the time in which the de<U+FB02>ection fell a certain
 number of degrees, <U+FB01>rst in air and then by surrounding the sphere
 and the pendulum by a dense atmosphere of the gas to be
 studied.
    I worked thus with air saturated with aqueous vapour at various
 temperatures from 16° to 100° ; hydrogen and carbonic acid not
 dried, but as they emerge from the bath in which they are pro
duced; air heated by charcoal or by the <U+FB02>ame of a candle, the
smoke of an extinguished candle, the fumes of burnt sugar, incense,
800. None of these substances showed any trace of conductivity.
    In one set of experiments, instead of cocoon-threads I used
ordinary sewing-thread stretched horizontally, and with a double
pendulum in the centre provided with pit-h balls. The results did not
change, but when I worked with aqueous vapour at high tempe
ratures, the divergence diminished rapidly by a certain quantity
and then became again almost constant.
    This effect is due to the vapour which is deposited on the larger
and less insulating wire, and to the fact that the small quantity of
electricity of the balls becomes divided between the thread and the
balls themselves—Campus Rendus, Sept. 13.

XLVIII. 0n the Electrolysis of Silver and of Copper, and the
   Application of Electrolysis to the Standardizing of Electric
    Current- and Potential-meters. By THOMAS GRAY, B.Sc.,
   F.R.S.E.*
                           [Plate VII.]
THE following paper contains an account of a large num
      ber of experiments on Electrolysis, and on its application
to the standardizing of electrical measurin instruments, which
have been made during the past year in t e Physical Labora
tory of Glasgow University: it forms a summary of the reports
which have been from time to time made to Sir William
Thomson on the subject. The primary object of most of the
earlier experiments was to obtain the value, in absolute measure,
of the indications of ampere- and volt-meters ; but these ex
periments were always taken advantage of for the purpose of
investigating the reliability of the method under various cir
cumstances as to treatment, size of plates, density of solution,
and so on. Many of the later experiments were made specially
for the purpose of investigating points of interest suggested
by the earlier experiments. It should be borne in mind, with
regard to the conclusions put forward in this paper, that
they have not been arrived at simply as the result of the ex
periments made personally by the writer, but that he has had
the advantage of seeing the methods applied by several inde
pendent experimenters in this laboratory and of comparing the
results they obtained.
   The electrolysis of copper has for several years been occa
          " Communicated by Sir William Thomson, F.R.S.
   Phil. May. S. 5. Vol. 22. No. 138.'Nov. 1886.        2E

390               Mr. T. Gray on the Electrolysis
sionally used by Sir William Thomson as a check on the
graduation of galvanometers; but the question of its reliability
had not been systematically attacked before the series of expe
riments here described were taken up. From a number of
experiments made in the above laboratory about four years
ago, I inferred that copper was capable of giving fairly uniform
results; and I obtained as the electrochemical equivalent of
copper'003307, or as the amount of copper deposited by a
coulomb of electricity '0003307. This value has since been
found to be too high; and recent experience indicates that
there are at least two ways of explaining the discrepance—
namely, either that the measurement of the current was in
error, or that the solutions were wrongly treated. The <U+FB01>rst of
these needs no remark, it is impossible to tell now whether the
 current was measured with the needful accuracy or not ; but
 the second will be referred to at some length in this paper.
 The solutions were in that case very carefully saturated with
 copper by shaking them up with, and <U+FB01>ltering them through,
copper oxide ; and I bring the matter forward now because I
believe that treatment was a serious mistake. It is easy to
 make a solution of copper sulphate which will give as high,
and even a much higher, value for the electrochemical equiva
lent than that above stated; but once the cause of this is known,
 it is equally easy to avoid the error. In order to obtain good
 results it is necessary that the solution be distinctly acid.
The ordinary commercial copper sulphate, or the sulphate
ordinarily sold as pure, usually contains enough of acid ; but
 the same solution cannot be repeatedly used with safety.
    Followin the results of the investigations of Kohlrausch,
and of Lon? Rayleigh and Mrs. Sidgwick, the substances used
 in the earlier of the present series of experiments were pure
silver and pure silver nitrate. Sheet silver was used both for
 the gain and for the loss plates; it was supplied by Messrs.
 Johnson and Mathey as pure silver. The form of the cell
 used for the silver is illustrated in <U+FB01>g. 1 (Plate VII.); it con
 sists of a glass vessel partially <U+FB01>lled with a solution of silver
nitrate, in which three plates of silver, arranged with their
planes parallel, are suspended from spring clips of the form
illustrated in <U+FB01>gs. 2 and 3. This form of cell offers, in com
parison with the platinum-bowl method recommended by
 Poggendorif and adopted by Lord Rayleigh, some advantages
which, in my estimation, outweigh its disadvantages.           The
total weight of the plate is very small, and hence a light and
very delicate balance can be used.        The thorough polishing
and cleaning of the plates is easier than when a bowl is used.
The cleaning of the platinum bowls by dissolving off the

                      of Silver and of Copper.             ~           391
 deposit in nitric acid and the satisfactory washing of a bowl
generally is troublesome ; indeed the time spent in this ope
ration is often more valuable than if the gain plate, deposit,
and all were thrown away; while, since the deposit is pure
 silver, the depreciation in value due to cutting up the sheet
 is small. When the deposit is good it may be rolled, beaten,
or burnished down su<U+FB01>iciently to allow the plate to be again
used, and thus the operation simply means a transfer of silver
 from the anode to the cathode. Another and perhaps more
 important reason for preferring the vertical plates is the fact
that, if the plates be properly proportioned as to size and
properly prepared, the loss plate can be used with perfect ease
as a check on the result of the gain plate. This is a point of
some importance in the case of silver, where the deposit is apt
to be of such a nature that there is considerable risk of loss in
the operation of washing. There is of course the objection to
the use of vertical plates, that the density of the solution is
apt to decrease at the cathode and increase at the anode.
 Such an action does take place, and the result is a slightly
thicker deposit on the lower part of the plate, thus changing
 to a small extent the effective area; but no dif<U+FB01>culty has been
 experienced from this cause, even when the current is allowed
 to <U+FB02>ow for three or four hours, when the current and the
 solution have the densities stated below.
    In the later experiments copper has been almost exclusively
used. It is found to be very much more easily managed than
silver, and gives, over a wide range of size of plate and den
sity of solution, deposits which are perfectly adherent and
homogeneous, thus rendering it more generally convenient
where currents of a considerable variety of strength are used.
Besides, for large currents such as from 10 to 100 amperes
and upwards, the use of silver is almost excluded on account
of the expense of the necessary materials. When the highest
accuracy is required, however, and when it is used in experi
enced hands, silver is decidedly superior to copper. It pre
sents hardly any of the uncertainties which, as will be pointed
out below, it is absolutely necessary to guard against in the
case of copper ; but the fact must not be lost sight of that an
expertness in manipulation and a degree of care are required
which cannot always be obtained.
    The objections which have been brought against the use of
copper are its readiness to oxidize in the air, especially if
moisture be resent, and the fact that it loses weight in the
liquid“. Bot of these are of course legitimate objections,
   ' See a paper by G. Gore, LL.D., F.R.S., ‘Nature,’ March 16, 1882;
and Lord Rayleigh and Mrs. Sidggvi<U+FB01>lk,2Trans. Roy. Soc. 1884, pp. 411-460.

 392                Mr. T. Gray on the Electrolysis
 and more might easily be added; hence the point to be de
 cided is whether the oxidation and loss in the solution can be
 avoided or their effects eliminated. As the result of a good
 deal of experience, it appears to me that the <U+FB01>rst objection is
 of very little weight indeed, as the plate need not be sensibly
 oxidized in the process of washing and drying if even ordinary
 care is taken in the operation. The loss by corrosion in the
 liquid leads to results which depend to some extent on the size
  of the plate and the temperature of the solution ; and a reat
 many experiments have been made on the effect this mayiave
  on the apparent value of the electrochemical equivalent in dif
 ferent cases. Examples of such experiments are given below,
 and they are there discussed more in detail; but it may be
  stated here that the efi'ect can be fairly well allowed for if
 the size of the plate and the strength of the current, as well
 as the state of the solution, are known.     The error due to this
 cause need never exceed a tenth per cent., and will generally
 be considerably less than that.
     It appears from experiments on the loss of copper in solu
 tions of' sulphate of copper, that a strong solution of normal
 pure sulphate is at ordinary atmospheric temperature even
 more active in dissolving copper than the same solution when
 as much as 5 per cent. of acid has been added ; but that in the
 use of the normal solution there is a danger that the presence
 of the copper plates in the cell may render the solution satu
 rated with copper, after which a rapid oxidizing action takes
 place which invariably causes the gain of weight in an electro
 lysis experiment to be too great. The deposit in such a case is
 of a darker colour than when the solution is kept suf<U+FB01>ciently
 acid; and indeed a bad plate can generally be detected by
 simple inspection, but it is well always to add such a quantity
of acid (a very little is suf<U+FB01>cient) as will prevent any un
certainty on the subject.
    Electrolytic Cells—Some of the arrangements which have
been found convenient for the electrolytic cells are illustrated
in <U+FB01>gs. 1 to 6. They consist, in the smaller sizes, of round
glasses into which three plates, arranged with their planes
parallel and about one centimetre apart, are held by means of
clips of stiff' platinoid or brass wire of the form shown in <U+FB01>gs.
2 and 3. The outer clips are connected together by a cross
piece, a (<U+FB01>g. 1), at the top, but are insulated from the middle
clip by a block of vulcanite, <U+FB01>xed in the cross piece, 6, into
which they are all tightly <U+FB01>tted. These clips are very con
venient, and are easily made by taking a piece of stiff wire,
bending it nearly close at its middle point, then winding each
half two or three times round a rod of metal of suitable size

                      of Silver and of Copper.                 393
so as to form the springs, and after bending the two ends
together soldering them to a stiff back-piece, as shown ; care
must be taken that the spring front presses <U+FB01>rmly on the back
before the two are soldered together. Several sets of clips
are <U+FB01>tted into one cross piece b, so that one frame may serve
for one or more cells, the double clips of any one set being
connected permanently to the single clip of the next set.
When the plates are being placed in the clips, the cross piece
which holds them is lifted off the frame and the plates placed
in position, the jaws of the clip being opened before the plate
is introduced. Care is also taken to open the jaws of the clip
before removing the plate, so as to obviate any risk of loss of
metal by friction between the holding-points and the plate.
This arrangement has been found very convenient for small
cells, as it allows the plates to be quickly and almost simulta
neously placed in, and removed from, the liquid, and avoids
all risk of the plates touching each other or the sides of the
vessel; but for cells to be used with currents of over 10 am
peres the plates become rather too large, and the arrangement
shown in <U+FB01>gs. 4 to 6 is then found more convenient. In this
form a frame of insulating material is <U+FB01>tted to the top of the
cell, and two sets of spring-contact clips, one set on each of
two opposite sides of the cell, are <U+FB01>xed to it. These clips
may be of the form just described, or they may be simply <U+FB01>at
strips of springy metal soldered to a stiff base piece, as in
<U+FB01>g. 5, in such a way that they press <U+FB01>rmly against each other.
In the use of this form of cell the anode plates are placed in
contact with one set of clips and the cathode plates with the
other set, the number of anodes being always one greater than
the number of cathodes. The form of the plates and the mode
of placing them in the cells are illustrated in <U+FB01>gs. 4 and 6,
from which it will be seen that the surface of the plate above
the liquid is made as small as possible by cutting away the
plate so as to leave two narrow strips connected to a cross
piece, 0, d. The end a of the cross piece is held in the con
tact clip, while the other end, d, is kept in position by a shallow
notch in the insulating rim. The insulating frame and
attached clips are simply laid on the top of the vessel, and
can therefore be lifted off and cleaned so as to insure perfect
insulation.
   Sizes of Plates and Densities of Solutions.——The size of the
plate can be varied within moderate limits in the case of
silver, and Within very wide limits in the case of copper,
 without greatly interfering with the quality of the deposit.
 In the case of silver and silver nitrate the effect of making
the plate either too small or too large is, as has been pointed

394               Mr. T. Gray on the Electrolysis
out by Lord Rayleigh, to make the deposit less adherent and
more roughly crystalline. There is then a tendency for the
 deposit to row out from the cathode towards the anode in
long branc -like crystals. This tendency is increased by
 any sharp corner on the cathode-plates, and hence care
must be taken to round the corners and smooth the edges
thoroughly. The deposit also deteriorates as time goes on in
consequence of the crystals presenting sharp protuberances,
which tend to grow and become more and more prominent.
It follows that a somewhat smaller plate or greater density of
current can be used if the time be short; but I have generally
found that when the density of the current is such that the
deposit would deteriorate greatly during the <U+FB01>rst two or three
hours, the adhesion to the plate is likely to be uncertain.
The best results seem to be obtained with a solution contain
ing about <U+FB01>ve per cent. by weight of nitrate of silver, and
cathode-plates which present an area of not less than 200 nor
more than 600 square centimetres per ampere of current. If
this strength of solution and size of plate be used and the
plates be properly cleaned, the deposit is very compact and
<U+FB01>nely crystalline, and adheres very <U+FB01>rmly to the surface of
the plate. When the strength of the solution is increased the
size of the plate can be slightly diminished, but not by any
means in the proportion of the increased quantity of silver in
the solution; the deposit is then more roughly crystalline, will
not bear lengthened application of the current, and adheres
much less <U+FB01>rmly to the plate. So far as these experiments
have gone, it seems a mistake to use a solution containing
more than, or even as much as, ten per cent. of silver nitrate.
Solutions containing from three to thirty per cent. have been
repeatedly tried; but the best results have always been obtained
with solutions containing from four to ten per cent. There
seems no reason for using strong solutions except a slight
difference in the original cost of the plates; but as these may
be of very thin metal, the cost is a small matter compared
with the risk of either total or partial failure of the experiment.
   When the loss or anode-plates are to be used simply to
supply silver to the solution, they need not be larger than the
giiin or cathode-plates; and there is some advantage in making
t em smaller, so as to increase the distance of the edges of the
cathodes from those of the anodes. When the plates are
small the surface becomes very soft and spongy, and if the
density of the current exceed a certain moderate amount they
will blacken, and the resistance of the cell is apt to become
variable, due to the liberation of gases. It is better to make
the anodes a good deal larger than the cathodes, because in

                     of Silver and 0f Copper.                    39!)
that case the surface of the plate remains bright and moder
ately hard, so that the plate can be washed and weighed if
that be thought necessary. The density of the current at the
anode should not exceed one ampere to 400 square centimetres
of surface, and should be even less if the plates are to be weighed.
The action of the current in causing the solution of the anode
is somewhat curious, especially if the plates be made of rolled
sheet. If the plates be simply washed and placed in the cell
with the bright polished surface still on them, it is seldom that
the outside skin will be dissolved. The silver is taken from
the interior of the plate, leaving a very thin skin lying loose
on the surface, which is ready to fall off either when the plates
are lifted out of the cell or when they are placed in water for
the purpose of washing. Whether this is due to the mecha
nical state of the silver on the surface or to a peculiar dif<U+FB01>culty
in so cleaning the surface of the plate that it is properly
wetted by the liquid, is not yet quite clear. A plate of silver
when repeatedly used for an anode becomes soft and almost
devoid of elasticity, due to the solvent action taking place
deep into the interior of the plate ; and it is well to heat the»
plates to about a red heat in a spirit <U+FB02>ame between diH'erent
experiments, so as to keep it hard and prevent loss of silver.
   In the case of copper and copper sulphate, the size of the
plate may be almost anything from twenty square centimetres
to the ampere upwards; but for experiments which are to be
continued for two or three hours, the cathode-plate should
present about <U+FB01>fty square centimetres of surface per ampere
of current. With plates of from this size upwards the cur
rent may be allowed to <U+FB02>ow for almost any length of time
without introducing the least dif<U+FB01>culty as to loss of copper in
the subsequent washing. At the higher limit of current
density here mentioned (one <U+FB01>ftieth of an ampere per square
centimetre), there is a slight tendency for the deposit to thicken
at the edges of the plate and become rough, but as the current
density diminishes this becomes less and less marked. It may
be taken as certain that the aggregation of the deposit at the
edges of the plate is due to the current~density becoming too
great at the sharp edges, and thus causing the formation of
sharp crystals, which in their turn intensify the action. If
the plates are made large enough, this critical current-density
is never reached, and the deposit is as smooth on the edges as
elsewhere. It is mainly in the ease with which a perfectly
uniform and solid deposit can be obtained that the great
advantage of copper over silver for ordinary use in electro
lytic measurements lies.                           _
   The anodes in the copper cell behave in a similar manner to

 396              Mr. T. Gray on the Electrolysis
 that above described for the silver anodes, with the exception
 that they show no tendency to become soft and inelastic. If
 the current-density at the anode exceed the fortieth of an
 ampere per square centimetre, the current is apt to be variable
 and may almost stop completely, even when an electromotive
 force of 25 volts is used to produce it*. This is due to excessive
 resistance at the surface of the anode. In some cases the
 current will, after a few minutes, resume nearly its former
 strength, and gases are then freely given off at the anode.
 When the current-densityis small, from the two-hundredth of
 an ampere per square centimetre downwards, the plate can
 generally be washed, and used to show the loss of copper during
 the passage of the current. This loss does not in any case agree
 with the gain on the cathode, in consequence of the solution
 taking up copper during the experiment; some examples of the
 results which have been obtained, and some further remarks on
 this subject are given below. In almost all cases there remains
 on the surface of the anode more or less of a very <U+FB01>ne brown
 powder, which increases in amount as the current-density is
 increased, and which also seems to depend somewhat on the
 nature of the plate. If, for example, a plate of electrotype
 copper be used, the surface will be found to have become a
 dark red when the plate is removed from the cell, but no loose
 copper will be found. That is certainly the case at least so
 long as the current-density does not exceed the one hundred
 and <U+FB01>ftieth of an ampere per square centimetre. Currents of
 greater density were not tried with electrotype copper. This
 result seems to point either to the mechanical state of the
 copper in the rolled sheet, or the presence of a somewhat in
 soluble oxide, as the cause of the loose powder being left on
 the plate. Local action, due to unequal quality of the plate
 itself, may have something to do with it; it is certainly greatly
 increased by frequent reversals of the current in the cell.
    The effect of varying the density of the solution of copper
 sulphate is not great until the density falls to about 1'05, when
 the deposit begins to be less adherent.        There is, however,
 greater danger of error due to oxidatiOn of the deposit in
 weak than in strong solutions, when no acid is added, owing
 to the fact that the solution becomes more quickly saturated
 with copper.     Any density between 1 and 1'18 will be found
 to answer perfectly, but it is not advisable to use a saturated
 solution because there is then a risk of crystals forming on
,the plates.
    Preparation of Plates.—In all experiments on electrolysis
 the proper treatment of the plates previous to their immersion
 in the liquid is a most important consideration. The treat
                        ' See note on page 413.

                     of Silver and of Copper.                 397
ment which I have found to give the best results with silver
is extremely simple. Suppose a new sheet of silver is to be
used either for a cathode or anode—<U+FB01>rst make the corners and
the edges round and smooth, and then polish the surface
thoroughly with a soft clean pad, water, and <U+FB01>ne silver sand,
so as to remove the skin which has been in contact with the
rolls in the manufacture; rinse the plate in clean water, or
by holding it in a rapid stream of clean water from a water
tap, so as to remove the sand, and then wash it <U+FB01>rst with clean
soap and water and afterwards with clean water; next place
it for a few minutes in a boiling solution of cyanide of potas
sium, and after that wash it thoroughly in a stream of clean
water, taking care not to touch the part of the surface which
is to receive the deposit with anything. If the surface of
the plate be touched with the <U+FB01>ngers, even when they appear
to be clean, the markings of the skin will be reproduced by
the deposit leaving the parts of the plate bare which were in
contact with it. The plate may be dried either in a current
of dry air in front of a bright <U+FB01>re, or in any other convenient
manner which will insure that the surface of the plate will
remain clean, and then accurately weighed. One point about
weighing should be mentioned, because it is apt to be over
looked, that is, that the plate must be allowed to assume the
temperature of the air before it is weighed, as even a very
slight difference of temperature between the plate and the air
 inside the case of the balance is suf<U+FB01>cient to produce quite a.
 sensible error in the weight.
    For the preparation of copper-plates a very good plan,
 especially with large plates and powerful currents, where it
 is necessary to arrange the resistance of the circuit carefully
 when the electrolytic cell is included, is, after the edges and
 corners of the plates have been well smoothed and rounded,
 to proceed as follows :—Polish the plate thoroughly with
 silver sand, wash the sand off by holding the plate in a rapid
 stream of water and rubbing it with a brush or a piece of
 clean cloth ; place the plate in the cell, as a trial plate, and
 deposit a thin coating of copper over it, at the same time
 adjusting the current to the proper strength; then remove
 the plate, wash it in clean water, and dry it, <U+FB01>rst in a clean
 blotting-pad, and then before the <U+FB01>re, taking care not to heat
 the plate sensibly. If the plate has not been properly cleaned,
 the deposit of copper will show any defect; and if it be found
 to be perfect, the plate may be weighed and the electrolysis
  continued. For small currents it is more convenient to use
 a battery of moderately high potential, say twenty or thirty
 volts, and to keep a resistance in circuit with the cells; and in

 '398              Mr. T. Gray on the Electrolysis
  this case it is not necessary, after the <U+FB01>rst trial at least, to
 adjust the current with the plates in position, as the resistance
  of the cells can be nearly enough allowed for. In these cases
  the plates were simply polished either with silver sand and
  water or with clean sand-paper, then washed in clean water
 to remove the sand, placed in water slightly acidulated with
 sulphuric acid for a short time so as to remove any trace of
 oxide, then rinsed in clean water, and dried <U+FB01>rst in clean
 blotting-paper and afterwards in front of the <U+FB01>re or over a
 spirit-<U+FB02>ame. If the plate be thickly oxidized on the surface
 but otherwise clean, as is often the case with new sheet
 copper, the quickest mode of cleaning is to wet the plates and
 then place them for a few seconds in strong nitric acid, rinsing
 them immediately afterwards in clean water, and putting
 them into water containing a few drops of sulphuric acid to
 prevent oxidation. The plates may then be lifted one by one
 out of the acidulated water, rinsed in clean water, and dried
 in the manner above described.
    The method of drying here recommended is important, as
 the blotting-pad removes almost at once nearly the whole of
 the water, and hence the drying can be completed in a few
 seconds, either in front of a <U+FB01>re or over a spirit-<U+FB02>ame, with
 out the slightest oxidation taking place. A plate may be
 washed and dried in this manner over and over again without
producing as much as the tenth of a milligramme of difference
in its weight.
     Washing the Deposit.—The operation of washing the de
 posit at the conclusion of the electrolysis is one on the im
portance of care in which Lord Rayleigh has laid great stress.
 The method adopted for silver in these experiments was to
lift the bar 1) (<U+FB01>g. 1) with the plates attached, and either to
dip them several times in clean distilled water contained in
a clean glass vessel before removing them from the clips, or
to remove them as quickly as possible from the clips, and dip
them several times one by one into the water; in either case
observing carefully whether any small crystals were removed
in the operation.    If there is danger of loss of silver from the
anodes, it is better to remove the plates from the clips before
they are dipped in the water. After this preliminary rinsing
to wash off the greater part of the silver nitrate solution, the
plates were laid in the bottom of a shallow glass tray con
taining distilled water, and the water made to <U+FB02>ow backwards
and forwards over them for a minute or two by raising and
lowering one edge of the tray.        The plates were then re
moved and placed in another similar tray containing clean,
but not necessarily distilled, water, washed in a similar

                    qf Silver and of Copper.                 399
manner, and allowed to soak for about <U+FB01>fteen minutes before
being dried. It is important to bear in mind that the water
used for the <U+FB01>rst rinsing and washing must be clean water
which has been recently distilled, and which has not had an
opportunity of absorbing any impurity, such, for example, as
a minute quantity of common salt, by coming in contact with
anything which has not been recently and thoroughly
cleaned. The water supplied by the Glasgow Corporation for
domestic purposes, although very nearly pure, clouds imme
diately on contact with silver nitrate, and throws down a con
siderable precipitate of silver chloride, no doubt due to the
fact that the water contains an appreciable percentage of
chlorides in solution. A plate which has been insuf<U+FB01>ciently
washed will generally want brightness when dried, and will
assume a somewhat brighter appearance and be found to lose
slightly in weight if heated to redness. The comparatively
simple washing indicated above will generally be found suf
<U+FB01>cient, and the plate may be heated without any sensible loss
of weight; but it is well not to continue the electrolysis so
long as to put a very thick coating of crystals on the plate,
as this increases the dif<U+FB01>culty in washing and gives no cor—
responding increase in accuracy from any other source.
   The plates were dried by heating the end of the plate in a
spirit-<U+FB02>ame, the greater part of the water havin been pre
viously drained off by holding one corner of t e plate in
contact with a pad of blotting-paper.
   The washing of the copper deposit requires much less care
because, if the plate is large enough for the current, it is
almost impossible by any ordinary washing to remove copper
from the plate. The deposit is solid copper, and may be
handled like any other piece of metal without risk of loss.
One thing, however, must be attended to, and that is that the
plate be not exposed to the air for a longer time than is ab
solutely necessary before the copper sulphate solution has
been completely washed off. The reason for this is that a
copper plate oxidizes very rapidly when wet with a solution
of nearly neutral copper sulphate and exposed to the air.
   The plates should be removed from the solution and at
once dipped two or three times into clean water (it need not
be distilled), containing two or three drops of sulphuric
acid to the litre, and then laid in a tray containing similar
water, and washed in the manner above described for the
silver plates. The plates may then be lifted out of the acid
water, rinsed in clean water containing no acid, and dried,
<U+FB01>rst in a pad of clean white blotting-paper, and afterwards in
front of the <U+FB01>re, or, if the plates be small, over a spirit~<U+FB02>ame.

 400               Mr. T. Gray on the Electrolysis
 No copper will be left on the blotting-paper, and no oxidation
 will take place if the deposit is of average quality. If the
plate has been too small for the current, the drying in the
  lotting-paper may have to be omitted; and in that case it
 will be found advantageous to dip the plate in alcohol or
other before drying, as it then dries more quickly and is less
likely to be oxidized. The plate should never be raised to a
temperature so high that it cannot be held comfortably in the
 <U+FB01>ngers, and evaporation should be, if possible, promoted by
holding it in a rapid current of dry air. This latter treat
ment is that best suited for the loss plates, as they can
seldom be placed in a blotting-pad without removing copper;
after a little practice, however, it is not dif<U+FB01>cult to dry with
out oxidizing them ; at the same time it does not seem
advisable to make use of the loss plates for ordinary
purposes.
    Loss of Weight in the Solution—A number of ex—
periments were made on the effect of leaving silver plates
in solutions of silver nitrate, and copper plates in solutions
of copper sulphate, for the purpose of <U+FB01>nding the rate of loss
of weight in these circumstances. The solutions of silver
nitrate contained from <U+FB01>ve to thirty per cent. of the salt, and
were in all cases pure with no acid added. The plates were
pure silver sheet. There was no appreciable change of weight.
The solutions of copper sulphate varied in density from 1'2
to 1'05, and were partly made from pure copper sulphate and
distilled water with no acid added, and partly from this solu
tion with from one to twenty per cent. of ordinary commercial
sulphuric acid added. The copper plates were in some of the
experiments ordinary “high conductivity ” sheet copper, and
in others thin sheet copper thickly covered with electrotype
copper. The results were generally somewhat irregular, but
they all showed a considerable loss of copper from the plate
to the solution *.
    The results of a series of weighings of plates of ordinary
copper sheet which were immersed in solutions of copper
sulphate of varying density and acidity for a period extending
in the aggregate to about seventy-one days are given in
   * Dr. Gore, in the paper above quoted, describes experiments on this
subject made by him bot on the loss of co per in an acid solution of the
sulphate, and on the loss of the anode and cathode plates in a copper
copper-sulphate electrol ic cell. Some of the results there given are in
agreement with the resu ts of my experience as given below—for example,
the advisability of using high current-density for the measurement of
the electrochemical equivalent; but the statement made to the effect that
a copper anode loses less by direct chemical action when the current is
<U+FB02>owmg than when it is not, is not borne out by my experiments.

                     qf Silver and of Copper.               401
Table 1., and are illustrated in the curves 1—12. The head
ings of the Table sufficiently explain the meaning of the
different columns. The ordinates of the curves show the rate
of loss of copper in hundred thousandths of a gramme per
square centimetre of surface per hour. A glance at the
Table, or at the curves, is sufficient to show how very variable
the loss was, and also that it seldom exceeds the two hundredth
of a milligramme per square centimetre per hour. For a plate
of <U+FB01>fty square centimetres surface this would amount to a
quarter of a milligramme, and the copper which may be de—
posited on this surface in the same time is, if <U+FB01>fty square
centimetres to the ampere be chosen, about 1'2 gramme.
Hence if the action be nearly the same during the passage of
the current as when no current is passing, the error will
amount to about one in three thousand. The actual difference,
as will appear from the results discussed below, is greater
than this, which seems to indicate a more rapid corrosion of
the copper by the liquid when the current is <U+FB02>owing, a result
agreeing with those obtained by Gore.
   The rate of loss, as shown by the results given in Table 1.,
is at <U+FB01>rst greater in the dense than in the weak solutions,
but seems to reach a minimum between the density 1'10
and 1'15, a result which was con<U+FB01>rmed by other experiments,
extending over shorter intervals. The loss, however, although
never great, is somewhat variable, and it is dif<U+FB01>cult to make
 out anything with certainty, unless a very much larger num
ber of experiments are made. The effect of adding acid to
the solution seems not to be great when the solution is dense,
 and seems, for densities between 1'15 and 1'10, rather to
 retard than to accelerate the action.
   The result of subsequent experiments, made with saturated
solutions containing different quantities of acid up to twenty
per cent., and electrotype copper plates, showed that the
effect of the addition of acid on the rate of corrosion was to
diminish the rate of loss under these circumstances.
   Perhaps the most interesting part of this series of results
is that which gives the behaviour of the plates in the solutions
to which no acid was added. The <U+FB01>rst action is a corrosion
of the plate, but after a sufficient time has elapsed the corro
sion ceases and the plates rapidly gain weight by oxidation.
This action goes on until the plates are nearly completely
covered with brown oxide, after which the weight remains
nearly constant for a few days. Another change then takes
place, the plates begin again to increase in weight rapidly,
and on examination it is found that they have now begun to
form hydrated oxide. This action continues until the plates

          On the Electrolysis of Silver and of Copper.      403
have become completely coated with a thick green coating,
when it gradually ceases. All the phases of this action are
illustrated in curves 1 and 4 ; the <U+FB01>rst part, namely the loss
of weight at the beginning, is not shown in curves 7 and 10,
as the plates had already gained weight before the <U+FB01>rst
weighings were made.
    Electro-chemioal Equivalent of Siloer.—Some preliminary
experiments were made on this subject, but owin to faults
being discovered in the standard galvanometer t e experi
ment was put aside and has not yet been resumed. The <U+FB01>rst
trouble that was experienced with the galvanometer is per
haps worth recording here. It was a new instrument of the
sine type, made almost wholly of brass, and had a short
needle suspended at the centre of the coil, and a light index
enclosed in a long rectangular box, the sides of which were
 made of thin brass, and the top and bottom of glass. The
 coil was forty centimetres in diameter, and consisted of one
 layer of silk-covered copper wire containing seventy turns,
 making up a breadth of about <U+FB01>ve centimetres. The constant
 of a second and more convenient instrument, of high sensi
 bility, was determined by comparison with the sine galva
 nometer, and then used in accordance with the method
 described below for measuring the current passing through
 two silver-silver-nitrate electrolytic cells arranged in series.
 The magnetic <U+FB01>eld at the needle of this auxiliary galvano
 meter was produced by permanent magnets, and was so in
 tense as to be hardly at all, certainly not to the extent of
 nlwth per cent., in<U+FB02>uenced by variations of the Earth’s
 magnetism. In the <U+FB01>rst three trials the constant of the
 second galvanometer was such that the current produced a
 de<U+FB02>ection of about 20° 0n the sine galvanometer, an angle
 which could be measured with a fair amount of accuracy, but
 which of course did not take full advantage of the sine prin
 ciple.   These three measurements each gave the same result,
 namely '0011185 gramme as the amount of silver deposited
 by a coulomb of electricity. The constant of the second gal
 .vanometer was then changed so as to give a de<U+FB02>ection of
 about 40° on the sine galvanometer, and then a difference
 amounting to about one sixth per cent. was discovered be
  tween the value now obtained and that previously got for
  silver. This seemed to indicate a departure from the law of
 sines, and suggested, as almost the only possible explanation,
  magnetic brass. A small Bottomley’s re<U+FB02>ecting—magneto
  meter was then set up, and the magnetic <U+FB01>eld at its needle
 made almost zero by means of a permanent magnet. The
 brass box enclosing the needle was unscrewed and, the needle

404             Mr. T. Gray on the Electrolysis
having been taken out, the box was brought up close to the
back of the magnetometer. It was then found to have several
magnetic poles, but particularly a north pole on one side and
a south pole on the other side of the position where the gal
vanometer-needle was suspended. This polarity, although
sensible enough to the test here made, was so small that it
could not be detected with certainty by a magnetometer
placed in the Earth’s <U+FB01>eld. The frame of the galvanometer
coil when tested in a similar manner showed signs just per—
ceptible of magnetism, but so small as to produce no sensible
effect on the indications of the instrument.
   The brass case was then replaced by a glass cell, and two
other measurements taken with de<U+FB02>ections of about 40° and
 60° respectively, the results obtained being “0011183 and
'0011182; but on continuing the experiment the indications
of the galvanometer were found to have become uncertain,
due apparently to some defect in the insulation, which has
not yet been investigated. The results so far as they go seem
to con<U+FB01>rm the value given by Kohlrausch and Lord Rayleigh
as closely as could be expected, but no great value can be put
upon them. In subsequent work the value '001118 was
assumed to be suf<U+FB01>ciently accurate for our purpose.
   RATIO OF SILVER T0 COPPER—A number of experiments
were made for the purpose of determining the ratio of the
electro-chemical equivalents of silver and copper.                     These
involved the determination of the effect of density of solution,
the effect of repeated use of the same solution, and the effect
of current-density.
   E<U+FB01>'ect of Density.—The effect of changing the density of
the solution was only gone into suf<U+FB01>ciently to show that no
important error is likely to arise from this cause. The re
sults of two experiments are given in Table II.                They show
a slightly smaller deposit from weak than from strong solu
tions; but the absolute difference of weight, only a <U+FB01>fth of a.
milligramme, if the somewhat doubtful result from the weakest
solution be omitted, is too small to found any conclusion upon.

   The number '3512 has a note against it in my notebook
stating that copper was lost in the washing, and generally
that the deposits from solutions of this density are unsatis
factory with this size of plate and strength of current.       It
would appear, therefore, that the last line of the table should
be struck out, but, as there is no note against the <U+FB01>rst result,
I have quoted the complete numbers in both cases.
   Eject of Acidity—In the <U+FB01>rst experiments made on the
relative value of the electrochemical equivalents of copper and
silver the solution was made with pure sulphate of copper
which had been supplied by Burgoyne Burbidges and Co. as
very free from acid. The results obtained were at <U+FB01>rst very
puzzling, the gain of weight being generally greater than the
loss and very irregular.    They are given in Table III., from
which the general nature of the result will be readily gathered.
   The ratio of the equivalents of copper and silver are
not given in the table. They may be calculated from the
results given; but as the early results are of no value for this
purpose, and the area of the plate has not been recorded for
the later ones, it has been thought unnecessary to give them.
   The results with the nearly neutral copper sulphate were
invariably too high, and this excess of weight was increased
by leaving a copper plate in the solution. Repeated use of
a solution which has been supersaturated with copper by
leaving a copper plate in it seems to bring the solution back
towards its normal state.
    The addition of a very small percentage of acid causes
different solutions to give perfectly accordant results.
    One possible explanation of the peculiar action of the
neutral solution sug ested itself, namely the formation of
subsalts of copper w en the solution was placed in contact
with metallic copper, the subsalt giving twice as much copper
as the ordinary sulphate. The real explanation is, however,
 I believe, the oxidation of the deposit while in the electro
lytic cell. In one or two cases the deposit was hammered so
as to se arate it from the sheet, and it was then found that
the back of the deposit obtained with the neutral solution
and the surface of the plate were completely oxidized, while
those from the acid solution were bright.
    Some further experiments were made with various speci
 mens of copper sulphate, some of them obtained in Glasgow
 and others in London, with the view of <U+FB01>nding whether any
 difference might arise due to a change from one sample of
 sulphate to another. These need not be quoted in detail, the
 result being entirely negative. Precisely the same gain of
 weight was obtained from a solution of the ordinary com

ratio for t 0 two current-densities here used are '2940 and

   The results given in Table IV. indicate a slightly reater
difference between the results obtained with a current-rfensity
of a fiftieth of an ampere and those obtained with a two
hundred and fortieth of an ampere per square centimetre of

                     of Silver and of Copper.                    409
the cathode; but both sets agree in indicating rather less than
a tenth per cent. as the correction which has to be added to
the results obtained with the denser of these currents, in order
to arrive at the true value of the electro-chemical equivalent
of copper.
   The results of Table IV. give for the amount of copper
deposited by a coulomb of electricity, when the cathodes ex
pose a surface of <U+FB01>fty square centimetres to the ampere,
'0003287 gramme, if we assume '001118 as the correspond
in number for silver. They would thus indicate a value not
di ering much from '0003290 as the true value of this con
stant for cop er.     In the use of copper for the measurement
of currents y electrolysis the absolute value of this latter
number is not of much importance; what is wanted is the
proper number to use for a certain current-density, and at
ordinary temperature this number will not differ much from
the number obtained by using '0003287 for cathodes of <U+FB01>fty
square centimetres per ampere, and correcting for other sizes
by the dotted line in curve 13.
   A few experiments were made with very weak current
deusities, the circuit being ke tclosed for about a week in
each. case. The results show t at when the current-density is
very small the rate of loss by direct action of the liquid is
much the same as if no current were <U+FB02>owing. The deposit
was patchy and did not usually cover all the surface of the
plate, a result which was perhaps due to inequalities in the
plate itself.

in the same liquid when no current is <U+FB02>owing, a result which
appears to be largely contributed to by the anode-plates losing
very much more when the current is <U+FB02>owing than when it is
not. If the difference between the gain and loss be divided
by the sum of the areas of the anodes and cathodes, and the
quotient, multiplied by the area of the cathode, be added to
the gain, a result is obtained which is alwa s too high to give
the true electro-chemical equivalent, but w ich is very nearly
constant for ditferent cells, even when they begin to give
uncertain results from the gain of weight taken by itself.
   Arrangement of the Circuit—For ex eriments with weak
currents, such as those the results of w ich are given in the
Tables II. to V., the circuit generally included a. batte         of
twenty-four tray cells, the electrolytic cells, one of Sir Wil iam
Thomson’s improved rheostats, and a galvanometer. The
 alvanometer was in some of the earlier experiments one of
   omson’s lever voltmeters, but in the later experiments one

410               Mr. T. Gray on the Electrolysis
of his “school galvanometers” arranged so as to have a
“false zero,” and having its needle suspended in a strong
<U+FB01>eld produced by permanent magnets, was used.          An ordinarv
index galvanometer when arranged in this way, with its zero well
off the scale, gives ample sensibility, and is very compact and
convenient. The current was adjusted by the rheostat until
the index was exactly over a division of the scale, and it was
kept there by turning the rheostat, if the current varied, all
through the experiment.
    Standardizing Arrangements.— The arrangement of the
apparatus for standardizing instruments intended to measure
strong currents such as dew and heeto ampere-metres is shown
in <U+FB01>gure 7, which mayr be taken as a plan of the arrangements
 on the top of the standardizing table, with the exception that
 the alvanometer G is, for convenience in the <U+FB01>gure, shown
 much too close to the conductors. On one end of the table
 six of the Electric-Power Storage Company’s accumulators are
 arranged, and connected by means of thick copper rods to a
 mercury-cup commutator as shown. The mercury cups m are
 shown joined across by bridges which are of thick copper in such
 a way that the cells are in series, but for most purposes these are
 removed and the cells joined in parallel by means of two rods of
 copper, provided with teeth at the proper distances apart to <U+FB01>t
 into the cups m, and thus join all in each row together. The
 battery, when fully charged and oined in this way, is capable of
 maintaining a current of two hundred amperes for ten hours.
 The commutator is joined by means of two copper rods r, r,
 to a distributing board A, by means of which one or more
 instruments can be put in the same circuit. In the arrange
 ment shown, a set of conductivity-bridges D and a rheostat
 R are introduced between the cups 1 and 2; a galvanometer
  G between the cups 4 and 5 ; a pair of large electrolytic cells,
 joined together by means of armoveable cup M, between the
 cups 6 and 7; and an electric-current balance between 11 and
  12. The arrangement here shown, together with details of
 the conductivities D and the rheostat R, will be found
 described by Sir William Thomson in a recent patent speci<U+FB01>~
  cation. The following description will give a general idea. of
 the apparatus and the mode of using it.
    A perspective sketch of two of the conductivity-bridges D
 is given in <U+FB01>gure 8, where one that is in the circuit is shown
 standing in the mercury troughs t, t, and another insulated.
 These conductivity-bridges consist of U-shaped pieces of plati
 noid rod or wire according to the conductivity required. The
 thick rods are bent into shape and the two limbs held at the
 proper distance apart by wooden blocks, while the thin wires are

                    of Silver and of Copper.                  411
supported all along their length by a strip of wood. The length
of rod in each U must of course be suf<U+FB01>cient for the metal not
to become much heated by the potential of cell, one or two volts;
the length actually used in the apparatus is four metres. The
troughs tare partially <U+FB01>lled with mercury and have thick copper
bottoms, against which the ends of the lantinoid rods press
by their own weight. The thin wires have thick terminal
pieces <U+FB01>xed to the wooden strips for this purpose. The con
ductivities of the different bridges, beginning at the end t, t,
<U+FB01>g. 7, are graduated so as to be nearly in the ratio 1, 1, 2, 4,
8, 16, &c.; so that any conductivity between the highest and
the lowest can be put in by steps equal to the lowest conduc
tivity in the set.   To bridge over these steps and thus make
the variation from the highest to the lowest perfectly con
tinuous,‘the rheostat R, which has a minimum conductivity
somewhat less than the lowest of the bridges, is introduced
and forms in fact another bridge which can be readily varied.
The wire of this rheostat is formed of a strand of <U+FB01>ne copper
wires, and is capable of carrying a current of ten amperes.
   The galvanometer G and the current-balance B may be of
any form which it is desired to standardize ; they are simply
put into the <U+FB01>gure by way of illustration. The electrolytic
cells E are rectangular earthenware vessels <U+FB01>tted in the
manner illustrated in <U+FB01>gs. 4—6, and described on page 392,
above. The larger of these cells is <U+FB01>tted to receive plates
the aggregate surface of which is suf<U+FB01>cient for two hundred
amperes, but when the current to be measured is smaller the
plates are not all introduced. In this cell the plates are so
large that there is considerable danger of their touching each
other when they are left freely suspended in the liquid, and
hence two U’s of thin glass rod are hung over each of the
anode plates, so as to keep the cathodes from touching them.
The small cell is convenient for currents of from 5 to 25
amperes.
   All these operations connected with the treatment of the
plates for these cells‘lhave been already described, and hence
it only remains to indicate how the apparatus is generally
used for standardizing instruments. Suppose, for example, a
current-balance is to be standardized, and that it is known, by
preliminary trials or by comparison with another instrument,
to require about <U+FB01>fty amperes to bring its index to the zero
mark when a certain weight is put on the beam. Arrange
the electrolytic cell so that the cathode plates expose a surface
of about twenty-<U+FB01>ve hundred square centimetres, and join up
as shown in the diagram, <U+FB01>g. 7, putting a bridge across from
4 to 5. Introduce conductivity into I) until the index of the

 412              Mr. T. Gray on the Electrolysis
 balance comes nearly to zero, and then adjust by the rheostat.
 Leaving everything in position, break the circuit and take
 out the cathode plates, wash, dry, and weigh them, in the
 manner already described. Again put the plates in the cell,
 and observing the time carefully on an accurate time-keeper,
 close the circuit. The current will at once assume almost the
 exact strength, and what little deviation there may be can be
 adjusted in a second or two by the rheostat. From <U+FB01>ve to
 ten seconds usually suf<U+FB01>ces to bring the current accurately
 to the proper strength, and the electrolysis is as a rule con
 tinued for an hour. NOW suppose the average error during ten
 seconds amounts to as much as <U+FB01>ve per cent., the error on the
 total amount will only be about one-seventieth per cent., which
 may be neglected. The current is kept steady by means of
 the rheostat during the whole hour, and with most instruments
 this can he done with suf<U+FB01>cient accuracy by observing the
 index of the instrument itself, but if the instrument is not
 suf<U+FB01>ciently sensitive, or if the constancy of its indication is
 to be tested, a second instrument possessing the requisite
 sensibility and constancy is introduced into the circuit in the
 manner indicated at Gr, and the current kept steady by
 observing the index 0f it. The constant of this second
 instrument does not require to be known ; it should be of such
 a kind that its constant can be readily changed so as bring
 its de<U+FB02>ection to the proper amount, and the index exactly to
 a scale-division. The position of the index of the instrument
 being standardized may then be observed from time to time
 and the variations, if any, noted.                             .
    When instruments which are designed for the measurement
either of very weak or very strong currents, as, for example,
milliampere- or hectoampere-meters, are to be standardized, it
is generally more convenient to send a stronger current in
the former case, and a weaker current in the latter case,
through the electrolytic cell. Several methods involving the
use of auxiliary galvanometers have been used for this purpose ;
but the method illustrated in <U+FB01>g. 9 is su<U+FB01>'icient to indicate the
general principle of divided circuits on which such methods
are based.
    Referring to the <U+FB01>gure, 1', r, is a set of resistances, supposed
in this case to consist of eleven straight wires each of exactly
the same resistance and as nearly as possible of the same
length and thickness. These wires are soldered to thick bars
of copper, b, 6;, b2, the resistances of which are negligible in
comparison with that of the wires. In the case here considered
the resistances are supposed to be arranged in two groups of
ten and one respectively, but for general purposes it is more

                     of Silver and of Copper.                 413
convenient to solder separate terminal pieces to one end of
each wire, so that the number in each roup may be varied
 by putting the terminals in one or ot er of two mercury
troughs. Between the bars b1 and b2 a zero galvanometer g
is connected, and is used for the purpose of indicating when
 b1 and b; are at the same potential. When this is the case,
 the current from b to 61 is to the current between I) and b, in
 the ratio of the resistance between b and b2 to the resistance
 between b and 6;. Two sets of resistances, or two rheostats, R
 and R1, are introduced into the branches for the purpose of ad
justing the currents to the required strength. The electrolytic
 cells E and E1 are placed in one or other of the branch circuits
 according as theinstrument to he graduated is designed for weak
 or for strong currents, and the instrument is included in the
 other branch. The circuit is closed through a suitable battery,
 which must be of such a kind as will maintain a nearlyuniform
 electromotive force. The current through the instrument G1 is
 kept constant by means of the rheostat R1, and the difference of
 potential between 121 and b, is kept at zero by means of the
 rheostat B. When the instrument G1 is to be standardized by
 means of a standard galvanometer or astandard current-balance,
 the arrangement and mode of operation is precisely similar, the
standard instrument taking the place of the electrolytic cells.

copper-sulphate electrolytic cell is referred to, and it is there
stated that, unless the anodes presenta surface greater than 40
 square centimetres per ampere, the current is apt to diminish
 greatly in strength after the <U+FB01>rst few minutes.
    As the result of some special experiments on this subject I
<U+FB01>nd that the requisite size of anode depends greatly on the
degree of saturation of the solution. When the solution is
nearly saturated, say above 1'18 in density, the current is apt
to be almost entirely stopped on account of the anode plates
becoming completely covered by a <U+FB01>nely crystalline deposit
of copper sulphate which dissolves in the liquid very slowly.
A current of one-tenth of an ampere derived from a battery
of 24 tray Daniells was passed through an electrolytic cell
charged with a solution of sulphate of copper of density 1'18,
and having two anode-plates made of round copper wires
presenting a total surface of 3'8 square centimetres. The
current remained nearly constant for 12 minutes, when it
gradually diminished, became practically zero in a few seconds,
and remained so for 20 minutes. At the end of this time the

414     Mr. H. Tomlinson on certain Sources of Error in
circuit was broken, and the plates taken out of the liquid.
The cathode was found to be covered with a good deposit of
copper, but the anode was completely enclosed in a glacial
sheath of copper sulphate.
   Another cell, in which the anode had a surface of 4'4 square
centimetres, was treated in the same way, and was found to
carry a current of one-tenth of an ampere for 14 minutes.
The plates were then found to be covered by a similar coating
of copper sulphate.
   A similar cell in which the anode had a surface of 7 square
centimetres was found to carry one—tenth of an ampere for
30 minutes, when the current fell off as before from the same
cause.
   Experiments were then made in a similar manner with
cells containing a solution the density of which was 1'11.
When the current density at the anode exceeded one ampere
per 20 square centimetres, the plate became covered with
black oxide and the current diminished greatly in strength
after a few minutes (about 7 minutes for a current-density of
one ampere to 7 square centimetres,and 3 minutes for double
that current-density). The current does not entirely cease,
and will after a few minutes, if the battery be of suf<U+FB01>ciently
high potential, again assume nearly its former strength. The
oxide then falls off and gases are liberated at the surface of
the anode, forming a descending stream close to the plate and
an ascending stream two or three millimetres further out.
As the current-density is diminished, less and less oxidation
takes place and it becomes a lighter brown in colour.          With
a current-density of one ampere to 30 square centimetres the
anode became covered with brown oxide, which made the re
sistance of the cell high and variable, but little or no gas was
generated.                         .
   No gas was, so far as could be observed, given off at the
cathode during any of these experiments.
XLIX- On certain Sources of Error in Connection with Expe
   riments on Torsional Vibrations. By HERBERT TOMLIN
   son, B.A.*
                           Introduction.
DURING a long series of researches on the torsional elas
        ticity and internal friction of metals, I have come across
certain sources of error in connection with torsional vibrations
     ' Communicated by the Physical Society: road June 26, 1886.

     Connection with Experiments on Torsional Vibrations.     415
  generally, which I venture to bring before the notice of the
  Physical Society in the hope that by so doing I may
  perchance save others who may pursue similar investigations
  from the pitfalls into which I have fallen, and from which I
  have managed to extricate myself only after a considerable
  expenditure of time and labour.
     In my earlier experiments a wire about 600 centims. in
  length and l millim. in diameter was suspended vertically,
  having its upper extremity clamped to a rigid su port and its
  lower one clamped or soldered to the centre 0 a horizontal
  bar of brass, from which were suspended, by threads or <U+FB01>ne
  wires, two cylinders of equal dimensions and mass, and placed
  at equal distances from the wire. The torsional oscillations
/ of the wire were observed by means of the usual arrangement
  of mirror, scale, and lamp, the main object of the inquiry
  being to determine as accurately as possible the logarithmic
  decrement of the amplitude of swing and the vibration-period.
  After one set of observations had been completed, the moment
  of inertia was altered by sliding the cylinders along the bar
  further away from or nearer to the wire, so that the latter
  might now vibrate in a different period. If t be the period of
  vibration, k the moment of inertia, and f the torsional couple,
                                   vr’lc
                               f— T.
     The moment of inertia of the bar together with that of
  the suspended cylinders could be calculated with very fair
  accuracy; the value of t was also calculated to a nicety; so
   that it was reasonable to expect that the values of f obtained
   with different moments of inertia should be very fairly in
   accordance with each other. For some time this proved to
   be the case, and several wires of different metals had already
   been examined when a curious phenomenon presented itself.
   A change of' moment of inertia had just been made, and the
   wire was then set in torsional oscillation; but instead of
   the amplitude of swing diminishing by slow degrees as in the
   previous experiments, the spot of light was seen to make <U+FB01>ve
   or six oscillations of very rapidly diminishing amplitude, and
   <U+FB01>nally come nearly to rest.      Soon, however, the amplitude
   began to increase until in a few vibrations it extended over
   some two hundred divisions of the scale, when once more
   diminution and, <U+FB01>nally, rest nearly ensued. I will not trouble
  the Society with my conjectures at the time as to the cause
   of the phenomenon ; su<U+FB01>ice it that at length I discovered, what
   perhaps I ought to have discovered at once, that the, at <U+FB01>rst
   sight, startling apparition was due to a very natural cause,

416      Mr. H. Tomlinson on certain Sources of Error in
namely, the rotation to and fro of the cylinders about their
axes, and that the rapid absorption of energy was owing to
the fact that the torsional vibration-period of the wire nearly
s nchronized with the vibration-period of the cylinders about
t eir axes. I need hardly say that after this discovery I con
sidered it necessary to re-try all my previous experiments with
improved arrangements. With more perfect apparatus, in
which the cylinders were clamped to the bar so as to be in
capable of motion independently of the latter, I was glad to
<U+FB01>nd the main conclusions which I had previously drawn re
specting internal friction con<U+FB01>rmed. On one occasion, how
ever, by what afterwards turned out to be the merest chance
in the world, the old phenomenon appeared with all its curious
concomitants, and beats were very plainly discernible between
two sets of vibrations which nearly synchronized. These two
sets of vibrations I set to work to disentangle in a manner
kindly suggested to me by Prof. G. G. Stokes, with whom I
had some correspondence on the subject. Suppose that in
one or more beat-intervals the slower vibration is dominant *,
and afterwards the quicker. If the amplitudes cross during
a beat-interval, that one is to be deemed dominant which is
 dominant about the time of lull. Suppose there are m beat—
 intervals in which the slower is dominant, followed by n in
 which the quicker is dominant, and let N be the total number
 of vibrations counted 1'.      Then the number of vibrations of
 the two component kinds will be :—
                       For the slower, N—2n,
                       For the quicker, N+ 2m.
     In this way I managed without any dif<U+FB01>culty to <U+FB01>nd that
 one of the two vibration-periods was nearly a constant what
 ever the moment of inertia; whilst the other, that due to the
 torsional elasticity of the wire, increased as the square root of
 the moment of inertia. At <U+FB01>rst I felt very strongly inclined
to believe that the former of the two vibration-periods per
tained to some molecular state of the wire; and I was espe
 cially deceived by the fact that always after rest the pheno
menon became less marked, and, <U+FB01>nally, almost vanished,
easily, however, to be reproduced in all its former intensity by
the slightest shock given to the wire, or by raising or lowering
the temperature slightly. The wire was of iron, and my pre
vious experience of the effect of rest on the molecular dispo
sition of this metal led me to draw the above-mentioned conclu
sion. Had I not been thus deceived, I might more quickly
   ' By dominant vibration is meant the vibration of greater amplitude.
   1' For accuracy, the counting should begin and end with a maximum.

    Connection with Experiments on Torsional Vibrations.      417
have arrived at the solution of the problem; but as it was
 four weeks were spent in endeavouring to <U+FB01>nd the effect of
 change of temperature, change of load, and change of mode
 of attaching the cylinders, until I discovered that the pheno
 menon was simply caused by approach to synchronism between
 the periods of torsional and pendulous vibrations of the wire.
 Of course, if the axis of the wire passed accurately through
 the centre of mass of the vibrator, the phenomenon would not
 occur, but it is impossible quite to secure this; and as a con
 sequence so-called centrifu al force on the one hand, and the
 force of gravity on the ot er, set up pendulous vibrations
 which may seriously interfere with the vibration-period due
 to the torsional elasticity, and still more so with the loga
 rithmic decrement of arc.
    Having thus discovered two enemies in ambush, I thought
 that the ground was now clear, at least as far as any danger
 from synchronism was concerned; but in this I was mistaken:
 for happening to pursue my investigations still further with
 comparatively light loads and small moments of inertia, I at
 length became acquainted with a third source of' error arising
 from approach to synchronism between the torsional and
 transverse vibrations of the wire. It is, I believe, quite im
possible to excite torsional vibrations without at the same
 time exciting transverse ones; and should synchronism nearly
 occur between the periods of these vibrations, we may have
beats quite as strongly marked as in the two cases before
mentioned.
    There is yet another source of error to which it is desirable
to draw attention. When a wire has been recently suspended,
the torsional vibration-period will always be found slightly
greater than when it has been suspended for some time and
frequently set in vibration. The length of time which must
elapse before a wire has reached its state of maximum torsional
elasticity depends upon the nature of the metal ; with copper,
for instance, a few hours will suf<U+FB01>ce, whilst iron may require at
least a couple of days. Now suppose that this state of maxi
mum elasticity has been reached: if we wish to preserve
it, care must be taken not to jar the wire or to subject it to a
change of temperature of even two or three degrees Centi
grade; for in either case the elasticity will be slightly di
minished, and a few hundred vibrations will be required to
restore it to its former condition. Since it is very dif<U+FB01>cult to
avoid such slight changes of temperature as those mentioned
above, it is always advisable after any rest to cause the
wire to vibrate a few hundred times before beginning fresh
observations.

418      Error in Experiments on Torsional Vibrations.
             Determinations of Torsional Electricity.
   It is evident, from what has gone before, that when the
c linders are suspended from the bar by threads, the torsional
e asticity, as inferredfrom the vibration-period, may be seriously
affected should the torsional vibration-period of' the wire
approach to synchronism with the vibration-period of the
cylinders about their axes ; and to such an extent did I <U+FB01>nd
this to be the case, that the values of the torsional couple for
the same wire, as calculated from the previously given formula,
differed from each other by 10 per cent. or more when the
moment of inertia was varied.
   The effect of synchronism between the torsional vibrations
of the wire and the pendulous vibrations is not likely, if proper
care be taken in the construction and disposition of the bar
and its appendages, to be great; but it may nevertheless be
ver sensible.
     ynchronism between the torsional and transverse vibra
tion-periods is not likely to occur except in extreme cases;
but it must be remembered that the torsional vibration-periods
may be affected by synchronism between them and multiples
of the transverse vibration-period, though of course not to
the same extent as when the fundamental transverse vibration
period equals the torsional vibration-period. A similar remark
to the above would also apply to the other two cases of
synchronism.
              Determinations of Magnetic Moments.
   It is evident that determinations of magnetic moments by
the method of oscillations may be similarly affected by the
same causes as we have seen would affect determinations of
the torsional elasticity.                   .
                       Damping of Magnets.
   Still greater error may be introduced from the above causes
in experiments on the damping of vibrating magnets ; for
the logarithmic decrement is much more seriously affected
than the vibration-period.
              Determinations of Moments of Inertia.
   When it is impossible to determine the moment of inertia
of a body b measurement of its dimensions and mass, it is
usual to <U+FB01>n the time of oscillation, and afterwards to redeter
mine this time when the moment of inertia has been altered
to a known extent.
   If t and t' be the two times of oscillation, K the required

                  On the Self-induction of IVires.            419
moment of inertia, and k the known change of moment of
inertia                              t2
        ’                   K=km,.
   Now a small error in the determination of eithert or t’ pro
duces a comparatively large error in the value of K; and it is
therefore of considerable importance here that there should be
no approach to the previously mentioned synchronisms. It
is important also here to notice the fourth source of error
which has been mentioned ; for it is very dif<U+FB01>cult to change
the moment of inertia without imparting some shock to the wire.
           L. On the Self-induction of Wires.-—Part IV.
                     By OLIVER HEAVISIDE“.
      S mentioned at the close of Part 111., it would appear
          that the only practicable way of making a workable
 system, which will allow us to introduce the terminal con
 ditions that always occur in practice, in the form of linear
 differential equations connecting C and V, the current and
 potential difference at the terminals, is to abolish the very
 small radial component of current in the conductors. This
 does not involve the abolition of the radial dielectric current
 which produces the electric displacement, or alter the equation
 of continuity to which the total current in the wires is subject.
 The dielectric current, which is SV per unit length of line,
 and which must be physically continuous with the radial cur
 rent in the conductors at their boundaries, may, when the
 latter is abolished, be imagined to be joined on to that part of
 the longitudinal current in the conductors that goes out of
 existence by some secret method with which we are not con
 cerned.
    We assume, therefore, that the propagation of magnetic
 induction and electric current into the conductors takes place,
 at any part of the line, as if it were taking place in the same
 manner at the same moment at all parts (as when the dielec
 tric displacement is ignored, making it only a question of
 inertia and resistance), instead of its being in different stages
 of progress at the same moment in different parts of the line.
 This requires that a small fraction of its length, along which
 the chan e in C is insensible, shall be a large multiple of the
 radius 0 the wire. The current may be widely different in
 strength at places distant, say, a mile, and yet the variation in
 a few yards be so small that this section, so far as the propa
                   * Communicated by the Author.

420                  Mr. O. Heaviside on the
gation of magnetic induction into it is concerned, may be
regarded as independent of the rest of the line ; the variation
of the boundary magnetic force or of 0 fully determining the
internal state of the conductors, exactly as it would do were
there no electrostatic induction.
   In a copper wire, in which #:1, and lc=1/1700, the value
of the quantity 47T/IJCP is p / 135. On the other hand, the
quantity m in --.<>'2=4-1rp.kp+m2 has values 0, vr/l, 21r/l, &c.,
or a similar series, in which l is the length of the line in cen
timetres, so that j'n' / l is a minute fraction, unless be exces
sively large. But then it would correspond to an utterly
insigni<U+FB01>cant normal system.        We may therefore take
                            —82=47T/bkp.
   It will be as well to repeat the system that results, from
Part II. The line-integral of the radial electric force across
the dielectric being V, from the inner to the outer conductor
(concentric tubes), and the line-integral of the magnetic force
round the inner conductor being 472-0, so that G is the total
current in it, accompanied by an oppositely direct current of
equal strength in the outer conductor, V and C are connected
by two equations, one of continuity of C, the other the equa
tion of electric force, thus :—
                      .         dV       .
           - % =SV, e— d—z =LOC+Bl”C+Rz”C. . (141)
Here e is impressed force, S the electrostatic capacity, and L0
the electromagnetic capacity, or the inductance, of the dielec
tric, all per unit length of line ; and R1” and R2” are certain
functions of d/dt and constants such that Rf'G and -—B,"C
are the longitudinal electric forces of the <U+FB01>eld at the inner and
outer boundaries of the dielectric, which, when only the <U+FB01>rst
differential coef<U+FB01>cient dC/dt is counted, become
                               d                   d
              R1"=R1+L.d—,, m"=R2+L,;,
respectively, where R1, L1, and R2, L2 are the steady-<U+FB02>ow
 resistance and inductance of the two conductors.
    The forms of R1” and R2” are known when the conductors
are concentric circular tubes, of which the inner may be solid,
 making it an ordinary round wire. Now if the return con
 ductor be a parallel wire or tube externally placed, it is clear
 that we may regard R1” and R,” as known in the same manner,
 provided their distance apart be suf<U+FB01>ciently great to make the
 departure of the distribution of current in them from symmetry
 insensible. We have merely to remember that it is now the
inner boundary of the return tube that corresponds to the

                     Seif-induction of Wires.                 4.21
former outer boundary, i. e. when it surrounded the inner
wire concentrically.
   The quantity V will still be the line-integral of the electric
force across the dielectric by any path that keeps in one plane
perpendicular to the axes of the conductors, in which plane
lie the lines of magnetic force. Also, the product VG will
still represent the total longitudinal transfer of energy per
second in the dielectric at that plane, or, in short, the energy
current. As regards the modi<U+FB01>ed forms of S and L0, there is,
in strictness, some little dif<U+FB01>culty, on account of the dielectric
being necessarily bounded by other conductors than the pair
under consideration, in which others energy is wasted, to a
certain extent. This can only be allowed for by the equations
of mutual induction of the various conductors, which are not
now in question. But if our pair, for instance, be suspended
alone at a uniform height above the ground, so that only the
very small dissipation of energy in the earth interferes, it
would seem, so far as the wire current is concerned, to be an
unnecessary re<U+FB01>nement to take the earth into consideration.
There are, then, two or three practical courses open to us; as
to suppose the earth to be a perfect nonconductor and behave
as if it were replaced by air, or to treat it as a perfect con
ductor. In neither case will there be dissipation of energy
except in our looped wires, which have no connection with
the earth, but there will be a different estimation of the quan
tities Lo and S required. For when we suppose the earth is
perfectly conducting, we shut it out from the magnetic <U+FB01>eld
as well as from the electric <U+FB01>eld. The electrostatic capacity
 S is that of the condenser formed by the two wires and inter
mediate dielectric, as modi<U+FB01>ed by the presence of the earth
 (the method of images gives the formula at once), and the
value of L0 is such that LOS=pc=v_’, where v is the velocity
 of undissipated waves through the dielectric ; that is, as
before, L0 is sim ly the inductance of the dielectric, per unit
length of line.     11 the ground there will be both electri<U+FB01>ca
tion and electric current, due to the discontinuity in the
electric displacement and the magnetic force respectively ;
 but with these we have no concern. In the other case,
with extension of the magnetic and electric <U+FB01>elds, the product
 LOS still equals 0". Neither course is quite satisfactory ;
 perhaps it would be best to sacri<U+FB01>ce consistency and let the
 magnetic <U+FB01>eld extend unimpeded into the earth, considered
 as nonconducting, with consequently no electric current and
 waste of energy, whilst, as re ards the external electric <U+FB01>eld,
 we treat it as a conductor. %Ve must compromise in some
 way, unless we take the earth into account fully as an ordi

422                 Mr. O. Heaviside on the
nary conductor. Similarly, if the line consist of a single wire
whose circuit is completed through the earth, by regarding it
as in<U+FB01>nitely conducting we .replace the true variably distri
buted return-current by a surface-current, and, terminating
the magnetic <U+FB01>eld there, have L(,S='o‘2 ; but if we allow the
magnetic <U+FB01>eld to extend into it, though with insigni<U+FB01>cant loss
of energy by electric current, we shall no longer have this
property.
   The property is intimately connected with the influence of
perfect conductivity on the state of the dielectric. For per
fect conductivity will make the lines of electric force normal
to the conducting boundaries, will make them cut perpendi
cularly the magnetic-force lines, which lie in the planes z =
const. and are tangential at the boundaries, and will make
L0S=v‘2, irrespective of the shape of section of the conduc
tors. Now, at the <U+FB01>rst moment of putting on an impressed
force, wires always behave as if they were in<U+FB01>nitely conducting,
so that, by the above, the initial effect is simply a dielectric
disturbance, travelling along the dielectric, guided by the
conductors, with velocity v, irrespective of the form of sec
tion. Of course dissipation of energy in the conductors
immediately begins, and <U+FB01>nally completely alters the state
of things, which would be, in the absence of dissipation,
the to-and-fro passage of a wave through the dielectric for
ever. Except the extension to other than round conductors,
this does not add to the knowledge already derived from their
study. The effect of alternating currents in tending to become
mere surface-currents as the frequency is raised (Part I.)
may be derived from, or furnish itself a proof of, the property
above mentioned—that at the <U+FB01>rst moment there is merely a
dielectric disturbance. For in rapid alternations of impressed
force, we are continually stopping the establishment of the
steady state at its very commencement and substituting the
establishment of a steady state of the opposite kind, to be itself
immediately stopped, and so on.
   When the dielectric is unbounded, not enclosed within
conductors, there is also the outward propagation of disturb
ances to be considered ; but it would appear, by general
reasoning, that this is, relatively to the main effect, or propa
gation parallel to the wires, a secondary phenomenon.
   It is clear that the same principles apply to conductors
having other forms of section than circular, when V and C
are made the variables, provided the functions R1” and R,”
can be properly determined. The quantity VG being in all
cases the energy-current, its rate of decrease as we pass along
the line is accounted for (as in Part 111.), thus, by making

                      Self-induction of Wires.                423

   Let us, then, assume that R,” and R)” can be found, their

required. They are functions of d/dt and constants, if the

such as can be set up by any steadily-acting distribution of
longitudinal impressed force (e an arbitrary function of z), so
that whilst V is arbitrary, O is only in a very limited sense
arbitrary, and O, O, &c. are initially zero, and certain de<U+FB01>nite
distributions of electric and magnetic energy in the terminal
apparatus are also necessarily involved; in this case we may
readily <U+FB01>nd the full solutions, and therefore also determine
the effect of any distribution of e varying anyhow with the
time. In fact, by the condenser method of Part III., we
shall arrive at the solution (135); we have merely to employ
the present it and w, and let M be the value of the right
member of (158). The following establishment, however, is
quite direct, and less mixed up with physical considerations.
    To determine how V and O rise from zero everywhere to
the <U+FB01>nal state due to a steadily-acting arbitrary distribution
of e put on at the time i=0.           Start with e; at z=z2 and

currents on the left (nearest z=0) and right sides of the seat
of impressed force.       We have to <U+FB01>nd qo, ql, A0, and A1.
The condition V=ZOC at z=0 gives us, by (153), (154),

therefore

Here the numbers 0 and 1 mean that the values of X, &c. and
S" at z=0 and at 2:1 are to be taken.
   New, at the place z=z2 the current is continuous, whilst
the V rises by the amount e2 suddenly in passing through it.

section, to be considered later, may easily be investigated by
means of Fourier series, at least when the return current
closely envelops it.

no elastic displacement permitted (80:0), the solution would

line at time t after it was V0, when left to itself, is got by
multiplying each term in the expansion by e'mzt/RS. The
corresponding current is given by RC=—-dV/dz. But the
solution thus got will usually only be correct, although (180)
is correct, when there is, initially, no energy in the terminal
apparatus. If there be, additional terms in the numerator
of (180) are required, to be found by the energy-difference
method of Part III. They will not alter the value of the
right member of (180) at all ; they only come into effect after
the subsidence has commenced. Similar remarks apply what
ever be the nature of the line. It is, however, easy to arrange
matters so that the energy in the terminal apparatus shall
produce no effect in the line. For example, join the two
conductors at one end of the line through two equal coils in
parallel ; if the currents in these coils be equal and similarly
directed in the circuit they form by themselves, they will not,
in subsiding, affect the line at all.
    Returning to (177), or other equivalent expression, it is to
be observed that particular attention must be paid to the
roots ml :0, which may occur, or to the series of roots p
belonging to the m=O case, when we are working down from
the general to the special, and happen to bring in m=0.

 ceding equation becomes <U+FB01>nite, making
                       d4>/”ll’=1(dR”/dP)
 The result is that the current solution contains a term, or
 in<U+FB01>nite series, apparently following a different law to the rest,
with no corresponding terms in the V solution. This merely
means that the mean current subsides without causing any

436                 Mr. O. Heaviside on the
electric displacement across the dielectric, when the ends are
 short-circuited (Z=O); so that if, in the <U+FB01>rst place, the cur
 rent had been steady, and there had been no displacement,
 there would have been none during the subsidence.
    The transition from the combined inertia and elasticity
solutions to elasticity alone is very curious. Thus, let Z=O
at both ends, and R”=R+Lp, where R and L are constants
not containing 10. The rise of current due to e is shown by

     Next let us consider the transition from the combined

 is usual to wholly ignore electrostatic induction in investiga

  S=O, stopping elastic displacement, and compelling the cur
  rent to keep in the wires always, i. e. when the insulation is

showing the current to rise independently of the distribution
of e, and V to have its <U+FB01>nal distribution from the <U+FB01>rst moment,
which, when the impressed force is wholly at z=0, of amount
e0, is e0(1——z/l). This in<U+FB01>nitely rapid propagation of V is
common sense according to the prescribed conditions, but
absolute nonsense physically considered, especially in view of
the transfer of energy. The question then arises, How does V
really set itself up, when the line is so short that the current
rises sensibly according to the electromagnetic theory?
   To examine this, let the line constants be R, S, L (inde
pendent of d/dt), and Z1=Z0=O. Put on e0 at 2:0 at time

   It is clear that when S is made to vanish, making m'=oo ,
the current oscillations wholly vanish, reducing the 0 solution
to the <U+FB01>rst of (193). But the V oscillations remain in full
force, though of in<U+FB01>nitely short period, and subside at a de<U+FB01>
nite rate. This means that the mean value of V at any place
has to be taken to represent its actual value, and this mean
value is its <U+FB01>nal value. That is, if V denote the mean value,
about which V oscillates, we have
                       V=e0(1 —z/l) =V0.

First ignore the subsidence factor, replacing it by unity, then
(195) represents a wave of V travelling to and fro at velocity

           V=O beyond z=vt.
When vt=l, the whole line is charged to V=e0.           The wave
then moves back in the same manner as it advanced, so that
the state of things at time t=l/v i1- is the same, until t reaches
2l/v, when we have V=O as at <U+FB01>rst. This would be repeated
over and over again if there were no resistance, which, through
the exponential factor, causes the range of the oscillations of
V at any place about the <U+FB01>nal value to diminish according to
the time constant 2L/R. Also, the resistance has the effect
of rounding off the abrupt discontinuity in the wave of V.
   I have given a fuller description of this case elsewhere
(Journal S. T. E. and E. v01. ix., “On Induction between
Parallel Wires”), and only bring it in here in connection
with the interpretation according to my present views regard
ing the transfer of energy. As it is clear that this oscillatory
phenomenon is, primarily, a dielectric phenomenon, and only
affects the conductor secondarily, it is necessary that the L in
the above should not at the beginning be the full L of dielec
tric and wires, but only L0, that of the dielectric, making 1:
the velocity of undissipated waves, although as the oscillations
subside the velocity must diminish, tending towards v = (LS)-’,

the case of an iron wire. The nature of the dielectric wave
is far more simply studied graphically than by means of
Fourier series, on the assumption of in<U+FB01>nite conductivity,
which allows us to represent things by means of two oppo
sitely travelling waves. To this I may return in the next Part.
    I will conclude the present Part with a brief outline of the
reasoning which guided me six months ago, when my brother’s
experiments on induction between distant circuits (mentioned
in Part II.) in the north of England commenced, to the con
clusion that long-distance signalling       e. hundreds of miles)
was possible by induction, a conclusion which has been some
what supported by results, so far as the experiments have yet
gone. Recognizing the great complexity of the problem, and
the dif<U+FB01>culty of hitting the exact conditions, I made no special
calculations but preferred to be guided by general considera
tions ; for, in the endeavour to be precise when the data are
uncertain and very variable, one is in great danger of swallow
ing the camel.
    One may be fairly well acquainted with electromagnetism,
and also with the capabilities of the telephone, and yet receive
the idea of signalling by induction long distances with utter
 incredulity, or at least in the same way as one might accept
the truth of the statement, that when one stamps one’s foot
the universe is shaken to its foundations. Quite true, but
 insensible a few yards away. The incredulity will probably
be based upon the notion of rapid decrease with distance of
 inductive effects. This, however, leaves out of consideration
 an important element, namely the size of the circuits.
    The coef<U+FB01>cients of electromagnetic induction of linear cir
 cuits are proportional to theirlinear dimensions. If, then, we
 increase the size of two circuits n times, and also their distance
 apart n times, the mutual inductance M is increased n times.
 Let B, and R.) be the resistances of primarv and secondary.
 The induced current (integral) in the secondary due to start
 ing or stopping a current O, in the primary is MCI/R2, or
 Mel/1132, if e, be the impressed force in the primary. Now
 increasing the linear dimensions, and the distance, in the
 ratio '11 (with the same kind of wire) increases M, R,, and R,
 all n times. So only e1 remains to be increased 11 times to get
 the same secondary-current impulse.         We can therefore en—
 sure success in long-distance experiments on the basis of the
 success of short-distance experiments, with elements of uncer
 tainty arising from new conditions coming into operation at
 the long distances.
    But practically the result must be far more favourable to

                     Self-induction of Wires.                 441
the long than to the short distances than the above asserts.
For no one, when multiplying the distance and size of circuits,
say ten times, would think of putting ten telephones in circuit
to keep rigidly to the rule. Thus it may be that only a slight
increase of el is required, on account of M being multiplied in
a far greater ratio than the resistances, or the self-inductances.
Thus, it is not uncommon for the R and L of a telephone to
be 100 ohms and 12 million centim. These form the prin
cipal parts of the R and L of a circuit of moderate size, and
of course do not increase when we enlarge the circuit. It is
therefore certain that we can signal long distances on the
above basis, with a margin in favour of the long distances,
which will be large or small according as the circuits are
small or large.
   Again, if e, in the primary be periodic, of frequency n/21r,
the ratio of the amplitude of the current in the secondary to
that in the primary will be
                        Mai-(112+ Lgnz<U+FB01>.
   Now, without any statement of the magnitude of the cur
rent in the primary, if it be largely in excess of requirements
for signalling in the primary, so that &6 part, say, would be
sufficient for the purpose, then we shall have enough current
in the secondary if the above ratio is only T56.     But, without
going to precise formulae, it may be easily seen that the above
ratio may be made quite a considerable fraction, in comparison
with T165, with closed metallic circuits whose linear dimensions
and distance are increased in the same ratio. But we should
expect a rapid decrease of effect when the mean distance
between the circuits exceeds their diameter, keeping the cir
cuits unchanged. (It should be understood that squares,
circles, &c. are referred to.)
   The theory seems so very clear (though it is only the <U+FB01>rst
approximation to the theory), that it would be matter for
wonder and special inquiry if we found that we could not
signal long distances by induction between closed metallic
circuits, starting on the basis of a short-distance experiment,
and following up the theory.
   [As a matter of fact, it was found possible to speak by
telephone between two circuits of { mile square, 15 mile between
centres, using two bichros with the microphone]
   Now coming to metallic lines whose circuits are closed
through the earth, the theory is rendered far more difficult on
account of there being a conduction-current from the primary
to the secondary due to the earth’s imperfect conductivity.
We therefore have, to say nothing of electrostatic induction,

442      Mr. H. Tomlinson on the Efect of Stress and
a superposition of effects due to induction and conduction,
the latter being far more dif<U+FB01>cult to theoretically estimate
than the former. But the reasoning regarding the electro
magnetic induction is not very greatly changed, although not
so favourable to long-distance signalling. If the return cur
rents diffused themselves uniformly in all directions from the
ends of the line, the same property of n-fold increase of M
with n-fold lengthening of the lines and their distance
would still be true. But the diffusion is one-sided only, and
is even then only partial, especially when exceedingly rapid
alternations of current take place.    But we have the power of
counterbalancing this by the multiplication of the variations
of current in the primary that we can get by making and
breaking the circuit, with a considerabte battery-power if
necessary, getting something enormous compared with the
feeble variations of current in the microphonic circuit, or that
can work a telephone. Electrostatic induction also comes
in to assist, as it increases the activity of the battery, and
therefore the current in the secondary also.
   But, as regards wires connected to earth, this does not pro
fess to be more than the very roughest reasoning, though in
 my opinion quite plain enough to show that we may ascribe
the signalling across 40 miles of countr ' between lines about 50
miles long mainly to induction, as we s ould be necessitated to
 do if we carried the experiment further and closed the circuits
metallically by roundabout courses, for then the plain argu
ment relating to induction will become valid. Experiments
of this kind are of the greatest value from the theoretical
point of view, and it is to be hoped that they will be greatly
extended.
  LI. Note on the E<U+FB01>'ect of Stress and Strain on the Electrical
    Resistance of Carbon. By HERBERT TOMLINSON, B.A.“‘
 PROFESSOR T. O. MENDENHALL has published in
       the September number of Silliman’s American Journal,
 and also in the October number of the Philosophical Maga
 zine, an account of some experiments on the effect of pressure
 on the electrical resistance of carbon. These experiments
 deal not only with such comparatively hard rods of carbon as
 are used in the arc lamp, but also with the compressed lamp
 black seen in Edison’s disks. I will <U+FB01>rst refer to the experi
 ments on the hard carbon. Prof. Mendenhall seems to think
 that these are in accordance with some experiments made by
                   ’1‘ Communicated by the Author.

           Strain on the Electrical Resistance of Carbon.       443
myself i"; but this I rather doubt, for the change of resistance
produced by pressure on the carbon rod used by him would
appear to be considerably greater than any which was ob
tained by myself on carbon rods of a similar kind. In fact,
had I not employed a very sensitive arrangement for testing
small changes of electrical resistance 1', I might have failed in
detecting any change whatever. The result arrived at by
myself was thata pressure of l grm. per square centim. would
produce a percentage decrease of only '00000064. So that, if
we assume the decrease of resistance to be proportional to the
pressure, there would be required a pressure of 22,215 lb. on
the square inch to produce a decrease of resistance of l per
cent. I am not aware of any investigations on the pressure
which would suf<U+FB01>ce to crush carbon, but we may form some
rough notion of its amount in the following manner :—The
crushing pressure of wrought iron is 36,000 lb. , and the value
of Young’s modulus for the metal is about 1900 X 106 grm.
per square centim., whilst the corresponding value for this
particular specimen of carbon was 2672 x 10 grm. per square
centim. We may perhaps say that the crushing pressure of
the carbon would probably be somewhere about
              36,000 x 2672
                                 lb. per square inch,
                    1900
i. e. about 5000 lb. per square inch. If this result be at all
correct, it would follow that pressure on the point of crushing
the carbon would diminish the electrical resistance by less
than 1} per cent. Prof. Mendenhall does not give any data by
which the amount of change of resistance observed by him
can be calculated ; but, if one may judge from the tenour of
his remarks and his arrangements for experimenting, it would
seem probable that the ratio of change of resistance to pressure
was considerably greater in his experiments than in mine.
     Further, Prof. Mendenhall seems to credit me with doing
what I have not done ; for, after describing his own experi
ments on the effect of pressure exerted in the same direction
as the current, he goes on to say, “It was also found that
compression at right angles to the direction of the current
produced a similar effect, but less in magnitude. These facts
had been already announced by Mr. Tomlinson.” I have
made no experiments on the effect of compression at right
angles to the direction of the current, but Ithink it probable
that if I had I should have found increase of resistance, and
   ' Phil. Trans, Part I. 1883,   . 65.

change of resistance of about 1 in 100,000.

444      Stress and Strain on the Electrical Resistance of Carbon.
not decrease, to follow on compression exerted in the above
direction.
     On the whole, then, I am of opinion that my experiments
are more in accordance with those of Professors Sylvanus
Thompson, W. F. Barrett, and others, than with those of
Prof. Mendenhall.
     As regards soft carbon, such as is used with Edison’s disks,
I cannot speak from experience. I was, however, much in
terested in reading the account given by Prof. Mendenhall of
his investigations on the subject, and especially with that part
of the account which relates to the in<U+FB02>uence of time on the
change of resistance of the carbon disk when the pressure is
varied ; inasmuch as some of my own experiments have shown
a similar influence of time on the electrical resistance of the
viscous metals zinc and tin in the form of foil, when traction
was applied in a direction transverse to that of the current”.
     At the same time I would venture to suggest to Prof. Men
denhall, that his ingenious experiments may not be quite
conclusive as to a considerable change taking place in the
speci<U+FB01>c resistance of the carbon. After showing that very
considerable change does take place somewhere in the circuit
of the mercury in contact with the carbon button and the
button itself, be substitutes for the soft carbon a disk of hard
carbon similar in dimensions, and <U+FB01>nds that a pressure of only
7 centimetres of mercury lowers the resistance by nearly 3 per
cent. ; and he says “There can be little doubt that this small
reductionT is due almost entirelyi to better surface-contact
produced by pressure.” From the above it is evident that
the surface-contact between the mercury and hard carbon was
by no means good ; but, writes Prof. Mendenhall, “The faces
ofa soft carbon disk are always smooth and polished; the
surface of hard carbon, on the contrary, is generally more or
less rough and irregular. It would appear, therefore, that, if
the reduction of the resistance of soft carbon by increase of
pressure is due to better surface-contact, this reduction of
resistance should be much more marked with hard than with
soft carbon.” The above assumption is a very dangerous one
   * Loo. cit. pp. 68 and 69.
   '3' Small in comparison to that which ensued with the soft carbon,
which was about twenty times as great for the same pressure—H. T.
   I The words “almost entirely ” used here seem to indicate that in the
experiments described in the <U+FB01>rst part of this note Prof. Mendenhall found
much greater changes produced in his carbon than I did.       Such a pres—
sure as that of 7 centimetres of mercury would not have produced an
sensible effect even with m arran ement, which must have been muc
more sensitive than that of rof.    endenhall.—H. T.

to make, for the surface of the soft carbon might not be in
the same state of cleanliness as that of the hard carbon.
    But even suppose we allow that there was better contact
with the mercury in the case of the soft carbon than in that
of the hard carbon, it does not necessarily follow that the ob
served decrease of resistance consequent on increase of pressure
occurred in the carbon of the button. The buttons are, I
believe, formed by compressing lampblack mixed with yum
water. Must we not suppose, then, that the particles of
lampblack are bound to each other by the gum, and separated
from each other by the gum, to a greater or less extent?
Would not the diminution of resistance experienced in the
body of the button when pressure was applied be due to one
or both of the two following causes :—
    1. Dimiuution of the resistance of the thin coating of gum
between the particles of carbon?
    2. Better surface-contact between one particle of carbon
and another ?
    The in<U+FB02>uence of time on the change of resistance might be
quite accounted for by supposing cause 1 to be at work’.

of delivery of momentum from S by water <U+FB02>owing out on one

and let ube the horizontal component velocity at P. The

When this is positive, the water between A0 and A must

 the horizontal component velocity is rigorously or approxi
 mately equal to U, then 1) is rigorously or approximately the

Do is found by (15), which is a cubic equation in D0, most
easily solved by successive approximations according to the
process obviously indicated by the form in which the equation
appears in (15). (As a <U+FB01>rst approximation take D for Do in

 become important, even though the corrugations at a great
 distance down-stream from the inequalities were in<U+FB01>nitesimaL

 present U to be considerably smaller than the critical value,
 we may neglect the <U+FB01>rst term in comparison with the second,
 remembering that in fact quantities comparable with the <U+FB01>rst

   There is no dif<U+FB01>culty in understanding the permanent
steadiness of the motion which we have now been considering:
to any <U+FB01>nite distance, however great, on either the up-stream
or down-stream side of the inequalities, if the water in the
<U+FB01>nite space considered is given in this state of motion, and
if water is admitted on the one side and carried away on the
the other side conformably. But it is very interestin and
instructive to consider the initiation of such a state of t ings
from an antecedent condition of uniform <U+FB02>ow over a plane
bottom. Suppose, as the primary condition, an inequality,
whether elevation or depression, to exist in the bottom, but
to be carried along with the water, so that the <U+FB02>ow of the
water is everywhere uniform and in parallel lines. If the
inequality is an elevation above the bottom, our supposition
is that the whole projecting piece, moving with the water,
slips along the bottom.    If the inequality be a depression in
the bottom, the more awkward supposition must be made of a.
plasticity of the bottom, and the form of the inequality
carried along, while the bottom is kept rigidly plane before
and after this depression.
   Suppose, now, the inequality is gradually or suddenly
brought to rest, what will be the resulting motion of the
water? The question is identical with that of <U+FB01>nding the
motion of water in a canal, when by an external force, such
as that of a towing-rope, a boat is gradually or suddenly set
in motion through it ; or, rather, it would be identical if the
boat were a beam <U+FB01>lling the whole breadth across the canal,
so that the motion of the water shall be purely two-dimen
sional. I hope in a later article (Part III. or Part IV. of the
present series) to investigate the formation of the proces
sion of standing waves in the wake of the obstacle, and its
gradual extension farther and farther down-stream from the
obstacle, the motion having become sensibly steady in the
its neighbourhood, and becoming so to greater and greater
distances down-stream by the completion of the growth of fresh
waves. The disturbance sent up-stream from the initiating
irregularity must also be considered. Equation (15) shows
that whether the irregularity be an elevation, as in our <U+FB01>rst
diagram (<U+FB01>g. 1), or a depression, as in <U+FB01>g. 2, a rising of
level must travel up-stream, at a velocity relatively to the
water which we know must be \/gDo', where Do' is inter

mediate between D, and the smaller depth, which we shall
call D', in the undisturbed stream above. But however gra
dually the initiating irregularity may have been instituted,
this travelling of an elevation up-stream must develop abore;
because the velocity of propagation is, as it were, different in
different parts of the slope, being x/gD' at the commence
ment of the slope, and ranging from this, through \/gDo’, '60
\/ gD0 as the depth rises from D’ to D0 ; so that, as it were,
the brow of the plateau in its advance up-stream overtakes the
talus, till the slope becomes too steep for our approximation.
The inevitable bore and “ broken” water (inevitable without
viscidity of the water, or some surface-action preventing the
excessive steepness) would modify affairs down-stream in a
manner which it is dif<U+FB01>cult to imagine. It becomes, there
fore, interesting to see how it may be avoided, whether by
surface-action, or by giving some viscosity to the water. It
is more interesting to do this by surface-action, and to allow
the water to be perfectly inviscid, so that our standing waves
down-stream may be perfectly unimpaired. And we may do
it very simply by covering the free surface all over (up-stream
and down-stream) with an in<U+FB01>nitely thin viscously elastic
<U+FB02>exible membrane, stiffened transversely (after the manner of
the sail of a Chinese junk) by rigid massless bars with ends
travelling up and down in vertical guides on the sides ofthe canal.
If we suppose the motion of these ends to be resisted by forces
proportional to their velocities, and the membrane to exercise
(positive or negative) contractile tensional force in simple
proportion to the velocity of the change of its length in each
in<U+FB01>nitely small part; we have a mechanical arrangement by
which is realized the mathematical condition of a surface
normal pressure varying according to normal component
velocity of the otherwise free surface, and in simple propor
tion to this normal velocity when the slope is in<U+FB01>nitesimal.
By making the viscous forces suf<U+FB01>ciently great, we may make
the progress of the rise of level up-stream as gradual as we
please, and perfectly avoid the bore. We may also make the
progress of the procession of stationary waves down-stream as
 slow as we please. The form of the water-surface over the
 ine uality or inequalities, and to any distance from them,
 bot up-stream and down~stream, is not ultimately affected.
 at all by the viscous covering ; and it becomes, as time
 advances, more and more nearly that of the mathematical
 solution for steady motion, which Ihope to give, with graphic
illustrations drawn according to calculation from the solution,
in Part III.

L111. New Geometrical Representation of Moments and Pro
   ducts of Inertia in a Plane Section; and also of the Re
   lations between Stresses and Strains in two Dimensions.
   By ALFRED LODGE, 111.11., Coopers Hill, Staines *.
THE object of the <U+FB01>rst part of this paper is to give two
        methods by which the connection between the moments
and products of inertia about pairs of rectangular axes through
a point may be represented by means of a circle, without the
necessity of drawing the ellipse of inertia.
   If a, b are the radii of gyration about the principal axes
OA, OB at the given point 0, and la, l those about any other
pair of rectangular axes through the same point, it being the
product-coe<U+FB02>icient about the same pair (i. e. the product of
inertia divided by the area of the section), we have

where 6 is the angle KOA, considered positive when measured
from +OA towards +OB, and when the right angle from
 + OK to + OL is measured in this positive direction.
       First illethod of Geometrically representing the above
                                 Relations,

whatever in the plane of
the section, cutting the

may be called the gyration
circle at O.
   On the diameter AB of
the circle take a point P,
such that PA=a, and
PB=b.
   Then, if OK, OL are a

454     Mr. A. Lodge on a New Geometrical Representation of
and twice the triangle KPL is the product-coef<U+FB01>cient about
the pair OK, OL.
    For, draw PM perpendicular to AK ; then PM=a cos 6,
MK=b sin 9 ; hence
                    PK2 = a2 cos2 9 + 1)2 sin” 0 = k”.
    Similarly, ’ PL2 = I”.
    Also LK (the base of the triangle KPL)=a+b ; and, if S
is the centre of the circle, SP = %(a—b), and the angle
KSA=29, therefore the height of the triangle
               =%(a—b) sin 20: (a—b) sing cos 0;
          twice area of triangle KPL=(a”—-b2) sin 0 cos 9:71.
                                                       Q. E. D.
    The sign of the product It is positive if the positive direc
 tions of OK, OL include between them the axis of minimum
 moment (as in the <U+FB01>gure), for in that case 0 is positive and
 less than a right angle, and a2—b2 is positive ; or 0 is nega
 tive and less than a right an le, and a2—-b2 is negative.
 This condition is the same as the 0110 wing :—If the centre S is _
 in the positive quadrant KOL, the product of inertia is positive
if O, P are on opposite sides of KSL. If S is taken on one
 of the axes OK, OL, when the product is positive P is in the
   ositive quadrant.
    If Q be taken on AB so that SQ=SP, the <U+FB01>gure PKQL
 is a parallelo ram with sides equal to the radii of gyration
 about 0 K, OL, whose area equals the product-coef<U+FB01>cient
 about OK, OL, and one of whose diagonals is the sum of the
   rincipal radii of gyration, the other being the difference;
 P, Q being the ends of the shorter diagonal.
     Hence, if the radii PK, PL, and the product-coe<U+FB02>icient
 about OK, OL are given, it is easy to <U+FB01>nd the radius SK of
 the gyration-circle at O, and to construct for the principal
 axes.
     It is worth noticing that if PK is drawn perpendicular to
  OK, LQ lies along LO, and P is on the positive or negative
  side of L0, according as the product of inertia is positive or
 ne ative.
      t is not dif<U+FB01>cult, being given the position of the centre of
 area G, to construct for the central principal axes. For,
  suppose G lies on OK ; draw GL’ parallel to OL. Then the
 radius about GK is known, the product of inertia about GK,
  GL’ is equal to that about OK, OL, and they are both there
 fore represented by parallelograms of the same height, and
 with one pair of sides of the same length. The other sides of
 the new parallelogram are of length equal to VPL2—OG2,

     Moments and' Products of Inertia in a Plane Section.     455
 and are therefore easily constructed. This completes the
 parallelogram, giving all data for the gyrafion-circle belonging
 to G.
  Second Method of representing the Relations (1), (2), and (3).
    Let UA=the 1110-                        Fig- 2
 ment of inertia about
 OA, and UB=AV=
 the moment about OB,
 OA and OB being, as
before, the principal
axes at O : so that UV
is the sum of the prin
cipal moments, and AB
their deference.
   Describe the circle
AOB with centre T.
Let any axis OK cut
the circle in K, and
from K draw KM perpendicular to UV.
   Then UM is the moment of inertia about OK,
         VM is the moment about OL (perpendicular to OK),
and      KM is the product of inertia about OK, OL.
   For, taking the area of the section as unity, which does
not affect the relations between the quantities,
      ‘ UM=UT + TM=J§~(az + b”) + &(az—b’) cos 29,
                         =a2 cos2 9 + b2 sin’t9=lc2 ;
        VM=VT—TM=a2 sin"0+b2 cos2 9:12;
        KM=TK sin23=§ (02—- ()2) sin 20 =h.
   These relations hold in whatever position the circle OAB is,
and therefore 0 may be in the same straight line with MK,
in which case OM=MK. Hence, if the moments and product
about OK, OL are given, we have the following construction
for the principal axes :—
   On OK take OM=the given product of inertia, measuring
OM in the positive or negative direction according as the
product is positive or negative. From M draw MU parallel to
OL in the positive direction equal to the moment about OK,
and in the opposite direction draw MV equal to the moment
about OL, so that UV is the sum of the moments. Bisect
UV in T, and with centre T, radius TO, describe a circle
cutting UV in A and B.         Then OA, OB are the principal
axes, and UA, UB the moments about them.

     The proof is the converse of the              Fig 3.
 preceding proof. The only thing                         U
 requiring special consideration is
 whether the axis of minimum
 moment will fall in the proper                        B
 quadrant KOL, i. e. in the positive                   /
 quadrant if OM is positive, and        +L          /
 out of it if OM is negative.                     /
     The axis of minimum moment                 /        T
 will evidently be in the same quad-         /
 rant as the point U from which
 the moments are measured, and                 91: M
                                          0 \4:\
 by the construction U will be in                   \ \
 the <U+FB01>rst quadrant if OM is posi-                      A
 tive and in the second if OM is
 negative; which completes the                           v
 proof.
    The expressions for the principal moments in terms of the
 given moments and product are easily deduced from the <U+FB01>gure,

and the angle AOK (9) is given by the equation
                    tan 20=tanKTA=p2_L,.,.. . . . (5)
These equations are of course deducible from the relations
 (1), (2), and (3)
                       Stresses and Strains.
    The above construction is also very useful for the graphic
determination of principal stresses and principal strains from
given two-dimensional stress or strain conditions in any two
rectangular directions, as the equations are exactly of the
same form as (4) and
    Thus, let OX, OY be two given rectangular directions, and
let 1;, be the normal component and q the tangential compo
nent of a given stress on planes perpendicular to OY, and
[12, q the normal and tangential components of a given stress
on planes perpendicular to OX, the whole action being
restricted to the plane XOY; and let 191, p, be considered
positive when tensile, and 9 positive when it tends to produce
positive sliding, i. e. when it tends to diminish the angle
between +OX and +OY.

   LIV. On the Distinction between Spectral Lines of Solar and
           Terrestrial Origin. By Prof. M. A. CORNU".
                             [Plate VIII.]
 '     RAUNHOFER, when he discovered the dark lines with
          which the solar spectrum is crossed, gave them names
 in order to facilitate description ; the principal lines were de
 signated by the letters A, B, . . . H in such a way as to separate
 approximately the seven principal colours of the spectrum.
 The subsequent observations of Brewster, Dr. Gladstone, and
  M. Janssen proved that, notwithstanding the symmetry of
  denomination and the identity of appearance, these dark lines
 belonged to two distinct classes. Indeed, the one preserves
 always the same aspect, while the other becomes broader and
  darker as the sun approaches the horizon.
      The <U+FB01>rst, most of which have been identi<U+FB01>ed with the bright
  lines due to metallic vapours (iron, magnesium, calcium,
  nickel, &c.), have been attributed, since the researches of
   Prof. Kirchhoff, to the absorption produced by metallic sub
  stances in a state of vapour on the surface of the sun. The
  other, in consequence of their intensity varying with the
  thickness of the atmosphere traversed by the sun’s rays, are
  explained by the selective absorption due to the cold gases or

vapours of' the earth’s atmosphere.         We ought then to distin
  uish the solar from the telluric lines.
    Thus, of the eight principal Fraunhofer-lines, six are cha
racteristic of metallic elements and are of solar origin (0 and
F, hydrogen ; D, sodium ; E, G, iron ; H, calcium) ; the
other two (A and B) are telluric.
    Fraunhofer had besides distinguished two complex groups,
namely a band a, very broad, in the extreme red, and a well
marked triple line, I), in the green ; b is solar (magnesium),
and a of terrestrial origin (fig. 1). Brewster, on discovering

              Solar spectrum, with principal lines marked.
new bands of variable intensity in the spectrum, added new
designations; it is suf<U+FB01>cient here to mention the band a:
situated in the orange, and the oband 3 in the yellow. These
symbols have been adopted by Angstrom (Spectre normal du
Soleil .
    Up) to the present time it has been considered a dif<U+FB01>cult,
and in any case a troublesome, matter to distinguish between
these two kinds of lines. It was necessary, in fact, to observe
the solar spectrum at two very different altitudes of the sun,
under various meteorological conditions, to be able to af<U+FB01>rm
that the Spectrum-lines do or do not change in intensity with
the thickness of the atmosphere or the quantity of water
vapour traversed by the solar rays.
    The improvement of spectroscopes, in respect of the sharp
ness and especially of the dispersion of the lines, has allowed
me to arrive at a method which renders the distinction between
the two kinds of rays in a certain sense intuitive.
    This method is founded on a principle due to M. Fizeau*—
the principle of the displacement of the spectral lines of the
light emitted by a source which is in absolute or relative
motion. We easily obtain the expression for the apparent
wave-length 7U of a radiation from a point in motion with a

460       Prof. M. A. Cornu 0n the Distinction between
relative velocity v, the true wave-length being A, viz. :—
                         x’=x(1-%),
This principle may be applied directly to the light emitted by
the solar disk at the two extremities of an equatorial diameter.
    The absolute velocity v of a point on the solar equator is
 very sensibly 2 kilometres per second, that of the velocity of
 light, V, 300,000 kilometres per second. Hence we shall have
 a variation of wave-length equal to
                A)»: ihx
                                2 _ - a
                            300,000 _ i 150,000’
 + or — according as we take the same radiation at the eastern
 or western end of the solar equator.
    If we wish to know numerically the magnitude of the dis
 placement of a spectral line corresponding to this variation of
 wave-length, it is suf<U+FB01>cient to substitute for 7x the numerical
 value which de<U+FB01>nes the region which we wish to observe.
 Consider, for example, the two D lines (7&1: 588'40, X2: 588'89).
 The displacement of a line having 7t=589 will be
                                  589
                      m“— i 150,000'
 If we wish to com are this displacement with the distance
 between the two        lines (i. e. with 7&2—X1=O'49), we shall
 have as the relative displacement,
                A). _ +         589       _ 1 .
              7.2-», " — '49 x 150,000 " 124-8
 The double displacement will therefore be              or—_— of
 the distance between the two D lines.            124 8    62 4
    This total displacement, small as it is, is perfectly appre
 ciable with spectroscopes of very high dispersion, such as the
 prism-spectroscope of M. Thollon, and the instruments with
 diffraction-gratings constructed by Prof. Rowland of the
 University of Baltimore.                  ‘
    With the magni<U+FB01>cent grating presented by Prof. Rowland
 to the Ecole Polytechnique, the double displacement may
 become sensible almost with all the points of the solar contour ;
 that is to say, even with those which are far from giving the
 maximum separation.
    The experimental method consists in causing the images of
 the two extremities of the solar equator to fall alternately on
 the slit of the spectroscope. For this purpose the solar beam
 is received on a condensing-lens, which produces in the plane
 of the slit a sharp image of the solar disk. The substitution

         Spectral Lines of Solar and Terrestrial Origin.                   461
of one of the extremities for the other produces the double
displacement of the solar radiations, while it has no in<U+FB02>uence
upon the position of the absorption-lines of the atmosphere.
   The analysis of the optical conditions shows that perfect
sharpness of the displacement can only be obtained when three
experimental conditions are ful<U+FB01>lled :—
    1. The spectral images at the focus of the telescope of the
spectroscope must be aplanatic ; that is, such that the vertical
lines (spectral lines) and the horizontal lines (due to the im
perfections of the slit) are equally sharp in the same plane.
    2. This plane must coincide accurately with that of the
cross Wires.
    3. The focal image of the solar disk must be exactly in the
plane of the slit of the collimator.
    The omission of any one of these adjustments would involve
an abnormal displacement of the lines consequent upon a dis
placement of the collecting-lens. On the other hand, when
all these adjustments have been made the dark lines of terres
trial origin are perfectly <U+FB01>xed, while those of solar origin
move with extreme sharpness.
    If we take as a <U+FB01>xed mark a dust particle on one of the cross
wires, such as are always to be found on wires, we are able
to distinguish immediately, at a glance, solar from telluric rays.
    Finally, I may add that the displacement becomes still
more sensible when the substitution of one solar edge for the
 other is effected rhythmically. This is done by causing the
 collecting-lens to oscillate two or three times per second *.
    ' The following (see <U+FB01>g. 2) is the arrangement employed :—The col—
 lecting-lens C is carried by a. socket S S' which rests on the table U U’ of

 aid of the lever L. The pinion H serves to put the collecting-lens exactly
 in focus on the slit.

462     On Spectral Lines of Solar and Terrestrial Origin.
The eye then becomes sensitive to the least oscillation of the
lines.
    The distinguishing of the lines becomes then entirely
intuitive. We observe each spectral line, and the result is
such as would be produced by shaking it. If it remains im
movable, it is a tellnric line ; if it oscillates, it is a solar line.
    The study of the tellnric lines of the solar spectrum becomes
therefore in<U+FB01>nitely easier than heretofore. I have devoted to
this study the fine days of the last few years, and the results
have been very fruitful. Amongst the most interesting of the
observations I may mention :— (1) the anatomy of Angstrtim’s
group a (see Plate VIII.), in which I have succeeded in
detecting a group possessing the same constitution as the
bands A and B, according to the beautiful observation of
Prof. Langley; (2) the tellnric nature of a certain number
of lines beyond the band 8; and (3) the solar origin of the
line 1474 of Kirchhoff: this line is double under strong dis
persion, and as it oscillates we may conclude that the vapour
which absorbs the radiations of which it takes the place is
carried round by the rotation of the sun *.
   it The oscillation of the lines is not the only means of distinguishing
the two kinds of lines. If (by means of a Wollaston’s double re<U+FB01>'acting
prism) we obtain two ima es of the solar disk in such a. way that the
two opposite extremities of t e equatorial diameter are tangent and normal
to the slit (<U+FB01>g. 3), the tellnric lines T T' of the spectra of the two images

   To sum up: Physicists and astronomers have now in their
hands an extremely useful method for studying the constitu
tion of the solar spectrum, a method which enables us to dis
tinguish at a glance between lines of solar and terrestrial origin.

The Volcanoes of Japan. By JOHN MILNE. Transactions of the
   Seismological Society of Japan, Vol. IX. Part II. Svo. Yoko
   hama, 1886: pp. 184, with a map and numerous sketches.
      R. JOHN MILNE, F.G.S., occupies the whole of this Part of
         the Transactions with another of his important papers on the
Volcanic Phenomena of Japan. Rich as Japan is in the possession
of Volcanoes, there does not appear to have been any native author
who has endeavoured to describe in full these conspicuous land
marks. From the limited bibliography of native works on the
subject (avowedly imperfect, and no doubt dif<U+FB01>cult to collect) given
in this Memoir, we can only note one which, from its title, would
appear to be a de<U+FB01>nite treatise, namely no. 26, KyzZs-hz't Kwaza'n Ron,
by Aoe Shin, giving an account of the Volcanoes in Ky<U+FB01>sh<U+FB01>. Of
European writers, Naumann, Von Drasche, and D. H. Marshall
have contributed to our scanty knowledge; but it has been left for
John Milne, in addition to his many notes on the subject, to
supply us with this systematic and exhaustive work on the “ more
important Volcanoes of Japan.”
    After the bibliography, which consists of 42 references, and
which would have been more valuable had the dates been given,
Mr. Milne proceeds at once to take the Volcanoes individually, on
a plan of his own, not easy to follow and apparently with no de<U+FB01>nite
 arrangement. A minute account of the date and extent of each
recorded eruption is given, together with many curious and inter
esting particulars as to the religious signi<U+FB01>cation attached thereto,
and the folk-lore concerning the mountain and its outbursts.
This is followed by a geological description, and accompanied by an
outline-sketch of the volcano, generally from a photograph.
    He <U+FB01>nishes this part of the Memoir with a table of all the
 known eruptions, showing a comparison of the activity in summer
 and winter months. The Japanese measurements, often used
 here, should have been translated or reduced to their English
 equivalents, in a table, or throughout, instead of in the rare and
 scattered instances met with.
    One hundred and sixty-two pages are devoted to these im
portant points; and Mr. Milne then goes on to give his conclu
 sions, from personal observation, that the two islands, Iturup and
Kunashiri, are older than any other members of the Japanese
the <U+FB01> ure (3) is modi<U+FB01>ed. The telluric lines remain vertical, while the
 solar ines are not only dislocated, but become oblique (see <U+FB01>g. 6). we
 have here a very delicate test which lends itself to photographic obser
 vations.

group, and that they “form the <U+FB01>rst of a series of stepping
stones which connect Japan, by means of Kamschatka, with the
remainder of Asia.”
   A few observations on the slope of the cones follow; and Mr.
Milne records one instance, that of the “small cone rising from
the upper crater of Cha-cha-Nobori,” in which the inclination is 37°.
A reference to another cone—Atatsu-Nobori, at p. 147,—“one side
having a slope of 50°, and the other of 49°”—might have been
repeated here.      Mr. Milne says that Atatsu-Nobori is “the
steepest volcanic cone I have yet seen.”
   Of the Kuriles, Mr. Milne writes, “They are, so to speak,
amongst the last of the links which together build up the Volcanic
chain which bounds the shores of the West Paci<U+FB01>c,” and “they are
probably contemporaneous with the younger volcanoes of Kam
schatka and Japan.”
   The author lays great stress on the importance of the Japanese
volcanoes as land-builders, and refers the low altitude of the
Kuriles, as compared with the Volcanic Peaks of Klutchewsk
(16,500 ft.) in Kamschatka, and of Fuji-yama (12,450 ft.), to the
fact that they were “probably built up from the bottom of an
ocean which is perhaps the deepest in the world.” The rocks
that he and his assistants collected appear to be augitic andesites.
The absence of lava-streams is noticed, and pointed out as “ sug
gestive of the way in which these islands have been built up ”—
by cindery accumulations or ash-beds. One of the most im
portant parts of the Memoir is the map of the Volcanoes of Japan,
in which the exact positions of one hundred and twenty-nine
active or extinct craters are indicated. In a table accompanying it,
a note is given of the height, and the nature of rock, with general
remarks concerning each volcano. Of the 129, <U+FB01>fty-one are still
active. Thirty-nine have symmetrically formed cones.
   The paper concludes with well-considered remarks on the
Relative Age of all of them, the characters of their Lavas and
other Rocks, the intensity of Eruptions, and the general form of
the Volcanoes. To assist the student in following the author on
the last-mentioned subject he has reproduced the diagrammatic plate
from the ‘Geological Magazine’ for 1878, and added a plate of
various pro<U+FB01>les of Fuji—san (“ called by foreigners Fuji-yama”) from
photographs and surveys of the mountain ; and he quotes an inter
esting series of causes which help to modify the natural curvature
of a volcano. Some important notes also are given as to the
height of Fuji-san; and the conclusion Mr. Milne arrives at is
that the proper height should be taken as between 12,400 and
12,450 feet. The memoir is profusely illustrated with lithograph
sketches, chie<U+FB02>y exact outlines of the various cones referred to.

IT is now nearly a quarter of a century since Dr. Croll <U+FB01>rst enun

                                                                    ’

 a problem which previous to that time had engaged and perplexed
 many minds. Till Dr. Groll’s famous theory appeared in the pages
 of this Magazine, no hypothesis had been propounded which satis<U+FB01>ed
 the conditions of the problem even as known at the time; while
 the various tentative explanations for the most part demanded the
 calling into existence of agencies and of terrestrial changes which
 would themselves be more dif<U+FB01>cult to account for than the phe
 nomena they were meant to explain.         It was from the <U+FB01>rst seen
 and conceded that the varying eccentricity of the ecliptic, upon
 which Dr. Croll bases his theory, has a real existence in nature;
 and the only points then, and now, in dispute have relation to the
 manner and extent to which these cosmical causes a<U+FB01>ect terrestrial
 climate and conditions. Early in the century, Sir John Herschel,
 Arago, and others had given attention to the question of the rela
 tion of eccentricity to climate; and they came to the conclusion
that it neither a<U+FB01>ects the amount of heat received from the earth
 nor, to any appreciable extent, its distribution.
    Dr. Oroll thus brought out his theory in the face of, and against,
 the con<U+FB01>dently expressed opinion of some of the greatest authorities
 in physical science. The door which he sought to open had been
 of<U+FB01>cially barred for a long generation, and when he pushed through
 it he found no beaten path on the other side. Notwithstanding all
 that had been written about the Glacial Epoch, the facts and phe
 nomena of the period were but imperfectly stated and understood,
 and the science of Climatology was either non-existent or in the
 most chaotic condition. Gradually and laboriously he built up his
 theory ; he accumulated facts and observations with the most pains
 taking industry; and these he marshalled and arranged with con
 summate skill, till he built up and solidly buttressed one of the
 most important and far-reaching doctrines which has been enun
 ciated in the whole range of geological science. In dealing with
 the climatological and other physical facts and bearings of his sub
 ject, Dr. Croll had little help from the investigations of those who
 had gone before him. He had, indeed, to combat many erroneous
 notions which had become generally entertained from the works of
 popular writers. Of the great physicists, some had given opinions
 directly opposed to Dr. Croll’s contentions; others had given no
 consideration to the climatological relations of terrestrial and cos
 mical phenomena; and many were by no means agreed as to the
 effects of such phenomena. Thus there was scarcely any ready
 made help available for incorporation with Dr. Oroll’s work; he
 had few witnesses to call in his favour; he had many stumbling
 blocks to remove, much to explain away, and much to argue against.
 With indomitable patience and perseverance he set himself to his
 task ; with calmness and temperance, and yet with marvellous in
tellectual alertness, he met the arguments of opponents, adhering
to his position, and maintaining his view, with modest tenacity and
resolution, which commanded the respect and esteem of his most
powerful opponents.
_ The greater part of what Dr. Croll has written on the subject of

466               Notices respecting New Books.
geological climate, and the principal controversies which have arisen
in connection with the theory, have appeared in the pages of this
Magazine, and may be presumed to be familiar to its readers. His
own contributions to the controversy during the last ten years Dr.
Croll has now gathered together, and presented to the public in the
volume which forms the occasion of this notice. The work is
largely controversial in tone, more taken up with maintaining the
position of the theory as enunciated in ‘ Climate and Time ’ than
in broadening its foundations by new views, or even in resolving
dif<U+FB01>culties and clearing the logical path along which Dr. Croll leads
his adherents. Dr. Croll is not prepared to accept any of the modi
<U+FB01>cations of his theory which have been proposed; still less is he
inclined to coincide in the arguments which would be subversive of
his position. In the preface to this volume he intimates that he has
now spoken his last word in defence of his theory. “There are
many of the topics discussed,” he says, “ which I could have wished
to consider more at length ; but advancing years and declining
health constrain me to husband my remaining energies for work in
a wholly different <U+FB01>eld of inquiry—work which has never lost for
me its fascination, but which has been laid aside for upwards of a
quarter of a century.” Such a decided intimation of withdrawal
from a controversy in which he has so long been the principal <U+FB01>gure
surely forms a <U+FB01>tting occasion for an acknowledgment of the vast
and varied services Dr. Croll has rendered to an obscure branch of
science, of the amount of intellectual activity and industry to which
his writings have given rise, of the large measure of light he has
thrown on What appeared to be the most complex and puzzling
phenomenon which meets the student at the very gateway of geo
logical investigation, and to the stimulating and suggestive models
he has afforded for dealing with the ravelled skein of geological
history in many of its departments.
   Dr. Croll’s theory, all opposition notwithstanding, holds the <U+FB01>eld.
Many have taken objection to the entire fabric, and still more have
been opposed to various propositions by which the theory is sup
ported; but no opponent has been able to suggest that most
powerful of all arguments—a counter—theory. It is almost a me
lancholy sight to see the learned President of the British Association
falling back upon the antiquated Lyellian doctrine. Whatever
may satisfy the conditions of the problem of Glacial periods, it is
now well known that Sir Charles Lyell’s theory of polar continents
and tropical oceans will not supply the key ; but Principal Dawson
can discover, or has at his service, no other.      But although no
effective counter-theory has been started, even as a stalking-horse,
against the Croll doctrine, it is not to be concluded that the con
troversy is at an end, and that henceforth the theory that periodic
changes of climate are primarily caused by Eccentricity is to be
accepted as an article of faith in the schools of geological and phy
sical orthodoxy. It would indeed be u misfortune were the con
troversy, which has gone on so briskly for about twenty—<U+FB01>ve years,
to be allowed to subside. Authorities who are prepared to accept

the cardinal points of the doctrine are by no means agreed as to
many of the assumptions on which it is based, nor as to the
issues of the argument for the case. The whole subject is compa
ratively new, and the men who are entitled to express an opinion
on it are not numerous. Ere a general concensus of opinion can
be arrived at much investigation and debate are necessary; foot by
foot solid ground must be conquered, and it will be found, as truth
emerges, that it will illumine, not only much that is yet obscure in
the theory of climatic perturbations, but that, like all truth, it will
become the fertile mother of a long line of exact knowledge.

on THE MAGNETIC ROTATION or MIXTURES or WATER WITH
    sonn or THE ACIDS or THE FATTY seams, WITH ALCOHOL,
    AND WITH snarnmnc ACID; AND OBSERVATIONS ON WATER
    or CRYSTALLIZATION *. BY w. n. PERKIN, PH.D., mas.
FROM the Author’s previous work on the magnetic rotation of
       compounds it was found that the molecular magnetic rotation
 of water, which is taken as unity, is not the same as the sum of
the values of oxygen and two of hydrogen, as deduced from the
molecular magnetic rotation of other bodies. Thus hydrogen is
found to be 0254, whilst hydrogen in hydroxyl varies from 0'194
in ordinary alcohol to 0137 in monobasic acids, and is 0261 in
 carbonyl; so that, taking the lowest number, it gives H2+O=
 0645, and taking the highest it is 0'769.
    From these facts it appeared that the determination of the mag
 netic relation of hydrated bodies might give numbers which would
 show whether they contained water or whether the substances with
 which it was mixed had combined so as to form new compounds.
 If the former were the case the molecular rotation should represent
 that of the compound + that of water; if the latter, it should be
 lower than this. For example, if formic acid were mixed with
 water, molecular proportions being used, either H.COOH+H,O
 or H.0(HOa) might be produced. In the <U+FB01>rst case the rotation
 should be

   As some of the fatty acids have been believed to unite with water,
to form trihydric alcohols, they were elected for examination; and
at the same time hydrated alcohol was also examined, because it
could not form a compound with water, and would therefore act as
a check upon the results.                                   -
   The results of the examination show that formic, acetic, and
propionic acids, when mixed with water, do not form new com
pounds, but that the products simply consist of these bodies and
water.
   Sulphuric acid in the pure and hydrated conditions was next
examined, viz.‘ H2804, H,SO,+H,O, H2804+2H,O, and 11,804+
311,0. The numbers obtained in this case show that combination
takes place chie<U+FB02>y when one molecule of water has been added, only
to a small extent in the case of the second addition, and scarcely
at all when the third is added; and the author gives reasons for
considering that sulphuric acid combines with one molecule of water
only, forming the compound (HO),SO.
   Whilst studying the nature of the hydrated products, the author’
attention was drawn to the subject of water of crystallization ; and
from the inconsistency as to the presence or absence of water of
crystallization in compounds of the same class—as, for example,
in those of silver, potassium, and sodium, and also methyl bromide,
as compared with analogous compounds—he considers it impossible
to believe that water of crystallization has any relationship to
chemical combination ; that of course refers to water when it exists
as such, and not to hydrogen and oxygen present in the proportions
found in water but otherwise combined. If this be so, it is thought
that its association with chemical compounds is most likely con—
nected with the building-up of the crystalline form, it being dif<U+FB01>
cult to see what other part it can play ; and the reason why some
compounds crystallize without and some with water of crystalliza
tion is probably determined by the tendency to produce that form
which can be the most readily built up : if that form can result from
the anhydrous salt, anhydrous crystals are formed ; if with the salt
and water, then the crystals will contain water of crystallization ;
and it is well known how change of conditions will cause variation
in the proportions of water of crystallization, and also form of
crystal.
   These observations would also apply to compounds crystallizing
with alcohol, acetic acid, benzene, &c., and to some double salts,
where one or more of the constituents would act like water of
crystallization.  Attention is drawn to the fact that if the above
view of water of crystallization be correct, it is evident that a salt
containing water of crystallization will be resolved into water and
the salt on breaking up of the crystalline form by solution, which
is believed to be the case by many who have studied the subject
of solution.—The Chemical News, Oct. 22, 1886.

LVII. Notes on Electricity and Magnetism.-——II. The Self
   induction and Resistance of Compound Conductors. By
   Lord RAYLEIGH, Sec. R.S., D. C.L.*
BEFORE entering upon the proper subject of this com
       munication, I take the earliest opportunity of correcting
a mistake of some importance into which I fell in connection
with induction-coils.     From the fact that a closed magnetic
circuit acts very ill as a store of energy, I argued that closed
electromagnet-s were to be condemned as secondary generators
(Phil. Mag. Au 1st 1886, p. 179). Dr. Hopkinson and Prof.
Ewing have in ependently drawn my attention to the fact
that the success of induction-coils does not depend upon
storage of energy, and that they might work with hi h ef<U+FB01>
ciency even though the whole of the energy put into 0 iron
were wasted. Prof. Ewing’s remark, to which I took excep
tion, is thus perfectly correct.
   In his inaugural address to the Society of Telegraph Engi
neers‘l', and in a subsequent communication to the Royal
Societyi, Prof. Hu hes has described a series of interesting
experiments, which ave attracted a good deal of attention
in consequence both of the o<U+FB02>icial position and known expe
rimental skill of the author. Some of the conclusions which
he advances can hardly be sustained, and have met with severe
criticism at the hands of Weber, Heaviside, and others. There

470          Lord Rayleigh on the Self-induction and
are certain other points raised by him, or sug ested by his
work, which seem worthy of consideration ; an I propose in
the present paper to give an account of some investigations,
mainly experimental, carried on during the summer months,
which may, I hope, tend to settle some controverted questions.
    Prof. Hughes’s <U+FB01>rst apparatus consists of a Wheatstone’s
quadrilateral, with a telephone in the bridge, one of the sides
of the quadrilateral being the wire or coil under examination,
and the other three being the parts into which a single
German-silver wire is divided by two sliding contacts. If the
battery-branch be closed, and a suitable interrupter be intro
duced into the telephone-branch, balance may be obtained by
shifting the contacts. Provided that the interrupter introduces
no electronwtive force of its own*, the balance indicates the
proportionality of the four resistances. If P be the unknown
resistance of the conductor under test, Q, R the resistances of
the adjacent parts of the divided wire, S that of the opposite
plart (between the sliding contacts), then, by the ordinary rule,
   S=QR; while Q, R, S are subject to the relation
                          Q+R+S=W,
W beinga constant. If now the interrupter be transferred
from the tele hone to the battery-branch, the balance is usu
ally disturbed) on account of induction, and cannot be restored
b any more shifting of the contacts. In order to compensate
tli'e induction, another influence of the same kind must be
introduced. It is here that the peculiarity of the apparatus
lies. A coil is inserted in the battery and another in the
telephone-branch, which act inductively upon one another,
and are so mounted that the effect may be readily varied.
The two coils may be concentric and relatively movable about
the common diameter. In this case the action vanishes when
the     lanes are perpendicular.       If one coil be very much
smal er than the other, the coef<U+FB01>cient of mutual induction M
is proportional to the cosine of the angle between the planes.
By means of the two adjustments, the sliding contact and the
rotating coil, it is usually possible to obtain a fair silence.
    In his address Prof. Hughes interpreted his observations on
the basis of an assumption that the self-induction of P was
represented by M, irrespective of resistance, and that the
resistance to variable currents could (as in the case of steady
currents) be equated to QR/S. In the discussion which fol
lowed I pointed out that this was by no means generally true,
   * This condition is not always satis<U+FB01>ed.   With the reed-interrupter
(see below) a. loud sound may sometimes be heard, although the batterv
branch be open.

              Resistance of Compound Conductors.                 471
and I gave the following formulaf‘F as applicable to the case
in which the only sensible induction among the sides of the
quadrilateral is the self-induction L of the conductor P :—
                                 QR—SP=P2ML,             . . . (1)
                      M(P+Q+R+S)=SL.                  .  .   . . (2)
The electrical vibrations are here supposed to follow the har
monic law, with frequency p/2vr.           “It will be seen that the
ordinary resistance balance (SP: QR) is departed from. The
change here considered is peculiar to the apparatus, and, so
far as its influence is concerned, it does not indicate a rea
alteration of resistance in the wire. Moreover, since )0 is
involved, 'the disturbance depends upon the rapidity of vibra
tion, so that in the case of ordinary mixed sounds silence can
be attained only approximately. Again, from the second
equation we see that M is not in general a correct measure of
the value of L. If, however, P be very small, the desired
condition of things is approached; since, by the construction
of the apparatus, Q+R+ S is constant (say W), and if P be
small enough S does not differ much from W, i. 0. most of
the wire forming the three sides of the combination is devoted
to the member opposite to P.”
   The formulae are easily proved. Since there is no current
through the bridge, there must be the same current (.22) in P
and one of the adjacent sides (say) R, and for a like reason
the same current y in the sides Q and S. The difference of
potentials at time t between the junction of P and R and the
junction of Q and S may be expressed by each of the three
following equated quantities :—
                         dw _          d(.v +y) _     _    _
           Qy'Pw Ldt—               M     dt    _-Rw Sy,
from which the required results are obtained by elimination
of the ratio w : y, and introduction of the supposition that all
the quantities vary harmonically with frequency p/Zvr.
   The inadequacy of Prof. Hughes’s original interpretation
has been remarked upon also by Prof. Weber‘l' and by Mr. O.
 Heavisidei, who have obtained the corrected formulae.              I
 give them here because I agree with Prof. Weber that this
 form of apparatus possesses distipct advantages. As he points
out, if P be known, the application of (2) really presents no
dif<U+FB01>culty, and allows of L being readily found in terms of M.

 472           Lord Rayleigh on the Self-induction and
     There are many cases in which we may be sure beforehand
 that P (the effective resistance of the conductor, or combina
 tion of conductors, to the variable currents) is the same as if
  the currents were steady, and then P may be regarded as
  known. There are other cases, however,—some of them will
  be treated below,—in which this assumption cannot be made ;
  and it is impossible to determine the unknown quantities L
  and P from (2) alone. We may now fall back upon (1). By
  means of the two equations, P and L can always be found in
  terms of the other quantities.         But among these is included
  the frequency of vibration ; so that the method is only prac
  tically applicable when the interrupter is such as to give an
  absolute periodicity. A scraping contact, otherwise very
  convenient, is thus excluded“; and this is undoubtedly an
  objection to the method.
      My own experiments have been made with three different
  forms of apparatus. The <U+FB01>rst was constructed upon the model
  of that originally described by Hughes, and still to be pre
  ferred for some purposes. The others will be described in due
  cdurse ; but it will be convenient to consider <U+FB01>rst those parts
  which are common—the interrupters and the induction
  compensators.
                              The Inte'r'rupters.
      When regular vibrations are not required, a scraping con
   tact interrupter is the least troublesome. Mine is of the
  roughest possible construction. It is driven by a small jet of
   water issuing from a glass nozzle in communication with a
  'tap, and impinging upon blades bent in a piece of tin plate
   and revolving about a vertical axis. The upper part of the
   axis carries a small cylinder of roughened iron, against which
   a brass spring lightly presses. As in Hughes’s apparatus, the
   scraping contact is periodically broken altogether by a pro
  jecting <U+FB01>nger, which during part of the revolution pushes
   back the brass spring. This is a point of some importance,
   for a faint scraping sound is far better heard and identi<U+FB01>ed
   when thus rendered intermittent. The apparatus stands in
   the sink, so that the water scattered from the revolving blades
   runs away without giving trouble. The pressure exercised
   by the contact-spring requires readjustment from day to day
. if the loudest sound is wanted.
      But for many of the most interesting experiments a scraping
   contact is unsuitable.       Prof. Hughes has found, indeed, that
     * A toothed-wheel interru tar, as usually emphloyed, does not give a
   regular vibration of the perio corresponding to t e passage of a tooth.

              Resistance of Compound Conductors.             1473
in some cases the natural pitch of the telephone-plate is pre
dominant; so that the vibration, as it reaches the ear, is not
quite so mixed as might have been expected from its origin.
When, however, the induction and resistance under observap
tion are rapidly varying functions of the frequency of vibra
tion, it is evident that no sharp results can be obtained
without an interrupter giving a perfectly regular electrical
vibration. With proper appliances an absolute silence, or at
least one disturbed only by a slight sensation of the octave of
the principal tone, can be obtained under circumstances where
a sci'laping contact would admit of no approach to a balance
at a .                                                          v
   A thoroughly satisfactory interrupter of this kind has not,
to my knowledge, been constructed. Tuning-forks, driven
electromagnetically with liquid or solid contacts, answer
well so long as the frequency required does not exceed 128 or
256 per second; but here we desire frequencies of from 500
to 2000. My experiments have been made with harmonium
reeds as interrupters, the vibrating tongue making contact
once during each period with the slightly rounded end of a
brass or iron wire, which can be advanced exactly to the
required position by means of a screw out upon it. Blown
with a well regulated wind, such reeds have given good
results even up to 2000 (complete) vibrations per second;
but they are often capricious and demand frequent readjust
ment. The reed which I have usually employed makes
about 1050 vibrations per second, and answered its purpose
fairly well. Hitherto I have not been able to satisfy myself
as to the cause of the falling off in ef<U+FB01>ciency, which often sets
in suddenly, and persists until cured by a readjustment.
Another objection to this interrupter is the simultaneous ro
duction of loud aerial sounds, which must be prevented rom
reaching the ear of the observer at the telephone by several
interposed doors.
                  The Induction- Compensators.
   Two instruments, similar in all respects, were made by my
assistant Mr. Gordon, much after the pattern employed by
Prof. Hughes.     In each there is a small coil mounted so that
one diameter coincides with a diameter of a larger coil, and
movable about that diameter. The mutual induction M
between the two circuits depends upon the position given to
the smaller coil, which is read off by a pointer attached to it
and moving over a graduated circle. The circles are so
divided that the reading (0) would * be zero when the axes
             ' The position is mechanically unattainable.

 474          Lord Rayleigh on the Self—induction and
  of the coils were coincident, or the planes parallel. In this
  position M is arithmetically a maximum (M0); and we con
  sider its algebraic sign to be positive. At 90°, when the
  axes are at right angles, M=0. At 180° M would be nega
  tive, and of the same arithmetic value (M0) as at 0°.
     The coils are wound upon boxwood rings, and in each there
 are 45 convolutions. The mean diameters are about 3 inches
 and 1% inch.
     Some of the earlier experiments were interpreted by a
 theory of the compensator, which I knew at the time to be
 very rough. If the small coil be treated as in<U+FB01>nitely small,
 then
                           M= M0 cos 0.
    On the same supposition we have, from the roughly measured
 dimensions,
                       M0: 60,000 centim.
     The law of the simple cosine was found to lead to consi
 derable anomalies; and when at a later date (August 19) I
 carried out my intended calibrations, some very curious
 results revealed themselves.
     The best arrangement for calibration and for determination
 of the constant of the instruments is to institute distinct pri
 mary and secondary circuits.    The former included a battery,
 9. scraping contact (p. 472), and the two outer (larger) coils
 of the compensators. The latter included the two inner coils
 and a telephone. The precise procedure will depend upon
 whether we can assume the exact equality of the two com
 pensators. In that case we may introduce, and retain during
 the observations, another air of induction-coils, one of course
 in the primary and the other in the secondary circuit, and of
 such power as to produce a displacement of about 30° of the
 compensator. Thus, while in the absence of the additional
 coils, balance would be obtained when both compensators stand
 at 90°, their introduction would lead to such readings as 90°,
 60°; 100°, 70°; 110°, 80°; &c. By this means various parts
 of the scale of one compensator can be compared with non
corresponding parts of the other; and this is suf<U+FB01>cient if the
two are similar.
    This method was used ; but it is perhaps better to arrange so
that each compensator is calibrated independently of the other.
In this case alternate readings are taken with and without the
cooperation of the additional coils; and the equivalent induc
tion is found for each compensator at various parts of its
scale. The following set of readings will give an idea of the
modus operandi.

   It will be seen that the adjustment is made alternately on
the two compensator-s. Thus in the second compensator the
steps 30°— 421°, 42i°— 53°, 53°— 64°, &c. have all the same
value, whatever may be the construction of the <U+FB01>rst compen
sator, which indeed need not be <graduated at all. In like
manner, the steps from 92°-102=§ , 102§°- 113°, &c. on the
<U+FB01>rst compensator have an equal value.
   An examination of these and other results, not here re
corded, leads to the unexpected conclusion that from 40°
to 140°, 2'. e. ,through a range of 100° about the perpendi
cular position, the scale of induction does not differ appre
ciably from the scale of degrees. From 30° to 40°, or from
140° to 150°, the induction is something like a tenth part
less than that corresponding to 10° in the neighbourhood of
90°.    Within the whole mechanical range of the instruments,
from 30° to 150°, there could scarcely be an error of 2 per
cent. in assuming M proportional to the angle measured from
perpendicularity, i. e. (tr—0), or, say, 0’.
   The general explanation of this very convenient property
is not dif<U+FB01>cult to understand ; since for high values of 0’ the
approximation over the whole circumference of coils of not
very unequal diameters must lead to a more rapid increase of
M than if the smaller coil were very small; and it is con
ceivable that for some particular ratio of diameters the
increase may just so much exceed that represented by sin 9',
as to correspond nearly to 6’. I was desirous, however, of
explaining this very peculiar relation more completely, and
have therefore developed the theory for the case of a ratio of
2 : I (nearly that of my apparatus) on the basis of formulae
given by Maxwell. The details of the calculation are given
in the form of an appendix (p. 498).

476          Lord Rayleigh on the Setf-induction and
    It may suf<U+FB01>ce here to say that the experimental result is
abundantly con<U+FB01>rmed ; and that reason is found for the con
clusion that the proportionality of induction to angle would
be even better maintained if the diameter of the smaller coil
were increased from '50 to '55 of that of the larger.          The
non-mathematical reader may be content to accept this pro
 portionality over most of the range of the actual instruments
 upon the experimental evidence.
    The absolute value of the induction-coef<U+FB01>cient corresponding
 to each degree of the compensators was determined at the time
of the calibration by comparison with the calculable induction
 coef<U+FB01>cient between two coils wound in measured grooves cut
on the surface of a wooden cylinder. These coils contained
respectively 21 and 22 convolutions ; and the induction
coe<U+FB01>icient for the mean windings is found to be 277 '3 centim.
by a calculation of which it is not necessary to record the
details. Hence, for the actual coils,
             M=21 X 22 x 277'3=1'281 x 105 centim.
 The obvious procedure for the comparison would be to com—
 bine the compensators without additional coils, so as to obtain
 a balance at the telephone when both stand at 90°, and then
 to observe the displacement or displacements necessary when
 the standard cylinder coils are introduced. In my case,
 however, the range of induction provided by the compensators
 was insuf<U+FB01>cient to balance the standard, if used in this way, even
 when displacements were made in such (opposite) directions
 as to cooperate in changing the total induction. An addi
 tional pair of coils was therefore introduced, for the purpose,
  as it were, of shifting the zero, of which nothing required to
 be known, since they remained connected whether or not the
 standard coils were in operation. With this modi<U+FB01>cation,
 balance could be attained in both cases.
     With standard coils in, one pair of readings was 130°,
 43?; and with standard coils out, 50°, 127#°. The connections
  were such that when there was no external change, the cor
  res ondin readings would move in the same direction (p. 475);
 an thus e number of degrees of one compensator equivalent
 to the standard is
                 130-50+127§-4212~, viz. 165.
 Accordingly, every degree of either compensator, not too far
 removed from the middle of the range, represents 77 6'3 centim.
 of induction-coef<U+FB01>cient.
     The maximum coef<U+FB01>cient, when 0=0, according to Table
 II. (Appendix), would be about 56100 centim.

   In view of the statement* “that the coe<U+FB02>icient of mutual
induction is less in iron than in cop er wires,” Imay mention
an experiment made with the aid 0 one of the compensators,
in which the effect of the substitution of iron for copper is
directly examined. The mutual induction measured is that
between two circuits, one of which was composed of the two
copper coils of 21 and 22 convolutions spoken of above
connected in series; and the other of a single turn of wire
situated midway between, and lying in a shallow scratch or
groove on the wooden cylinder, by which its position was
accurately de<U+FB01>ned. The arrangements being the same as in
the determination of the constant of the compensator, the
value of the double induction (obtained by reversal) between
the circuit of a single turn of copper wire and the circuit of
43 turns was 40°‘7. The single turn of copper wire was now
replaced by a turn of iron wire of equal diameter and bedded
 in the same scratch, with the result that the double induction
 was 40°15, the same value being obtained whether the iron
 wire were included in the primary circuit with the battery and
interrupter, or in the secondary with the telephone. Care
had, of course, to be exercised in the disposition of the leads,
in consequence of the use of a single turn only for one of the
 circuits. So far as the experiment could show, the induction
is absolutely the same, whether the single turn be of iron or
 of copper.
    To return new to the bridge arrangement, the following
 are a few examples of the use of the original form of appa
 ratus. The scale of the wire readings was in          inch, the
 whole length (Q+R+ S) being 1960. In ohms the resist,
 ance of the whole wire is 4'00. The interrupter was the “reed,”
making about 1050 (complete) vibrations per second. Thus
                          11:271' X 1050.
 The <U+FB01>rst case is that of a helix of insulated copper wire,
 without core of any kind. To get a balance the compensator
 had to be placed at 54°, so that M=36°, each degree re
 presenting 776 centim. The resistances also necessary were
            Q=610, R: 190;          therefore 5: 1160.
 They are expressed in scale-divisions, the value of each
 of which is

This is the effective resistance to variable currents of the
frequency in question.

The resistance to variable currents, calculated by the correct
formula: with knowledge of the frequency of vibration, is thus
almost identical with the value found with steady currents;
whereas if we were to ignore the disturbance of the ordinary
resistance rule by induction, we should erroneously conclude
that the resistance to variable currents was some 12 per cent.
higher than to steady currents.
   Of other experiments made with this coil I will only men
tion one. When a stout copper rod was inserted, the circum

with variable currents to
                Q: 660, R=190;             M=29§°.
   The effective self-induction is evidently diminished, and the
effective resistance increased in accordance with the universal
rule *. The precise values may be obtained from our two
fundamental equations, in the manner exempli<U+FB01>ed above.
   If the fore oing experiment (with the copper core) be
attempted ' with the scraping-contact interrupter, giving a
mixed sound, no de<U+FB01>nite balance is obtainable.

iron about 1‘} metre long and 3'3 millim. diameter. Here

period as before,

lead to an error of 1% per cent. only. _                 .

We may conclude that the effective resistance to variable
currents of this frequency (1050) is 1'84 times the resistance
to steady currents.
   A long length of wire from the same hank was examined
later by another method (p. 488), and gave for the ratio in
question 1'89.
   In some of his experiments‘l' Prof. Hughes found that it
made but little difference to the self-induction of an iron wire,
whether it was arranged as a compact coil of several turns,
or as a single wide loop.        The question is readily examined
with the present form of apparatus; for, since the resistance
is not altered, the compensator readings give an accurate
relative measure of theself-induction. A hank of nineteen
convolutions of insulated soft iron wire required for balance
25°‘8; but when opened out into a single (approximately cir
cular) loop, the reading was only 11°‘2, a much greater differ
ence than that mentioned by Hughes.

480'         Lord Rayleigh on the Self-induction and
   A better experiment may be made with a coil of doubled
wire. The leno'th previously used was divided into halves,
which were tied together closely with cotton thread and bent
into a compact coil of 9 convolutions and about 4% inches dia
meter. When the two wires were connected in series, in such
a manner that the direction of electric circulation was the
same in both, the self-induction was represented by 240'2;
but when one wire was reversed, the self-induction fell to 9°‘2,
the large difference depending entirely upon the mutual
induction between the two iron wires.
   I had intended to apply this apparatus to investigate the
self-induction of wires of various materials and diameters,
formed into single circular loops, but the subject has been so
ably treated by Prof. Weber as to render further work un
necessary, at least as regards the non-magnetic metals.
   That the circle is the proper standard form for accurate
measurement cannot be doubted ; but the effect of magnetic
quality is shown most markedly when the wires compared are
of given length and diameter, and doubled so as to form single
close loops. For a total length 2l of copper wire, the self
induction is smallest when the wires are just in contact, and
then *
                               L = 3772 Z.
In practice some interval is required for insulation, so that
the coef<U+FB01>cient of I may perhaps be taken to be 4. To iron
wires the theory is not strictly applicable 1', but we may pro
bably assume without serious error
                 L=l(4 log 2+,u)=l(2'772+#),
a being the permeability. Prof. Hughes <U+FB01>nds for the ratio
of iron to copper under these circumstances 440 : 18 i ; accord
ing to which we should have

                              T "F’
or a=95, in approximate agreement with values found by
 other methods.
   Although the original apparatus of Hughes is capable of
 very good results, and is especially suitable when the wires
 under test are in but short lengths, the fact that induction
 and resistance are mixed up in the measurements is a decided
 drawback, if it be only because the readings require for their
 interpretation calculations not readily made upon the spot.

              Resistance of Compound Conductors.            481
The more obvious arrangement is one in which both the in
duction and resistance of the branch containing the subject
under examination are in every case brought up to the given
totals necessary for a balance. To carry this out conveniently
we require to be able to add selffinduction without altering
resistance, and resistance without altering self-induction, and
both in a measurable degree.     The <U+FB01>rst demand is easily met.
If we include in the circuit the two coils of an induction-com
pensator, connected in series, the self-induction of the whole
can be varied in a known manner by rotating the smaller
coil. For the self-induction of the instrument, used in this
manner, may be regarded as made up of the constant self—
inductions of the component coils taken separately, and of
twice the positive or negative mutual induction between them.
The <U+FB01>rst part, in consequence of its constancy, need not be
regarded ; and thus every degree (within the admissible
range) may be taken as representing 2x776'3, or 1552'6
cm., of self-induction.
   The introduction, or removal, of resistance without altera
tion of self-induction cannot well be carried out with rigour.
 But in most cases the object can be suf<U+FB01>ciently attained with
the aid of a resistance-slide of thin German-silver wire. It
may be in the form of a nearly close loop, the parallel out
going and return parts being separated bya thin lath of wood.
A spring of stout brass wire makin contact with both parts
short-circuits a greater or less lengt of the bight.
    In the Wheatstone’s quadrilateral, as arranged for these
 experiments, the adjacent sides R, S are made of similar
 wires of German silver of equal resistance           (g ohm).
 Being doubled they give rise to little induction, but the accu
 racy of the method is independent of this circumstance. The
 side P includes the conductor, or combination of conductors,
 under examination, an induction-compensator, and the resis
 tance-slide. The other side, Q, must possess resistance and
 self-induction greater than any of the conductors to be com
 pared, but need not be susceptible of ready and measurable
 variations. But, as a matter of fact, the second induction
 compensator was used in this branch, and gave certain advan
 tages in respect of convenience. Sometimes also a rheostat
 was included ; but during a set of comparisons the condition
 of this branch was usually maintained constant, the necessary
 variations being made in P. In order to avoid mutual in
 duction between the branches, P and Q were placed at some
 distance away, being connected with the rest of the apparatus
 by leads of doubled wire.
    It will be evident that when the interrupter acts in the

482          Lord Rayleigh on the Self-induction and
battery branch, balance can be obtained at the telephone in
the bridge only under the conditions that both the aggregate
self-induction and resistance in P are equal to the correspond
ing quantities in Q. Hence when one conductor is substi
tuded for another in P, the alterations demanded at the com
pensator and in the slide give respectively the changes of
self-induction and of resistance.
   In this arrangement the induction and resistance are well
separated, so that the results can be interpreted without cal
culation. During the month of July at large number of
observations on various combinations of conductors were
effected, but the results were not wholly satisfactory. There
seemed to be some uncertainty in the determination of resis
tance, due to the inclusion of the two movable contacts of the
resistance-slide in one of the sides (P) of the quadrilateral *.
I therefore pass on to describe a slight modi<U+FB01>cation by means
of which much sharper measurements were attainable.
    In order to get rid of the objectionable movable contacts,
some sacri<U+FB01>ce of theoretical simplicity seems unavoidable.
We can no longer keep Q (and therefore P when a balance
is attained) constant; but by reverting to the arrangement
adopted in a well-known form of Wheatstone’s bridge, we
cause the resistances taken from P to be added to Q, and vice
versd. The transferable resistance is that of a straight wire
of German silver, with which one telephone terminal makes
contact at a point whose position is read o<U+FB02>' on a divided
scale. Any uncertainty in the resistance of this contact does
not in<U+FB02>uence the measurements.
                                Fig. 1.
    The diagram shows the connection of the parts. One of
the telephone terminals goes to the junction of the (1.; ohm)
resistances R and S, the other to a point upon the divided
wire. The branch P includes one compensator (with coils
connected in series), the subject of examination, and part of
the divided wire.     The branch Q includes the second com
pensator (replaceable by a simple coil possessing suitable

second apparatus.

 self-induction), a rheostat, or any resistance roughly adjust
 able from time to time, and the remainder of the divided wire.
 The battery branch, in which may also be included the in
 terrupter, has its terminals connected, one to the junction
 of P and R, the other to the junction of Q and S. When it is
 desired to use steady currents, the telephone can of course be
 replaced by a galvanometer.
    In this arrangement, as in the other, balance requires that
 the branches P and Q be similar in respect both of self-in
 duction and of resistance. The changes in induction due to
 a shift in the movable contact may usually be disregarded,
 and thus any alteration in the subject (included in P) is
 measured by the rotation necessitated at the compensator.
 As for the resistance, it is evident that (R and S being equal)
.the value of any additional conductor interposed in P is
 measured by twice the displacement of the sliding contact
 necessary to regain the balance.
    The position of the contact was read to tenths of an inch ;
 and, since the actual resistance per inch was '0246 ohm, a
 displacement of that amount represents '0492 ohm. To save
 unnecessary reductions, the resistance of any conductor will
 usually be expressed in terms of the contact displacement
 caused by its introduction, just as the self-induction is ex
 pressed in degrees of the compensator.
    In order to compare the behaviour of iron and copper,
 two double coils were prepared as nearly similar as con
 veniently could be. The iron coil was that already spoken
 of (p. 479). The resistance of each wire was '9 ohm, and the
 diameter '032 inch. In the double copper coil the resistance
 of each wire was '1 ohm, and the diameter '037 inch. Each
 coil consisted of 9 (double) convolutions, of diameter about
 4% inches.                         '
    The two iron wires being connected in series, the large self
 induction (when the current circulated the same way in both
 wires) was found to be 65°‘1 ; the small self-induction (when
 the directions of circulation were different) was 23°‘1. On
 the other hand, with the copper wires the large self-induction
 was 450'0, and the small only 10'0. Thus, although the
 manner of connection makes far more relative difference in the
 case of copper than in the case of iron, the absolute difference,
 which represents four times the mutual induction of the two
 wires, is nearly the same, viz. 44°‘0 for copper and 42°‘0 for
 iron.   There is here no evidence of any distinction in the
 mutual induction of iron and copper, the slight want of
 agreement being easily attributable to different degrees of

484        Lord Rayleigh 0n the Setf-inductz'on and
closeness of approach in the two cases. The readings for re
sistance were sensibly the same, whether the currents were
steady (balance being tested by a galvanometer), or were
variable with a frequency of 1050 per second.         They were
also unaffected by the reversal of one of the wires.
   With the same pair of double coils an interesting experiment
may be made by observing the effect of closing the second
wire upon the apparent resistance and self-induction of the <U+FB01>rst.
To steady currents the resistance of one of the cop er wires
was 1'75, unaltered by closing the circuit of the ot er wire.
With secondary open, the same resistance was found to apply
to periodic currents of frequency 1050 ; but when the
secondary was closed the resistance rose to 2'67. On the
otherhand, the closing of the secondary reduced the self
induction from 11°‘2 to 4°"7. It will be instructive to com
pare these results with Maxwell’s formulae :—

which we may do by means of a value of M (the mutual in
duction) deduced from the previous experiment, in which the
wires were connected in series.   Thus

agreeing pretty well with the proportional change observed
in the resistance.    The corresponding change in self-induc
tion would be barely sensible.
   In the case where the primary and secondary circuits are
similar (S=R, N :11), Maxwell’s general formulae may be
 written in the form                                '
                    RI-R_L-L/_ii_e__                              5

and we may note two extreme cases. When p is small, or,
more fully expressed, when the period of vibration is long in
 comparison with the time-constant of either circuit, viz. L/R,
 the reaction of the secondary currents is of small importance.
 On the other hand, when p is large, the right-hand member
 of (5) approaches to the form MWL2 ; and this again does
 not differ much from unity when the two circuits consist of a
 double coil of non-magnetic wire.    Under such circumstances
 the reaction of the secondary tends to destroy the self-induction
 and to double the resistance of the primary.
    Being desirous of investigating an example approximating
 to the second extreme, I prepared a double coil of stouter
 wire than the preceding. The diameter was about '08 inch,
 and the length of each wire was 318 inches. There were
 20 (double) turns, so that the mean diameter of the coil,
 wound as ,compactly as possible, was about 5 inches. The
 resistance of each wire was about '05 ohm.
    The coef<U+FB01>cient of mutual induction was determined by
 comparison of the self-induction (L) of one wire with that of
 the two wires connected oppositely in series, viz. (2L—2M).
 In this way it appeared that
                  M=43°'1 =43'1 X 1553 centim.
 The interrupter was the reed, of frequency 1050.
    Observation showed that the closing of the secondary
 diminished the self-induction from 44°‘4 to 3°‘4. The re

   Taking then

According to the formula, therefore,
                  L/ = '068 L = '068 X 44'4 = 30'0,
 which is to be compared with the observed 3°‘4.
   The application of the formula to the calculation of R’ is
 somewhat embarrassed by the observed difference of resist
ances to steady and to periodic currents when the secondary
 was open, of which the theory takes no account. It is true
that the difference is small, but it appeared to lie outside the
limits of error of observation. It is not accounted for merely
by the tendency of periodic currents to adhere to the outer
parts of a conducting cylinder. If this observation stood
alone, one would be inclined to attribute the discrepancy to
 some action, whether electro-magnetic or electro-static, of the
neighbouring secondary, even though open ; but, as we shall
have occasion to notice, a similar tendency of the resistance
 to increase when periodic currents are substituted for steady
 ones is to be observed in cases where no such explanation is
 available.   The effect was, however, too small to be investi
 gated further without some modi<U+FB01>cation in the apparatus, or
 in the nature of the conductors submitted to examination.
    If we take, as found for the periodic currents, R='97, we
get
                        R’=1-93x -97=1-s7,
 instead of 1'74 as observed.       On the other hand, if we take
R='92, we get                                              '

   The next experiment was contrived to illustrate the beha
 viour under periodic currents of a system composed of two
 conductors connected in parallel. The general theoretical
 formulae are given in a former paper*; but the more special
 case selected for experiment was one in which the mutual
 induction of the two conductors (M) and the self-induction of

in which SR/(R+ S) represents the resistance to steady cur
rents (10:0). The peculiar features of the arrangement are
brought out most strongly by taking a case in which S (the
resistance of the induction-less component) is great compared
with B. It is then obvious that steady, or slowly alternating,
currents <U+FB02>ow mainl through R, and accordingly that the re
sistance and self-in notion of the combination approximate to
R and L respectively. Rapidly alternating currents, on the
other hand, <U+FB02>ow mainly through S, so that the resistance
of the combination approximates to S, and the self-induction
to zero.      These common-sense conclusions are of course
embodied in the formulae.
    The conductors combined in parallel were (1) the coil of
stout copper (p. 483) with its two wires permanently con
nected in parallel so as to give maximum self-induction (L),
and (2) a moderate length of somewhat <U+FB01>ne brass wire.
With steady currents the resistances were
                  R='45, S=2'29, Bo’='35.
    It had been expected that the resistances B, S, of the sepa
rate conductors would have been sensibly the same whether
tested by steady or by (periodic currents ; but the resistances
in the latter case tende always to appear higher.       Thus with

These results of observation illustrate satisfactorily the general
behaviour of the combination to periodic currents of high
frequency, and they agree fairly well with the formulae.
According to these, if we take the values of R and S as ob
served with periodic currents, we have
                       R’=2'16,    L’=2°'61.

488          Lord Rayleigh on the Self-induction and
in the above examples, is an extreme case of what may happen
to a sensible extent within a simple conducting cylinder,
especially of iron, when the diameter is not very small in
relation to the frequency of electrical vibration. In order to
avoid magnetizing the material of the conductor, the current
 tends to con<U+FB01>ne itself to the outer strata, in violation of the
 condition of minimum resistance.          Prof. Hughes has already
 given examples of this effect; but they are dif<U+FB01>cult to com
 pare with theory in consequence of his employment of a
 vibration of inde<U+FB01>nite pitch. The following observations were
 made with the usual reed interrupter, giving about 1050
 vibrations per second.
     A somewhat hard Swedish-iron wire, 1003 metres long,
 and 1'6 millim. diameter, was <U+FB01>rst examined. The resistance
 to steady currents was 103, and to the variable currents given
 by the reed, 120. The wire was then softened in the <U+FB02>ame of a
 spirit-lamp, after which the resistance to steady currents was
 104, and to variable currents 12'1. Expressed in ohms, the
 resistance to steady currents is
                        104 x '0492='51 ohm.
     From these data we may deduce an approximate value of
 the magnetic permeability (,u.) of the material for circumfer_
 ential magnetization. For if l he the length, R the resistance
  to steady currents, p/2'1r the frequency of vibration, we have
  for the resistance (R’) to variable currents the approximate

      A more accurate use of the formula would bring out a
   sensibly higher value ; but it is hardly worth while to pursue
   the matter, inasmuch as any deduction of ,u. from the small
   observed difference of resistance (1'7) is necessarily subject to
  considerable error.
      In order to get better materials for a determination of 1.4. by
   this method, a stouter wire of Swedish iron was next tested,
   18'34 metres in length and 3'3 millim. in diameter. The
   metal was rather hard. The resistance to steady currents
   was found to be 4'7, and to the variable currents from the

worth while to record another numerical result, viz. :—

In these calculations it is assumed that the increase in R,
observed when variable currents are substituted for steady
ones, is due simply to a less favourable distribution of current
over the section. If there were sensible hysteresis in the
magnetic changes, It would be still further increased.                      I
believe, however, that under such magnetizing forces as were
at play in these experiments, there is no important hysteresis,
and that ,u. may be treated as sensibly constant.

  490           Lord Rayleigh on the Self-induction and
  due to its magnetic quality, are doubtless disadvantages from
  a telephonic point of view. If found serious they may be
  mitigated, as Prof. Hughes has shown, by the use of a
  stranded wire, in which the circumferential magnetic circuits
  are interrupted.          There has been some confusion, I think, in
   connection with the notion of “ retardation.” If we had
  the means of observing the passage of signals at various points
  of a long cable, we should <U+FB01>nd them not merely retarded
   (which would be of no consequence) as we recede from the
  sending end, but also attenuated. The amplitude of a periodic,
  e. g. telephonic, current sent into a cable becomes less and
  less as the distance increases. Nothing of the kind can
  happen in a well-insulated iron wire of negligible electrostatic
  capacity. Its resistance and self-induction may oppose the
  entrance of a current, but whatever current there is at any
  moment at the sending end of the wire must exist unimpaired
 throughout its whole extent.
     I will now record a few experiments as to the effect of an
 iron core upon the apparent self-induction and resistance of
 an encompassing helix. The wire was wound in one layer
 upon a glass tube; the total number of turns is 205, occu
 pying a length of 28'6 centim. The length of the wires
 forming the cores was 241 centim. The results given are
 the differences of the readings obtained with and without the
 cores, so that the resistance and self-induction of the helix
 itself are not included. The interrupter was the same reed as
 in previous experiments.
     A comparison was made of the effect of a solid iron wire
 1'2 millim. in diameter and of two bundles of wires of similar
 iron (drawn from the same specimen) of equal aggregate
 section and weight.                One bundle contained 7 wires, and
another 17.        The results were :—
                                      1 wire.  7 wires.    17 wires.

showing that when the wire was undivided the secondary
currents developed in it increased the apparent resistance of
the helix by 1'3, and diminished the apparent self-induction.
    A similar experiment was tried with a stouter wire
3'3 millim. in diameter (from the same hank as the len t-h oi“
18'34 metres treated as a conductor).              In the hard condition

                  Resistance of Compound Conductors.                    491
the self-induction due to this was 244°, and the resistance
3'8; numbers altered to 28§° and 4'4 respectively by softening
with a spirit-<U+FB02>ame.         The effect of a bundle of thirty-<U+FB01>ve soft
wires of the same iron and of equal aggregate section was
84° of self-induction and 1'6 of resistance *.
    There is nothing surprising in the conclusion, forced upon
us by the observations, that the magnetic effects of iron rods
3'3 millim. in diameter are seriously complicated by the
formation of induced internal electric currents. As I have
shown on a former occasion T, the principal time-constant
of a cylinder of radius a, speci<U+FB01>c resistance p, and per
meability a, is given by

This means that circumferential currents started and then
left to themselves would occupy a time '1' in sinking to 0"1 of
their initial magnitude. Whether the effects of such currents
will be important or not depends upon the relative magnitudes
of 1- and of the period of the magnetic changes actually in
progress. In the present case, with
                      y. = 100,    p = 9827,     2a = '33,
 the value of 'r is about 20155 of a second, that is, about half
 the period of the actual electrical vibration.

 approach to a balance could be obtained when a. scraping contact inter

    The mathematical analogy between this problem and that
of the variation of a longitudinal electrical current in a
cylindrical conductor has been pointed out by Mr. Heaviside 'I',
who has also given the full solution of the latter. Maxwell’s
investigation, somewhat further developed in my paper 1,
relates principally to that aspect of the question wit which _
experiment is best able to deal, viz. the relation between the
total current at any moment and the corresponding electro
motive force.
    That the argument in ¢>, da’ is the same in (12) as in (8)

Y    These are expressed in absolute measure, and reckoned per
  unit length of core. To obtain numbers comparable with
  the experimental readings, we must multiply by 24'1 (the
  length of the core), and reduce 8L by division by 1553, and
  SR by division by 109 x '0492. The result is
                     (8L) =25°'6, (8R) =4'6;
  which agree moderately well with the observed values, viz.

     The ratio of the actual effect to that which would be got
  from the same aggregate section of a bundle of wires, in<U+FB01>nitely
  thin and insulated from one another, is thus
                           8L      FP—

  of which the numerical value in the present example is '303.
  The corresponding ratio of observed effects for the solid wire
  (softened), and for the bundle of 35 wires of the same aggre
  gate section was
                           2ss / 84:339.
     The general result of these experiments is to support the
  conclusion arrived at by Oberbeck that the action of iron
  cores, submitting to periodic magnetizing forces of feeble
  intensity, can be calculated from the usual simple theory,
  provided we do not leave out of account the induced internal
  currents which often play a very important part. Oberbeck’s
  observations were made with the electrodynamometer, and
  with rather low frequencies of vibration—about one tenth of
  that used in most of the observations here recorded.
     We have seen in several examples that the self-induction
  of a combination of conductors, being a function of the pitch,
  admits of an inde<U+FB01>nite series of values; and the question
  suggests itself to which (if any) of these corresponds the

                  Resistance of Compound Conductors.                          495
 value obtained by galvanometric observation of the transition
 from a. state of things in which all the currents are zero to
 one in which they have steady values under the action of a
 constant electromotive force. In the ordinary theory of Max
 well’s method for determining self-induction from the throw
 of the galvanometer-needle in a Wheatstone’s bridge (a resist
 ance-balance having been already secured), the conductor
 under test is supposed to be simple. The general case of an
arbitrary combination of conductors can only be treated by a
 general method. An investigation founded upon the equa
tions of my former paper" shows that the result which would ‘
be obtained by Maxwell’s method corresponds to the self
induction of the combination for in<U+FB01>nitely slow vibrations.
     We have supposed that the behaviour of the compound
 conductor is not in<U+FB02>uenced by electrostatic phenomena ; other
 wise the representation of the part of the electromotive force
in the same phase as (10 / dt as due merely to self-induction
would be unnatural. So far as experiment is concerned, we
have no means of distinguishing between an effect dependent
upon dC /dt and one dependent upon SC (it, for the phase of
both is the same. We may contrast two extreme cases—(1) a
simple conductor with resistance and self-induction, (2) a
simple condenser with resisting leads. In the <U+FB01>rst case the
electromotive force at the terminals is written

where p.’ represents the “stiffness ” of the condenser.                    If we
persisted in regarding the imaginary part in the second case
as due to (negative) self-induction, we should have to face the
fact that the coef<U+FB01>cient becomes in<U+FB01>nite as p diminishes with
out limit.
    A number of combinations in which the induction of coils
is balanced by condensers are considered by Chrystal in his
valuable memoir on the differential telephoneT.
     In a paperi already referred to I have shown that when
two conductors in parallel exercise a powerful reciprocal

496         Lord Rayleigh on the Self-induction and
induction, very curious results may follow the application of
a periodic electromotive force. I have lately submitted the
matter to experimental test, by which theoretical anticipations
have been fully con<U+FB01>rmed.
   The two conductors in parallel were constructed out of the
three wires of a heavy and compact triple coil of copper wire“
mounted in a mahogany ring, which has been in my possession
for many years. Of these wires two are combined in series
(with maximum self-induction) to constitute one of the
branches in parallel. The other branch is the third wire of
the triple coil, so connected that steady currents would circu
late the same way round them all. The variable currents
were obtained from a battery and scraping-contact apparatus
(p. 472), connected directly. Under these conditions, if the
intermittence be rapid enough, the currents distribute them
selves in the two branches so as nearly to neutralize one
another’s magnetizing-power ; and this requires that the cur
rent in the single wire should be of about twice the magnitude
of the current in the double wire, and in the opposite direction.
If we call these currents 2 and --1, the current in the mains
must be + 1.
   As may be seen from formula (13)‘l', such a state of things
leads to a hi h equivalent resistance for the system ; and the
question mig t be investigated on this basis with the apparatus
already described. I preferred, however, to examine directly
whether it were true that the current in one of the branches
exceeded that in the main ; and this could be readily done by
“tapping” with the telephone. For this purpose the two
                              Fig. 2.

                         T
branches and the main were'led through short lengths of
similar German-silver wire to the junction, composed of a
copper plate to which the wires were soldered (<U+FB01>g. 2). One
telephone terminal was soldered to the plate ; the other was
brought into contact with some point of the German-silver

               Resistance of Compound Conductors.            497
wire carrying the current to be observed. It is evident that
if the three alternating currents were of equal magnitude,
sounds of like loudness would be heard at equal distances
from the copper plate, whichever of the wires was touched ;
and, further, that the distances required to produce equal
sounds are inversely as the magnitudes of the corresponding
currents.
    A moment’s observation proved that the currents in A and
B were about equal, and that in C much greater. Numerical
estimates are best made with the aid of a second observer, who
does not see what contacts are being tried. My assistant
considered that about 6‘} inches of B and about 315 inches of C
were required to give the same loudness as 6 inches of A.
 This agrees with the approximate theory as well as could
be expected.
     If the single wire be reversed, then, accordin to theory
 (resistances of German-silver wires neglected), the distribution
 should be much the same as of steady currents under the sole
 in<U+FB02>uence of resistance; that is, the currents in the branches
 should be as +2 to +1, so that on the same scale the main
 current would be +3. According to this the equivalent
 lengths of the German-silver wires would be 6, 9, 18. The
  numbers actually found by experiment were 6, 8, 17%.
     In the <U+FB01>rst part of this experiment the current in one of
  the branches is greater than in the main; but I wished to
 examine a case where both parts of the divided current
  exceeded the whole.        This could be done with a <U+FB01>vefold
  coil, as described in the previous paper; but such was not
  ready to hand. In default thereof a common double coil,
  belonging to a large electro-magnet, was enveloped with a
  single layer of extra wire, which was combined in series with
  one of the original wires. This arrangement isless favour
  able than one in which the two branches are in close juxta
  position throughout; but I thought that with the aid of an
  iron core it could be made to answer the purpose.       Such a
  core was provided in the form of a bundle of <U+FB01>ne wires,
  solid iron being obviously inappropriate. The two wires were
  now connected in parallel and replaced the triple coil, the
  arrangements in other respects remaining unchanged.
      The currents in the shorter branch (composed of one
   original coil simply), in the longer branch (composed of the
   other original and of the additional coil), and in the main
   were now found to be inversely as the measured distances
   '9, 1'3, 2'3, no regard being paid to sign, viz. as 1'11, '77,
   '43. These numbers cannot be quite correct as they stand,
   for the third should be equal to the difference between the

 498           Lord Rayleigh on the Self-inductimz and
 <U+FB01>rst and second. If we suppose the second and third to be
 correct, the <U+FB01>rst would have to be 1'20 instead of 1'11. Such
 an error as this may easily occur in estimating the equality
 of sounds heard successively; and there can be no doubt
 that the smaller branch current largely exceeded the main
 current*.

LVIII. Permanent Magnets.—III. On Magnetic Decay (con
   tinued). By R. H. M. BOSANQUET, St. John’s College,
   Oxford.
  To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
IN the Philosophical Magazine, ser. 5, xix. 1885, pp. 57—59,
-     I gave an account of the decay of the magnetism of a
pair of permanent magnets during some months after they
were made.
   Observations for H have been continued at intervals with
the same pair of magnets, both in the laboratory and the non
magnetic room ; incidentally a large number of determinations
of the moments of these magnets have been obtained, and from
these an interesting result appears to follow with considerable
certainty.
   The decay of the magnetism proceeds much more rapidly
in summer than in winter; and in all probability the rate of
decay is quicker for higher temperatures and slower for lower
temperatures.
   It will be remembered that Joule proved, by burying
systems of magnets for several years, that the maintenance of
a constant temperature did not secure the constancy of the
magnetic intensity (Reprint, vol. i. page 592), on which Joule

  remarks, “so that the cause of the gradual decline of power
  has yet to be discovered.”
   7 Regarding heat as a species of molecular agitation, it seems
  reasonable to expect that this agitation should act in a manner
  analogous to mechanical disturbances, in facilitating the decay
  of permanent magnetism._ In fact we know that, by exposing
  permanent magnets to moderately high temperatures, we can
  destroy their magnetism altogether.
     The following are the mean results of the sets of observa
  tions that have been made.          The changes in the value of M
  are shown in the <U+FB01>gure. It will be seen that they are much
  greater in summer than in winter.

LIX. On the Vapour-pressures of Water from Salt-Solutions; 2
  By W. W. J. NICOL, MA, 17.80., 1".R.S.E., Lecturer on
   Chemistry, Mason College, Birmingham“.
IN 1835 Legrand‘l' published a paper on the effect of various
     salts on the boiling-point of water in which they were
dissolved in varying proportions. The results he obtained
were exceedingly interesting, but incomplete; and the experi
ments of Wiillneri and others have done but little to extend
our knowledge of this branch of the wide subject of solution.
   With the desire of arriving at some de<U+FB01>nite conclusion as

                    of Water from Salt-Solutions.              503
to the nature of the action of salts on the vapour-pressure of
the water in which they are dissolved, I commenced in April
 1884 a series of experiments on the subject, the <U+FB01>rst portion
of which, relating to the boiling-points of saturated solutions,
has been already published‘; while the general conclusions
arrived at up to the middle of 1885 are to be found in a report
on Solution, presentedto the British Association in that year.
Since then I have repeated my experiments with improved
apparatus, with the result that my previous conclusions are
extended and con<U+FB01>rmed, so that I feel myself justi<U+FB01>ed in
publishing this second part of the research.
   Before proceeding to an account of my own experiments, it
will be advisable brie<U+FB02>y to summarize the results obtained by
Legrand (loo. cat).
   His experiments were conducted as follows :—
   After he had determined the boiling-point of pure water by
heatin it in contact with some granulated zinc in a wide
test-tn , in the neck of which was fastened a delicate ther
mometer the bulb of which was immersed in the water, he
introduced a known quantity of the salt under examination
and again observed the boiling-point. The tube was weighed,
and thus the quantity of water present was ascertained. A
further quantity of salt was added, and the operations repeated
until a saturated solution was obtained, the amount of salt in
which was determined in the ordinary way. From the results
thus obtained curves were drawn, and thus the quantities of
salt required to raise the boiling-point of water successive
half-degrees were found.
   On an examination of Legrand’s <U+FB01>gures, we <U+FB01>nd that the
seventeen salts examined in the above manner are divided into
four classes by their effect on the boiling-point of water.
   1. Several salts agree in this, that more salt is required to
raise the boiling-point the <U+FB01>rst half-degree than to raise it the
second, and this more than the third, and so on : thus, 7'5 per
cent. NaGl raise the boiling-point to 101° C. ; 5'7 per cent.
raise it from 101° to 102° 0.; 4'9 per cent. raise it from 102°
to 103° C. ; 8:0.       The salts which behave in this way are
NaCl, KC], Na,CO;, Na2HPO4, and BaCl,.
   2. One salt only, KClOs, has its effect on the boiling-point of
water represented by a straight line : n (14'64 per cent.) K0103
raise it 11° C.
   3. Other salts behave in a manner the converse of those in
class 1 ; i. e. as the concentration increases so does the amount
of salt re uired to raise the boiling-point each successive
degree. IgHlNOB, NaNOa, and KN03 behave in this way.

    4. The most general case is a combination of the three
 foregoing classes in the order given. At <U+FB01>rst the quantity of
 salt diminishes rapidly with the concentration ; then more
 slowly till it becomes practically a constant for a few degrees;
 then it increases more and more rapidly up to the saturation
 point. K2003 may be taken as an instance. From 100°—
 101° C. 13 per cent. of salt are required ; from 101°—102° C.
 9'5 per cent. For each degree between 113° and 118° 0.
 4'8 per cent. only are required; and above this the amount
 increases till from 130°—131° 0. 5'4 per cent are required ;
 and with other salts the increase is still more marked. K2003,

 KOgHgOg ; that is, eight out of seventeen salts examined
belong to this class alone.
    It appears probable, as indicated above, that there is but a
 single curve of the form indicated in the diagram below ; and
 that it is complete in the case of some salts, while others cor
 respond to the <U+FB01>rst, second, or third parts of the curve. How
far this hypothesis is borne out by my experiments will be
shown later on.

   Apart from the general inaccuracy attending Legrand’s
method of experiment, there is the serious objection to it that,
though the pressure was constant, the temperature was vari
able. It would be dif<U+FB01>cult, if not impossible, to convert his
results into a form in which they would be available for the
purposes of the present paper. As it is, I believe they can
be used only qualitatively, and that even with hesitation.

                 of Water from Salt-Solutions. ,             505
   In my experiments I had two methods available ; either the
barometer-tube method as modi<U+FB01>ed by Konowalow, or the
boiling-point method modi<U+FB01>ed so that the temperature was
constant and the pressure the variant. The latter is by far
the more convenient of the two methods, and is the one that I
employed; but it was only after repeated trials that I succeeded
in overcoming the danger of superheating and the conse
quent error of experiment.                       -
   A <U+FB02>ask, about 200 cubic centim. capacity, communicates by
a wide side-tube with an upright condenser ; this in its turn is
connected with a three-way tap and an air-reservoir, which
communicates with the gauge and the water-pump. The
<U+FB02>ask stands on a small burner, and is protected from the heat
by a metal ring, except about an inch and a half at the very
bottom. In the neck of the <U+FB02>ask is <U+FB01>tted the thermometer.
The course of experiment was as follows :—In the <U+FB02>ask was
placed 50 grammes of zinc and 60 cubic centim. of water,
then 310 of the molecular weight of the salt in grammes were
added.     This gives a solution of almost exact molecular
strength, as T§85=3J6.      The thermometer was introduced,
care being taken that the bulb was completely immersed ; the
side-tube joined to the condenser, the pump set in action,
and the burner lighted.    When the solution boiled, the pres
sure was slowly increased till the thermometer rose to 70° C.
The barometer and gauge were then read by two telescopes,
the pressure was again diminished slightly, a tube full of
mercury introduced into the reservoir of the barometer, and
another reading made at 70°, the mean of the two being
taken.   The same operations were repeated at intervals of
5° 0. up to 95° 0., when the <U+FB02>ask was disconnected, washed,
and dried, and the whole set of observations repeated with a
fresh solution of the same strength.    Thus each determination
given in the following Tables is the mean of four results, ob
tained with two separately prepared solutions. The granulated
zinc is absolutely necessary in large quantity, otherwise super
heating takes place. In no case was the zinc dissolved by the
solution ; nor was it ap reciably attacked, except by the very
strongest solutions of KI‘IOs and NaNO, at the higher tempe
ratures. In these cases appreciable amounts of ammonia
were evolved, a point I intend to investigate further; but
even after prolonged boiling the boiling-pressure was found
unaltered ; thus the results are not affected by the small de—
com osition of the salt in these cases. The remainder of the
met 0d of experiment is the same as that described in my
previous paper. It must not be forgotten that, though the
temperatures are arbitrary, still, as the determinations were

  506          Dr. W. W. J. Nicol on the Vapour-pressures
   all made with the same thermometer and are thus strictly
   comparable among themselves, and as the boiling-pressures
   of pure water were determined at the same time with the same
   thermometer, we have a natural standard by which the results
   may be corrected if need be. Nothing, however, would be
   gained by such a correction; for, as the <U+FB01>gures in Table I.
   show, the thermometer, which was by Geissler and divided
  into tenths, was very nearly exact, the results agreeing well
  with Regnault’s, when it is remembered that his <U+FB01>gures are for
  steam and mine for water. With regard to the probable error
  for any single determination, that does not much exceed i-'3
  millim., and is of course proportionately less for the mean
  results of four determinations which are given in the Tables.

      At present I have examined only four salts, which may be
  regarded as typical of the class which crystallize without
  water; they are NaOl, KO], NaNOa, and KNO3. I intend
  soon to examine the behaviour of some typical hydrated salts.
      The results thus obtained enable us to examine, not only
  the effect of varyin amounts of salts at the same temperature,
  but also that of <U+FB01>xed amounts of salts at varying temperatures;
  that is, the Tables iven may be read either vertically or
  horizontally. Each         able consists of two halves.  The <U+FB01>rst
  contains the value ofp —p’, where p = the vapour-pressure of
  pure water at the given temperature as contained in Table I.,
_ p’ the pressure of water-vapour from the salt-solution of the

  The second half of the Table contains P2P ; that is, the effect
  on the vapour-pressure of pure water by the presence of one
  salt-molecule in solutions of the stated composition. A glance
  at the Tables shows at once that the four salts range them
  selves in two classes, when the effect of varying amounts of

   The accuracy of the above results is undoubted, though it
is at variance with the results obtained by Wiillner (loo. cit.),
who found that the effect of the above salts was in direct pro
  ortion to the quantity present; nor can the conclusions of
   iillner be explained by the fact that his solutions were of
percentage composition, while the above are molecular, corre
sponding to parts per hundred of water; for though this
might e lain one class of salts, it fails if applied to the
others.       y results, on the contrary, are con<U+FB01>rmed by those
of Tammann *, obtained by the barometer-tube method, as will
be shown later. I reserve the discussion of the probable
cause of this di<U+FB02>'erent behaviour of the salts to the end of the
    er. behaviour of the salt-solutions of the same strength,

   Though not ver much can be gathered from the individual
results, still I thin that they give reliable results when treated
en masse. When we divide the whole of the <U+FB01>gures for each

                  of Water from Salt-Solutions.               511
salt into two groups—A, for tem eratures 70°, 75°, and 80°;
B, for 85°, 90°, and 95°-—and ad together all the <U+FB01>gures in
group A and group B, then we <U+FB01>nd that, in the case of NaCl,
  roup A exceeds group B b 20, with KOl A: B, and with
ilaNO; and KNO, group h exceeds Group A by 30 and
91 respectively; thus showing that the net result for all
strengths of solutions of the salts is that rise of temperature
diminishes the restraining effect of the salt in the case of
NaCl, does not a<U+FB02>‘ect it in the case of KCl, but increases it in
the case of NaNO, and KNOs, and more so with the latter
than with the former. I am fully aware of the danger of
drawing conclusions from differences so small as these; still
the number of experiments in each of the groups (eighteen
being the minimum) is probably suf<U+FB01>ciently great to justify
my doing so.      In any case, the accuracy of     6 results is at
least as great as those attainable by the barometric method;
and I fail to see that more accurate results can be in any way
obtained.
    Comparing now the weak solutions with the strong ones at
 the low and high tern eratures, we <U+FB01>nd that, taking the
 <U+FB01>gures in Tables II. to     ., and subdividing the groups Aand
 B at the dotted lines, and calling these subgroups A, and A,,
 B, and B, respectively, then the ratio of % to % is :—
 ForNaCl,1:0'983; forKCl,1:0'990; for NaN03,1:0'999;
 for KN03, 1:1'018; that is (in words), concentration in
 creasing and temperature rising, the result is diminution of
 the restraining effect of the salt—considerable in the case of
 NaCl, appreciable with KC], little or none with NaNOa, and,
 on the contrary, a considerable increase in the restraining
 effect of KNOa.
    Turning now to the results of Tammann (loo. cit.), we <U+FB01>nd
 general con<U+FB01>rmation of the conclusions arrived at above.
 Tables IX. and X. contain his results compared with mine
 for the four salts examined by me. Tammann made his
 determinations at no de<U+FB01>nite temperatures, but at irregular
 intervals on the temperature-scale, and he employed the
 vapour-pressure of water observed at the same time with the
 salt-solutions as his temperature-indicator ; nor did he use mo
 lecular solutions. The quantity of salt present is expressed
 in arts per 100 of water; and he gives the observed values
 of —T’, i. e. (p—p’) and also what he terms “die relative
 Spann-kraftserniederungen," or relative diminution of vapour
                     (T—T’) x 1000
 pressure ; this is                   , where m=parts of salt per
                          T.

Now as Tammann’s temperatures are variable, it is necessary
to use this value in comparing his results; and, again, as his
<U+FB01>gures vary within rather wide limits, better results are
obtained by taking the mean value of Tm—T'I;         _ I x 1000 for tem
peratures lying on either side of the desired temperature.

rise of temperature on the vapour-pressure with solutions of
constant strength. Here also there is con<U+FB01>rmation of my
results, and we arrive at the following conclusions :—
   1. Temperature constant.—The effect of increase of concen
tration is, in the case of NaOl, an increase of the restraining
effect of each salt molecule. Such is also the case, though
less marked, with KCl, while with NaN03 and KNO;
precisely the reverse is the case, the four salts forming a
series, as is shown diagrammatically above.

  514      Dr. W. W. J.,Nicol on the Vapour-pressures
     2. Concentration con
  stant.—-The effect of rise
  of temperature is to di
  minish the restraining
 effect of the salt in the
  case of NaCl, to leave
  KCl unaffected, and to
 increase the effect with
 NaNOs and. KNOs.       The
 four salts forming again
 a series in the same order
 as above.
    3. When both temperature and concentration increase the
 salts form the same series—diminution of the restraining
 effect with NaOl and KC], little or none with NaNOs, and a
 marked increase with KNOa.
    4. When the solubility as a function of the temperature is
 considered, the same series is observed. The solubility of
 NaCl increases only slightly with rise of temperature, that of
 KCl rather more so. Still more marked is the case with
 NaNOs, while the solubility of KNO3 increases enormously
 with the temperature.
    5. There is clearly a connection between increase of' solu
 bility of the salts and the effect they have on the vapour
 pressure of the water in which they are dissolved.
    Any attempt to explain the behaviour of the salts must of'
 necessity, in our present state of knowledge of the nature of
'solution, partake largely of the nature of hypothesis. Still I
cannot refrain from pointing out how completely the Theory
of Solution I put forward some years ago explains these very
.varied phenomena.
    According, to this theory, solution is an entirely physical
‘process, and results from the action of purely physical forces;
thus differing entirely from all the modi<U+FB01>cations of the
 Hydrate Theory which have hitherto found favour with expe
rimenters. Solution is the result of the tendency of three
forces towards equilibrium.      These three forces being the
 attraction of water for salt, that of salt for salt, and that of
water for water. For the sake of brevity the attraction be
tween similar molecules may be spoken of as Cohesion, that
between dissimilar molecules as Adhesion. Thus, where the
salt is soluble, the adhesion of salt and water is greater than
the cohesion of the salt plus the cohesion of the water. When
the salt is insoluble, the reverse is the case. When the salt
dissolves, the adhesion of water to the salt is more and more
diminished by the presence of the dissolved salt till a point is

                   of Water from Salt-Solutions.                     515
reached at which the three forces are in equilibrium; this is
the saturation-point for the temperature under consideration.
At the saturation-point as many salt molecules meet and
unite to form solid salt in unit time as are dissolved by the
action of the water on the still undissolved salt.
   The effect of temperature on each of these three forces is
to diminish each of them. It may be each to the same ex
tent, or it may be by unequal amounts ; and thus a salt may
have its solubility unaltered, increased, or diminished by rise
of temperature. That is, accordin as the difference between
the adhesion and the sum of the co esions at the higher tem
perature is > , =, < the same difference at the lower tempera
ture, so is the solubility at the higher temperature > , = , < than
the solubility at the lower temperature. But this is not all,
for the magnitude of these differences depends on the various
effects of temperature on the adhesion and the sum of the
cohesions; and this may be very different with different salts,
 for though the cohesion of the water is affected by tempera
 ture always to the same extent, still the cohesion of the salt
 and the adhesion are variables. With this preliminary ex
planation, I will proceed at once to the explanation of the
effect of salts on the vapour-pressure of water according to
 the above theory.
    The <U+FB01>rst point to be noted is that all four salts have, in
dilute solution, very nearly the same restraining effect :—
      n.           NaCl.         K01.        NaNOa.         KNO,.
      2            4'25          3'80          4'25          3'75
     10            5'04         443            3'67          2'73
but that in strong solutions it is very different. Now the
restraining effect of a salt can only be due to the adhesion of
the water and salt"; this, then, is very nearly a constant for
all four salts, and is still more nearly a censtant for salts of
the same metal. Next, the heat of solution of the salts is as
follows:—
            N9.01.         K01.         NaN03.          KNOa.
          —1180         —- 4400       —5200           —8500,
still the same series before observed.         Now, as pointed out in
another paper, if the restraining effect of salt be a constant,
or nearly so, then the heat of solution of various salts is a
   ' It may be noted, in passin , that unless a salt molecule were capable
of disturbing the e uilibrlum o the whale of the water molecules present,
it could have no e ect on the vapour-pressure of the water.

516      On the Vapour—pressures of Water from Salt-Solutions.
measure-of the physical work done in effecting the change of
,state of the salt—that is, in overcoming the cohesion of the
salt. If this is so, then the cohesion of the four salts under
consideration increases from NaCl to KN03.
    Now the e<U+FB01>'ect of concentration is to markedly increase the
restraining effect of the salt in the case of NaCl, to a less extent
,with KCl ; and, on the contrary, to diminish it with NaNOa,
 and still more so with KNOs. But the cohesion is small with
 NaCl and increases up to KNOa. Is it not reasonable to sup
 pose that, in the case of a salt with small cohesion, concentra
 tion has but little effect on the adhesion ; and that, on the
 contrary, when the cohesion is very large, the effect of con
 centration is to slowly diminish the adhesion in each case till
 the saturation-point is reached ; and salts with cohesion inter
 mediate between the extremes above will have an intermediate
 effect on the vapour-presure of the water ?
    We have next to consider the effect of rise of temperature
 on the restraining effect of the salt. This we have seen is a
 diminishing one with NaCl, nil with K01, and an increase in
 the case of NaNOa and KNOs. This, I submit, is fully in
 agreement with the above, and also with the observed solubi
 lities ; for though an increase of solubility implies an increase
 of the difference between adhesion and the sum of the cohe
 sions, still that is in few cases due to an actual increase of the
 value of the adhesion, but to the decrease of the cohesions
 exceeding the decrease of the adhesion. Now in a solution of
 a salt of constant strength, rise of temperature is necessarily
 attended by a decrease in the value of all the three forces. If
 the cohesion be diminished a little more than the adhesion the
 salt will be a little more soluble, and the effect on the restrain
 ing effect of the salt will be to diminish it; for though the
 comparative value of the adhesion be increased, the absolute
 value is diminished.      On the other Hand, if the cohesion be
 very large and be largely affected by rise of temperature, the
 result will be to increase the comparative value of the adhesion ;
 and in strong solution to actually increase the absolute value,
 as is shown by the increase in the restraining effect of KNOs,
 especially in stron solutions.
    Thus it appears t at this theory of solution is able to explain
 the very varied phenomena of vapour-pressures of water from
 salt-solutions, as it has explained other phenomena of solu
 tion. It remains to be proved whether this explanation is
 correct.

   LX. On Stationary Waves in Flowing Water.——Part III.

AS promised in Part I., we may now consider the appli
         cation of the principles developed in it and in Part II.
to the question of towing in a canal, and we shall <U+FB01>nd almost
surprisingly a theoretical anticipation, 49% years after date,
of Scott Russell’s brilliant “Experimental Researches into the
Laws of certain Hydrodynamical Phenomena that accompany
the Motion of Floating Bodies, and have not previously been
reduced into Conformity with the known Laws of the Resist
ance of Fluids”*, which had led to the Scottish system of
“ fly-boat,” carrying passengers on the Glasgow and Ardrossan
Canal, and between Edinburgh and Glasgow on the Forth
and Clyde Canal, at speeds of from 8 to 12 or 13 miles an
 hourT by a horse, or a pair of horses, galloping along the
 bank. The practical method originated from the accident of
a spirited horse, whose duty it was to drag a boat along at a
 slow speed (I suppose a walking speed), taking fright and
 running off, drawing the boat aftg him, and so discovering
 that when the speed exceeded \/gD the resistance was less
 than at lower speeds. Mr. Scott Russell’s description of the
 incident, and of how Mr. Houston took advantage for his
 Company of his horse’s discovery, is so interesting that I
 quote it in eztenso :—“ Canal navigation furnishes at once the
 most interesting illustrations of the interference of the wave,
 and most important opportunities for the application of its
 principles to an improved system of practice. It is to the
 diminished anterior section of displacement, produced by
 raising a vessel with a sudden impulse to the summit of the
 progressive wave, that a very great improvement recently
 introduced into canal transport owes its existence. As far
 as I am able to learn, the isolated fact was discovered acci
 dentally on the Glas ow and Ardrossan Canal of small
 dimensions.      A spirite horse in the boat of William Houston

518            Sir William Thomson on Stationary
Esq., one of the proprietors of the works, took fright and
ran off, dragging the boat with it, and it was then 0 served,
to Mr. Houston’s astonishment, that the foaming stern surge
which used to devastate the banks had ceased, and the
 vessel was carried on through water comparatively smooth,
with a resistance very greatly diminished. Mr. Houston had
 the tact to perceive the mercantile value of this fact to the
 Canal Company with which he was connected, and devoted
 himself to introducing on that canal vessels moving with this
 high velocity. The result of this improvement was so valuable
 in a mercantile point of view, as to bring, from the conveyance
 of passengers ata high velocity, a large increase of revenue to
 the Canal Proprietors. The passengers and luggage are con
 veyed in light boats, about sixty feet long and six feet wide,
 made of thin sheet iron and drawn by a pair of horses. The
 boat starts at a slow velocity behind the wave, and at a given
 signal it is by a sudden jerk of the horses drawn up on the top
 of the wave, where it moves with diminished resistance, at
 the rate of 7, 8, or 9 miles an hour” *.
    The “diminished anterior section of displacement pro
 duced by raising a vessel with a sudden impulse to the
 summit of the progressive wave” is no doubt a correct
 observation of an essential feature of the phenomenon;
 but it is the annulment of “the foaming stern surge which
 [at the lower speeds] used to devastate the banks” that
  ives the direct explanation of the diminished resistance.
  tis in fact eas to see that when the motion is steady, no
 waves can be le t astern of a boat towed through a canal at a
 speed greater than \/gD, the velocity of an in<U+FB01>nitely lon
 wave in the canal ; and therefore (the water being supposed
inviscid) the resistance to towage must be m'l when the velo
city exceeds \/gD. This holds true also obviously for towage
in an in<U+FB01>nite expanse of open water of depth D over a plane
bottom.
    The formula (25) of Part II. for the whole horizontal com
 ponent force upon an inequality or succession of inequalities
on the bottom allows us to calculate the resistance on a boat
 of any dimensions and any shape provided we know the height
of the regular waves which follow it steadily at its own speed
in the canal, at a suf<U+FB01>ciently great distance behind it to be
sensibly uniform across the breadth of the canal, according to

    To <U+FB01>nd the steady motion of water <U+FB02>owing in a rectangular

    The series (14) is convergent for all values of 1: less than

 Poisson, the extreme case of 1c in<U+FB01>nitely little less than unity
will be made the foundation of our practical solutions. By

  (la: in the <U+FB01>rst member of (18) is zero for all values of a' dif
  fering <U+FB01>nitely from zero or 2i7r/m, (i being an integer); and
  it is in<U+FB01>nitely great when .z'=0 or 2i7r/rn. 'Hence we infer
  from (17) and (18) that a vertical longitudinal section of the
   bottom presents a regular row of symmetrical elevations and
  depressions above and below its mean level; the elevations being
  con<U+FB01>ned to very small spaces on the two sides of each of the
  points x=0 and w=2i7r/m, and the pro<U+FB01>le-area of each eleva—
  tion being A. The depths of the depressions below the average
  level in the intermediate spaces between the elevations, are of
 .course extremely small because of the exceeding shortness of
  the spaces over which are the elevations. For our complete
  analytical solution, not only must A be in<U+FB01>nitely small, but
  the steepness of the slope 11p to the summit of A must every
  where be an infinitely small fraction of a radian ; and of
  course therefore the in<U+FB01>nitesimal lowering of the bottom be
  tween the ridges, which the adoption of a mean bottom-level
  for our datum line has necessarily introduced, may be left
  out of account in our dynamical problem.
      If the slope of the ridge is not an in<U+FB01>nitely small fraction
  of a radian our solution will still hold, provided its height is
  very small in comparison with the depth of the water over it.
  But the effective potency of the ridge would then not be its
  pro<U+FB01>le-area A, but something much greater; of which the
  amount would be found by taking a stream-line over it, far
  enough above it to have nowhere more than an in<U+FB01>nitesimal
  slope, and <U+FB01>nding the pro<U+FB01>le-area of such a stream-line above
  its own average level considered as the virtual bottom. With
  these explanations we shall speak of a ridge for brevity instead
  of an “ irregularity ” or “ obstacle,” and call its pro<U+FB01>le-area A,
  simply the “ magnitude of the ridge ;” this being, as we see
  by (15), the measure of its potency in disturbing the surface.
  When instead of a ridge we have a hollow, A is negative;
  and when convenient we may, of course, call a hollow a nega
  tive ridge.
      It is clear that (15) converges, and does not depend for its
1 convergence on re being less than unity ; so that in it we may
  take 1c absolutely equal to unity, and we shall do so accordingly.

   The de<U+FB01>nite integral (21) or (23) seemed rather intractable,
and the quadratures required to evaluate it, for many and Wide
spread enough values of w to show the shape of the surface
for any one particular value of 13/1), would be very laborious.
But I had found a method of evaluating it from the periodic
solution for an endless succession of equidistant equal ridges
(15), wholly analogous to analytical deductions from corre
sponding solutions for cases of thermal conduction and of
signalling through submarine cables, to be found in vol. ii.
pp. 49 and 56 of my Collected Mathematical and Physical
Papers ;. and, towards applying this method to a particular
case of the disturbance due to a single ridge, I had fully
Worked out the periodic solution for the case represented by
the diagram of curves (<U+FB01>g. 3, p. 529), when I found a direct
and complete analytical solution for the single-ridge problem
in a form exceedingly convenient for arithmetical computation,
except for the case of .z equal to zero, or from zero to a quarter
or a half of the depth.    The previous method happily gives
the solution for small values of .z', and indeed for values up to
two or three times the depth, by very rapidly converging
series, and thus between the two methods we have a remark
ably satisfactory solution of the whole problem.
   Before explaining the curves and their relation to the pro
blem of the single ridge, I shall give the new direct solution

                       Waves in Flowing Water.                      523
of this problem. It is founded on a well-known analytical
method of Cauchy’s, of which examples are given in the
Eighteenth note (p. 284) to his Memoir on the Theory of
 Waves".
    First, bring the denominator of' (23) to the form of the
product of an in<U+FB01>nite number of quadratic factors, as follows :—

Hence, when bis greater than D, W is positive for all real
values of 0'. But when b has any positive value less than D,
W (which is always positive for small values of 02) is nega
tive for large values of 0*; and therefore at least one positive
value of 0’ makes W zero. We shall see presently that only
one positive value of a" does so. We shall see that all the
zeros of W when I) is less than D, and all but one when 6 is
greater than D, correspond to real negative values of 09.
This indeed is obvious if for 02 we put —62, which gives
                              2            D sin 0

   When w=0, the convergence has the same order as that of
   1—e+eg——&c., when e=1; and we <U+FB01>nd the sum by taking
   as remainder half\ the term after the last term included.
   The true value of the sum is intermediate between the values
   which we obtain by this rule for a certain number of terms,

      It remains to deal with the <U+FB01>rst term for the case D>b,
   which makes it imaginary in the form 39), but real in the
    form (38) with —a,’ substituted for 0, .         For this case we

   It is to be remarked that, inasmuch as (38) has the same
value for equal positive and negative values of w, the evalua
tions expressed in (39) and (41) are essentially discontinuous
at .2:=O; and when w is negative, —.z' must be substituted
for w in the second member of the formulas. I hope in
Part IV. to' give numerical illustrations ; but with or without
numerical illustrations, the analytical formula (39), with (41)
for its <U+FB01>rst term and the sign of :0 changed throughout when
a: is negative, is particularly interesting as a discontinuous
expression for a curve passing continuously from one to the
other of the two curves

    For the case of b > D every term of (39) is real, and (re
membering that the sign of a: is changed when a: is negative)
we see that it makes 5 equal for equal positive and negative
values of .21, and diminish asymptotically to zero as .70 becomes
greater and greater in either direction. It expresses unam
biguously the solution (clearly unique when b>D) of the
problem of steady motion of water in a uniform rectangular
canal interrupted only by a single ridge of magnitude A
across the bottom. This is the case of velocity of <U+FB02>ow greater
than that acquired by a body in falling through a height equal
to half the depth.
   It is otherwise in respect to uniqueness of the solution when
the velocity of <U+FB02>ow is less than that acquired by a body in
falling through a height equal to half the depth (6 < D). For
this case the formulas (39) and (41) express a particular
solution of the problem of steady motion through a rectan
gular canal, when regularity of the canal is only interrupted
by the single ridge of magnitude A. But we clearly have
an in<U+FB01>nite number of solutions of this problem ; because in
still water in a canal of depth D we can have free waves of
any velocity from zero to V91), which is the velocity of an
in<U+FB01>nitely long wave in water of depth D. In our <U+FB01>owin
water then superimpose upon the solution (39) (41), any

    position for one of the zeros, with wave-length such that the
   velocity of wave-propagation is U, and the direction of motion
    such as to cause the progression of the wave to be up-stream.
    The wave-motion thus instituted constitutes a set of free
   stationary waves, and the superposition of this upon the case
   of motion represented by our symmetrical solution consti
   tutes the general solution of the problem of single-ridge
   steady motion. To <U+FB01>nd the arbitrary addition which we must
   thus make to our symmetrical solution to <U+FB01>nd the general
   solution, put (13) into the following form :

         The motion represented by this solution ,with any values of C
      and C', is steady and stable throughout any <U+FB01>nite length of the
      canal on each side of the ridge, provided the water is introduced
      at one end of the portion considered and taken away at the
      other conformably.      If the canal extends to in<U+FB01>nity in both
      directions, and if the water throughout be given in the state of
      motion corresponding to the solution (46); the motion through
      out any <U+FB01>nite distance on each side of the ridge will continue
      for an in<U+FB01>nite time conformable to (46). The water, if given at
      rest, might be started into this state of motion in the follow
      ing manner :—First displace its surface to the shape repre
      sented by equation (46), and apply a rigid corrugated lid to
      keep it exactly in this shape, so that it is now enclosed as it
      were in a rectangular tube with one side corrugated, two
      sides plane, and the fourth side (the bottom) plane, except at
      the place of the ridge. Next by means of a piston set the
       water gradually in motion in this tube. To begin with, the
       pressure on the lid will, in virtue of gravity, be non-uniform ;
      less at the high parts and greater at the low parts. If too
      great a velocity be given to the water by the piston the pres:
       sure will, in virtue of <U+FB02>uid motion, be greater at the high
      parts and less at the low parts.       If the average velocity be
       made exactly U, the pressure will be uniform over the lid,
       which may then be dissolved ; thus the liquid is left moving
       steadily under the surface represented by equation _(46) as
       free surface. But it is only in virtue of this motion being
       given to the <U+FB02>uid throughout an in<U+FB01>nite length of the canal
       on each side of the ridge, that the motion can remain stead
       on each side of the ridge conformable to (46), except for the
       particular case of this general solution, corresponding to

 LXI. Decomposition of Glass by Carbon Dioxide held in
     Solution in Capillary Films of Water. By Prof. R.
     Bunsen *.
IN an earlier publication 1' I have given my investigations
       of the phenomena which present themselves when carbon
dioxide is allowed to act on capillary glass threads covered
with an extremely thin <U+FB01>lm of moisture. According to these
investigations, it appears that 4945?) grammes of such capil—
lary threads are able in 109 days to take up so much carbon
dioxide, that on heating not less than 2369 cubic centim. of
this gas is set free. The gas so retained in the water-<U+FB01>lm,
showed towards pressure and temperature precisely the rela
tions which are presented in the ordinary phenomena of as
absorption by liquids. In these experiments, as in all that
have been previously carried out, it has been assumed, both
from the result of direct observation and on theoretical
grounds, that the action of carbon dioxide on glass may be
entirely disregarded. And, indeed, experiments were carried
out in my laboratory seventeen years ago by Dr. Emmerling,
which showed that glass vessels in which an 11 per cent.
solution of hydrochloric acid was boiled for hours together
did not lose 0'0005 grm. in weight. If, in addition to this,
we bear in mind that under ordinary atmospheric pressure, at
 15° 0., water dissolves only 0'2 per cent. by weight of carbon
dioxide, an acid which is set free from all its compounds even
by the weakest acids, and, further, that repeated observations
show that dry carbon dioxide has practically no action upon
dry glass, then it must appear almost absurd to attempt to
explain the gradual <U+FB01>xation of carbon dioxide on glass dried
by calcium chloride by a chemical decomposition of the
  lass.
     But the matter presents itself under quite a different aspect
when we have regard to the phenomena of absorption as
occurring in capillary <U+FB01>lms. Water which at 15° C. and
   1* Translated from Wied. Ann. x. pp. 161—165(1886), by G. H. Bailey,

0'76 metre pressure takes up about 0'2 per cent. of its
weight of carbon dioxide behaves quite differently in capillary
<U+FB01>lms, for it is not then under a pressure of one atmosphere,
but under a very high capillary pressure, and so can take up
so much more carbon dioxide, that, if we would study the
decomposing action of the solution, we have no ground of
comparison, and must solve the problem by direct experiment.
   Such an experiment could not be carried out either before
or during the revious experiments without destroying the
capillary glass t read; and thus it was not possible to proceed
with the examination of this uestion till the experiments
already proceeding were <U+FB01>nished.
   The 49'453 grms. of glass used were, for this purpose,
removed from the measuring tube and extracted with cold
distilled water of such a purity that it left only 5% solid
residue on evaporation. For the extraction, portions of 300
grammes of water were taken, and the whole 3000 grammes
so used were <U+FB01>ltered through a double <U+FB01>lter and evaporated
to dryness in a platinum vessel. The residue dissolved in
hydrochloric acid with evolution of carbon dioxide, and con
tained 0'8645 grm. of sodium chloride and 0'0608 grm. of
silica along with unweighable traces of calcium chloride or
potassium chloride.
   From the composition of the capillary threads *, it appears
therefore that there was not less than 2882 rms. of the
glass decomposed, or 5'83 per cent. of the whole quantity
used. We see, then, that the chemical action of carbon dioxide
under the influence of pressure in capillary <U+FB01>lms is far greater
than we had any cause to expect. The carbon dioxide had,
in the course of the experiments, taken up from the glass a
quantity of soda corresponding to 07841 grm. sodium car
bonate, and containing 0'325 grm. carbon dioxide. '
   Since sodium carbonate is not decomposed, even at very
high temperatures, the 2369 cubic centim. or 04659 grm. of
carbon dioxide set free on heating could not arise from this
decomposition product of the glass thread. But sodium car
bonate takes up carbon dioxide and is transformed into the
bicarbonate, and this carbon dioxide is set free again on heating,
exactly in the same manner as in these observations.
   It is thus to be determined whether the phenomena ob
served in capillary absorption can be exclusively attributed to
the formation of sodium carbonate.
   If we start from the most unfavourable supposition that all
the sodium carbonate formed became bicarbonate, and that
        “ VVied. Arm. xx. P .545 (1883) Phil. Mag. March 1884 .

532       Decomposition of Glass by Carbon Dioxide.
the temperature to which the glass was heated was suf<U+FB01>ciently
high to expel the whole of the carbon dioxide, then we can
only account for 1652 cubic centim. of carbon dioxide instead
of 236'9 cubic centim. There must therefore, even under the
most unfavourable conditions, have been at least 71'7 cubic
centim. of carbon dioxide <U+FB01>xed on the glass otherwise than
by chemical union. We cannot unfortunately determine how
much, however, actually was due to the decomposition of the
glass and how much to the capillary absorption. If, then,
carbon dioxide, under the conditions described, can overcome
the af<U+FB01>nity of silica for soda, a similar action, although in a
lesser degree, may be expected from pure water.
   That such an action really does take place may be expected,
if one may draw a conclusion from the action at higher tem
peratures, as indicated by the following fact, which I had
occasion to observe in the preliminary experiments on the esti
mation of the tension of water-vapour at veryhigh temperatures.
In these experiments I made use of narrow thick-walled tubes,
sealed at the upper end, and attached at the lower end to a
calibrated capillary tube 2 metres long, and which would
withstand a pressure of 600 to 800 atmospheres. In the
wider part of the tube containing air there was, standing over
the mercury column by which the approximate pressure was
measured, a column of water, and this was heated to 550° C.
in the thermostat described *.
   At the part of the wall of the tube with which the water
had been in contact there were alterations of a marked
character.
   The glass was transformed to more than a third of its
thickness into a hard white porcelain-like mass, and the inner
cavity of the tube diminished to one-tenth of its original
diameter. There can be no doubt therefore that glass and
other silicates intended to be used in the examination of such
questions are quite inapplicable.
   In order to obtain trustworthy results in absolute measure
without the interference of chemical in<U+FB02>uence, there remains
scarcely any other course than to repeat the whole of the
experiments on capillary absorption with very <U+FB01>ne gold or
platinum wire, and allow for the chemical action on the
relatively small surface of the glass measuring-tube.

LXII. Reply to the Observations made by Messrs. T. E. Thorpe
   and A. W. Riicker upon our Essay entitled “[ntorm) ad
   alcuneformule date dal Sig. Mendelejeff e dai Siggn. T. E.
   Thorpe e A. W. Riicker per calcolare la temperatura critica
   della dilatazione termica.”
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
IN the course of some researches we were engaged upon
       two years ago we found it necessary to determine the
critical temperature of all, or that of the greatest possible
number of liquids. Inasmuch as this had only been arrived
at experimentally in a comparatively small number of bodies,
it occurred to us to apply to the remainder the theories and
formula of Van' der Waals, and thus calculate the temperature
from the expansion caused by heat. We had already com
menced our investigations when we became acquainted with
the essay by Mendeleje<U+FB02>' on the Expansion of Liquids published
in the Annales de Chimie et de Physique, and with the
summary of it in the essay by Mr. Thorpe and Mr. Riicker
which appeared in the Beibla‘tter, entitled “ On the Critical
 Temperatures of Bodies, and their Thermal Expansions as
 Liquids.” As the formula deduced by Messrs. Thorpe and
 Riicker from the formula of Mendeleje<U+FB01>‘ involved very simple
calculations for determining the critical temperatures, we
 decided to adopt it.
    Before doing so, however, we were desirous of establishing
to our satisfaction the relative correctness of the formula, and
the limits within which it could be legitimately applied.
 This preliminary inquiry gave rise to an essay entitled
 “ Intorno ad alcune formule date dal Sig. D. Mendelejeff e dai
 Siggn. T. E. Thorpe e A. W. Riicker per calcolare la tempe—
 ratura critica della dilatazione termica,” published in the
Nuovo Cimento for July, August, and September, 1884,
pp. 91—104. This essay was also published in the Gazzetta
 Chimica Italiana, vol. xiv. 1884 ; and a report of it appeared
 shortly afterwards in the Bail/latter za den Annalen der Physilc
und Chemie, and also in the Journal de Physique de d’Almeida,
 and, lastly, at the commencement of the present year, in the
 Annales de Chimie et dc Physique. Messrs. Thorpe and Riicker,
 in a note inserted in the ‘Philosophical Magazine’ for May, have
 done us the honour to reply to our essay. We feel convinced that
 these gentlemen have only read the abridged report of our
    Phil. ilfag. S. 5. Vol. 22. No. 139. Dec. 1886.      2 O

paper published in the Annales, or they would not have waited
two years before replying; and we believe also that had they
read the paper in its entirety they would not have found it
necessary to send any reply. We had no intention of criticising
the work of Messrs. Thorpe and Riicker, but merely of
showing by numerous examples the limits within which the
formulas of Mendeleje<U+FB01>', and of Thorpe and Riicker, were
applicable.
    We believed that our inquiry would result in some utility,
 because it was not clear whether the formula of Mendelejetf',
which was deduced from the comparison of the expansion of
 liquids, measured under a pressure of one atmosphere, could
 be applied to the expansion of liquids measured under a
 constant, or uniform, pressure, although not of one atmo
 sp here.
     We proved that the formula of Mendelejetf is valueless for
 showing the results of the experiments of Him, who has
 carefully studied the expansion of certain liquids under a
 constant pressure of 11 metres of mercury.
     This fact appeared, and still does appear, to us to detract
 much from the general applicability of the formula of Men
 delejeff for representing the expansion of liquids, which there
 fore we cannot consider otherwise than as empirical, and
 applicable only within narrow limits, but having with regard
 to the formulas more commonly adopted the merit of greater
 simplicity.
     We were Well aware that the formula of Mendelejeff and
 that of Messrs. Thorpe and Riicker (which is applicable within
 the same limits as that of Mendelejeff) were not applicable to
 water, and we especially called attention to the fact in the
 note at page 98 of our article, and also at page 102.
     .The formula of Messrs. Thorpe and Riicker for calculating
 the critical temperature leads to results which agree exactly
 with those obtained from experiments at temperatures lower
  than the normal boiling-point. We have already applied
  that formula for the calculation of critical temperatures of
  all liquids of which the thermal expansion has been studied.
     We shall feel obliged by your kindly publishing the above
 statement.                             Yours &c.,

 LXIII. Electromagnets.-—VI. The Tension of Lines of Force.
                    By R. H. M. BOSANQUET.
   To the Editors of the Philosophical lM'agazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
THE experimental determination of the magnetic attrac
       tion corresponding to measured values of magnetic
induction has long been in my mind. It has some bearing
on my theory of permeability (see Phil. Mag. ser. 5, xix.
1885, p. 87 (note) and p. 94, in both of which places 352 is
inadvertently printed for 932) ; but its independent interest is
considerable.
   After the following experiments were arranged, a paper on
a somewhat similar subject was read to the Royal Society by
Mr. Shelford Bidwell. From the accounts which have been
so far published, the method of this paper appears to be entirely

 different from mine, as the magnetizing force and the weight
were alone directly measured : and in other respects the
 method differs essentially from that which I have adopted.

536       Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet on Electromagnets.
   The sketch represents the instrument constructed for these
experiments. This consists of two cylindrical iron magnets,
“each 20 centim. long and “526 centim. in diameter. Each is
wound with 1096 coils of wire. One magnet is <U+FB01>xed in a
wooden frame, while the other moves exactly under it smoothly
and without friction, between two brass collars (not shown),
through a vertical distance of about a quarter of an inch.
The magnets were at <U+FB01>rst ground together so as to ensure a
perfect contact. The lower or sliding magnet has attached to
its lower end an iron hook, which passes through the table
and sustains the wooden pan for the reception of the weights.
To this magnet also is <U+FB01>rmly attached a brass collar, in which
are two holes for the pivots of the beam. The beam which
carries the counterpoise is about 18 inches long ; it moves on
knife-edges, and has at one end a half-round fork, which em
braces freely the collar on the lower magnet, and is pivoted
thereto. On the other end of the beam is hung a lead coun
terpoise exactly balancing the wooden pan and magnet.
   The magnetizing current was sent through both electro
magnets, while the induction was measured* by small coils
placed round the point of contact of the two magnets. The
inductions were measured by reversal. Weights were care
fully added until the contact was broken, and the greatest
weight sustained was taken as the observed number. This
could be observed with certainty to the nearest ounce.
   The <U+FB01>rst result is that the formula,
                                      2
(W1) weight in grammes = &T (S: section of contact),
derived from (vol. ii.) Clerk Maxwell’s ‘ Electricity and Mag
netism,’ p. 256, represents the values well on the whole ; but
for very small inductions the weight sustained is several times
as great as it should be according to this theory. And this did
not arise from residual induction ; for when the magnetizing
current was interrupted, no power was left to sustain any
weight at all.
   I therefore framed the empirical formula W , involving
both §3 and $32 ; this represents the lower and middle values
fairly, but not the highest.
   It cannot, however, escape notice that the observed values
are best satis<U+FB01>ed by adding about 4 oz. to all weights calcu
lated from W1. Since, however, this addition must vanish
for 23:0, we cannot thus obtain a general formula.             Note ‘
          '* For the method see Phil. Mag. ser. 5, xix. p. 75.

          Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet on Electromagnets.          537
 that the induction has been forced up to the high value of
 18,500. I have shown in recent papers that this quantity
 has no <U+FB01>xed limit in bar-electroma nets. This accords to
 some extent with the conclusions of r. Shelford Bidwell in
 the paper before referred to.
    The table of experiments is followed by one containing the
 means of the errors of the formula: W1 and W, for the groups
 into which the experiments are divided.
    Finally there are set out a few experiments made with the

we took about half that quantity, say '000026. The experi

At present I am unable to give any explanation of these

   The general truth of the law
                       Tension QC 8232
is suf<U+FB01>ciently established.
   In my theory of permeability I have assumed the tension
within the magnetic body or Q. It is clear that this assump
tion leads in that case to consequences which correspond with
reality, and that the assumption tension 0: S332 does not do
so in that case. I am at present unable to explain the diver
gence between the two points of view.
   The weights have all been reduced to lbs. and ozs. to facili
tate comparison with the actual experiments.
   Batteries were used for weights up to about 51b.; the
dynamo from about 2 lb. upwards.

    SILK v. WIRE, OR. THE “ Gnos'r” IN THE GALVANOMETER.
                       BY n. n. M. BOSANQUET.
THE ballistic galvanometer which I used for some years for the
     measurement of induction currents consisted of a small astatic
pair of needles with mirror, surrounded by a small coil of very low
resistance. The suspension was from a silk <U+FB01>bre about six inches
long, the <U+FB01>bre being left just stout enough to carry the weight.
This whole combination was extremely sensitive and for the most
part convenient to work with.
   The silk suspension, however, has certain troublesome properties.
I shall not here enter into the manner in which it gradually
untwists itself when stretched, or into its property of taking a set
from any change of position ; but shall con<U+FB01>ne myself to the
appearance which we called the “ ghost.”
   At certain times the needles of the galvanometer would move about
with sudden and capricious movements, the mirror often traversing
several degrees of the scale. The decision and sharpness of the
movements were very remarkable, and we habitually spoke of their
cause as the “ ghost.”
   The ghost used to visit us mostly in summer between the hours
of nine and eleven in the forenoon, and about six in the evening *.
When these movements began it was no use attempting to work
with the galvanometer. There can be no doubt that the movements
were due to the solar heat falling more or less directly on the
instrument and causing hygroscopic changes in the silk <U+FB01>bre.
   In the early summer of this year I found it necessary to free
myself from this source of interruption, and constructed a galvano
meter with a wire suspension. The difficulty consists in combining
a needle system large enough to vibrate very slowly on the wire
suspension, with a coil having suf<U+FB01>cient power over the needles,
and at the same time a low enough resistance.
   The needles are stout knitting-needles seven inches long. They
are hung from a. support fastened to the wall by a very <U+FB01>ne wire
about 5 feet long. The needles are very nearly astatic, and the
complete double vibration takes a little over half a minute. The
coil consists of about 500 turns of N0. 20 B. W. G. The resistance
is much greater than that of the old instrument and the loss of
sensitiveness is an inconvenience; but the instrument works well
in connection with our large earth induction-coil of 250 turns of
the same wire, and it is entirely free from the visits of the ghost.
   It is my conviction that silk and thread suspensions are sources
of error and inconvenience to an extent that has been imperfectly
realized; and that they ought to be entirely banished from all
instruments of precision
         ' The aspect of the galvanometer-room is north and east.
