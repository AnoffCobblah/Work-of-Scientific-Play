1.   GINCE      M. Weber, in 1835, studied the laws of the tem-
     ^     poral course of the permanent elongation remaining
after the cessation of a temporary stretching of a thread (the
elastic effect)t, and in 1841 advanced as the cause of the elon
gation
         " the difference of the position of the axis of elasticity
of the smallest particles at any instant from that which corre
sponds to, and is determined for each tension at, perfect equi
librium," an opportune observation by R. Kohlrausch (in
1847)$ has been followed by a more extensive series of inves
tigations upon the relations of imperfect elasticity. These
have been carried out essentially in two different directions.
In the one set the temporary and the permanent alteration of
form are in part observed directly, as well as in their temporal
course ; in the other the diminution of the length of swing of
oscillating bodies.
    In the experiments of the latter sort (for example, on tor
sional oscillations) the molecules are immediately transferred
from the positions assigned to them by the forces acting at
any instant to other positions, before the elastic afteraction has
ended ; and consequently the phenomena are highly compli
cated.    It therefore appeared to me advisable, before studying

relations of this sort, first to investigate the positions of equi
librium of bodies deformed by forces, or the torsions of their
molecules which then takes place.
   With this intention                               I
                               have already, in the years 1858-
1862*, published a series of treatises both on torsion and
bending considered apart, and also on the analogies between
mechanical and magnetic phenomena, as well as the reciprocal
actions between the two.
      I
      had endeavoured inter alia to determine in general out
lines the ratio between the permanent deformations of a body
and the temporary deformations occurring during the action
of the deforming force, and had shown that, as Wertheim f
had already observed, the former occur even after the slightest
temporary deformations, so that in a body not previously de
 formed a limit of elasticity does not properly exist, but bodies
which have sufficiently often been deformed within certain
limits by determinate forces, on the repeated action of the
same or less forces in the same direction as that last applied,
constantly again receive the same permanent deformation.
With this agrees the result subsequently (1865) communi
cated by ThalenJ , that by repeated stretching of rods a raising
of the limit of their elasticity, increasing with    takes place         it,            §.
Moreover, with the first deformation the permanent alterations
of form increased much more rapidly than the temporary,
which      not the case in an equal degree with repeated defor
                 is
mations.       had in like manner shown that, when left longer
                      I
in    state of rest after repeated deformations, bodies partially
      a
return to their previous condition          and behave similarly
                                                          ||,
under deformations which exceed the limits of the first.                                I
have also studied the behaviour of bodies under consecutive
oppositely directed deformations^, &c.
    In addition to these experiments      take leave to communi
                                                          I

should be extended.

The apparatus        employed was the same that had served for the
previous experiments.           PI. I. fig. 1 represents it with some
more recent modifications.             The point which, in the former
experiments, held fast in the axis during the torsion the lower
extremity of the wire and the circle, bow, and metal rod sus
pended from        it,  instead of working as before in an agate

more suitable than the former one, in which the wire vv
struck direct against the wires w w, since thereby the shakings
that might take place during the slow lowering of the roller, in
consequence of the elastic afteraction in the temporarily twisted
wire, and in the thereby occasioned sliding of the wire vv on
ww, are avoided.           Finally, the string A                 A

 the scale-pan  is    loaded   with   the  weights, let down and raise
 the roller very slowly, and twist and untwist the wire without
a   shock.     The wheel       turned so readily on its axis that when
                               p
a   string loaded at each end with 200 grams was suspended on
it,  an excess of less than         gram caused

 inside with a millimetre-scale, which, as usual, was observed

        annealed under feeble tension.
            3. Repeated Torsion in the same Direction. — First a brass
        wire of 480 millims. length and 2 millims. thickness, which
       was loaded beneath with altogether 10460 grams, was re
       peatedly twisted by increasing weights G, and the first tem
       porary torsion T which took place immediately after the initial
        complete action of the weights was, so far as possible, con
        stantly observed (the commencement of which was known by
       the little rod x striking against the wires w w), as well as the
       final temporary torsion T1} which was definitively produced
        after a long time.            Likewise on lifting the torsion-weights
       the torsion P which at first set in, and the finally constant
       permanent torsion P1} were measured.                         The values of T and
       P cannot be exactly determined by any method, since the
       twistings of the wire that take place on lowering and winding
       up the weights immediately pass over, at the full action and the
    •
       complete lifting of the weights, into the deformations produced
       by the aftereffect.

    Thus the temporary torsions increase, as was previously
found, at the first operation of the increasing weights, at first
more slowly, and then always more rapidly, up to a deter
mined value corresponding to the maximum loading.                             This
latter value rises on the repeated employment of the maximum
loading, at first more rapidly, then more slowljT, up to a cer
tain maximum*.
    The permanent torsions exhibit the same behaviour ; only
they rise, on the operation of increasing weights, as already
mentioned, more rapidly than the temporary torsions ; they are
also more increased, on repeated torsion by the same maxi
mum weight, than the latter.
    The result previously observed with alternately directed
torsions is here confirmed — that the limits up to which oppo
sitely acting forces temporarily twist wires always become
narrower with repeated torsions, and gradually approach a
 constant minimal distance.           In the present case those forces
are the temporarily twisting maximal weight and the force nil,
and the distance between the limits is the corresponding value
Ti — Pi.
    At the same time, with repeated torsions the differences
 Tj — Pj that obtain for the various twisting weights become
 constantly more proportionate to the twisting weights ; they
 rise a little with increasing weights, as the differences A of
 the consecutive    values    Tj — Pj show.
     4. Repeated     Torsion in opposite Directions. — In order to
  pursue  this  latter relation within wider limits, especially when
 the wires are not only unilaterally twisted repeatedly in one
  determined direction, but their molecules are turned aside by
  alternately acting forces in opposite directions, a wire of the
  same dimensions as the former ones was loaded with 8175
  grams, repeatedly put into oscillation, and thereupon twisted
  ten times hither and thither by the weights ±114, when its
  temporary and permanent torsions no longer perceptibly
  altered ; their amounts, in scale-divisions, were : —

    Here, as in the previous experiments, after repeated twist-
ings and untwistings the temporary and the permanent final

    5. Torsion of a partly untwisted Wire. — Another, similar
wire was again and again twisted to and fro by the weights
 ±120, till its torsions were no longer altered on the renewed
application of the same forces.                 Again the limits within which
the temporary and the permanent torsions were confined con

     After this the permanent torsion (118) of the wire was re
 duced to lower values by the weights — 20 to —120, and the
 wire each time again twisted by increasing weights in the
 positive direction. The operation was afterwards reversed.
  The results are contained in the following Table, in which T0
  and P0 denote the temporary and permanent torsions obtained
 at the reductions.
     The results of the first observations (reduction by negatively
  acting weights) are more exact, because the finally valid
  action of the weights was longer waited for.                           They are on
  that account delineated in the curves in Plate I. fig. 2, of
  which the ordinates give the permanent torsions P — P0, and
  the abscissae the twisting weights.                   Moreover it follows im
  mediately from the numbers of both Tables that, reckoning
  from the torsion P which remained at the reduction, the tem-

    will gradually increase from P„ to P+m. If this be subtracted

from the temporary torsions produced by the above weights
W, the differences T — P will again be the same to whatever
value Pn within the first limits P+m and P_ro the torsion
P+m has been reduced.          They rise hardly quicker than corre
sponds with the proportionality to the acting weights, and are
equal to the temporary torsions Tm — Pp produced by the same
weights in the ascending direction.           Within the limits P±m
and T±m, therefore, the wire is almcjst perfectly elastic, if the
temporary deformations produced by the forces be reckoned
from the actual zero-position, and so the transient torsions
 alone be taken into account.       It is consequently only the dis
placement of the position of permanent torsion toward one side
that conditions the deviation of the total (reckoned from the
 original position of equilibrium) temporary torsions from pro
 portionality with the acting forces.        Therewith the permanent
 torsion P„ increases up to Pm, at first more quickly, and then
 more slowly, with the rising forces.
    From the above-cited experiments it immediately follows,
 further, that the wire which, after repeated torsions, has ac
 quired a permanent torsion P+m by forces W(_) acting in the
 opposite direction to that of the last applied twisting force
 W(+m), receives stronger temporary torsions T(_) than when
 the forces W(+) act repeatedly in the same direction as the
 force W(+IB).    The difference corresponds to the shifting of the
 position  of permanent torsion in the negative direction.
     7. The Permanent Torsion of a Wire that is frequently
 twisted as far as a determined Limit. — In other experiments a
 metal plate directed vertically downwards was soldered in a
 radial position to the horizontal disk borne by the wire ; and
 horizontal screws were arranged so that at the torsion of the
 wire the plate struck against them. When in this way a brass
 wire of 2 millims. thickness, 450 millims. long, and loaded
 beneath with 9200 grams, was repeatedly twisted by the tor
 sion-weights, the deflection amounting to T scale-divisions, its
 permanent torsions Pi were found to be : —

     Thus also with repeated equal (or, indeed, somewhat dimi
  nishing) temporary torsions of a wire the succeeding perma
 nent torsions increase.      The latter also increase after agitation
 of the temporarily twisted wire.

  8. Influence of the Load. — I have already, in the year 1858*,
shown that, just as the breaking-off of a permanently twisted
iron wire by torsion through magnetizing is independent of
the weights with which the wire is loaded, so also, within
certain limits of loading (in oscillation-experiments), the
toughness of iron wires has the same independence of their
tension t, and mentioned that this is not the case with silver
 wires, especially at a higher temperature.             A brief statement
 of similar results respecting the increase of the toughness
 with the load was published in 1865 by Sir W. Thomson^.
 Braun also has recently § made experiments in the same di
 rection, concerning the action upon bodies of two deform
 ing forces in directions independent of one another                 ||.
      In connexion with those observations, to be communicated
 later on, I    first made some further experiments, on the static
 conditions of wires which had been subjected to various forces
 both of tension and torsion.              For these experiments the
 weighted     iron   rod  suspended    beneath   the rod     of the torsion-

 of the beaker.              The total weight of the metal ring hanging to
 the wire, with its holdfast &c, as well as that of the beaker
 filled with water up to the end of the glass tube, amounted to
 3220 grams.
     9. Loading during Permanent Torsion. — First, an annealed
 brass wire, of 2 millims. thickness and 480 millims. length,
 was twisted ten times, five minutes each time, up to the stroke
 of 2430 scale-divisions, while it was loaded beneath with 3220
 grams.           The permanent torsions, five minutes after each de-
 torsion, were : —

     6000 grams of water being then admitted into the beaker
 suspended beneath the wire while the latter was in the posi
 tion of permanent torsion, the permanent torsion was reduced
 by the shaking to 748*7.                  If  the wire was then again brought
 to the previous temporary                 torsion    and untwisted, the perma
                                        —
 nent torsion rose to 764 and on a second torsion and detor-
 sion, to 770.              When the water was let out, the permanent
 torsion was lowered to 762"6 by the shaking, but rose again
 up to 765 at a single torsion and detorsion.
     10. Loading during Constant Temporary Torsion. — When
 in like manner a new wire was temporarily twisted and un
 twisted to the stroke of 1952 scale-divisions ten times by the
lesser loading, the permanent torsions amounted to : —
            I.       II.     III. IV. V. VI. VII. VIII. IX. X.
          351       387-5    401  409   434    447'5   420-2  422 3 424   425-2
 The wire was then again twisted up to striking ; and while
it was in the position of the temporary torsion, 6 kilogs. of
water was admitted into the beaker with which it was loaded.
After the detorsion the permanent torsion had risen to 452 ;
after a repeated torsion and detorsion, to 461.
     The same experiments were performed inversely ; that is to
say, the wire was first twisted and untwisted ten times while
loaded, and was then unloaded in the positions both of the
permanent and of the temporary torsion. The results were : ¦
                                                                                   —
     I. Loaded wire temporarily twisted up to 2283 scale-divi
sions ten times.

While the wire was in the permanent position the water Was
let out, when P fell to 662. The wire being again twisted up
to 2283 scale-divisions, and untwisted, without loading, P
rose to 664 — and on a second torsion and detorsion, to 665"6.
     11. Loaded wire ten times temporarily twisted to 1839
scale-divisions.
                 I.      II. III. IV. V. VI. VII. VIII. IX. X.

                  M. G. Wiedemann on Torsion.                  11
    When the wire in     the temporary position was unloaded and
untwisted, the permanent torsion was 319"5, and rose to 320
on a second torsion and detorsion of the unloaded wire.
    Therefore, if a load acts upon a wire while it is temporarily
twisted only up to a determined limit, an increase of the per
manent torsion appears, similarly as above, at the shaking of
the wire.     This takes place both when, after repeated tempo
rary torsions, the weight is hung on the wire in the position
of the permanent and when in the position of the temporary
torsion. The unloading acts (though scarcely) in the same
direction.
     11 . Loading during Variable Temporary Torsion. — Analo
gous experiments were made on a brass wire of the same di
mensions ; but the wire was temporarily twisted by a weight
 (110 grams) freely, without striking, and the load was altered
 in the position of the permanent torsion.     In order to render
 the differences of behaviour with different loads more conspi
 cuous, the wire was heated to 100° 0. For this purpose it
 was suspended, with its holdfasts, in a vertical brass tube of
 15 millims. diameter, which was surrounded by a somewhat
 shorter brass tube 6 centims. wide. The ends of the latter
  were connected with those of the former by conical additions.
  This entire heating-apparatus was divided lengthwise into two
  halves, which were soldered together along the surface of the
  longitudinal section, and were joined to one another by hinges,
  in order that the wire might be more easily suspended in it.
  Steam was introduced simultaneously into both halves, through
  side tubes, from above, and carried off from beneath.       The
  following were the temporary and permanent torsions (P0
  noting the permanent torsion after alteration of the loading
  weight) : —

12                      M. G. Wiedemann              on   Torsion.
   Consequently, when the state of the wire, after repeated
torsions and detorsions, has become constant, an increase of
the loading, imparted to it during its detorsion, effects an
augmentation of the following temporary and permanent tor
sions; on the subsequent diminution of the load the final
temporary and permanent torsions remain almost unaltered
(conf. § 14).
                        If,
                    however, we take the differences between
the temporary and the permanent torsions after the wire had
been once loaded, they remain almost perfectly equal.         By
the loading, therefore, only the permanent position of equili-
librium    displaced (as above,
           is                      5), reckoned from which the
                                              §
transient torsions produced by the torsion-weight are constant.
In this sense the wire which has arrived at constant state        a
possesses equal elasticity with different loads.

                        of
 Weights. — A similar action of different loading of the wire
is  shown when      undergoes torsion by increasing weights w
                        it
at the same time that        loaded with alternately lighter and
                                  it   is
heavier weights W.      The experiments were made on brass                        a
wire of the same dimensions as the former ones, and at the
temperature of 100° C.     The results were as follows —                      :

                              A                            and Pj             Tx

almost perfect regularity.
   13. Lastly, we notice the influence of different stretchings
with torsions in alternately different directions. A brass wire
of the former dimensions was, under alternately lighter and
heavier loading, turned both ways up to       determined tempo

rary  torsion  ±T,  and  then  the  permanent torsion ±P was
observed.    Thus  —     :

    Consequently, if the wire in the alternatingly directed tor
sions with a lighter load is brought into such a state that it
constantly takes up again the same positive and negative per
manent torsions, these will be increased with a heavier loading,
but will gradually be diminished with repeated temporary
torsions, and approach toward those obtained with the lighter
loadings.
    14. Effect of very frequently repeated Loadings. — The hitherto
mentioned effects of loading the wire with different weights
always manifested themselves before the wire had arrived at
the constant state in which it always behaves in the same
manner under like conditions. There still remained for in
vestigation the question whether, after the expiration of this
variable state of the wire, alterations of the load still exer
 cise any influence upon its torsion.
    For this purpose a well-annealed brass wire of 2 millims.
diameter and 480 millims. length was put into the apparatus,
loaded beneath with the empty beaker, again annealed and
then repeatedly temporarily twisted and untwisted by 100
 grams, and, as before, the values T and Tx as well as P and Px
 read off, as follows : —

     After the wire ceased to be in this way essentially altered,

Hereupon the              wire was allowed to unturn by lifting the twist
ing-weights ;             its permanent torsion was immediately 559, and
after a longer            time 552.   If water was again let into and out
of the beaker,             the permanent torlions Pz and Pa were : —
                                  I.         II.      III.        IV.

     Inthe temporary torsion, therefore, the first loadings and
also the unloadings produce first of all an increase ; in the
permanent torsion the first loading effects a diminution.                        If
this effect has run out, in the present experiments a decrease
apparently takes place in both cases at the loading, and an
increase at the unloading, to the slight amount of 6-9 scale-
divisions. In order to ascertain if this trifling effect might
not result from the construction of the apparatus notwith
standing the utmost care in its arrangement, the wire was
again unloaded.       The positions of the mirror before and after
the loading corresponded to 584*7 and 579*2 scale-divisions
respectively. The difference amounts to +5*5 in favour of
the unloading.       If, on the other hand, the steel ring was
screwed beneath,    in  which the point that was fastened under the
wire and sustained centrically by it was suspended, the position
remained perfectly unaltered at 587.                       If
                                             the wire was then tem
porarily twisted up to 2212 scale-divisions, and then slowly
carried over to the permanent torsion- position 494, and after
a longer time to 488, and then alternately loaded and unloaded
beneath,       I
             obtained the following : —
                    I.           II.        III.     IV.        V.      VI.

   Here, therefore, after the first effects have run out, which
at first produce at each change of tension a diminution of the
permanent torsion, the latter remains perfectly invariable.
The above-observed small final variations of Pz and Pa, as
well as of Tz and Ta, are consequently to be attributed to
slight rollings of the steel point in the ring, which must always
occur if at the action of the twisting-weights it is pressed to
one side of the steel ring, rotated on                 it,

                               [Plates II. & III.]
 § 1.   rTTHE      transverse vibrations of rods, prisms, or laths
         J-     have been examined by Euler, Poisson, Cauchy,
 Seebeck, and Chladni.          These calculators and experimenters
 have considered the notes and nodes in such bars when both
 ends are free.       The following numerical experimental results
 may    be  of  use  to  those studying the vibration of such solids.
 They    to a  considerable    extent are in accord with the results
 obtained by previous experimenters.
    I propose    to consider here : — (I.) The actual position of the
 transverse nodes in a lath rigidly clamped along one narrow
 edge and vibrating in segments ; and (II.) the torsional and
 torsio-transverse vibrations of a lath similarly clamped.
     I. The material used was hammered sheet-brass cut into
 strips or laths, clamped firmly in a heavy horizontal vice. The
 brass was 2-5 millims. thick. The free ends were always, unless
 otherwise stated, 280 millims. long.              Three such laths were
 used, which were of various widths.                 The laths will in the
 sequel   be  called   A,  B, and  C.
                      A   was 280 x 2-5 x     9-4 millims.
                      B     „ 280x2-5x22-0            „
                      C     „ 280x2-5x32-0            „
     The total length of each lath was 305 millims. (say 1 foot).
  That the effect of the tail of the lath behind the vice's jaws is
  negligible will appear in § 4. The nodes were determined
  in the usual way by fine dry sand, the lath being vibrated by
  a bow.     Let us call the line of the vice's jaws the artificial
  node, and the other nodes the natural ones ; and let us call
  the piece of lath from the free end to the first node the first
  segment, and so on, the last segment being the piece bounded
  at one end by the vice's jaws.          We may represent in the cases
  of segmental vibration the fixed point by a double transverse
                       * Communicated by the Author.

     In
      the next series the same lath was used, but           other                                      its
end was   clamped.   This   comparison   tests the uniformity                                                 of
the lath    density, elasticity, thickness, and width, the latter
                       in
condition being only negligible when the edges are parallel.

there are four   segments,  they are     unequal;     there are          all                  if

there is an odd number of segments, there is a node in the
middle of the lath, and that in all cases the equal segments,
which we may call normal segments, are grouped symmetri
cally in regard to the ends and middle of the lath.
   § 3. The conditions of a lath free at both ends were studied
by the men above mentioned, and by Strehlke, and are strictly
comparable with those of the half-free lath.       A quite free
lath always vibrates symmetrically about its geometric centre,
whether the material centre be at rest or in motion. When
the centre is at rest, and therefore forms a node, the free lath
might be supposed to have motions similar to those of two
half-free laths joined end to end. And so we might expect
that the same lengths of segments would be observed in the
quite free lath as in the half-free one.
   According to Seebeck, the distance from the end of a quite
free lath having natural nodes, when n + 1 is the number of
nodes, is got from the expressions : —
                                                                   1*322

 The last of these, giving the distance from the free end of the
 quite free lath of the with node, of course expresses the equality
 of the distances from one another of all nodes after the third,
 and so embraces the generalization i. in § 2 ; but it has no
 direct bearing upon the lengthening of the last segment in
 the half-free lath.
    From Seebeck's constants and general expression, adopting
 for the sake of direct comparison my length of 280 millims.
 for the quite free lath, we should have the numbers of fig. 2.
    These numbers agree remarkably well with mine.              But
what kind of agreement is it ? In the quite free lath having
two natural nodes, the end segment is equal to the end seg
ment of the half-free lath of the same length having one arti
ficial and one natural node, and so on for more numerous
nodes.    If, therefore, we have a quite free lath of length I
vibrating with a node in the middle — that                   is,
                                                  having an even
number of segments (say 2n)     —  and then clamp     at the central
                                                                   it

the end segment, which was formerly one of the two middle

18                  Frederic Guthrie on certain
ones and had the normal length.           Or if we have a half-free
lath having one artificial and, say, four natural nodes, and
then set it quite free and cause it to vibrate, only the last seg
ment will be affected, breaking up into two parts respectively
equal to the first and second at the other end.
    § 4. The lengths of segments        and consequent vibrating-
 periods or notes are independent of the length of the part of
the lath on the other side of the vice's jaws. This appears
from two experiments with B. This lath was shortened by
pushing it through till its effective length was 220 millims.
 The tail from the front edge of the vice was now 85 millims.
 The lath divided into two segments «j = 172 and s2=48. Their
 ratio is 3"51. The analogous ratios when the length was 280
 was 3-51.     The next segmentation gave
      *1=29-5,    s2=80-5,   «3=110,      ^=2-73,      -3=l-36.
    The analogous ratios with the 280-millims. lath were 2"77
 and l-37 respectively.
          II.   Torsional and torsio-transverse  vibrations.
    § 5. The laths A, B, and C are, when clamped as before,
 easily set vibrating torsionally so as to have a single central
 longitudinal node (fig. 3).
    With A and B the nodal line is perfectly straight. With
 C it was slightly curved, touching the central line near the
 middle, and bending down at both ends to the amount of
 •5 millim.    As this was not a condition of bowing (for the
 line did not shift when the lath was bowed on the other side) ,
it must result either from some slight variation in the quality
 of the lath or want of perfect symmetry in the clamping. It
 has no present interest.
     § 6. The simplest combination of the torsional with the
 segmental as exhibited by all three laths is shown in fig. 4.
    The same figures are obtained on whichever side the lath is
 bowed ; so that whether the form of A and C, or that of B is
produced must depend upon some indefinitely small difference
of condition either of quality or clamping. With B, however,
 it is possible to obtain a state of vibration by means of very
hard clamping, which is perfectly symmetrical about the axis.
 This is shown in fig. 5. The actual condition of the sand
 about the cross nodes is interesting.
    The next combination is fig. 6, and then fig. 7.         Again,

the segments under the assumption that the nodes are straight.
The corresponding lengths of the consonant monochord are: —
for 0^=628; for C", / = 624; and for C'V = 609. The nodal
lines may be as much as 1 millim. curved away from the
chord.     As such curvature does not appear to be a direct
consequence of the slackness of the clamping, but rather of
the inequality of clamping almost necessarily accompanying
such slackness,   I have not further examined it.         In all pre
vious experiments the clamping was so hard that no further
 clamping affected the nodal positions.

 accompanied by explanations.         Of these rules, the first, second,
 and fourth, with their explanations, have been very generally
 accepted, and do not require special consideration.          The Third
 Rule, which is enunciated in these terms, " The qualities of            -
 bodies which admit neither of increment nor decrement, and
 which pertain to all bodies on which experiments can be made,
 are to be considered qualities of universal bodies," is accom
 panied by special explanatory remarks and definitions respect
 ing the ultimate qualities of bodies.      The purpose of this com
 munication is to indicate the necessity of accepting this rule
 in conducting physical theory, and to discuss the definitions
 Newton has appended to it.
                   I
    The object have in view requires commencing with the
 premise that all theoretical research for explaining experi
 mental facts is carried on by means of calculation, which in
 essence is reasoning conducted by symbols of quantity.              The
 application of reasoning by calculation for acquiring know
 ledge consists of three distinct processes : — (I.) Making hypo
 theses (i. e. foundations of calculation); (II.) deriving equa
 tions by means of the hypotheses from the data of proposed
 questions; (III.) solving the equations, according to previously
ascertained rules, for obtaining the answers to the questions.
In order to establish the truth and necessity of this method of
theoretical inquiry,       I shall bring under review the various
stages    of its   application, beginning with the earliest as re
gards both the mathematics employed and the physical data.
As there will be occasion to revert repeatedly to the several
parts,   I shall designate them respectively as parts (I.), (II.),
and (III.).
    It is well known that arithmetical calculation, such as that
now practised, had its origin in India, where " the device of
place/' according to which the value of a figure is determined
by its place relative to other figures in the same row, was
invented.        This expedient,     which appears to have been
unknown to the Greeks and Romans, and without which it
was hardly possible that much progress could be made in cal
culation, was imported into Europe by the Arabians. Whether
or not they derived Algebra from the same quarter, it is cer
tain that the Arabic name, which properly signifies the oppo-

                         Communicated by the Author.

22                     Prof. Challis on Newton's
sition of the two sides of an equation, not only indicates
advancement in numerical calculation, but shows also that the
Arabians put in practice the above-defined processes (I.), (II.),
 (III.) for acquiring information by calculation. In fact, the
formation of the equation implies, first, the making of an hy
 pothesis (putting a; for the unknown quantity), thence deri
 ving the equation by arithmetical rules from the data of the
 question, and, thirdly, the possession of some means of solving
 the equation.       The rules of calculation are obtained by means
 of numerical indications of quantity, it being necessary for
 that purpose to know the relative magnitudes of the quan
 tities. Letters might thence be put in place of numbers in
 such manner as to generalize all particular instances of the
 application of the rules ; and the result would be general arith
 metic, but not algebra.        The essential principle of algebra, as
 now understood, is to reason according to the arithmetical
 rules without knowing whether a represents a greater or less
 quantity than b. The Arabians, in forming and solving equa
 tions, do not appear to have put letters for known or given
 quantities.     This step was first taken by Vieta (in the latter
 half of the sixteenth century), necessitating the use of the
 signs of operation + and — , and, in logical sequence of the
 use of such symbols according to ascertained rules, forms of
 expression which may be called representations of negative
 quantity and impossible quantity.         From this time the science
 of general algebra made rapid progress, our countrymen
 Oughtred, Harris, Wallis, and Newton being conspicuous
 among its promoters. When by their labours the rules of
 operating with indices and- expanding in series were estab
lished, the way was cleared for discovering a new process in the
application of calculation for answering questions.          This ad
vance   was   first  made  by Newton,    whether   as exhibited in his
method of prime and ultimate ratios or that of fluxions.
Leibnitz invented the differential calculus, which is the sym
bolic form of the new calculation which is most suitable for
general application.        By means of the differential calculus
equations     are   formed   the answers to which are no longer
values of    unknown     quantities, but forms of unknown functions
of variable quantities.
    In the meantime discoveries were made by observation and
experiment which called for the application of the new cal
culus.    Kepler ascertained by observational astronomy his
three famous laws of the planetary motions without being able
to assign any reasons for them. Galileo determined experimen
tally (in opposition to the Aristotelians) the laws of the acce
leration of bodies falling towards the earth by the constant

                    " Regula Tertia Philosophandi."                  23
 action of gravity, and, what is much more, the parabolic motion
 of a projectile.     The latter fact is indicative of the law that the
 acceleration in the direction in which gravity acts is the same
  whatever from other causes may be the movement of the body
  acted upon.      It is here proper to remark that experimental
 determinations may be classed under two different heads,
  some being necessary as foundations of theoretical research,
  and others serving to verify and extend theoretically calcu
  lated results.    Of the former class are Galileo's theorems re
  specting the acceleration of falling bodies and the parabolic
  motion of a projectile. All that Newton and Laplace wrote
  on physical astronomy depends on hypothetically adopting
  these two theorems.        Newton, in his First Book, repeatedly
 expresses   his  indebtedness   to the second, calling it " Galileo's
 Theorem."       Kepler's observations belong to the other class ;
 and his name occurs in the Third Book, where Newton speci
 ally refers to the law of the planetary distances as a phenome
  non to be accounted for by the theory of gravitation.            The
 laws of the lunar and planetary motions being determinable
 since Newton's time by theoretical investigation, there was no
 more occasion to employ for that purpose such observations
 as those of Kepler, it being the particular province of theory
 to demonstrate laws, while observations are required for as
 certaining the numerical values of the constants which the
 theoretical formulas involve. The astronomical observer of
 the present day simply determines as accurately as he can the
 celestial places of the sun, moon, and planets, and gives his
 results to the theoretical computer to be dealt with accord
 ing to his requirements.         Flamsteed, from not understand
 ing what he considered to be Newton's crotchets, attempted to
 discover the laws of the lunar inequalities solely by observa
tion.     There is reason to think that something like Flam-
 steed's misapprehension       of the relation between the respec
tive provinces of theory and experiment exists at the present
time.
                                    I
    After these preliminaries, am prepared to enunciate the
parts (I.), (II.), (III.) of Physical Astronomy. The differen
tial calculus satisfies the demands of physical astronomy so
far as regards the operations which calculation has to perform.
Part (I.) consists in making these three hypotheses : — (1)
that every particle of matter attracts by the force of gravity
every other particle; (2) that the action varies with the dis
tance between the particles according to the law of the inverse
square ; (3) that the action conforms to the law of Galileo's
Theorem.       Part (II.) consists in deducing from these hypo
theses what is equivalent in modern analysis to forming a

24                   Prof. Challis on Newton's
differential equation involving an unknown expression or
function of a variable quantity. This was Newton's most
important discovery, which his contemporaries, although, as
he says, they were acquainted with the law of the inverse
square, in vain attempted to make.       Part (III.) is composed
of determinations of unknown expressions by virtual solutions
of differential equations, together with physical inferences
drawn from the solutions, and comparisons of these results
with facts of observation.      In short, in analytical language
Newton effected the solution of a differential equation of the
second order between two variables, whereby he not only ac
counted for Kepler's laws, but also demonstrated, a posteriori,
by the comparison of calculation with observation, the hypo
thesis of the inverse square and that of Galileo's Theorem.
     The course of inquiry by which the science of physical as
tronomy has been established forms a paradigm to be followed
in the more advanced department of physical research embra
cing the theories of light, heat, force of gravity, electricity,
galvanism, and magnetism.         Here also Newton has pointed
 out the way of proceeding, having stated in his Third Rule
 of philosophizing, and at the end of the Third Book, the
 primary hypotheses on which such research must be founded.
 These constitute Part (I.) of this new stage of physical philo
 sophy.    They consist of two kinds, namely, hypotheses abso
 lutely true, and hypotheses which admit of being proved to be
 true by comparison of mathematical results derived from them
 with facts of observation.    To both kinds Newton's dictum,
 " hypotheses non Jingo "
                           (I not arbitrarily make hypotheses),
                             do
 applies.   The several hypotheses may be stated as follows.
 The " least parts " (atoms) of bodies have only sensible qua
 lities, as form, magnitude, mobility, and intrinsic inertia.
  These are absolute and necessary qualities, inasmuch as their
 existence is immediately conveyed to us by our senses, and
 apart from them we cannot conceive of matter.       Newton adds
 the quality of   "                 " relative to the least parts,
                    impenetrability
 which signifies that they admit of no change of form or mag
 nitude. In fact, they would otherwise not be conformable to
 that part of the enunciation of the Third Rule, which states
  that the ultimate qualities of bodies cannot be increased and
  diminished (intendi et remitti nequeunt).    Moreover he does
  not allow the possibility (or conceivableness)     of one body
  acting upon another without intervening substance ; and in
  the scholium at the end of the Principia he adverts to the
  agency of a certain
                        " very subtle " medium
                                                 (the aether), per
  vading the grosser bodies.      On adopting these Newtonian
  principles for the purpose of extending the boundaries of phy

                   " Regula     Tertia Philosophandi."                    25
sical philosophy,      I have further supposed, for the purpose of
applying     mathematical      reasoning, that the atoms are impene
trable spheres, that the aether is a perfect fluid of constant in
trinsic elasticity, and that it varies in pressure in exact pro
portion to variations of its density.            The aether is thus defined
 by the equation p=kp,p being the pressure, p the density,
 and k an absolute constant.           These three hypotheses are of the
 kind which have to be verified by comparisons of deductions
 from them with experimental facts.
      Bearing in mind Newton's monition not to make hypotheses
                  " the tenor of experience," or to deviate from
 contrary to
 "the analogy of nature,"         I  have added the above-stated hy
 potheses on the following grounds.               First, since experience
 has brought to our knowledge no other kind of masses of
 matter than such as are atomically constituted, and since a
 universal plenum under any natural conditions is inconceivable,
 I suppose the aether to have a uniform atomic constitution —
 that is, to consist of minute atoms all of the same size and
 uniformly distributed. Under this constitution it may be
  conceived to be susceptible of variations of density from point
  to point, and to be capable of pressing in proportion to the
  density. Again, in the formula p = kpas applied to the aether,
  there can be no variation of the factor k, because, as the exist
  ence of the aether is supposed to be the primary condition of
  physical force, there are no ulterior forces to which a variation
  of its elasticity can be referred.          This view makes it neces
  sary   to demonstrate      that  all   the  forms of physical force are
  modes of pressure of the aetherial medium.               To show this has
  been the express object of physical researches (subsequently
   referred to in this communication) on which I have been en
  gaged during many years.                Further, it is to be said that a
   system   of philosophy     which    rests  wholly on the indications of
   sensation and experience can admit of no other kind of force
   than pressure, because of this force we have immediate sensible
   cognition (as when we press with the hand against any sub
   stance); and the same assertion cannot be made respecting
   any other kind of force.         In support of the hypothesis of the
   spherical   form   of the   atom   I  might cite another of Newton's
              " natura solet esse simplex" the form of the
   sayings,                                                           sphere
   being defined by a single constant.            Also the fact that a mass
    of water remains the same in magnitude and quality after any
    amount of change of the relative positions of its parts, implies
    that each ultimate part has the same relation to surrounding
    parts after as before the disturbance, and that the relation is
    the same in all directions from the ultimate part.           These views
    may be regarded      as justifying     the  hypothesis   of the sphei-ical

26                     Prof. Challis on Newton's
form of the atom, but only as a ground for mathematical rea
soning whereby the truth of the hypothesis may be tested.
    Before proceeding to Part (II.) of the stage of physical
inquiry now under consideration, a certain mathematical diffi
culty has to be stated and cleared up. In physical astronomy,
as we have seen, Newton overcame the difficulty of discover
ing the calculation proper for determining the motion of a
single particle acted upon by given forces.         Since, according
to the foregoing hypotheses, the pressure of the setherial me
dium performs an essential function, we have now to discover
the hydrodynamical principles and calculations applicable to
the determination of the motion and pressure of a fluid par
ticle in juxtaposition with other particles, which is a prelimi
nary difficulty of the same kind as that just mentioned.         The
former process required the formation of a differential equation
containing two variables ; this requires differential equations
containing at least three variables, and is therefore of greater
complexity.        The discovery and treatment of two such equa
tions, one expressing the principle of constancy of mass, and the
other derived from an application of D'Alembert's Principle,
 were effected by the researches of Euler, Lagrange, and
 Poisson.     On attempting to advance to Part (II.) by employ
ing these equations,       I was stopped by finding that Poisson
had   deduced     from  them, in the case of a fluid the pressure of
which varies proportionally to its density, an equation from
which    I  could strictly infer that the same fluid particle might
be at rest and have a maximum velocity at the same moment
 of time (see Phil. Mag. for June 1848, p. 496, and my ' Prin
 ciples of Pure and Applied Calculation/ p. 195).           This was
 evidently   a  reductio  ad absurdum   absolutely demanding a re
 consideration      of the hydrodynamical principles.       As those
principles on which the two equations are founded are unques
tionably true, the only logical inference is that they are in
sufficient.    It consequently occurred to me that, besides the
equation expressing constancy of mass, one was required for
expressing continuity of the motion. Accordingly have proI
posed to found such an equation on the following principles : —
 (1) that the course of a given particle is so far continuous
that the directions of its motion in successive instants cannot
make with each other a finite angle ; (2) that the directions
of the lines of motion in each elementary particle are at each
instant normals to a surface of continuous curvature, which is
either of finite or infinitely small extent, the total surface of
displacement being conceived to be such that, however it
might be composed of discontinuous parts, no two of its con
tiguous elements are inclined to each other by a finite angle.

                       " Begula Tertia Philosophandi."                                                 27
In proof of principle (1) it suffices to say that a finite change
of direction of the motion of an element in an infinitely small
interval could only be produced by infinite force, which, by
the nature of the inquiry, is excluded.     The principle (2) of
geometrical continuity, being supposed independent of change
of time and place, requires to be expressed as such, like that
of constancy of mass, by a differential equation, the mathe
matical investigation of which I proceed now to give.
      If
      m, v, w be the velocities at the point xyz at the time t in
the directions of the axes of x, y, z, it is known that in
the case supposed of surfaces of displacement      of continuous
curvature, udx + vdy + wdz is either integrable of itself or by
a   factor.         Hence   if ~      be the factor,         when one is required, and
{dijr) be put for the exact differential                       - dx + - dy + — dz,                     we

shall have (dtjr) = 0 for a surface of displacement.     The above
stated principle of continuity requires that such an equation
should apply to each element of the fluid at successive instants.
This condition is expressed by the formula (d\Jr) + B(dyfr) — 0,
the sign of variation B having reference to change of position
of the element in space and time.           Hence as (d-\fr) — 0, we
shall have  also S(cty)  =   0, and, on  account  of the independ
ence of the signs of operation S and d, (d . Byfr) = 0, whence by
integration By}/ = <f>(t)8t.    The complete variation B\}r of the

 giving proof of the reality of motion for which udx + vdy + wdz
 is integrable by a factor.     In short, reasons may be adduced
 for concluding that the factor         - is applicable   to cases in which
                                        A,
  the motion is not distinctively that of a fluid, but such as a fluid
  is capable of if conceived to be composed of infinitely small
  parts that are solid — such, for instance, as uniform rectilinear
  motions parallel to agiven plane and varying as some function of
  the distance from the plane, or uniform motions of revolution of
  infinitely thin cylindrical shells with velocities varying as some
  function of the distance from a common axis, or steady spiral
  motions composed of these two kinds.              So far as the motion
  partakes   of that which  pertains   to a  solid, it must be determin
  able from the data of the problem by separate treatment, and
  has to be eliminated.    For the remaining motion udx + vdy + wd z
  is integrable of itself, because this analytical circumstance spe
  cially indicates that the motion is such as pertains to a fluid.
  Hence the reasoning (in the Phil. Mag. for March 1851,
                                                          '

  Applied Calculation,' p. 186)         from   which      Ihave    inferred
  that the motion is rectilinear when udx + vdy +         wdz   is an exact
  differential, and have thence attempted to get rid of the diffi
  culty resulting from the before-mentioned           reductio ad absur-
 dum, cannot be maintained.         I  have recently ascertained that
 the origin of the difficulty admits of being simply stated as
 follows. In the reasoning by which the rate of propagation in
 a fluid defined by the equation p = a2p can be shown to be
 such as to lead to the above-mentioned           absurdity for a parti
 cular form of the arbitrary function, it is assumed that the
 lines of motion are all parallel to a fixed plane, or that the
 surfaces of displacement are planes.         (See Phil. Mag. for Jan.
 1851, example     I.,   p. 34,   and    Principles &c.' example
                                         '                                 I.,
 p. 193.)     Now in that case,     as      evident, the motion
                                             is                       isnot
 such as is   peculiar to     fluid, but of the kind for which, as
                         + a
above said, udx + vdy        wdz   isintegrable by       factor, whereas
in the reasoning that differential expression         is aassumed to be
integrable    of itself.  This   contradiction    accounts    for the re
 ductio ad absurdum.
    In order to clear up the difficulty, have supposed that rec-
                                              I

                  " Regula    Tertia Philosophandi."                 29
tilinear propagation takes place along an axis, and that the
contiguous motion is such as only a fluid is capable of.             To
express these conditions, it suffices, after taking the straight
line of propagation for the axis of z, to assume that
                       (d./<f>)
                                = udx + vdy + wdz,

t   only.   For, on these suppositions,

 ¦J-=0, where x=0, and y = 0, the axis of z will evidently be
 an   axis of the motion. On reasoning from these antecedents
 no   contradiction is met with like that which occurred in the
 previous method ; and the reasoning is proved to be legiti
 mate by actually conducting to a definite form, expressed in
 series, of the function 0, and also to a series of definite form
      /
 for in case the motion be a function of the distance from
 the axis for any given value of z.         The series for $ is the har
 monic series assumed by Helmholtz and other physicists in
 the mathematical theory of music. As the motion indicated
 by this series is not supposed to be dependent on a particular
 mode of disturbance, it evidently should be derived mathema
 tically from the initial hydrodynamical definitions. This is
 what is done by the above-stated course of reasoning.              The
  other factor   /  differs very little from unity in aerial vibra
 tions ; but in a medium of great elasticity, such as we have
  supposed the aether to be, it is of special significance, serving
 to account for transverse vibrations in the undulatory theory
  of light, and the distinction between common and polarized
  light. As experience shows that polarization is a quality of
  light depending on the constitution of the medium by which
  the luminous vibrations are transmitted, being producible
  under a great variety of extraneous conditions, it is an im
  portant confirmation of the present reasoning that it is capable
  of deducing transverse vibrations from the original definition
  of the aether.
      By the same course of reasoning,        the velocity of propaga
  tion is found to   be ko, k   being a determinable numerical con
   stant.   Having concluded that my attempt to calculate the 4-
   value of k, contained in the Phil. Mag. for February 1853,
   was erroneous,    I  made another in the Phil. Mag. for May
   1865, p. 329, which      I have introduced into the ' Principles
                                                                        '

30                   Prof. Challis on Newton's
velocity of sound thence derived is 1 109*3 feet per second,
which exceeds by 17*5 feet the value obtained experimentally
by Dr. Schroder (Phil. Mag. for July 1865, p. 47).
    It will here be proper to make some remarks on methods
that had been previously employed for determining theoreti
cally the velocity of sound. The reasoning adopted by Newton,
and afterwards by Laplace, fails to give the true theoretical
value, because it is vitiated by involving the contradiction
which   I  have indicated above.    Laplace, assuming that from
hydrodynamical      considerations  no value different from the
quantity a was deducible, proposed to account for the differ
ence between observation and theory by the effect of develop
ment of heat and cold produced by the condensations and
rarefactions of the aerial vibrations.    He accordingly sought,
quite logically, to establish this explanation on a theory of
heat.    I do not suppose that any physicist now accepts that
theory, inasmuch as the explanation of the above-mentioned
difference is made to rest on some gratuitous hypothesis which
is not supported by any reference to an antecedent theory of
heat.    For instance, when it is said that the acceleration of
the rate of propagation is due to slow dispersion of the deve
loped heat and cold, no evidence is adduced to show that this
is a vera causa in unconfined air.       From a theory of heat
        I
which have founded on Newton's a priori hypotheses,        I  have
inferred that the dispersion is so rapid as to produce little or
no effect on the rate of propagation ; and this result accords
with the value of k deduced mathematically, as said above,
from the properties of a fluid defined by the equation p=a?p.

cited work.)
   After the foregoing rectification of the principles of hydro
dynamics, the way is clear for proceeding from Part (I.) of
general physics to the consideration of Parts (II.) and (III.).
The former of these two parts consists of formations of equa
tions applicable to the several theories of light, heat, gravita
tion, electricity, galvanism, and magnetism; and the latter
comprises deductions from the solutions of the equations and
comparisons of the results with experiment.       Respecting the
investigations belonging to these two divisions,      I can only
refer to my own mathematico-physical productions, because,
as my contemporaries      have in no instance adopted the New
tonian hypotheses of Part (L), they are logically debarred
from entering upon Parts (II.) and (III.). In a communica
tion like the present it would not be possible to advert in detail
to the many problems    I have undertaken to discuss under these

                   " Regula   Tertia Philosophandi."                   31
two heads     ; so that  I can do no more than direot the reader's
attention to the investigations contained in my ' Principles of
Pure and Applied Mathematics,' published in 1869, and in
                                         '
two smaller works, one entitled            Essay on the Mathematical
                                       ¦        '
Principles of Physics,' and the other Remarks on the Cam
bridge Mathematical Studies and their Relation to Modern
 Physical Science,' published respectively in 1873 and 1875.
These investigations are founded, for the most part, on nume
 rous communications made to the Philosophical Magazine.
 I   am well aware that, as was likely to happen in so extensive
 an undertaking, there are many imperfections and errors in
 these productions (some of which             I   have rectified in later
 communications       to the Phil. Mag);     but   since the course which
 they follow rests on Newton's authority, and, as 1 think have      I
 shown in this communication, is pointed out by the antecedents
  of physical philosophy,     I cannot but be of opinion that these
  works, or one embodying like views, will eventually have to
  be regarded as holding the same place relative to general
  physics as Newton's Principia holds with respect to physical
  astronomy.
      I shall here introduce a few results obtained under Parts^
  (II.) and (III.), selecting such as may serve to justify the
  opinion above expressed as to the necessity of the course of
  philosophy     I have been advocating.
           The   distinction  between common light and polarized
                                                        /
      (1)
  light is   indicated  by  means   of the function       already denned,
  which for common light is a function of the distance r from the
  axis of propagation independently of any special mode of dis
  turbing the aether, and for polarized light a function of x and
  y depending on arbitrary disturbance. These results agree
   with experimental facts.
      (2) The dynamical action of aetherial vibrations on a small
   sphere, when terms of the second order are taken into account,
   is capable of producing, according to differences of circum
   stances, attraction or repulsion of the sphere, and thus of ac
   counting for atomic repulsion, molecular attraction, and the
   attraction of gravity.
       (3) It may be demonstrated that no particle of the asther,
    supposed to be of unlimited dimensions, can be transferred
    across a plane fixed in space so as permanently to alter the
    quantities of fluid on the two sides of the plane.              Conse
    quently the motions are either vibratory or in re-entering
    currents. To the former motions the phenomena of light,
    heat, molecular adhesion, and gravitation are referable, and to
    the latter the phenomena of electricity, galvanism, and mag
    netism.

    32                  Prof. Challis on Newton's
       (4) On the' same principles, the existence of a mechanical
   equivalent of heat is accounted for (see ' Principles &c.'
   pp. 469 and 481).
       (5) It may plainly be demanded of this advanced depart
   ment of physical philosophy to give reasons for the qualities
   of the three hypotheses on which, as before stated, the science
   of physical astronomy rests.        It affords, in fact, the following
   reasons :  — (1) The universality of gravitation is a direct con
   sequence of its being a mode of action of a universal medium,
   the aether.    (2) The gravitation law of the inverse square is
   mathematically derived from the dynamical action of aethe-
   rial undulations of large magnitude on an atom taken to be a
  small sphere.       The most complete investigation of this law
  that   I have succeeded in giving on hydrodynamical principles,
  I   consider to be that contained in arts. 31-38 of a communi
  cation on Attractive and Repulsive Forces, in the Phil. Mag.
  of September 1872.         (3) In art. 39 of the same communica
  tion, an argument embracing the squares of the velocities of
  the aether is adduced, from which the coexistence of the trans-
  latory effects of all forces referable to the action of setherial
  vibrations is inferred.       Hence, after accounting for universal
  gravitation and the law of the inverse square, Galileo's
  Theorem, in its most general acceptation, is an immediate con
  sequence of the above result.
      If it should be inquired whether the hypotheses of general
 physics, like those of physical astronomy, admit of being de
 rived from ulterior conditions,       I  should decidedly say they are
 not so derivable.      For as the philosophy of general physics
 consists of fundamental principles perfectly intelligible from
 sensation and experience, and of mathematical                deductions
 therefrom,     no  further   research   is either   needed  or possible,
 the results being reached by means whereby alone complete
 human knowledge of nature is attainable.                These physical
 principles must therefore be referred to causes that are not
                                                                    "
               "
 mechanical (to use Newton's expression), and may conse
 quently exist by the immediate Will of the Author of the
 Universe.      It may further be remarked that in this scheme of
philosophy     no  place is left for the exercise of the imagination ;
and accordingly Newton has laid down the rule (not enough
attended to by some modern physicists),
                                                  " somnia temere con-
fingenda non sunt."
     It is right that in connexion with the foregoing views             I
should advert to the many excellent treatises on physics which
have been published in recent times both in England and on
the Continent.       These, one and all, are devoted to establishing
physical facts, and expressing the laws by which they are

                  '*
                     Regula Tertia Philosophandi."                 33
  governed  by mathematical formula?.        This necessary prelimi
  nary department      of  physical philosophy, which has been
  handled with admirable skill and exactness in those treatises,
  evidently differs in its character from Newton's mathematical
 Principles of Natural Philosophy. French writers, with their
  usual attention to logical accuracy, name that department
 La Physique (Physics), and carefully distinguish between
 ascertaining laws by such means, and referring them to a
priori principles. The deduction of laws from experiment and
 observation, and expressing them by mathematical formulae,
 is often called theory ; and such it is in a subordinate sense.
 But theory in its most exact and complete sense consists in
 giving reasons for experimental laws by means of mathema
 tical reasoning founded on intelligible primordial principles.
 This is the department I have taken up, in accordance with
 Newton's example and anticipations, being of opinion that
 his Principia has established the presumption that laws, just
 because they are laws, are proper subjects of human research
 and demonstration.
    My physical investigations may      be classed under two heads   :
 — those relating to the principles     and processes of Hydrody
 namics, which I commenced in the Philosophical Magazine as
 far back as the year 1829, and have carried on, not always
 successfully, up to the present time ; and those which treat
 theoretically of the laws of the physical forces on the basis of
the Newtonian hypotheses, beginning with a Mathematical
 Theory of Heat contained in the Philosophical Magazine for
March 1859. Among this class of researches I beg to call
attention more particularly to the article on Newton's ''Foun
dation of all Philosophy," in the Philosophical Magazine for
                                I
 October 1863, p. 280. As intend the present communica
tion to be a kind of resume' of the portions of my productions
which   I consider to be most conducive to the progress of theo
                                     I
retical physics, and as probably may be unable to make any
further efforts of the same kind,       I take this opportunity for
expressing the opinion, which       I  have   long entertained, that
injustice has been done to Newton's scientific fame by the
persistent neglect, and even opposition, with which modern
physicists have treated the parts of his Book III. which have
reference to the future of theoretical philosophy, and may
be considered to justify his naming that Book Mundi Sy sterna,
those parts being, according to my judgment, among the most
remarkable proofs of the greatness of his genius.

readily be inferred from the given expression for f. The in

induced to relinquish only under the above-stated misap

any fault in the reasoning of that investigation. The rate of

 upon that of cp, and on the legitimacy of the application of the
 two equations to the gas or vapour under consideration.
    With respect to the first of these points, may be remarkedit
 that E. Wiedemann has recently (Fogg. Ann. fed. clvii. p.                                1,
 1876, and Wied. Ann. Bd. ii. p. 195, 1877) determined the
 specific heats at constant pressure of 14 out of the 35 gases
 and vapours studied by Regnault.         The difference between
 the results of the two investigators amounts in two cases only
 (ethylene and ammonia) to        per cent.

 about     per cent., and in all the others less. Thus even on
           5
 the assumption that the later experiments     are absolutely cor
 rect,    follows that Eegnault's numbers may be trusted to
           it                                                                             6

 the particular temperatures at which the experiments were
 made, as Wiedemann shows that in all but the most perfect

gases the specific heat at constant pressure varies considerably
with the temperature.
    More recently still, Wiillner (Wied. Ann. Bd. iv. p. 321,
1878), using Kundt and Warburg's method, has determined
the ratio of the specific heats of air, carbonic oxide, carbonic
acid, nitrous acid, ethylene, and ammonia at 0° and 100° C.
 He finds that for gases which obey Boyle's law, cp and c„ are
 constant, but that in the case of less perfectly gaseous bodies
 they increase with the temperature.       The difference between
 them, however, is always very approximately constant and
 equal to the theoretical number — thus justifying the applica
 tion of the first of the above equations to imperfect gases, and
 proving that the observed increase in the specific heats is due
 to work done within the molecules, and not against the inter-
 molecular forces, which must therefore be negligible.
    On the whole, then, the result of these researches is to show
 that m + e can be calculated very approximately from the above
 equations if cp is given, and that Begnault's values of this
 quantity are probably trustworthy to 6 per cent.
    One of the chief difficulties of the thermodynamic theory of
 gases has been to attribute to m and e values which would at
 once lead to the observed ratios of cp to cv, and satisfy any
 rational supposition as to the interior mechanism of a mole
 cule.   Kundt and Warburg proved that for mercury vapour^
— =1*666, which is consistent only with the supposition that
 the atoms of that substance are smooth rigid spheres.        Boltz-
 raann (Pogg. Ann. Bd. clx. p. 175, 1877) and Bosanquet (Phil.
 Mag. April 1877) have since drawn attention to the fact that,
 for a smooth rigid surface of revolution, m = 5 and e=0, which
 would make    —  =1'4.    The fact, therefore,   that this number
 agrees very closely with those given by experiment for a large
 number of gases (air, 0, N, H, CO, and NO) would be accounted
 for by supposing their molecules to be surfaces of revolution.
 This condition would be fulfilled, as is pointed out by Mr.
 Bosanquet, by two spheres rigidly united, and would thus
 accord well with our conception of the atomic constitution of
 the above gases.     It would perhaps be better to regard the
 spheres not as rigidly united, but as bound together by forces
 which prevent the separation of their surfaces, while leaving
 them otherwise free to move.        The required five degrees of
 freedom would thus be obtained, and the hypothesis would
better coincide with the supposition of the union of two smooth
spheres to form the ultimate particles of the gases.

sent purpose is to point out an interesting fact connected with
its application to chlorine and its compounds.
   The maximum number of degrees of freedom which a mo
lecule composed of n smooth rigid spheres could possess would
be 3n ; but the forces in play between the spheres might, as
in the case of air and the other gases above referred to, reduce
the number to much below this amount.          Thus the value of
m + e could not exceed, but might be less than 3n + e.        For
gases in which the molecule consists of two atoms, e=0; but
in the cases of more complex combinations we can say only
that, cceteris paribus, we should expect that its value would
increase with the number of atoms in the molecule.       Bearing
these facts   in mind,  the following Tables  lead  to a  curious
result.   In the first column of each are placed the symbols of
the substances             referred       to.   In   the second columns          are the
ratiosof the specific heats, deduced (except in the case of mer
cury) from Regnault's experiments by the use of equation (1).
In the third are the values of m+e (omitting fractions) de
duced    by equation (2). In the fourth are the values of 3n,
where    n is the number of atoms of which the molecule is com-

    The first Table contains a number of simple and more or
 less complex compound gases and vapours ; the second is con
 fined to chlorine and its compounds alone.           The difference
 between the two is most marked.           In the first   the value of
 m + e is for every substance (with one exception) less than 3n,
 or than the maximum possible value of m. In the second the
 reverse statement holds good in more than two thirds of the
 whole number of cases.
    This difference can hardly be accidental ; nor can it be ex
 plained by an error of 6 per cent, in Eegnault's experiments.
 It might be accounted for by supposing that in the case of
 chlorine e is abnormally large — and that this gas differs from
 others in which the molecule is built up of two spheres, in that
 the spheres are not necessarily in contact, and are probably
Jherefore less" firmly united.
    Another supposition, however, would meet the case equally
 well, viz. that n has been taken too small, that the symbol Cl2
 is incorrect, and that the atoms of chlorine, and therefore the
 molecules of its compounds, contain a larger number of sub-
 atoms or atoms than has been supposed.            It need hardly be
 added that this supposition fits in most satisfactorily with the
 results of the recent researches of Prof. Victor Meyer on the
 vapour-density of chlorine ; and in the fifth column of Table     II.
 are given the values of 3n calculated on the assumption that
 throughout the first column we ought to write Cl3 for CI.
 Hydrochloric acid now offers a difficulty, as a body composed
 of four spheres could only possess so small a number of de
 grees of freedom as five if the spheres were rigidly connected
 with their centres in one straight line. With this exception,
 however, columns       III. and V. of Table II. now present differ
 ences of the same sign and order as those in the corresponding
 columns in Table I.
    The number of degrees of freedom attributed to each sub

                 as to the Constitution     of Chlorine.               39
stance  may perhaps be wrong by one in some of the simpler
bodies, and by rather larger numbers in some of the more
complex ; but the general character of the Tables is probably
beyond the reach of any such changes.                An error e. g. of 6
per cent, in the specific heat at constant pressure of the tetra
chlorides would only reduce the number of their degrees of
freedom by one.       Much greater alterations would be intro
duced by taking the specific heats at other temperatures than
those at which they were determined by Regnault.                  Chloro
form is the only compound of chlorine of which the law of the
variation of the specific heat with the temperature was studied
by Wiedemann ; and using his results,           I  find that at 0° C. the
number     of degrees of  freedom  of    this substance would be one
less instead of two greater than 15.
    In spite, however, of the uncertainty thus introduced, the
comparison of the two Tables is sufficiently suggestive to in
duce me to lay them before the Physical Society.                 The fact
that the application of the theory of gases to the specific heats
 of a large number of substances, determined as far as might
 be under similar circumstances,        leads to the alternatives that
 the atoms of which a molecule of free chlorine is composed are
 either less strongly united or are more numerous than in the
 case of other elements, is not unimportant.
    It remains to add that the ratios of the specific heats of bro
 mine and of the only one of its compounds which has been
 studied agree with those of chlorine and the corresponding
 chlorine compound.

    Note. — Since the above was written, the conclusions at first
 drawn from Prof. V. Meyer's research have been questioned
 (Chem. News, Nov. 21, 1 879, p. 244) on the ground that experi
 ments made by Seelheim, of Utrecht, indicate the possibility of
 the formation of a volatile chloride of platinumat high tempe
 ratures.     However this may be, the cause of the anomalous
 specific heats of chlorine and its compounds remains to be ex
 plained ; and the above statement of the alternative supposi
 tions to which the theory discussed leads may not be uninter
 esting, even if it should be proved that one of them lacks the
 support which, at the time of writing, Prof. V. Meyer's research
 was supposed to afford it.

that gives no aberration in the primary plane for rays of small
obliquity.   Neither kind of aberration important for a glass
                                                     is
lens of this sort moderately sloped.                 If
                                                n=Vh, (43) gives
0=73°.     If    exceed

   Another case of considerable interest can be investigated
more easily.    It that of prism with flat sides, through
                          is           a
which convergent or divergent light passes.           The prism                      is
supposed to be adjusted     until the   symmetrical (horizontal)
plane contains the radiant point but        ;   need not be in the

the same principles as are applied by Professor Stokes* to in

The factor    fi—fi-1 is equal to unity when /i=l*62, and for
glass   will never  differ much from unity.       By comparison with
(31), it would appear that in the case of a 60° prism in the
position of minimum deviation, the admissible vertical angular
aperture is twice as great as the admissible horizontal angular
aperture ; but, on account of the variable distribution of light
in the image, this conclusion probably requires modification
in favour of the horizontal aperture.
    If there is to be no confusion of the two soda-lines when
seen with a prism of extra-dense glass one inch high, the dis
tance of the radiant points must exceed four feet.
    Equation (44) is applicable without change to a spectroscope
of any number of properly adjusted prisms of similar material.
                 § 8.   The Design    of Spectroscopes.
    The circumstances under which spectroscopes are used
 are   so various that it is probably impossible to lay down
 any one construction as absolutely the best; but the princi
ples of the foregoing sections allow us to impose certain limi
tations within which the choice of the designer must be con
fined.     The first point to be considered is the resolving-power.
This,   in the case of prismatic instruments of one given mate
 rial,  carries with it the total thickness traversed; and the
 question is simply in what form it is most advantageous to
 employ this thickness.       The other points to be attended to are
 principally illumination, quantity of material, ready applica
 bility to various parts of the spectrum, simplicity and ease of
construction.
    To a certain extent the requirements of illumination and re
 solving-power are antagonistic. If, indeed, the eye were a
 perfect instrument, a beam of diameter equal to that of the
 pupil would present the full degree of brightness, and a resol
 ving-power corresponding to the thickness employed.              But,
 as was explained in § 3 (vol. viii. p. 272), in order to obtain the
 full value of the thickness it is necessary further to narrow the

beam    ; and then illumination suffers.         If full illumination be
required, we must employ a thickness three or four times as
great as that defined by (5), § 3.
    Apart from the question of the area of the pupil occupied
by the beam, illumination suffers from the effects of absorption
and reflection. The first depends simply upon the thickness
traversed, and is therefore an invariable quantity when the
material and resolving-power are given. Some years since it
was laid down by Pickering* that in spectroscopes composed
 of prisms of the same material and in the position of minimum
deviation (which disperse equally and admit the same amount
 of light) the loss by absorption will be the same.            In accord
 ance with what has just been proved, we are now able to
dispense with the restriction to minimum deviation.
    In powerful spectroscopes the transparency of the material
 of which the prisms are made is a point of great importance.
 Some specimens even of well-made flint and crown glass exa
mined by Christie f stopped as much as half the light in a
thickness of 4 inches.         Such a degree of absorption renders
the glass unsuited for instruments of more than moderate
power. From measurements by Robinson and GrubbJ, how
ever, it would seem that absorption need not stand in the
way of much more powerful instruments than any yet at
tempted.       One specimen of Chance's glass was of such trans
parency     that   111 inches would be necessary to reduce the
transmitted light in the ratio 2*7 to 1.
    The loss of light by reflection depends upon the number
 of surfaces and upon the angles at which the rays are inci
dent.     It might be thought that a great multiplication of
 surfaces was necessarily very unfavourable to brightness ; but,
 as has been pointed out by Pickering in the paper referred to,
this difficulty may be overcome by using prisms of such angle
 that the reflected light is perfectly polarized.            Under these
circumstances       half  the  light at  least escapes   reflection ; and
the necessary angles (64 for ordinary flint glass) are not
otherwise objectionable.          The least loss of light is incurred
when the whole thickness is thrown into one prism of mode
rate angle ; but the gain in brightness would rarely compen
sate for the other disadvantages of such a construction.

    With regard to the material for prisms, the choice lies prin
cipally between various kinds of glass and fluids. It is not
without difficulty that glass is prepared free from striae and
well annealed; but solid prisms have the great advantage
that, when once good ones are obtained, there is no further
trouble.     In consequence probably of the practice of using
in all cases a standard angle of 60°, an exaggerated idea is
often entertained of the advantage of great density. Accord
ing to Hopkinson, the difference of indices relative to the lines
D and B for dense flint, extra-dense flint, and double-extra-
dense flint are respectively "0067, '0075, and -0091, which
numbers are inversely as the equivalent thicknesses.
    Of fluids, bisulphide of carbon has the merits of cheap
ness and very high dispersive power, the difference of in
dices for D and B being "0126. When pure, it is also in a high
degree transparent. On the other hand, its sensitiveness to
variations of temperature is so great that 1° C. makes about
nine times as great a change of refrangibility as a passage
from Dx to D8.       Great precautions are therefore required to
prevent inequalities of temperature from destroying definition ;
and frequent shaking is generally necessary.            Some observers
have thought that, apart from inequalities of temperature, or
dinary bisulphide of carbon tends to arrange itself in strata
of different refracting-power ; but this does not seem to be
established satisfactorily.     In some recent experiments with a
rotating stirrer, introduced with the view of promoting uni
formity of temperature,       I  obtained evidence of a thin layer
of moisture floating on the surface.         Under the action of the
stirrer this layer was broken up and the liquid rendered very
irregular.     A few lumps of chloride of calcium introduced into
the liquid absorbed most of the layer; but an arrangement
such that the free surface remained undisturbed would have
been preferable.
    Within the last few months Prof. Liveing * has proposed
the use of a solution of iodide of mercury, which is consider
ably more dispersive than e^en bisulphide of carbon, the dif-
erence of indices between D and B amounting to "017. This
liquid is of a yellowish colour, and is hardly sufficiently trans
parent, even at the lower end of the spectrum, to make its
use advisable in very powerful instruments.              But for some

    Experience has not yet decided the question as to the rela
 tive advantages of large and small prisms. As generally used,
 large prisms have the disadvantages of requiring a greater quan
 tity of material for a given thickness and of involving cumbrous
 and more expensive telescopes.             The first might be avoided
 partially, and the second wholly, by the use of higher refracting
 angles, or (perhaps preferably) by the addition of half-prisms
 to the ends of the train (fig.                   That prisms may act
                                          19).

 as   cylindrical telescopes was observed many years ago by
 Brewster* ; and recently Christie has constructed half-prism
 spectroscopes in which this property is taken advantage of.
 In these instruments, however, the total thickness of glass is
too small for high resolving-power.
    In the arrangement of fig. 19 the rays from the collimator
are received on diminishing half-prisms, by which the width
of the beam is increased up to the point suitable for the big
prisms. Afterwards the rays are concentrated by magnifying
half-prisms until the width of the beam is the same as at first.
 On this plan the larger prisms need be no higher than small
ones ; and the quantity of glass corresponding to a given total
thickness varies as the first power, instead of as the square, of
the linear dimension.
    I  have experimented with a pair of 60° prisms, 3 inches
thick and only f inch high. The glass is of rather low den
sity; so that when the position of minimum deviation is
adopted, the emergent beam is inconveniently wide.                     With
this material a larger angle would have been preferable ;
but much the same result may be arrived at by turning the
prisms a little, so as to increase the angle of incidence on
the first surface and the angle of emergence from the last
surface f.      In this way the incident and emergent beams are
so far narrowed that they can be received on small telescopes;
and the combination is very economical in comparison with
one in which the position of minimum deviation is adopted,

involving, as it would, larger telescopes, and, unless a loss of
brightness were accepted, higher prisms.
   Another point requiring attention in the discussion of the
question of large versus small prisms is the relative difficulty
of securing the necessary accuracy of surfaces in the two
cases ; but it can hardly be treated satisfactorily a priori.         It
would, however, seem that small prisms have the advantage
in this respect also.
    So far I have supposed the prisms to be simple.            Of late
years compound prisms       of   flint and crown have come largely
into fashion ; and quite recently M. Thollon has revived the
use of compound prisms of bisulphide of carbon.            Mr. Christie
considers that compound prisms are, on the whole, to be pre
ferred ; but  I  cannot help thinking that, except where direct
vision is important, their advantages have been overrated.
The difference of indices in the case of crown glass for the
rays D and B is "0035, which is quite sufficiently high to come
into comparison with the corresponding numbers for flint and
bisulphide of carbon.       In a direct-vision prism the thickness
of the crown is greater than that of the flint ; so that the loss
of efficiency is even more serious than a mere comparison of
the dispersions would suggest.           See (6) § 4.
    The principle of the compound prism is carried to its limit
by employing media of equal refracting-power for the part of
the spectrum under examination.              For this purpose   I chose
bisulphide   of carbon  and    flint           With  Chance's   " dense
                                      glass.
flint
      " the refractions are the same,        and the difference of dis
persions relative to D and B is '0056, i. e. about as great as
the difference for "double-extra-dense flint" and crown. A
dozen glass prisms of 90° were cemented in a straight line on
a strip of glass and immersed in bisulphide of carbon.              The
liquid is contained in a tube closed at its ends with glass plates.
                   "
The " thickness of each prism is 1 inch and the height about
| inch, so that the total thickness is 12 inches. The character
of the glass is such that at ordinary temperatures the red rays
pass without deviation.        To observe other parts of the spec
trum   with  advantage,  it  is necessary to mix a little ether with
the bisulphide of carbon in order to lower its power.                 A
similar result could be obtained by slightly warming the tube;
but this course is not to be recommended.
   The instrument, which was made by Hilger, gave excellent
results at times, but showed the usual caprice of bisulphide of
carbon.    With the refracting edges vertical, the definition
was usually good for twenty or thirty seconds after shaking
up, but would often rapidly deteriorate afterwards.          Although
care was taken not to touch the tube with the hands, this

 54          Lord Rayleigh's Investigations in Optics.
effect was sometimes so persistent that         I began to think   I had
 evidence of a tendency to separate into distinct layers. When
 the edges of the prisms (and slit) were horizontal, the tube
 being also horizontal as before, the loss of definition after
 shaking still occurred, but could be remedied in great mea
 sure by a change of focus.         Further experience, however, led
 me to attribute these effects to temperature-differences,        caused
 perhaps by the ceiling of the laboratory being warmer than
 the floor.    At any rate, they were greatly mitigated by wrap
 ping   round   the tube strips of copper and numerous folds of
 cloth ; and they could be produced with considerable persist
 ency by touching the top of the naked tube for a few seconds
 with the hands.        A difference of even jov °f a degree Cent,
 between the upper and lower halves of the prisms might be
 expected to make itself apparent when the edges are vertical.
 The advantages of this construction are the elimination of re
 flection and the almost absolute immunity from defects due
 to errors in the separating surfaces ; but they are rather dearly
 purchased.      As might be expected, the best results as to defi
 nition are obtained when the tube is vertical ; but such an ar
 rangement is inconvenient, as it involves the aid of reflectors.
 Spectroscopes on this plan may perhaps be useful for special
 purposes ; but the want of ready adaptability to different parts
 of the spectrum is a serious objection.
    The general result of this discussion would seem to be in
 favour of a spectroscope with simple glass prisms of such
 angle that the reflected light is wholly polarized, the number
 of prisms being increased up to the point at which mechanical
 difficulties begin to interfere.        With the aid of reflection, at
 least six prisms may be used twice over.             When it becomes
 necessary   to  increase  the  size  of  the prisms, considerable eco
 nomy may     be  effected  by the   introduction  of half-prisms at the
 ends of the train, as already explained.
    When the surfaces are not quite flat, or when the focus of
 the collimator is imperfectly adjusted, it becomes important to
 secure a rather exact perpendicularity between the edges of
the prisms and a plane passing through their middle points ;
 otherwise the linear image of a point may not be parallel to
 the length of the slit. Even when the plane of symmetry is
 obtained, there may remain considerable errors, due to curva
 ture of the image, dependent upon the quantity denoted by y
 in § 6. Much information as to the cause of bad definition
 may often be obtained by replacing the slit by a simple hole
and examining the character of the resultant image.             In many
instruments a great improvement is effected by narrowing
the vertical aperture whenever the light will bear diminu

tion. Such a result may be anticipated when with full aper
ture the top and bottom of the spectrum appear better denned
than the central parts.         The principal cause of error is pro
bably a deviation of the extreme rays from horizontality in
their passage through the prisms, due either to imperfect
action of the collimator or to the curved faces of preceding
prisms.
    It   is not easy to decide whether the highest resolving-power
is more likely to be obtained by gratings or by prisms.           Up
to a certain point the resolving-power of gratings is principally
a question of the accuracy with which the lines can be ruled.
If    the deviations of the lines from their proper places do
not exceed (say) one fourth of the interval between consecu
tive lines, the definition in the first spectrum will not be
materially injured.        To obtain corresponding results in the
2nd, 3rd, 4th, . . . spectrum, the errors must not exceed J,
             ¦ • respectively of the same interval.     Every effort
 v2> tV> •
should also be made to rule as great a number of lines as pos
sible, even if it be necessary for this purpose to reduce their
length.
     I  have lately had the opportunity of experimenting with
two Rutherfurd gratings, one on glass, with nearly 12,000
lines (a present from Mr. Rutherfurd himself), the other on
speculum-metal, with nearly 14,000 lines (kindly lent me by
Mr. Spottiswoode). The lines are at the rate of 17,296 to the
inch.       Both these gratings give admirable results in the
second spectrum, where, according to (14) § 4, the resolving-
power in the orange exceeds that obtainable from 25 centims.
of extra-dense flint.       In the third spectrum the gain of re
solving-power is still apparent, but illumination is rather
 deficient.
    It is much to be wished that spectroscopists in possession
of powerful instruments would compare their actual perform
ances with those of which they are theoretically capable.          A
carefully arranged succession of tests of gradually increasing
 difficulty, like those applied to telescopes, would be of espe
cial value. In my own observations          I have usually attended
principally to the definition of the fine lines bordering b2 and
 to the double line b3.
     For experiments on dark heat, to which in some respects
 gratings are well adapted, resolving-power is secondary to
 illumination.       In order to avoid confusion of spectra, it would
 be well to eliminate the second spectrum altogether, which
 could be effected by ruling equally strong lines at alternate
 intervals in the ratio of one to three.

         VI.  Note on a Method of Checking Calculations.
                        By W. H. Walenn*.
           method of checking calculations by casting out the
THEnines      has only been utilized to a limited extent — prin
cipally in schools, to check multiplications and divisions of
considerable length.       The fact does not seem to have been
realized by teachers, although it has long been known to ma
thematicians, that every operation in natural numbers has a
corresponding operation in the remainders to any divisor of
those natural numbers, which may be used to check a calcu
lation in many cases from beginning to end without appeal to
the original numbers, except at the beginning and the end.
    Moreover the application of these remainders is never made,
by teachers, to decimal calculations. This is easily under
stood, because the change in the condition of the remainder
(when so used) is not realized by them.            When employed to
check calculations, the remainder is no longer in the condition
                            a        t
implied in the equation        =c+       but it is simply the number
                             ^       ^,
of units by which the number is in excess of being exactly
divisible by nine. Therefore the checking process is as appli
cable to all terminable decimals as it is to ordinary numbers.
    If, for instance, it be required to ascertain the weight of
water in a tank which is 2-375 feet high, 3-25 feet wide, and
3*75 feet broad, the formula maybe written w = 62'S"2abc, and
the state of the question is m = 62-32 . 2-375 . 3-25 . 3-75 in
pounds, the result being w= 1803-871875 lbs. The definition
of a unitate being the number of units by which the correspond
 ing number is in excess of being exactly divisible by a given
number (nine in this instance), the operation of checking the
 calculation by which w was found may be symbolized as fol
 lows: — U9w = U9(4 . 8 . 1 . 6) = 3. That the above value of w
 is correct appears because U91803-871875 = 3.             It will be
 found that the formulation of the process to be effected by
 unitation, as a check upon a main calculation, is of great
service.
    Not only is it possible to check calculations involving direct
 operations, but it is also possible to check inverse operations
by unitation.      In checking subtraction, it must be remembered
that  a  remainder    is not really altered by the addition of the
divisor, for instance U93=U912 ; subtraction may then take

subtrahend is greater than that of the minuend.       The dealing
with fractions is more difficult if our unitates are always to be

to preserve the fractional form throughout.       The unitates of

being the number that furnishes the unitate or remainder), is
interfered with by the following peculiarities: — 1. There is
no check upon the number of digits in N.         2. Nor upon the
place of any particular figure in N.   3. Nor upon the figures
themselves, if they be either 9 or 0, or if their sum = 9 or any
 multiple of 9.
   Moreover, as evident above, the number of reciprocals or
fractions which can be expressed in whole numbers by U9N is
limited to 66"6 per cent.    In 100 there are 33 fractional uni
tates to reciprocals.

if we cast out the elevens instead of the nines), we gain the

au      a3>         being the digits in N. 2. There is a check
upon the place of any figure, so far as to its being in an even
or odd place. 3. There is a check upon the figures themselves,
except when their sum (in the odd places or in the even places)
= 11 or any multiple of 11.
   One eleventh, only, of reciprocals or fractions are unable to
be expressed by whole-number unitates.            In 100 there are 9
fractional unitates to reciprocals.
   Therefore the method of checking calculations that this
paper advocates is the combination of the formulation of work
and of results with casting out the elevens, in preference to
casting out the nines.
   The shortest way to cast out the elevens is to add together
all the digits in the odd places of the given number to form
one sum total, and all the digits in the even places to form
another sum total, then to subtract the latter sum from the
former. In the process of obtaining each sum total, as soon
as any number higher than 11 is obtained its unitate should
be substituted.      In obtaining the unitate to a decimal, it must
be remembered to take all the alternate digits from the unit's
digit as additive.
   In checking additions, the one operation onlv need be used,
and that without putting pen to paper.           All the digits in the
odd places may be added together, reducing from time to time,
from which sum the sum of the digits in the even places, simi
larly obtained, is subtracted.
   In checking     subtractions, it is only necessary to be sure that
the unitate of the subtrahend is less than that of the minuend ;
this is easily done, if necessary, by the addition of eleven to
the unitate of the minuend.
   Multiplications only require the reduction of the unitate of
the product to a number less than 11.          In multiplications into
which decimals enter, the operation must be without contrac
tion.
   In divisions, the division may be finished at any predeter
mined place of decimals, taking into account the fraction at
the end which includes the remainder.          The fractions are dealt
with (as   if of the  form a  . r)by  the table of unitates of UuN-1,

   The table of powers of Un N repeats after every ten powers ;
values of the form am must therefore have a unitated to the
base 11 and m to the base 10 as a preliminary operation to
UUN. The unitation to the base 10 is accomplished simply
by striking off the last digit of m, except when it is 0, when
Ui0m=10.
   By the above means all calculations not involving surd roots
can be checked with much greater ease and certainty than by
casting out the nines.

     Mercury has been omitted, as it gives a very much higher
value than any of the others.             Were the induced currents in
the induction-balance proportional to the resistances given in
the table, the numbers in the last column would of course be
all the same. The deviations from equality are far greater
than could be accounted for by errors in the approximations              I
have adopted, especially for the metals not at the beginning
or end of the list. Hence we are driven to conclude, either
that the resistances of the metals given in the tables are not
the same as the resistances of the metals used by Prof. Hughes,
or that the induced current is not proportional to the conduc
tivity of the metal.
     It should be noticed that the method of measuring currents
by the sonometer assumes that the telephone integrates, as it
were, the current ; i. e. the loudness of the sound depends only
on the total current, not on the time during which the current
is passing, provided that the time be very short.                I  do not
know whether this point has been investigated ; but if not, it
would probably be easy to examine it by means of the sono
meter.      It would be advisable to modify the instrument in
such a way that the formulae might be more easily employed,
and that the approximations might be nearer to the truth.
     The formulas used in this paper may be obtained as follows,
the method being adapted from that given in Maxwell.
     The potential of a circular unit current at any point is the
same as that of a magnetic shell of unit strength bounded by
the circuit.      This, again, is the same as the attraction of a thin
plate of matter of unit surface-density in a direction perpen
dicular to the plane of the plate.            If co be the attraction of a

Aurorce;      their  Characters  and Spectra.       By  J. Band Caprcw,
    F.B.A.S. E. and F. Spon, London (46 Charing Cross) and
    New York (446 Brown Street) : 1879.
                 of all visible things, both above and below, the most
^HOUGH
       pure, ethereal, peaceful, yet the sometimes-seen changeful,
fitful shining of the Aurora Polaris in the sky is most fre
 quently likened by men in general, on any of its grander displays,
 to conflagrations of cities and war's alarms !— as when, on one of
 those rarer occasions on which the usually very Northern lights,
 extending far southwards, have been seen superbly even in Pales
 tine, it is recorded in the second book of Maccabees (ch. 5, vv. 2 & 3)
 that
    "There were seen horsemen running in the air, in cloth of
 gold, and armed with lances like a band of soldiers, and troops
 of horsemen in array, encountering and running one against ano
 ther, with shaking of shields, and multitude of pikes, and drawing
 of swords, and casting of darts, and glittering of golden ornaments,
 and harness of all sorts."
    When the delicate, innocent Aurora can so often be described in
this warlike guise, we may be excused for alluding to the present
 state of science and scientists towards it in somewhat of military
phrase, while yet describing a state of things seldom occurring in
earthly warfare.       For, behold, the campaign of the last eleven-year
cycle of Solar activity cum Auroral brilliancy has been duly fought
 out ; yet who can say with what results achieved ? Most creditably
to themselves, observers in every civilized country, and more espe
cially in America and Western Europe, have discharged at the
 strange phenomenon, the spearmen of the sky, their biggest guns
in volleys, in platoons, and as single isolated sharp-shooters' pieces,
 from rock and tower as well as from populous cities and large obser
 vatories. They have also exploded mines enough to have hoisted the
 very auroral testudo or corona right above their heads. But nowthat
the cycle is over, the battles ended, where are the prizes ? what is the
spoil? The lively opponents have vanished with all their flashing
 sheen of golden armour for full three years past ; but the slain are
still nowhere to be found, and we know not when, where, or how
the next encounter may take place.
    The present, then, while it is certainly no occasion for claiming
the triumphs of victory, is happily not one for deploring any very
ruinous defeat; it is merely that every one is nonplussed with
the past, uncertain of the present, and dark on the future — a time,
therefore, this above all others, for gathering up our scattered forces,
comparing notes, collecting information, and preparing to present
a new front to the foe at present invisible, but certain to return
before long. In fact this is the very time for a book on the Aurora,
for chronicling in black and white every thing that has yet been

done without     fear and without favour, yet with practical ability,
and for publishing it in such a form that every observer shall be
both able and found willing to read deeply therein before entering
into the coming Solar Cycle, the auroral displays of which who can
attempt at present to describe or predict ?
    This, then, evidently is even the pressing time for such a book ;
and now verily here it is before us — a handsome quarto volume of
above two hundred pages, well printed, bound, cut round the edges
in the American manner, so as to be ready for immediate deep peru
sal or rapid reference — decorated and additionally explained by many
fine engravings, both chromo- and monolithographs, while by its
 size and shape it is peculiarly adapted to lie open on the table for
 consultation with other similar-sized astronomer's books.      And to
whom do we owe such an addition to our scientific literature, this
book of the time, this probable foundation and help for future dis
 covery ?
    Not to any large Society or public observatory or Government
 office of any kind or degree.      It is all the voluntary, spirited,
 generous work of a private gentleman, J. Eand Capron, Esq.,
 already favourably known in the ranks of modern physicists by his
 volume of ' Photographed Spectra,' prepared in his country-house
 at Guildford. And any one who has ever once met with him
 knows that he has not only a love for the present subject, but an
 untiring energy in working at it himself, unflagging spirits in
 keeping up the enthusiasm of others, an admirable battery of
 telescopes   (both refracting and 'reflecting), spectroscopes,   elec
 tric tubes, and photographic apparatus, the ability to use them
 all, and the generosity of soul to desire that any one and every one
 else shall profit by all that he knows and almost all that he pos
 sesses, so long as something more shall thereby be discovered touch
 ing the Aurora. Por vive aurora-observation ! vive aurora-research !
and especially vive aurora-spectroscopings ! form the animating spirit
which vivifies every page of Mr. Capron's most timely publication.
    The work is divided into three parts, whereof the First is his
 torical chiefly, and descriptive of the phenomena of the Aurora as
 appreciated by humanity in general, age after age. Collective is
 it also most extensively of all the theories which the busy, various,
inquiring mind of man has formed concerning the nature and causes
 of Aurora, its why and wherefore, together with the phenomena
which influence it and which it may influence in turn.          In this
 part, therefore, figure frequently the honoured names of Lemstrom,
 Becquerel, Loomis, De la Eive, and Plante, amidst an encyclo
 paedic collection of other authors of more or less note ; and there
are many pictorial illustrations.
    Poremost amongst these pictures we are certainly not inclined to
put one of the most ambitious of them, a chromolithographic copy
of an oil-painting from Norway ; for it is to us crude, shallow,
without atmosphere, and betraying very limited observation in the

                    Notices respecting New Boohs.                    67
 painter.    But as corrective of that picture, we can fortunately
 point attention to the author's own view of the Aurora as seen in
Kyle Akin, Isle of Skye, in 1874. The quiet of the scene there,
 the grand symmetry of the chief arrangements in luminous arch
behind arch of impalpable light, the mysterious extra darkness
below, and the black clouds in front, are what, we well know, do
often characterize the Aurora in that part of the world, and speak
so solemnly of one of the greater mysteries of nature, extending
from here into starry space, and thence presenting to man a symbol
of the still unknown, unsolved enigmas of the universe of earth and
heaven.
    Part the Second deals with the spectroscoping of the Aurora, and
is very  full with all that has been, or may be, done in the way of
spectroscopic observation, and the best instrumental means for
accomplishing it.
    Herein it may just happen that some persons will be moved to
complain of the rather fragmentary character of much of the reading ;
repeated and intensified, too, as that defect is in some of the plates,
where spectra appear longways, crossways, on scales of various
length, and in bits and corners sometimes of plates already occupied
with spectroscopes, gas-vacuum tubes, micrometers, &c.        Yet that
is really one of the merits of the book when fully considered ; for
in the present backward and uncertain state of Aurora-theory it
would never do to have too much organizing, cutting, trimming,
 and reducing to some one man's Procrustean ideas alone, to gain
 mere symmetry of literary work, seeing that future progress may
 show some day that, in so doing, certain of the most important
points of observation have been left out.
    Mr. Capron therefore wisely gives us now every thing he can lay
 hands on, packing it always into the most practicable shape for
 printer and engraver, author and reader combined.       And to judge
 how important it was that he should do so, we have only to refer
 back to seven years since, when some few spectroscopists of Aurora,
 or what they thought was such, had arrived at a most simple expla
 nation of the whole affair — grand certainly, but baldly insipid, —
 and had very nearly induced the world to rest from its exertions,
 under the idea that there was nothing more to be discovered.
 At that period, so soon after the brilliant discoveries of the
  greater men, when a single glance almost in a spectroscope had
 settled the gaseous nature of nebula versus the solid or fluid state
 of stars, and had detected by a line whether, say, hydrogen, or iron,
 or calcium, "or any other particular chemical element existed in sun,
 or star, or any burning flame anywhere upon this earth far or near,
 it was certainly expected that the auroral light, so close to us deni
 zens of the earth as to be generally within ninety miles of its sur
 face, would soon fall an easy prize to the wonder-working modern
power of prismatic vision through a narrow slit.
    Moreover one distinguishing and all-important bright line had
  been found in the citron or yellow-green region of the Aurora's
                                   F 2

68                   Notices respecting New Books.
spectrum. It had, too, in every auroral display a constancy and a
power which rendered almost needless the notation of any thing
else in the spectrum ; and every thing there did accordingly pale
its insignificant head to most observers ; while reported discovery
after discovery extended through the whole Solar system the glory,
unity, and rule of that one chief dominant citron line.            It was
said, for instance, that it also characterized the whole of that mys
terious and believed solar phenomenon of the night-sky, the zodia
cal light — then that it was the chief external feature in the spec
 trum of the solar corona as seen in total eclipses, and proved a
perpetual aurora to be always environing the sun ; and then, coming
 down to earth, that wondrous citron-line was found to be an iron-
 line ; wherefore, behold, iron can give out a rarer, lighter, more
  ascensional vapour than any gas known.
     All this would have been, if the spectrum-place of the observed
 line in each case had been really the same ; for spectrum-place, if
 well measured, is just as absolute as stellar position by right ascen
 sion and polar distance.        But, as time went on, the introduction
 by   successive observers  of more   of that marvellously discriminating
          "            "
 power      dispersion (or   the  parent  of all spectrum-place) soon told
 another tale — declaring firstly that without a terrestrial aurora in
  the sky there was no citron or any other bright line in the spectrum
  of the zodiacal light, secondly that the solar corona-line did not
  pretend to correspond with the aurora's grand citron line, but
  with some faint subsidiary line suspected by some one and con
  firmed by none ; and, thirdly, the same coronal line, and still
  more the true auroral line, did not either of them correspond in
  place with the expected iron-line, and were essentially different in
  physiognomy as well — this being the particular discovery and
  clearing-up of Prof. Young, of Princeton, U. 8., who does all things,
  spectroscopic, well.
      Then, in that case, what does the all-important aurora citron-
   coloured line correspond with '?
      That is exactly the question which Mr. Capron asks you and
   me and every one to join him in trying, by night and by day, and
   by every manner of means, to discover if we may ; for, far as he,
   and they, and all of us have searched yet, there is nothing else in
   heaven above or earth below which gives a line of that comparative
   intensity in that particular spectrum- place.      Every pure chemical
   element known to science, and not a few compounds also, have been
   burned either in flame, or furnace, or electric spark, whether ordi
   narily presenting themselves as solids, fluids, or gases ; but the
   line is not there ; neither is it in the sun, nor in any star, nor in
   any nebula whatever.                                0
      The last work of the late eminent Professor Angstrom, who him
   self had, years before, discovered this puzzling citron aurora-line,
   was to compare it with the spectrum of the light of the negative
   pole in an air-vacuum tube illuminated by electric spark ; and he
   thought that he had at last therein and thereby attained the aurora

                   Notices respecting New Books.                     69
spectrum of nature. But the necessary absolute coincidence was
subsequently found to be, if at all, only with some infinitesimally
faint and hazy band in the blue ; so that the whole expected
great discovery w as, after all, a most extreme case of the play of
'
  Hamlet ' not only without the part of Hamlet (the princely citron
line), but without the part also of the red-handed old King — or the
" red line," which is the next most important feature of the aurora-
spectrum (a line, too, that is very like the well-known red hydro
gen-line, yet most decidedly not it) : and nothing was left further
to claim identity of spectrum-place with, except an uncertain faint
shimmering of mere continuous spectrum in the sky-blue, which
might be any thing or nothing, and so caused Prof. Alexander
Herschel to exclaim, with Shakespearian pity, and full rounding off
of the chief characters in the play, "Alas ! poor ghost ! "
     Was there ever, then, such a call upon every one with a tele
scope and every one with a spectroscope to join in the next cam
paign, and endeavour to retrieve the future of observation and the
credit of spectroscopic science ? Never certainly in all the written
history of Aurora ; wherefore to aid in that good cause the Third
part of Mr. Capron's book goes largely into magneto-electric expe
riments touching all sorts of possibilities affecting the anxious mys
tery of the coming foe.
     Every one, we suppose, now looks on the Aurora as having some
thing electric in its nature — as possibly a slow discharge of some
kind even of atmospheric electricity, but which, in place of the
discontinuous discharge of lightning common to warmer regions of
the earth, travels from closely abutting particle to particle of semi-
frozen vapour nearly uniformly and most extensively distributed
 through the atmosphere of not exactly the Polar, but rather only
 the proximately Polar regions of the earth.
     Such slow electric discharge, after once being set in action by
electricity, is also believed to be influenced in position and shape
by terrestrial magnetism.       But no known artificial production of
 any kind of electric light, with or without any magnetism that
 can be put into   it,  will produce in the spectrum that wonder of
 the present age, the auroral citron line.
     Nevertheless Mr. Capronhas researched into this matter largely,
 having fitted up very powerful electromagnet and tried its effects
                 a
 on the illuminations already electrically excited of various gas-
 vacuum tubes, and with the effect often of changing the intensity,
 colour, and shape of the light therein (as detailed through forty well-
 filled pages of his book), but never of producing the auroral citron
line.
     Some grand experiments of   a   further kind have been imagined
 by   Mr. Henry   E. Procter,  of Clemen  sthorpe, North Shields, the
                                                "
 author of the excellent article on "Aurora in the presently pub
 lishing edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica;' and though they
                         '
 are hardly likely to be tried soon, because they will inevitably

70                 Notices respecting New Books.
prove expensive, yet we do hope that an intelligent Government
may relieve him of that difficulty before long.
    Meanwhile, however, we are practically left in the cold comfort,
of almost as weak an hypothesis as the one famous medieval idea
that " nature abhors a vacuum within the limits of 32 feet of
water"- — seeing that the final outcome of every thing auroral seems
to resolve itself into this rebuke to mankind, that the electric dis
charge of that phenomenon takes place in a medium which we do
not know any thing about, and that is why we cannot reproduce
the citron spectral line.
    But that by no means satisfies so untiring a genius as Mr. J.
 Rand Capron ; wherefore up he starts to his feet again in an effec
 tive Fourth part to his book, or a series of five Appendices giving
 additional information, references to, and reprints from, divers
 works, essays, and codes of instruction issued to polar voyagers.
 He does all this ; and now comes the one black blot with which to
 bring this review to a too effective end.
    Yet Mr. Capron himself is not to blame in it. He comes out
 brighter, more the benefactor of the public, and the pure-souled
 prosecutor of science for science's own sake, than ever.         In his
 ardent desire to omit nothing that could contribute to the progress
 of auroral knowledge, he thought he would give a niche in his book,
 and thereby wider publicity as well as renewed circulation, to the
 modicum of auroral work performed by the Government's late Polar
 expedition. With this view, he both printed the auroral instructions
 prepared for the officers of the Arctic ships by the Royal Society, and
 the subsequent reports of what the said officers had observed accord
 ingly, just as they appear in the Government's Arctic papers.
     That was easy enough so far ; but finding that the mere written
 descriptions were hardly clear without the assistance of certain
 lithographic plates which, having already answered all their in
 tended purpose for the Government's report, were about to be
 wiped off, Mr. Capron applied to My Lords of the Treasury for
 leave to have copies printed from those stones at his own expense.
 And what did My Lords of the Treasury answer to this hero, sans
 peur et sans reproche, of auroral research for advancing the science
  of our country and of the age in which we live ? They informed
  him " that he could not be permitted so to do, unless he paid also
  one third of the cost of the original execution, of the drawings
                                                                    " —
                                                                      !
 an additional burthen to the other expenses of his scientific book,
  which it was of course quite out of the question for him to under
  take.
     Oh ! that the effects of the now universal education which is
  spreading throughout the country might be to produce in the upper
  Government offices, as well as the country at large, genius, large
  ness of soul, and hearty love of science ; and then such an example
  as Mr. Capron has shown in his book on 'Aurora),' though still per
  haps rare, would be appreciated more nearly as it well deserves to be.

                        Paris :  1879.    Pp. 271.
   M. G-aston Plante has republished in a convenient collected
form the experimental researches in Electricity that have occupied
him for nearly twenty years.       The chief points in the work are : —
(1) a research   on the secondary currents produced by electrolytic
polarization  ; (2) the behaviour of different metals used as elec
trodes in respect of the secondary currents they yield ; (3) the
construction of secondary batteries of large size, and the mechanical
contrivances for charging them in compound circuit and discharging
in simple circuit ; (4) the various effects — chemical, thermic, mag
netic, and mechanical — produced by the powerful discharges from
such batteries ; (5) the analogies      presented by these phenomena
with certain natural phenomena ; (6) the construction of an in
strument called a Bheostatic Machine, for rapidly charging and dis
charging a large accumulator consisting of mica plates, to be used in
conjunction with large secondary batteries.
   The interest of the greater part of the work is in the experi
mental detail, which, however,         adds little to electrical theory.
 Some of the more important conclusions are as follows : —
   The falling-off of the current observed when a saline or acidu
lated solution is electrolyzed between metallic electrodes, is due to
various causes, of which the chief are : — (1) the insolubility of the
 oxide formed at the positive electrode ; (2) the low conductivity of
the same ; (3) the resistance of the layer of saline liquid which
 surrounds the pole if the oxide is soluble ; (4) the electromotive
force of the separated ions, tending to produce an inverse secondary
current. This current M. Plante finds to be due, in the case of
most metals, to the reduction of the metallic oxide formed at the
positive electrode, and the oxidation of the metal of the negative
electrode or of the hydrogen that has been liberated upon its sur
face.   In the case of the difficultly oxidizable metals, however,
such as gold or platinum, the secondary current is chiefly due to the
action of the hydrogen which has been more or less occluded by
the negative electrode, and also possibly to the gases dissolved in
the liquid in the neighbourhood of the two electrodes respectively.
In the case of the metal lead, when used as elect rodes in dilute sul
phuric acid, the action is very marked, the surfaces of the elec
trodes becoming porous with repeated oxidation and reduction, and
so holding the liberated gases in loose combination to a high degree.
M. Plante therefore uses sheets of lead in constructing the cells
of his secondary batteries, which unite the double advantages of an
E.M.E. ns high as 2-718 volts, and an internal resistance as low as
0-12, or even 0-048 ohm.        The inability of De la Hive to obtain a
secondary current from lead was due to his use of dilute hydro
chloric acid; for the chloride of lead formed at the positive electrode
is practically insoluble.
    Some of the phenomena of discharge studied by M. Plante are
of great interest, and suggestive by their analogies with natural
phenomena.

         1. "On the      probable  Temperature of the Primordial Ocean of
  our Globe." By Robert Mallet, Esq., F.R.S., F.G.8.
     According to the latest hypotheses as to the quantity of water on
  the globe, its pressure, if evenly distributed, would be equal to a
  barometric pressure of 204-74 atmospheres.                   Accordingly water,
  when first it began to condense on the surface of the globe, would
  condense at a much higher temperature than the present boiling-
  point under ordinary circumstances.               The first drops of water
  formed on the cooling surface of the globe may not impossibly have
  been at the temperature of molten iron.              As the water was pre
  cipitated, condensation of the remaining vapour took place at a
  lower temperature.         The primordial atmosphere would be more
  oblate and less penetrable by solar heat than the present, and the
  difference     of temperature between polar and equatorial regions
  would   be   greater ; so that, in the later geologic times, ice may have
  formed    in   the one, while the other was too hot for animal or vege
  table  life.     Thus, formerly the ocean would be a more powerful
  disintegrant and solvent of rocks, mineral changes would be more
  rapid, and meteoric agencies would produce greater effects in a given
  time.

  sometimes       contained in Granite."        By   J.     Arthur Phillips, Esq.
  F.G.S.
     Patches     resembling fragments of other rocks frequently occur in
  granite,    sometimes     angular, sometimes rounded, sometimes with

clearly defined boundaries, sometimes melting away into the surround
ing mass, generally finer in grain than the latter. After a sketch
of the literature of the subject, the author described the results of
chemical and microscopic       investigations of these patches in the
granites of Cornwall, Shap Fell, Aberdeen, Peterhead, Fort William,
and North-eastern Ireland.        There are two classes of inclusions : —
(1)  the result of the abnormal     aggregation of the minerals consti
tuting the granite itself, containing generally more plagioclastic
felspar, mica, or hornblende than       it,with some other distinctions,
most probably concretions formed contemporaneously         with the soli
dification of the mass   ; (2)  fragments  of  included schistose or slaty
rock, often not very highly altered, caught up from the rock-masses
through which the granite has forced its way.
    3.   " Certain Geological Factswitnessed in Natal and the Border
Countries during nineteen years' residence."       By the Eev. George
Blencowe. Communicated by the Rev. H. Griffith, F.G.8.
   Shales and sandstones are the prevalent rocks from the coast for
about twenty-four miles inland.       Here       protrusion of granite
                                              is

beyond tho sandstones come ferruginous shales, with scattered
boulders of trap on the surface.      The northern third of Natal            is
white sandstone, formed into hills and ridges by denudation, with
a long trap-capped plateau near Helpmakaar.           Coal-seams occur
in the sandstones.    There are frequent vertical pipes in these sand
stones, which, the author thinks, mark the site of trunks of trees,
round which the sandbeds had accumulated.           Rorke's House and
Isandhlwana are near the above plateau.          Near the former      anis

 6000 feet above the sea, extends for about 500 miles from the north
of Natal to near Cradock in the Cape colony; they are sandstone
horizontally stratified, capped by trap.        Some other geological
features are described.     The Transvaal consists of undulating hills
 of soft limestone,  asandstone range, and      country rich in metals

stratigraphy and petrology of the above districts, which have led
him to the following conclusions: — (1) The granitoid (Dimetian)
rocks of Anglesey pass down into an anticlinal of dark gneiss (above)
and grey gneiss (below).     (2) Associated with the granitoid series are
bands of felsite, halleflintas, and felspathic breccias.   (3) The suc
cession of gneissic and granitoid rocks in Anglesey resembles so
closely the metamorphic series of Malvern as to justify the correla
tion of the two groups.      (3) The Pre-Cambrian rocks of Anglesey
and the Malverns, from the highest known member down to the
base of the gneiss, may be thus classified : — A. Pebidian (to be de
scribed hereafter) ; B. Malvernian — (a) Dimetian, with associated
quartz-folsites and halleflintas (Arvonian) passing down into (b)
Lewisian.
   2.  " Penological Notes     on the Neighbourhood of Loch Maree."
By Prof. T.    G. Bonney, M.A., F.B.S., Sec.G.S.
   The author had visited the upper end of Loch Maree and its
vicinity with the view of seeing whether microscopic examination
threw any light on the vexed questions as to the age of the newer
gneiss &c.      He described the microscopic structure of a typical
series of the Hebridean gneiss, and gave reasons for considering the
mass of rock on the right bank of Glen Laggan to be not an intru
sive " syenite," as has usually been supposed, but a mass of the
Hebridean gneiss faulted against the newer series.       The microscopic
structure of tho Torridon Sandstones was described : it proves that,
as  previously asserted, they are made up of the debris of the Hebri
dean   series ; from this also probably came the materials of the
quartzites. By examination of specimens, collected both in Glen
Laggan and at other points along the northern escarpment of the
newer series, the author showed that its rocks have been rightly
called metamorphic ; and then, by comparison of these with speci
mens collected in Glen Docherty, ho concluded that the latter
belonged to the newer series, and that no part of the Hebridean
series reappeared here (which would require a most unusual uncon-
formnbility).     On Ben Fyn also he could find no traco of the older
series, the rocks there, where not igneous, resembling the newer
series, though more highly altered than it is further north.         The
paper concluded with some remarks upon the bearing of the evi
dence obtained from these studies upon questions of metamorphism,
especially as regards its
                           " selective " action.

               BY PROFESSOR SILVANUS P. THOMPSON*.
                1. Propagation    of a Longitudinal    Wave.
  A    PIECE of apparatus for illustrating the propagation of a lon-
      gitudinal disturbance more effectively than the customary rows
of suspended ivory balls, or of glass balls laid in a groove upon a
table, is made by hanging to a wooden rod a row of the balls of thin
caoutchouc distended with air, which are sold coloured for children's
toys.    There is enough tangential friction, if properly arranged, to
allow of the propagation of a transversal disturbance being also
shown.
                    2. Demonstration    of Vowel Qualities.
    The usual demonstration of the part played by the various cavi
ties and positions of the throat and mouth in producing vowel qua
lities of tone is to set the air in them vibrating by resonance to the
tones of appropriately chosen tuning-forks,             corresponding to a
harmonic series, held in front of the open mouth. The jew's harp,
with its simple reed set vibrating by the finger, affords a capital
adjunct to the experiments with tuning-forks.              The entire set of
vowel    sounds,   and   even  such  simple phrases     as  " who are you ? "
 (minus the consonantal sounds) may be pronounced by the jew's
harp in the following manner : — The instrument is held against the
 slightly opened teeth in the usual manner for playing.             The ope
 rator then adjusts his throat and mouth as if to pronounce the
 desired vowel or vowels, and, breathing softly to sustain the vibra
 tions of the reed, strikes the turned-up end, or tongue, with his
 forefinger.    An audience of one or two hundred people can hear
 the sounds without difficulty.
 3.  Illustration of compounding      a Rectilinear Vibration with a Simple
                        Translation at right angles to it.
    Let   a straight piece of stout clock-spring or of flat steel " crino
             "
 line-wire be fastened to a suitable handle, and a heavy silvered
 bead be attached to the other end.           If  this be set vibrating, the
 bright point produced by viewing         a light  by reflexion in the sphe
 rical surface of the bead appears drawn out into a line of light.         If
 the spring be held in a horizontal plane, this line is of course vertical.
 Let the spring be then moved in the hand with a swift horizontal
 motion of translation ; the line of light will then appear drawn out
 into a luminous sinusoidal curve.

                    ON A NEW STANDARD OF LIGHT.
       To the Editors  of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       Gentlemen,                                   New York, Dec.   4, 1879.
    In a recent Number of the Philosophical Magazine (Nov. 1879,
                                                                      " On a
p. 392 &c.) Mr. Louis Schwendler communicates a memoir
New    Standard  of  Light."   It consists of a strip  of platinum raised  to
a standard temperature by an electric current.            He remarks of this
method, that it appeared to him so natural and simple that he could
scarcely understand why it had not been proposed and acted upon
before.     Subsequently he found that Dr. Draper had suggested the
same previously.       Mr. Schwendler's experiments were instituted
on behalf of the Board of Directors of the East Indian Railway
Company, under orders of the Secretary of State for India, to inquire
into the feasibility and practicability of lighting up Indian railway-
stations by the electric light.
    In view of this, will you do me the favour to reprint a passage in
the Philosophical Magazine.         It is in the Number for May 1847,
in a memoir by me, " On the Production of Light by Heat," p. 359.
    " Among writers on Optics it has been a desideratum to obtain
an artificial light of standard brilliancy.         The preceding experi
ments furnish an easy means of supplying that want, and give us
what might be termed a unit lamp. A surface of platinum of
 standard dimensions, raised to a standard temperature by a voltaic
current, will always emit a constant light.           A strip of that metal,
 1 inch long and -g-V °^ an mcn wide, connected             with a lever by
which its expansion might be measured, would yield at 2000° a
light suitable for most purposes. Moreover it would be very easy
 to form from it an available photometer, by screening portions of
 the shining surface.      An ingenious artist would have very little
 difficulty, by taking advantage of the movements of the lever, in
 making a self-acting apparatus in which the platinum should be
 maintained at a uniform temperature notwithstanding any change
 taking place in the voltaic currents."

            ON THE    PASSIVITY    OF IKON.     BY L. VARENNE.
     "When a piece of iron is put into the ordinary commercial nitric
 acid a reaction is immediately set up and becomes intensely vigorous.
 Concentrated nitric acid, that which in tho laboratory mostly bears
 the name of fuming nitric acid, does not react upon iron ; moreover
 the metal acquires, by contact with this acid, the singular property
  of not being attacked by the dilute acid : the fuming acid is said to

render the iron passive.      The experiments which      have the honourI
to submit to the Academy were instituted with the aim of casting
some light on this interesting question.
    I. (1) Iron which has been rendered passive is immersed in the
ordinary acid and caused to strike against the sides of the vessel
containing      it,
                 the necessary energy of the shock being the less the
more dilute the acid solution takes place instantaneously.
                           ;                                         The
same result can be attained either by rubbing the metal with        glass            a
rod, or by projecting       jet of water upon
                             a                    while immersed, or by
                                                         it
 settingit  in rapid gyration.
    (2) Vibrations even of extremely slight amplitude suffice to make
 the passivity cease.    M. Ducretet has been so good as to construct,
 according to my indications, a very simple apparatus for the study
 of this novel influence.      A strip of soft iron    interrupted in its
                                                                   is
 middle by      strip of caoutchouc.
                a                       One of the parts      fixed verti       is
 cally in  a  pincer the lower part

                                                    is
 fuming acid and thus rendered passive.         The monohydrated       re                is
 placed    bycommercial acid, in which the iron remains intact. Vibra
 tions are then induced by bringing near to the upper part an elec
 tromagnet similar to those employed for electric bell signals.
 Scarcely has the vibratory motion commenced before the reaction
appears.

rugous metal immersed in the fuming acid,      saw    gaseous sheath

form about the iron, which persists when         put into the dilute

I was led by this observation to study the part which might be
played by the gaseous envelope in the phenomenon with which we
are occupied.    The following experiments were made for that pur
pose.
   (1) Iron rendered passive        entirely immersed in the dilute acid,
                                          is
then cautiously taken out so as to be completely covered with the
acid liquid, and suspended in the air.      After few moments (almost
                                                              a
immediately in rather brisk current of air) the attack commences,
                       a
and continues with energy.        It preceded  is              by
                                                    the sudden appear
ance of gas-bubbles coming to the surface and bursting.
   (2) Iron rendered passive          plunged into dilute nitric acid
                                           is                                                  ;
some air-bubbles are caused to arrive in the vicinity of the metallic
fragment     the reaction commences, being set up the more quickly
             ;
the more uneven the surface of the metal.
   (3) Under the same conditions, the metal being suspended in the
liquid, some pieces of    carbonate (chalk, for example) are deposited
                               a
at the bottom of the vessel      carbonic acid being liberated, the metal
                                      ;
is attacked.
   (4) A vessel containing dilute nitric acid      prepared beforehand,
                                                              is
 on the bottom of which a little spongy platinum or platinum-black
is placed (substances eminently porous and liberating on immersion
 numerous gas-bubbles)        piece of iron rendered passive being sus
                                 ;   a

78           Intelligence    and Miscellaneous Articles.
pended    in the liquid so that it does not touch the platinum, the
attack is induced at the end of a few seconds.
    (5) At the bottom of a cylindrical vessel a small fragment of iron
is deposited (a Paris tack, for instance), and covered with fuming
nitric acid ; after a few moments of contact, passivity being induced,
the inonohydrated acid is decanted and replaced by the dilute acid ;
an exactly similar fragment, but not passive, is then cautiously in
troduced by means of a pincer consisting of two pieces of glass,
and arranged parallel to the first and at a distance from it rather
considerable in comparison with their diameters.         The new frag
ment is attacked, gas being liberated ; the other is unaltered. If
they be brought nearer together, at a given moment, when the dis
tance is reduced to a certain amount, the passive iron enters into
solution.    All other things being equal, the greater the diameters
of the fragments the greater is this maximum distance.
    (6) Some iron which has been rendered passive being plunged
into the dilute acid is rapidly attacked if a strip of metal attackable
by the acid is placed near it but not in contact (a metal electroposi
tive in relation to iron, such as zinc).   I  have observed that the
contact of the immersed part of the iron with a copper wire was
sufficient to induce the reaction of the acid upon the iron ; but if
the contact took place upon the part which was out of the liquid,
no such reaction was produced. Is not the cessation of passivity
to be attributed to the liberation of gas produced under the former
conditions ?
  III.   It follows from all the experiments above referred to, that
any shaking produced in the vicinity of the passive metal, either by
a shock or a vibration, or by a current of gas (sometimes          very
slight, as in the case of spongy platinum), is sufficient to cause the
passivity to disappear. On the other hand, the monohydrated acid
exerts an action upon the metal ; but that action immediately ceases,
the phenomenon being interpreted by the disposition around the me
tallic fragment of a gaseous enveloping sheath.      We are thence led
to conclude from these results of experiment that this gaseous
 sheath is the sole obstacle to further attack, that it is more adhe
rent to a smooth surface and to a sample possessing great molecular
 condensation than to one that is uneven and less compact, and that
mechanical shakings and gaseous currents either weak or strong
 (the latter perhaps adding in certain cases a chemical action to their
 displacing influence) more or less rapidly determine its dislocation.
    Experience has confirmed these previsions to which the preceding
 trials necessarily led.  If the passivity of the metal is the conse
 quence   of the  formation  of the gaseous sheath, this will disappear
in a vacuum, and the passivity with it. A fragment of iron ren
 dered passive was placed in vacuo by means of peculiar arrange
 ments, so as to avoid any shaking. A vacuum having been produced
 (/i=15 millims.), the piece of iron was cautiously withdrawn with
 out directly touching it,  and immersed in the dilute acid, where   it
was immediately attacked.

  The nature of the enveloping gas may, besides, be very approxi
mately determined.   In fact, if a few air-bubbles are let into the
vacuum-apparatus at the moment when the exhaustion is finished,
the orange-red coloration characteristic of hyponitric vapour appears
in the receiver : the gaseous sheath is therefore formed principally
of binoxide of nitrogen.

      AN EXPERIMENT ON SULPHUB.                  BY DE. THEODOR GEOSS.
                     I
  In the following take leave to make a brief communication on
an experiment with sulphur, by which              I
                                      have obtained a' substance
which, according to my judgment, is new, and cannot be further
analyzed by several of the most powerful chemical reagents.
   Some purest commercial milk of sulphur was mixed with linseed-
oil, in the proportion of one part of sulphur to not quite one part
of oil, and then gently heated in a very wide bowl.            The mixture
 swells up strongly, emitting disagreeable fumes, and leaves a black
porous mass behind in large pieces which will not ignite under con
ditions under which sulphur by itself would burn briskly.               The
black mass was then finely pulverized and, with pure concentrated
sulphuric acid, heated gently during several hours till it boiled.
                                                      I
After a brisk liberation of sulphurous acid, obtained a liquid which
in its most concentrated state has the appearance of thick fluid
sulphur. More attenuated, it appears clear and pure yellowish red;
still more diluted, brownish yellow.         Into this diluted acid liquid,
sulphuretted hydrogen      was   passed,  and  thereby, at least in part, a
bright-brown precipitate      thrown   down.     This is soluble in sulphide
of ammonium, and also in hot potash-lye.          On the other hand, even
a hot mixture of hydrochloric acid and chlorate of potass dissolves
but little of it.
    "When the precipitate is heated in air, the sulphur burns up, and
 the residue is a black substance likewise very indifferent to inorga
 nic acids. This, on being heated in the combustion-boat in a tube
 of difficultly fusible glass, with a, current of oxygen passing through
it,  till the glass was bright- red-hot, proved tire-proof. Similarly
heated in chlorine   it  became first brown, and after longer action
white  ;   and part of    itwas deposited as        sublimate immediately
                                                      a
 behind the hottest place of the glass tube.        By heating in hydro
                                                                     it
 gen the original black substance      was  then  again obtained.

   Since the black substance is precipitable from its combination with
or solution in sulphuric acid by sulphuretted hydrogen as a preci-
tate soluble in sulphide of ammonium, it belongs to a certain well
known group of elements, from all of which it is essentially dis

tinguished by the above-mentioned characters. Hence feel called
upon to regard it as new. It is, moreover, either not at all altered,
or undergoes no further resolution, by strong acids, oxygen, chlo
rine, and hydrogen. Since such a substance as the one described
is not contained in linseed-oil, it can only be derived from the sul
phur ; and the question immediately arises how it is present in the
latter. If sulphur is an element, our substance can only have been
mixed with it. But as a trifling mixture of something with an
element that occurs in abundance is out of the question (for 10-
20 grams of sulphur give an amply sufficient quantity of the above-
described substance for the chemical reactions and experiments),
one would suppose that, since it is not mixed as such with the sul
phur, it occurs therein in a combination which could not be resolved
by distillation &c, goes with sulphur into its combination with
alkali or alkaline earth, is likewise precipitated by acid, and, finally,
could only be detected by the experiment with- linseed-oil.          Yet
such a supposition would not be a probable one.           Sulphur sepa
rated from chemically pure gases with the utmost precaution does
not behave otherwise to linseed-oil than milk of sulphur, and, as       I
in March last communicated to the Physical Society of this place,
can by itself alone be heated so that, employed even in minute
quantities (such as about half a gram), it leaves a black residue in
which carbon as carbonic acid can be identified.                   I
                                                         Further, have
observed {inter alia) that sulphur, distilled under certain conditions,
yields peculiar gaseous products which could not be brought into
accordance with any known inorganic sulphur combination. From
all these reasons it has become very doubtful to me that sulphur is
an element.      This question, however, shall not be further pursued
here, since  I  hope shortly to publish further experiments for its
discussion, and since the purpose of this communication was chiefly
to make known the above-described substance, which           I hold to be
new.
   Permit me here to mention that, besides sulphur,        I am also in
vestigating   other   bodies, and have   observed with phosphorus espe
                                      I
cially something similar to what have observed in the case of sul
phur. — Communicated to the Berlin Academy of Sciences by Prof.

XL    The Dilatation    of Crystals on Change of Temperature.               By
    L. Fletcher, M.A., Fellow of University                College, Oxford,
    Assistant in the Mineralogical Department, British Museum*.
                 the last fifty years a considerable amount of
 DURINGenergy has been     devoted by mathematicians and crystal-
 lographers to the investigation of the nature of the alteration
 of a crystal due to change of temperature, and it cannot even
yet be said that the state of our knowledge is very satisfactory.
 It  must be hoped that this short paper may serve to once more
 direct attention to this important and interesting question.
Mitscherlich was the first to observe that the angles of crystals
may vary with the temperature (Pogg. Ann. vol. i. 1824,
vol. x. 1827); and he concluded from his experiments that the
alteration is probably related to the axes of optical elasticity.
    F. E. Neumann was the next to take up the question (Pogg.
Ann. vol. xxvii. 1833), and assuming, as a deduction from
experiment, that the luminiferous aether is in every crystal sym
metrical to three perpendicular planes, and that the symmetry
of the aether is superinduced by the symmetry of the arrange
ment of the crystal-molecules, decided that the matter of the
crystal must also be symmetrical to these three planes, and
that on change of temperature the perpendiculars to these
planes must remain permanently fixed in direction in space :
to these lines he applied the term thermic axes, and gave for
mulae by the help of which their position could be calculated
in the case of an oblique crystal from goniometrical observa
tions at any two temperatures.           Employing for gypsum the
data supplied by Mitscherlich, he found that, within the limits

82             Mr. L. Fletcher  on the Dilatation of
of errors of experiment, these thermic axes did actually coin
cide with the axes of optical elasticity ; and he therefore con
cluded that there really exist for all crystals what may be
called rectangular " morphological axes."        If this be true, it
follows that the oblique and anorthic systems are probably
mere hemihedral developments of the rhombic.             About the
time of the publication of this paper the crossed dispersion of
the optic axes of borax was discovered by Herschel and Nor-
renberg ; and thus considerable doubt may be felt as to the
truth of Neumann's assumption that the luminiferous aether
and therefore also the matterc of every crystal are symmetrical
to three rectangular planes. Angstrom (Pogg. Ann. vol. lxxxvi.
1852) next made a series of experiments on gypsum and fel
spar, and enunciated as result that the axes of optical elasticity,
of cohesion, of ordinary elasticity, and of heat expansion did
not all coincide, and that therefore the idea of rectangular
morphological axes must be given up.           Grailich and Lang
{Sitzungsber. d. Akad. in Wien, vol. xxxiii. 1859), in their
celebrated memoir on the physical relations of crystals, treat
of this subject. They come to the conclusion that, for all
changes of temperature, the parametral ratios are permanently
either rational or irrational, and that in an oblique or anor
thic crystal rectangular thermic axes do not necessarily, and
in fact in gypsum do not, exist — thermic axes being defined to
be " such directions in crystals of the non-tesseral systems as
at every temperature are equally inclined to each other and
present the same unaltered relation to the crystallographic
elements." It was, however, soon pointed out that an expres
sion which they had found on substitution of the data for
gypsum to become imaginary, could in the most general case
be expressed as the square root of the sum of the squares of
two real quanities, and therefore was necessarily real. It is
clear that some numerical error had been made in their
 calculation, and that their formulas really prove that in the
 symmetry-plane of an oblique crystal two lines can be
found, at any one temperature, which are at right angles at a
second.    It must be remarked that it is not proved that the
lines are at right angles at the intermediate temperatures.       It
may be here stated that the relations given by Grailich and
Lang, as connecting the angles between any five planes, are
only proved for the case where two of the planes are crystalloid-
planes and the other three are zone-planes, and so can scarcely
be called general relations between five crystalloid-planes.     If,
however, we remark, as will be shown later, that the constancy
of the indices, on which the proof depends, still holds even if
they be irrational, it follows that the relations mentioned above

              Crystals on Change of Temperature.                     83
are   true in any case, it being a matter of no moment whether the
planes be crystalloid-planes, zone-planes, or neither.       C. Neu
mann (Pogg. Ann. vol. cxiv. 1861) shows that, in an anorthic
crystal, for any two temperatures three lines can be found
which are at right angles at both, and shows how their posi
tions may be calculated from the observed angles of the crystal
at the two temperatures.        In 1868 (Pogg. Ann. vol. cxxxv.)
                                            " thermic and chemical
appeared a paper by C. Pape, on the
axes" of gypsum and chalcanthite, in which he (somewhat in
accurately) states that, in the preceding article, Neumann has
proved the existence of axes which remain at right angles at
all temperatures.       From his experiments he infers the coinci
dence of the thermic and chemical axes in both gypsum and
chalcanthite, whence he rapidly passes to the belief that he has
established the existence of rectangular morphological axes for
all crystals.
     It is difficult to see how the dispersion of the planes of the
 optic axes, met within many crystals, can be simply explained by
 the theory of the existence of these rectangular morphological
 axes.     In the same volume of the Annalen is published one of
 Fizeau's papers on the dilatation of crystals as determined by
 experiment; and he finds, by his admirable method, that the
 coefficients of dilatation of felspar along two directions equally
 inclined to an optic mean line, and on opposite sides of          in
                                                                 it,
 the plane of symmetry, are almost in the ratio of      5   :   1;and
 thus the belief in the existence of any simple relation between
 the positions of the axes of dilatation and the axes of optical
  elasticity ought to be finally discarded.     In his treatment of
 the theoretical part of the question, Fizeau assumes that the
  directions of maximum, mean, and minimum dilatation are
  permanent for all temperatures  ;     and in this assumption he      is
  followed by Groth (Physikalische Krystallographie, 1876,
  p. 140).      Summing up, we may say that up to the present
it    has merely been proved, and that in a laborious manner,
  that at any two temperatures there are three crystal-lines at
  right angles at both:   it   has not been proved that these lines
  are at right angles at other temperatures or are fixed in space;
  but still Pape, Fizeau, and Groth seem to think they may
  legitimately assume it.
      We shall assume that the physical and geometrical proper
   ties along all parallel lines of crystal are the same. Hence
                                 a                                     it
   immediately follows that any set of particles of the crystal in
   a right line at any one temperature will be so at any other,
   although the position in space and the length of the line may
  vary equal parallel lines will remain equal and parallel
      ;                                                                ;
   parallel planes will remain parallel planes    ;    parallelograms

84             Mr. L. Fletcher on     the Dilatation of
will remain parallelograms ; and parallelepipeds will remain
parallelepipeds.      We may remark, in the first place, that
since   all the edges of tautozonal planes are parallel, and
lines parallel at one temperature are parallel at every other,
the property of tautozonality is a permanent one ; and, further,
since the condition for the tautozonality of planes, whether
crystalloid or not, depends only on their indices, the latter,
whether rational or irrational, must also be unaltered by change
of temperature.      This may also be proved as follows : — Imagine
the crystal freely suspended in space : the forces due to change
of temperature being all internal and in the nature of actions
and reactions, the centre of mass must remain unaltered in po
sition, and may be taken as a fixed origin.        At the initial tem
perature   let OX OY.     . OZ   be any  three  crystal-lines passing
through the centre of mass 0, and let ABC . HKL be any two
planes cutting them in A, B, C, H, K, L respectively ; if
ABO be the parametral plane, the indices of HKL will be
                           OA      OB     OC
                           0"H'    OK'    OL"
At any other temperature let A', B', C, H', K', 1/ be the new
positions of the crystal-points A, B, C, H, K, L ; the indices
of H', K', I/, if A' B' C be the parametral plane, will be,
                         OA'      OB'     OC'
                         UK"      OK"     01/
But points which are in       a right line and equidistant from each
other at one temperature will possess these properties at any
other, and thus parts of a crystal-line which have any ratio
at one temperature will have the same ratio permanently ; we
therefore must have
             OA'  _ OA        OF    _ OB      OC'  _ OC
             OH'      OH'     OK'     OK'     OL'    OL'
 and the indices, whether rational or irrational, are invariable.
 Since parallelograms remain parallelograms, it follows, from
 the known properties of homographic figures, that a circle will
 in general become an ellipse, and a sphere an ellipsoid. This
 may, however, be shown very simply as follows: — 0 being, as
 before, the centre of mass, let OA . OB . OC be three perpen
 dicular crystal-lines at the first temperature ; construct a paral
 lelepiped having OA . OB . OC for adjacent edges, and let P
 be the other extremity of the diagonal which passes through 0 ;
 at a second temperature the lines OA . OB . OC will in general
 not only have taken new directions in space, but have varied
 in mutual inclination and in length. Let OA', OB', OC be

                    Crystals on Change of Temperature.                            85
these new directions and lengths ; on these lines as adjacent
edges construct a parallelepiped, and let P' be the other extre
mity of the diagonal which passes through 0: since parallele
pipeds at one temperature remain so at any other, it follows
that P' is the new position of P, and its coordinates a/ %f
referred to the oblique axes will be OA'. OB'. OC respectively.
                                                                                  J
Let the unit lengths in the directions OA . OB . OC at the first
temperature have increased to the lengths a . /3 . y in the direc
tions OA'. OB'. OC at the second; we must have
           OA'=«.OA,                    0B'=/3.0B,           00=7-00,
and
           (if      +   (0     +

If the   locus of  at the first temperature be
                    P                             sphere of unit     a
radius, the equation  to the surface at the second  temperature
and referred to oblique axes becomes

    But this    the well-known equation of an ellipsoid referred
               is

 temperature   will in general  become    an   ellipsoid at any other,
 and any triad of perpendicular lines in the sphere will become
a   triad of conjugate diameters of the ellipsoid conversely,            ;
 any triad of conjugate diameters of the ellipsoid must have
 been at right angles in the sphere.         But one and only one
 triad of conjugate diameters of an ellipsoid, namely the prin
 cipal axes,    rectangular and thus there must always exist
               is                        ;
 one and only one triad of lines which            rectangular at two

                       however, the sphere remains a sphere or
 becomes   a spheroid,      clear that
                              it   is     will be possible to find an

infinity of triads which are rectangular at two temperatures.
 The axes of the ellipsoid will evidently be the triad of lines
which have experienced respectively           maximum, mean, and
                                                        a
minimum dilatation. It may also be remarked that in general
two, and only two, great circles of the sphere will remain
circles — those, in fact, which become at the second tempera
ture the circular sections of the ellipsoid. The above            true       is

crystal in the interval has not yet been considered.
    It will be convenient now to enter into a short digression
as to the permanency of a plane of symmetry at all tempera
tures, and thus to consider the question of the permanency of

86              Mr. L. Fletcher on          the   Dilatation of
the crystallographic systems.    It has been shown above that
the indices of planes remain constant, and that for this reason
the change of position of any plane of the system of given in
dices will be known if we are given the changes of the elements
f , rj, £; a:b:c.  Now it may be proved, by help of the ratio
nality of the anharmonic ratios of any four of its planes, that
any crystalloid system must present one or other of six types
 of symmetry, according to the values of £, 17, and the ratio  f
nality or irrationality of the ratios a:b:c.    For instance, if
        =                       ? be all irrational, the crystalloid system
               ^and y
£ =17
                           ^>
of planes will present symmetry to three and only three per
pendicular planes ; while if one and only one of these ratios,
say    y   is irrational and the other elements are unaltered, the
crystalloid system will present symmetry to the above three
planes and also to two additional planes perpendicular to each
other and bisecting the angles between two of the former. It
becomes an interesting question as to whether or not, in the
case of a crystal presenting symmetry to only three perpendi
cular planes,           can ever be so altered by change           of tempera
                    ^
ture  as to become rational.   In the above memoir Grailich
and Lang answer this question in the negative ; for, they argue,
if such an event were possible, a crystalloid system of planes
might pass, on change of temperature, from rhombic to tetra
gonal symmetry: and this they think is disproved by the state
ment that no crystal has been observed to pass on change of
temperature from one type of symmetry to the other, as shown
by the fact that the optical properties of a crystal at various
temperatures point to a permanent type of symmetry of the
luminiferous aether, and therefore of the mass of the crystal.
In the first place, we may remark that the difference between
an irrational number and the nearest rational one is not very
large, being somewhere near the infinitieth decimal figure :                if,
then,   ?   experience     any finite change,      it   must necessarily pass
through a large number of rational values, for every one of
which the crystalloid system of planes must possess tetragonal
symmetry. The fallacy of the argument           this      assumes
                                                          is       :   it
that the symmetry of   the crystal, as shown  in  all its physical
properties,    the same as the symmetry of disposition of the
               is
crystalloid planes.  But       easy to see that this need not be
                                  it   is
always the case.
   Suppose the centres of mass of the molecules to be arranged

               Crystals on Change of Temperature.                          87
in rectangular-parallelepipedal order, the edges of an elemen
tary parallelepiped having absolute lengths a, b, c respectively;
and, as usual, suppose that all the planes through molecular
mass-centres are crystalloid planes : it follows from the above
that such a set of planes will possess the symmetry character
istic of the rhombic system so long   as the ratios         ->       are all
                                                       g>        ^
irrational, but the symmetry of the tetragonal       if one      and only
one   of them (say   become rational; but it is clear that unless
                  ^)
a is not only in a rational ratio to b, but actually equal to            it,
the symmetry of disposition of the mass-centres themselves,
and therefore the symmetry of the physical properties, will
still be no higher than rhombic. But we may go still further,
and assert that even if a actually become equal to      the phy
                                                            b,
sical properties of the crystal need only be symmetrical to
three perpendicular planes.    For  if the molecules themselves
"have sides," or different properties in different directions
(and no one has ventured to assume that they have not),
                                                                      it   is
possible to imagine that each molecule has an internal sym
metry, upon which, as well as upon the arrangement itself of
the molecules, the symmetry of the physical properties must
ultimately depend.      If,
                          then, in the case we are considering,
the internal symmetry of the molecule be only symmetry to
the above three planes, even though the symmetry of disposi
tion both of the molecular mass-centres and of the molecular
planes be tetragonal, those physical properties (among which
we must include dilatation on change of temperature) which
depend on the internal symmetry of the molecules as well as
upon their grouping will still present only that symmetry
which characterizes the rhombic system.     And we may further
observe that, as the dilatations along the directions perpendi
cular to these planes     are independent,       will again become
                                             ^
irrational, and the crystalloid system itself once more pass to
rhombic symmetry.
   It might appear at first sight that, from the measurement
of the angles of crystal at only one temperature, no safe con
                 a
clusion could be arrived at as to the crystal-system to which              it
must be referred, and that either the crystal must be measured
at second temperature or some physical tests must be applied.
   a
We must, however, remember that the faces of a crystal will
be in general called into existence in such     way as to accord
                                                 a
in their symmetry of disposition with that which        common
                                                            is
to the internal arrangement     of the molecules and to their

88              Mr. L. Fletcher on     the  Dilatation of
grouping, even if the crystal is formed at some temperature at
which the latter possesses a symmetry corresponding to a
higher type.
    In what follows, it will be assumed that in a crystal there
is an extremely large number of points arranged in parallele-
pipedal order, and that at each of these points there is a centre
of mass of a molecule or molecular group — all these groups
being equal and parallel in .orientation.          For brevity, such a
molecular group will be spoken of as a molecule.
    We infer from the above, that the only symmetry-planes
which are permanent on change of temperature are those
which are at once planes of symmetry to the molecules them
 selves and to the molecular grouping, and also that it would
 be possible for a single crystal to determine at each of six dif
 ferent temperatures a crystalloid system presenting symmetry
 corresponding to a different crystal-system.
    Now nothing in the above would conflict with the possibi
 lity of new planes of symmetry common to the molecules and
 their arrangement starting into existence.           All we can say is
 that, if they do come into existence, they must do so symme
 trically to the preexisting common symmetry-planes ; but
 once in existence, they cannot be made to disappear again by
 any cause which would produce internal reactions symmetrical
 to these common symmetry-planes.               Even if the molecules
                             ¦
 explode, they must do so simultaneously and symmetrically
 to these planes, and the products of these explosions must
 therefore also be symmetrical to them.             As a crude illustra
 tion of the way in which such planes might come into exist
  ence, take the previous example of a rhombic arrangement of
 molecules themselves possessing rhombic symmetry, and let
 the temperature change to that at which the arrangement of
 the molecules is tetragonal.         It is quite conceivable that at
  this temperature the internal equilibrium of the molecules
  might become unstable, and that each molecule might rear
  range itself in such a way as to be still symmetrical to the old
  planes of symmetry, but also at the same time to the two ad
  ditional planes requisite for tetragonal symmetry. From this
  instant the whole system, including the arrangement and the
  internal constitution of the molecules, would present a sym
  metry corresponding to the tetragonal type ; in fact, the
  crystal would henceforth be tetragonal.
     But this symmetrical state could only be so permanent in a
  space where no disturbing force could enter.          We know from
  experiment    that the  cohesion  of  a  body  diminishes as the tem
  perature increases,     and  that  in   general   the body may come
  to find itself in a fluid condition, a state in which the slightest
  exertion of force will disturb the general arrangement of the

                 Crystals on Change of Temperature.               89
molecules.      If the cohesion has diminished to this extent in
any single direction in the a3olotropic body we are considering,
the body has reached a condition at any rate analogous to the
fluid state ; and although, under the sole action of change of
temperature, it would for ever retain its symmetrical crystal
line arrangement, still, if any attempt were made to determine
its hardness while in this state, the result must inevitably be
the total collapse of the parallelepipedal nature of the system.
 If  the crystal is within reach of the force of gravity, it will not
 be necessary even to try the hardness ; the parallelepipedal
 system on arriving at the above state will instantly be destroyed.
     It would thus appear that, although by the action of change
 of temperature the introduction of new planes of symmetry
 common to the molecules and their grouping may be possible,
 the reverse operation cannot be achieved until after a serious
 interference with the parallelepipedal grouping, and not at all
 in regions far away from disturbing forces.         This seems to
 point to the greater stability of the systems of higher sym
 metry, and to the fact that we may entertain the hope of being
 able to transfer most crystals under favourable circumstances
 into the cubic system — hexagonal crystals, however, being
 denied this privilege by virtue of their possessing an equato
  rial plane of symmetry. The reverse operation might, how
  ever, be effected by the action of some force, such as magnetism,
  which would not necessarily induce internal reactions symme
  trical to the common planes of symmetry. As remarkable
  instances of this kind of transformation from a lower to a
  higher type of symmetry, we may mention the transition of: —
  (1) amorphous bodies to the crystalline state, as in wrought
  iron, barley sugar, and the fusible alloys of Rose and Newton;
   (2) an oblique to a rhombic crystal, as in the case of artificial
   sulphur ; (3) a rhombic to tetragonal, as in that of iodide of
   mercury ; (4) a rhombic to rhombohedral, as in the change of
   arragonite to calcite.   And although the red tetragonal iodide
   of mercury does become yellow, and therefore presumably
   rhombic, on heating, still the general rule seems to be that if a
   crystal is to pass, under the action of the above kind of forces,
   from a type of symmetry in which there is any number of
   symmetry-planes common to the molecules and their grouping,
   to a type in which any of these planes has disappeared, the
   crystal must first pass through the fluid condition ; and in all
   cases we may say that the parallelepipedal nature of the system
   will first be destroyed.
      Neglecting   cases where   this destruction of the parallelepi
    pedal nature of the system takes place, we shall henceforth
    assume the permanency for all temperatures of any of these
    common symmetry-planes.

   90           Mr. L. Fletcher on   the Dilatation of
      Returning to the so-called thermic axes, we have seen that
  their rectangularity and permanency has been generally-
  assumed for all temperatures.     But on consideration we must
  decide that this is an unfair assumption; for just as Neumann
  was led by his theory of the symmetrical nature of every
  crystal with respect to three perpendicular planes to conclude
  that these perpendicular planes would remain fixed in space
  for all temperatures, so we might in the same way almost
  conclude the converse of this proposition, and say that if these
 planes are permanent in position in space for all temperatures,
 they are planes of symmetry to the molecules and their group
 ing. It is true that if these planes only retain their mutual
 inclination whilst altering their directions in space, we cannot
 come to the above conclusion; but in that case we should
 probably say that thermic axes which revolve with the tem
 perature do not bear any very intimate relation to the struc
 ture of the crystal — that, in fact, they are mere geometrical
 inventions, and something akin to the axes of that hypothe
 tical ellipse which the moon describes round a certain point as
 focus.
     For simplicity we shall first consider the alteration of a
 crystal presenting at least one plane of symmetry common to
 the molecules and their grouping, and this at all temperatures.
     Imagine a circular cylinder cut at any temperature from
 such a crystal, with its axis perpendicular to the plane of
 symmetry. From the above, if the cylinder be freely sus
 pended in space and its temperature changed, the axis will
 remain permanent in direction. In general, the planes perpen
 dicular to the axis will be translated parallel to it ; but one
 plane, that passing through the centre of mass of the crystal
 or the middle point of the axis, will remain permanently fixed
 in space ; the crystal-lines, however, which lie in this plane
 will in general change their directions in space and likewise
 their mutual inclination.     To investigate the nature of these
 changes, we shall take in this plane rectangular axes OX . OZ
fixed in space. At any instant determined by the time t, let
the crystal-line of unit length coinciding with OX be rotating
in space with the angular velocity        or 6, and be increasing
in length at the rate -~ or   i ; and let     or
                                                    ^  or 7, be the
corresponding values for the crystal-line of unit length coin
ciding at the same instant with the direction OZ. If x z be
the coordinates of any point P at this instant, its resolved ve
locities in the directions OX.OZ will be x'a.—z§, xd + zy
respectively.    If the change of OP at this instant be one of

               Crystals on Change of Temperature.             91
simple elongation, we must have
                  xu—z<j>    xd + zy

                   Oa?-(u-y)xz + fr? = 0                     (1)
   We may first remark that there is either a single pair of
such lines, whether real or imaginary, or an infinity of them ;
for so long as the coefficients do not all vanish, this equation
represents only two lines ; while if all the coefficients do va
nish, and thus the equation reduce to any identity, we must
have   6=<j>
             = 0 and « = 7, in which case the change is one of
simple linear dilatation in all directions.    If the crystal pre
sent the common symmetry-planes characteristic of the cubic,
tetragonal, or hexagonal systems, it follows from the perma
nency of direction of those planes that there will be more than
two lines in certain of these symmetry-planes likewise perma
nent in direction in space : in these cases, therefore, the change
of every line of the system lying in the common symmetry-
plane containing these lines of fixed direction will be one of
 simple elongation without rotation.     In the case of the ortho-
 rhombic system, the two lines in a symmetry-plane which
 remain unchanged in direction in space will be the same for
 all temperatures, and, moreover, will be at right angles.
    We shall now show that these lines, in the case of an oblique
 crystal, are real, though it is clear that in general they are
 not at right angles.      From dynamical considerations it is
 known that, so long as the forces acting on a material system
 are internal, and therefore of the nature of actions and reac
 tions, there can be no change of the moment of momentum of
 the system about any line.     As the molecular system under
 consideration starts from rest, the moment of momentum of
 the system about any line must therefore be zero throughout
 the motion.     Further, the moment of momentum of a material
 system   about  any straight line is known to be equal to the
 moment of momentum of the system, supposed collected at its
 centre of mass and moving with        it,
                                        plus the moment of mo
 mentum of the system relative to its centre of mass about      a
 straight line drawn parallel to the given straight line through
 the centre of mass.     In the case of a molecular group, the
 latter of these terms will be either absolute zero, or, at any
 rate, of an order of magnitude which may safely be neglected
 in comparison with the former term. If, then, be the distance

the centre of mass of the group, the moment of momentum of
the molecule about the axis is mA, and for the whole system
"S,mr2a.   From the above this must be zero ; and thus at any-
instant the values of to for some molecules must be positive
and for others negative, and there must be at least one inter
mediate position for which as must be zero.      From the above
equation, or from more simple considerations, it follows that
there is a second real line at this instant fixed in space. For
these lines Professor Maskelyne (to whom        may here express                       I
my hearty thanks for his many valuable suggestions) proposes
the convenient term atropic. The change of configuration of
the system at this instant may be treated as a simple linear
dilatation along these two directions. Expressed in rectangular
coordinates, the above condition 2?wr2t0 = O may be written as
                       (a— ^ytmxz— $2m,z2 = 0.

As the atropic lines are in general not at right angles, and
yet one pair of crystal-lines rectangular at one temperature
has been shown to be also rectangular at a second, it is
seen that these latter lines will in general have changed their
direction in space. The position of this pair of lines may be
found in the following way: — Let r         be the polar coordi                yjr

         Rotation of the Molecules. — have already, in my
memoirs from the year 1858 to 1862, endeavoured, by the
investigation of the mutual relations between the mechanical
and the magnetic behaviour of bodies when they undergo
alterations of form, to demonstrate experimentally, besides
the displacement of their molecules on one another, at the
same time also the alterations of direction of their axes, or
their rotations about their centre of gravity, and to show that
these displacements are constantly accompanied by the last-
mentioned rotations which are rendered evident by alterations
in the magnetism of bodies (at torsions of temporary and per
manent magnets), and also that, conversely, a rotation of the
molecules may have for its consequence a displacement of them
(when a current is passed through a magnet).
   If the existence of discrete molecules in bodies be admitted
at all, those experiments might not only prove in general the
existence of preformed molecules capable of rotation about
their centre of gravity, of displacement, and, finally, magnetic,
but also determine, at least in general, the nature of the
rotations they undergo in individual cases of external altera
tion of form (for example, in the torsion of iron wires through
which a current passes, &c). Thus also it can be proved, as
already follows from Wertheim's observations, that magnetic
steel wires which have first been twisted and then passed into
the position of permanent torsion or of absolute nil exhibit
polarity externally, consequently that their molecules still
retain a sensible rotation. The hypothesis advanced in the
appendix to W. Weber and Kohlrausch's paper* (1866), that
the elastic afteraction proceeds from a rotation of the molecules
producing a change in the molecular forces without the centres
of the molecules necessarily altering their relative position,
would have found from the beginning a very positive support
by reference to these results.
   The above results, and especially the indication of the mag
netism of a wire which, having been first transversally mag
netized by a current passing through          and undergone tor

 of temperature or slight shakings, already contain directly like
 wise another proposition, which F. Kohlrausch (1876)* de
 duced from the interesting temporal course of the torsion of
 a wire repeatedly turned in opposite directions. According
to this proposition, "Different arrangements (of the molecules)
 may coexist with one and the same configuration ; and there
 are forces of elasticity which can temporarily remove the
 shape of a body from the state of equilibrium."      Here even
 different positions of equilibrium of the molecules come in,
which are at once manifested by the magnetic behaviour, and
out of which the molecules may be brought, by various causes
and in the course of time, into more stable positions.
    From all the foregoing experiments and many similar ones,
the investigation of the magnetism of deformed bodies appears
especially suitable for the purpose of gaining intelligence re
specting the molecular processes within them, a knowledge
of which it is absolutely necessary to presuppose for a com
plete theory of deformations.      Only therein a complication
presents itself, inasmuch   as  with  the purely mechanical re
lations the reciprocal magnetic actions of the molecules are
secondarily combined.      Apart from this, a force acting from
without upon a magnetizable body can in this relation be con
ceived precisely like any other mechanically acting force,
except only that it moves the molecules in other paths.
                                     I
    16. Agitation-Effect. — have now shown, inter alia, that
the temporory torsion (or bending) of a body is augmented
 by slight shakings as well as by magnetizing (i. e. by the
 motion of the molecules in essentially different paths, as in
 the first deformation), and likewise by changes of tempera
 ture, and the permanent torsion (or bending) diminished, and
that in like manner the first slight alterations of figure,
shakings, and heatings act upon both the temporary and
the permanent magnetism.         These actions have not directly
any component coinciding      with   the original direction of dis
placement of the molecules, and are at first independent of
the direction of the force that produces the first deformation.
I  had, on that account, designated the action of this influence
    " agitation-effect," by which the molecules become
as                                                        movable,
and, more and more in correspondence with the forces acting
from without, place themselves in new positions of equili
brium.       I
             had separated this agitation- effect from the regular
deformations which indeed go on together with              it,

     In the subsequent first-observed state of equilibrium the
  agitation-effect may show itself in various ways.              Sometimes
  it consists merely of a rotation of the molecules about their
  centre of gravity — as, for instance, on the diminution of the
 permanent and the increase of the temporary magnetism by
 the first agitations, heatings, &c.
     Further, the agitations may produce a turning of the mole
 cules about their centre of gravity without any directly per
  ceptible gliding of them over one another, which may only
 afterwards have for its consequence an alteration of their dis
 placements on one another — as, for example, at the first alte
 rations (increase or decrease) of the load of a wire fixed in
 an invariable position of temporary torsion (§10), by which,
 after detorsion, the permanent torsion of the wire is in
 creased in precisely the same manner as if the wire had been
 frequently turned to the extent of its position of temporary
 torsion.
     Finally, agitation may produce at the same time a rotation
 of the molecules and their displacement on one another. This
 appears, e. g., when a permanently twisted wire is shaken or
 loaded, heated or magnetized, on which its permanent torsion
 first diminishes (conf. my observations of 1858, and § 9 of this
 paper). Herein is integrally included the result found by Braun
 in 1876 *, that pennanent alterations in the shape of a body
 in a determined direction are lessened by alterations in a di
 rection substantially different from and independent of the
 former.
     The corresponding effect also results when a temporarily
 twisted wire, which can freely yield to the pull of the torsion-
 weights, undergoes changes of load, and thereby has both its
 temporary and afterwards its permanent torsion increased.
     17. The effects of agitation (or accommodation                actions)
 might be conceived as similar to the diminution of the friction
 of rough surfaces by rubbing them together. When deforma
 tion takes place in any wire, the groups of molecules present
 are displaced in relation to one another, and their cohesion is
 more or less impaired, so that they become movable and fol
 low further the forces acting from without than before.                  In
 the " cracking
                    " of tin when bent in one and afterwards in
 another direction, the commotion of the entire mass corre
 sponding to these purely mechanical shiftings of the groups
resistance to distortions, within the limits of their elasticity (?), become
less the oftener such distortions take place (Pogg. Ann. cliii. p. 406 ;
 Wien. Bet-, lxix. Marz 1874, p. 38 of separate impression).

of crystals can be directly heard. The me^cules then gra
dually take up new positions of stable equilibrium with respect
to both their relative situation and the orientation of their sup
posed axes.
    If  the deformations take place successively (or even simul
taneously) in different, independent directions — e. g. in two
directions perpendicular the one to the other, the molecules
may be rendered still more movable by this double motion
than if the deformation took place in only one direction, because
now the rotations of the molecules are conditioned by both
influences.     Thus, e. g., we know that by torsion, as well as
by stretching, the molecules of magnetic wires are in fact
variously rotated.
    The phenomenon that a loaded wire under certain circum
stances, e. g. at higher temperatures, receives through torsion-
forces greater temporary and permanent torsion than without
loading (§ 12), and that even when temporarily twisted as far
as a fixed limit the same holds good for the residual permanent
torsion (§ 10), may be in part conditioned hereby.           Stretching,
however, may also act, in this way : by it the molecules are
more forcibly pressed together and are consequently rotated
further round their centres of gravity during the torsion,
which rotation may then have for its result a further displace
ment of the permanent positions of equilibrium of the con
 sequently differently oriented molecules with respect to one
another, beyond which the displacements as far as the tempo
 rary torsion          Pj) are entirely independent of the load.
 With repeated torsions the differences of behaviour of the wire
 with and without a load become less and less as the mobility
 of the molecules is enhanced ; substantially, therefore, they fall
 into the accommodation-period (cf. the experiments on oscil
 lation, § 24), and by no means universally prevail.
     The proposition advanced by Braun*, that a body which
 simultaneously undergoes two temporary deformations in two
 independent directions A and B receives a greater permanent
  deformation in the direction A than if only the temporary de
  formation in the direction A had operated alone, may be quite
 in harmony with the above experiences, and would probably
 also hold only for the period of accommodation.
     If  a body has lost unhomogeneousness             within the limits
  conditioned by the repeatedly applied, at first unilateral de
  formations, and if its molecules have
                                              " accommodated " them
  selves, the regular phenomena come out more and more.               At
  the same time the displacements of the molecules occasioned

  by various forces in the direction of the deformations              are
  directly proportional   to the forces, provided     that  they  do not
  approach too near to the maximum of the first deforming
  force.   The deviations from this in the extreme positions,
  beyond which the wire behaves more or less like a yet unaltered
  one (see my memoir of 1858), may arise from the molecules
 not yet possessing as much mobility in those positions as
 beyond them.
     If thereupon the deformations are effected in the opposite
 direction, the molecules are rotated and displaced within new
 limits, between which homogeneity is not yet restored ; the
 body behaves more or less like a fresh one ; a displacement
 of the permanent positions of equilibrium, in the direction of
 the new temporary deformations, comes in, until, after repe
tition of these, the wire behaves in 1 this direction as it did in
the other.
     18. Torsion of different Parts. — When a wire is deformed
alternately in opposite directions, it is by no means absolutely
inevitable, especially before the body has accommodated itself,
that constantly the same molecular groups will be moved and
turned. Just as at the demagnetizing of a magnet succes
                                      I
sion-points may arise (to which shall recur in another place) ,
they may also appear, for instance, in a rod which is first
twisted and then turned in the opposite direction. With
slight torsions this is not immediately perceptible ; with greater
ones it is very distinctly so.      In order to prova this, one end
of a rod of soft copper 15 millims. thick, and 160 millims.
long, was fixed in a screw vice, while the other end was
twisted 720° and then turned as far back again.            In the wave
like coils of the fibres it was distinctly seen that the detorsion
was most considerable at the extremities of the rod, and was
much slighter towards the middle. Since the molecular
groups of such a rod, removed unequal distances from their final
positions of equilibrium, in consequence of the elastic after
action simultaneously tend towards them with different and
variable velocities, and these motions accumulate, an alter-
natingly directed rotation of the free end of the rod may take
place, as was observed by Kohlrausch*.                 Also the more
                                                                          '
superficial   and  more   central  layers of  the   wire, which in the
torsion are unequally stretched     and compressed, may be affected
in different measure by the detorsion, and may therefore con
dition this interesting phenomenon f.

                                                    finally, the va
riously  answered    question  to  be discussed, whether    the defor
mation (torsion) which remains long after the removal of the
deforming force   is   to be attributed to   anew position of stable
equilibrium of the molecules, corresponding to the state of the
body at the time, or whether     it   is merely transitional stage
                                                  a
through   which    the  body tends, though extremely slowly, to
the position of absolute zero which         itpossessed before that
deformation. The former of these two views, however,                      is
most probably the true one for, first, otherwise
                             ;                             body could
                                                            a
not receive any lasting alteration of shape at all without being
submitted to change of temperature, &c, but all bodies would
inevitably return gradually to their original form. A second
ground for the view that the permanent torsion reached by                 a
wire when repeatedly twisted in one direction corresponds to
a  permanent position of equilibrium        is,
                                              that transient torsions
in the same direction, produced by weaker forces, reckoned
from that position onwards are proportional to the forces.
Lastly, one must remember that at the opening of current        a
temporarily magnetizing a steel rod the molecular magnets,
which have been deflected from their position of absolute rest,
suddenly spring back with great velocity into new permanent
positions of equilibrium, corresponding to the permanent mag
netization, without the latter becoming, either at once or in
the course of time, perceptibly less.
    20. Elastic Afteraction. — It was to be foreseen, and         con
                                                                    is
firmed by the experiments,        that  with  repeated deformations
the molecules always reach their temporary as well as perma
nent position of equilibrium the more quickly the oftener the
body    is deformed in the respective direction.          The elastic
afteraction declines therefore with different rapidity in the
different periods of the accommodation of           body. Further,
                                                       a
if  a body, e. g. a wire, has been frequently deformed (twisted)
in alternately opposite directions,    itnot unimportant for the
                                            is
course of the elastic afteraction whether the wire be once more
twisted in the direction of the last torsion and then again re
turns to its previous permanent torsion, or whether            be    it
twisted in the opposite direction and its permanent position
of equilibrium shifted.     Consequently      wire cannot be at

vation of the elastic afteraction, by frequently twisting                 it
hither and thither, but there    isalso the direction of the new
torsion to be considered.    In this sense, probably, to the pre
vious careful and particular investigations on the elastic after
action further observations will have to be added, which will

   21. Torsion Oscillations. — Only after the study of the static
conditions into which a body is brought by alternately directed
forces, does it appear possible to discuss with more exactitude
what takes place in its elastic oscillations, since evidently pre
cisely the same phenomena must prevail in these as in the
former — only with this difference, that in them the temporal
course of the elastic afteraction is not attended to.
   As according to the preceding investigations a wire twisted
hither and thither behaves quite otherwise on being twisted
toward one side of the existing position of equilibrium than on
being twisted toward the other, the hypothesis according to
which the diminution of the amplitudes of oscillation in tor
sion oscillations, for example, is to be referred to an internal
friction which, for the entire course of the oscillations, is a
function of the velocity, can no longer be maintained.        Just
as little can the elastic afteraction alone suffice for the expla
nation    if,
            for example,     be assumed that the force impelling

                                                        is
since the wire at the time has not yet attained the position
                                  t
of equilibrium, equal to a(x—p), being function of x and

   The chief cause of the diminution of the vibration-ampli
tudes lies rather, according to the above observations, in the
shifting of the position of permanent torsion at the end of each
oscillation, beside which the slow alteration of       in the course

torsion in its molecules, we will draw axes parallel with' the
axis of the wire. Let the wire next be " accommodated " by
frequent rotations to and fro, and therein at last be tempo
rarily twisted in the positive direction describing an angle
 + a, while the molecules may be rotated so that the lower
ends of their axes, looked at from the axis of the wire, describe
an angle + a, say to the left.        The direction of this rotation
follows even from my magnetic experiments *. If the wire
be slowly brought back into the permanent torsion-position
 + b, the axes of the molecules will retain a portion + jS of
their rotation to the left. If the wire now receives an impulse
in the positive direction, which again elongates it up to + a,
according to the laws of perfect elasticity it will swing back
 again to the position + b. If it now swings beyond this po
sition further to the right, and if the molecules in their rotation
had no friction on one another at all to overcome, it would arrive
 at the elongation — a, since, according to § 6, the same force
 that twists it from + b to + a twists it in the contrary direc
tion from +b to —a, while the axes of the molecules would
be rotated just as far (—a) to the right as previously to the
left. Again, with perfect elasticity the wire would go back to
the position —b, in which the molecules would be rotated —          yS,
and so forth.
    The to-and-fro motions of the wire, between ±a and ±b,
are perfectly elastic   ;  therefore the performances of work in
the swingings outwards and the swingings back again must,
within these limits, completely compensate one another.             In
fact, however,    there  results a  diminution  of   the amplitudes of
 oscillation hence the loss of vis viva therein can only corre
           ;
spond to the work which     is   expended for the alteration of the
positions of equilibrium, or the rotation of the molecules
from +/3 to —      /3   which determines it. The above dimi
 nution may therefore be taken as     a  measure for this work.
   Since the shifting  of the  permanent torsion-position to accom
modation    is,within certain narrow limits, proportional to the
temporary torsion, and therefore the rotation of the molecules
therewith  is  likewise approximately so, the oscillation-ampli
tudes must, within those limits, diminish according to the law
of geometrical series.

placement itself of the permanent position of equilibrium, the
resulting loss of vis viva may be relatively very little, follows
also directly from oscillation-experiments.

mentioned in § 4, and loaded in all with 8175 grams, was set in
torsion-oscillations.       The elongation Ax and As0, of its first and
its fiftieth swing in the same direction, amounted, in scale-divi
sions as follows : —
                  A,     520-390=130       600 - 372=158
                  A50    516 -394=122      525- 378=147

   In order that     the influence of the resistance of the air might
he estimated, a light pasteboard box closely similar in form to
the weights with which the wire was loaded was placed upon
them, which at the same time bore a pasteboard ring similar to
the brass ring, and some pasteboard appendages copying the
eccentric parts of the apparatus.         The weight of them was only
68 grams ; so that the alteration thereby conditioned could not
exert any particular action ; the oscillation-period, too, was
not greatly changed ; the resistance of the air, however, was
probably about doubled.
    The oscillation-amplitudes Aq and A80 were : —
          A0    534- 372=152       552-350=202        529- 376=153

    From this, according to the formula              A60=A1ar49,     follows
the ratio x of two successive elongations (in percentages):              —

    With the thick wire here employed, the influence of the
friction of the air is therefore not considerable.            The diminu
tion of the' oscillation-amplitude does not amount on the ave
rage to 0-l per cent., while the shifting of the permanent posi
tion of equilibrium in the same wire from +6 to —b with the
alteration of the temporary torsion from +a to —a amounts
to about 3-8 per cent, of the latter.
   23. Accommodation. — As the same frictional relations that
condition the static displacement of the position of equilibrium
occur also in a perfectly analogous manner in the oscillations,
the analogous general relations must also result in the latter
as in the former.
   Just as in alternatingly directed torsions by temporarily
acting weights, we observe correspondingly in the oscillations
also first a period of accommodation.            As during it with the
former the permanent position of equilibrium is first much
shifted, so at first the elongations of the swingings diminish
greatly.      Since in this period the permanent torsions rise very

considerably in proportion to the increments of the tempo
rary, the decrease of the oscillation-amplitudes during the
same period must, as has been observed, with greater elonga
tions be relatively more considerable.         If before the oscilla
tions the wire (as, for example, a drawn wire) already pos
sesses a permanent torsion, this also will be lessened by the
action of agitation during the oscillations ; a corresponding
displacement of the zero-position accompanies the diminution
of the elongations; and the latter can be greater in the direction
of the displacement than in the contrary direction *. If after
the accommodation the wire be again permanently deformed
(for instance, more twisted), it is self-evident that the wire in
swinging makes a new period of accommodation, with en
hanced diminution of the elongations by the action of agita
tion, &c.f
   24. Influence of the Load. — As in the above-mentioned
torsion-experiments (§§ 12 and 13) in relatively soft wires
the static displacements are initially greater with a heavier
than with a lighter load, so also must the decrements atten
dant upon oscillations be greater in the former case, but, like
those, gradually approach the magnitude which is observed
with lighter loading. This is proved by experiments which               I
made as long ago as the year 1860.
   A soft silver wire of about 0*5 millim. thickness and 75
centims. length was suspended in a double-walled vertical
brass tube, through the annular space of which aqueous
vapour could be conducted.         The wire, like those used above
(§ 2 et seqq.), carried a brass clamp provided with a mirror,
which in like manner supported on a hook a cylindrical brass
box 14 centims. in height and 6 centims. wide, into which
closely-fitting leaden weights (B) could be put. The ampli
tudes of the torsion-oscillations of the wire, previously an
nealed and then set oscillating, were observed by means of a
telescope and scale.      The following Table contains under T
the excursions in both directions directly observed on the scale,
under E the total elongations, under N the mean of each pair
of excursions in the two directions, under u the percentage of
diminution from the first to the tenth elongation. The num
bers placed before the observations are the ordinal numbers
of successive oscillations. In series II., under Z are given
the times which had elapsed between the observations.                 The
wire was kept incessantly oscillating during the whole series.

of a wire should behave differently ; for the slightly heavier
loading of its upper parts could hardly, according to the above
investigation, explain this anomaly, at least after the state of
the wire has become constant.
   The present experiments show that the experimental por
tion of this field of research still needed extension ere it would
be possible to arrive at an exhaustive theory of the phenomena
of imperfect elasticity, in which, after determining the static
(i. e. the mean) positions of equilibrium       of the molecules
executing their thermal vibrations, one might also enter upon
the .direction of the latter.
I    hope shortly to be able to make further communications
upon the subject here treated, and especially on its relations to
magnetism.

  112                Dr.    J. A. Fleming on a     new
  " bridge"-wire     consists of the arm H H7 and the wire under
  the base-board together with the galvanometer inserted be
  tween G and G\          By moving round the arm H H7 and press
  ing the button w, we can find a position where there is no
  current through the galvanometer.            The copper strips k k are
  made of copper so thick that their resistance is practically
 nothing.      Having established a balance between the conduc
  tors and read the vernier, the next operation is to lift up the
 legs of the coil which were inserted in the cups a and c and
 drop them into the cups b and d. Likewise a similar change
 is effected on the other side ; the terminals of the coil inserted
 in V and df are changed to a' and d . An examination of the
 connexions as shown in fig. 1 will show that the result of the
 operation is as if the coils had changed ¦places whilst preserving
 their former connexion. Now let the arm be moved round
 and a fresh position of equilibrium found by pressing the
 trigger and reading the vernier. A little consideration will
 show that the difference of these readings gives the difference
 between the resistances of the coils in terms of a length of the
 bridge-wire ; for the amount by which one coil exceeds the
 other in resistance is equal to the resistance of that part of the
 bridge-wire included between the two readings *. In order
 to render this method of determining the difference of the two
 coils practicable, the platinum-iridium wire must be exceed
 ingly uniform in resistance, or else a Table of calibration will
 have to be made. Great pains were taken to procure a length
 of wire as uniform in size and resistance as possible ; and con
 siderable care was taken, in laying the wire in its groove, not
 to strain it in any way.         It lies evenly in its groove, just suf
 ficient tension being put upon it to keep it in its place.             The
 whole resistance of the wire from end to end is not far from
      of an ohm at about 15° C.
     The wire was carefully calibrated by measuring the differ
ence in the resistance of two pieces of thick brass wire of such
 lengths that the difference of their resistances was about equal
to that of thirty divisions of the bridge-wire ; and this differ
ence was measured at about a hundred different equidistant
    * This  method of obtaining the difference of two resistances in terms
of  a length of the calibrated bridge wire was suggested by Prof. G. 0.
Foster, F.R.S., in a paper read before the Society of Telegraphic Engi
neers, May 8, 1872.     In this paper is given an account of the method of
calibrating  a wire.  It  is obvious, without any further proof, that if the
coil placed in a and c exceeds in resistance that placed in b and d, then
on exchanging them, since the united resistance of coils and bridge-wire
remains the same, that the contact knife-edge must be moved back along
the bridge-wire by a length exactly equal in resistance to the excess of
one coil over the other.

positions all along the bridge-wire, and found to be so nearly
the same that no Table of calibration was deemed requisite.
To protect the bridge- wire from injuries, as well as to preserve
it from being heated by radiation from surrounding bodies, a
wooden ring, v v, is fastened down on the base-board.                The
ring    is 1£  inch  wide  and  £  inch   deep; and   its internal  dia
meter is 1 inch greater than that of the ebonite disk.               The
wire, therefore, lies hidden away on the side of a square-sec
tioned circular tube ; and, furthermore, a shield of cardboard
faced with tinfoil lies upon the face of the disk e, extending
just beyond the ring. An aperture is cut in this shield to
 permit the passage of the trigger, as well as to allow the
 vernier to be read.     By this means the wire is not only out of
 sight, but out of reach of all radiation as well as mechanical
 injury.

     4. Method   of determining  the Variation-coefficients  of Coils.
 To determine the variation-coefficient of any given coil we
 proceed as follows : — Three other coils are provided, two of
 them nearly equal in resistance, which we will call 1 and 2.
 A third coil, 3, must be taken whose resistance is nearly equal
  to that of 4, the coil whose variation- coefficient is desired (see
  fig. 5).   The terminals of 3 are inserted in the mercury-cups
  a and c, those of 4 in V and d! , those of 1 in p and r, and
  those of 2 in q' and /.     Now the operation to be conducted is
  to keep the coils 1, 2, and 3 at a fixed temperature, and to
  keep 4 successively at two known temperatures, differing by
  about 15° Cent., and to obtain the difference of the resistances
  of 3 and 4 at these two temperatures.         The difference of these
  differences, divided by the difference of the temperatures, is
  the mean coefficient of variation of resistance between these
  temperatures.      The chief difficulty to be contended with is
  that of keeping the temperature of the coils constant during
  the operation, and of ascertaining what that temperature is;

114                Dr.  J.  A. Fleming   on a new
for, as Prof. Chrystal has remarked in his report (Brit. Assoc.
Report, 1876), it is not easy to tell whether the temperature
of the water in which the coil rests is identically the same as
that of the wire, since the latter is imbedded in a mass of
slowly conducting paraffin.       To reduce as far as possible the
difficulty of keeping the coils at a constant temperature, they
 are placed in water-vessels made of zinc (see fig. 3, PI. IV.).
 These water-boxes are composed of two cylindrical vessels — an
 outer case 9 inches high and 8 inches in diameter, and an inner
 one of lesser size ; the two are connected at the top, so that they
 form a sort of jar with hollow sides and double bottom.        This
 interspace forms an air-jacket.     Around the inside vessel near
 the top is a row of small holes; and two tubes communicate at
 the bottom — one with the inner vessel, and the other with the
•annular interspace.      The top is closed by a wooden lid with
 apertures for thermometer and stirrer.       Water can be made
 to flow from the supply-pipes into the inner vessel ; it rLes up
 and overflows through the holes, and drains away down the
 interspace and out by the other pipe.       The bodies of the four
 coils are placed in four water-boxes of this description ; and
 water from the town mains being sent in a continuous stream
 through all four water-boxes, the coils are rapidly brought to
 and maintained at a known temperature.          Any desired tem
 perature can be given to one coil by leading warm water from
 a cistern into its vessel.   The annular air-filled space renders
 the rate of cooling very slow.     Hence the coils, once at the
 desired temperature, can easily be kept there. Fig. 4, PI. IV.,
 gives a sketch of the arrangement, two of the water-boxes
 being removed to show the connexions.
     The advantage of the somewhat complicated arrangement of
 copper bars will now be seen. We can, without withdrawing
 the coils 3 and 4 from their water-boxes, and without in any
 way disturbing the other arrangements, reverse the position of
 the coils 3 and 4 on the bridge, by simply lifting up the legs
 half an inch and changing the mercury-cups into which they
 dip. Thus the legs of coil 3 are changed from cups a and c
 to b and d, and those of coil 4 from b' and df to a! and
 This exchange does not occupy more than a few seconds; and
 hence we can obtain the two readings necessary to give the
 difference of the resistance of the coils 3 and 4 when they are
at different temperatures in a very short time.        During this
 short time the temperatures of the two coils will not change
perceptibly, protected as they are by an air-jacket.
    In the ordinary form of straight bridge there is considerable
trouble in exchanging the coils, because the water-vessels have
to be moved and the mercury-cups readjusted ; and all this

                    Form of Resistance-Balance.                  115
  time the coils are cooling ; so that the two readings are never
 made under the same circumstances as regards temperature.
 Beginning, then, with all four coils at the same temperature,
 we take the difference between 3 and 4.         To get them all at
 the same temperature, water from the town mains is allowed
 to circulate through the system for half an hour.       At the end
 of this time the difference of 3 and 4 is taken; and several read
 ings are taken at small intervals of time to see if the tempe
 ratures are constant.      This being done, the temperature of
 coil 4 is raised by the introduction of warm water until it is
 about 15° above that of coil 3.     It is best to raise the tempe
 rature about 20° above the other at first, and keep it there for
 20 minutes, and then let it fall very slowly.      In this way coil
 and water cool together, and an equilibrium of temperature is
 established between them.      The difference between 3 and 4 is
 again taken; and from these two readings we have, as seen
 above, the mean variation-coefficient between the two tempe
 ratures.    Another method, which would probably be a more
accurate one, for obtaining the mean coefficient of variation
between 0° C. and 15° 0. would be to wait until the tempe
rature of the water in the town mains was about 15° C, and
then to keep three of the coils at that temperature, and to cool
the fourth by means of ice to zero.      If then all four were kept
 at 15° and the observations repeated, we should have the
means of finding the variation-coefficient of the fourth coil
between 0° and 15°.       Prof. Chrystal, in his report, threw out
the suggestion that resistance-coils    should have a thermoelec
tric couple attached to them, one junction being buried in the
 heart of the paraffin surrounding the wire, and the other out
 side. This has been tried in some coils recently made, and
proves a satisfactory method of ascertaining the equilibrium
of temperature between the wire and the water.
    Another source of error in the ordinary methods arises from
uncertain or variable resistances at the mercury-cups. It is
important that the copper legs of the coil-terminals should
press very firmly against the tops of the copper pins on which
the india-rubber-tube cups are fixed. To ensure this, the plan
adopted is to fasten on the coil-legs an ebonite clamp.       Along
                                         j
the edge of the wooden promontory, hi (fig. 1), are put brass
pins m ; and by means of steel spiral springs fixed to these and
attached to the clamps the coil-legs are pressed down very
firmly (see fig. 3). The ends of the pins which carry the
india-rubber cups and the ends of the coil-legs being well amal
gamated, we get, when they are thus firmly pressed in contact,
a very good joint, and one whose resistance is small and con
stant.    If the clamps are not used, then one leg may get lifted

    5. Example of a determination of the Variation-coefficient of
a Coil. — The whole resistance of the platinum-iridium wire is
very nearly 0'0512 of an ohm, or not far from           of an ohm,
at about 15° Cent.      As the whole length can be divided by
the vernier into 10,000 parts, this gives as the value of         of                 ^
a division i^joWy of an ohm.

    As before, the fourth column gives the difference of F and
K   at 28°-2 C.   Taking the mean difference at 28°-2 0. to be
947 units, and that at 11° C. to be 45 units, we have

in units of bridge-wire.    Since the coils F and K are approxi
mately ohm coils, this gives as the variation-coefficient of the
coil K *0262 per cent.     This coil is of platinum-silver wire.
These three determinations occupied about an hour and a half,
during which time many more readings were taken, all closely
agreeing with the above. The actual measurement of the
differences requires but a few moments to effect, the principal
expenditure of time being that required to bring the coils
to the same temperature          as the water.
    In   conclusion,   I may state
                                that this resistance-balance has
been constructed in the workshops of the School of Mechanical
Engineering at Cambridge, under the direction of Prof. Stuart.
Great care was taken in laying on the wire so as to avoid
straining it in any way; and the performance of the instrument
is consequently very satisfactory.          I
                                         should also express the
fact that this excellent performance is due to the supervising
care of Prof. Stuart, who not only supplied several of the
details of the construction, but aided, by his valuable sugges
tions generally, during the process of carrying out my rough
designs into a practical form.

                                                  having   been read at the
meeting held on December 13, 1879.

 118               Messrs. Perry and Ayrton on
 great difficulties in the way of exact determinations of the
powers of lights.     Our experience in experimenting with elec
 tric lights leads us to believe that, but for this difficulty, we
 should have a vast body of information on the subject of elec
 tric lighting, instead of the vague and conflicting statements
 which fill the scientific journals.    Perhaps only those who
 have made experiments will appreciate fully the great advan
 tages of our having some compact form of photometer.          The
 members of the Society will no doubt see many applications
 of a compact photometer, such as measuring the light from
 various parts of the sky for instance, in which ordinary pho
 tometric methods are unavailable.      Now our instrument will
 resemble a camera; and it may be turned in all directions.
    We were delighted to hear from Dr. Guthrie that his prin
             "
 ciple of a retention-image photometer," recently communi
 cated to the Society, has proved to be correct quantitatively.
 The success of his test must be as interesting to physiologists
 as to physicists.   Besides testing his principle by using pow
 erful lights, he will have experiments to make concerning the
loss of light in reflection, as we shall have concerning loss in
 refraction. Probably, however, he does not intend to apply
 his instrument to powerful lights, on account of the very
 great difficulty he would meet with in measuring the breadth
 of the fine slot which would be needed.
    In ordinary photometric methods, the rays of light illumi
 nating unit area of screen, if coming from a powerful source,
 are contained in a very small solid angle.      We use the very
simple expedient of causing these rays to fill a much greater
 solid angle by passing them through a thin concave lens, and
in this way obtain the same amount of illumination as before,
but on a screen placed at a short distance behind the lens.
Thus we not only save space, but prevent a great deal of the
absorption which occurs when light passes through air.         This
absorption is sometimes very great in London.           We have,
however, absorption in the lens as a disadvantage; but with a
 very thin lens this may probably be reduced to an almost in
appreciable amount.
    A is the light to be measured ; D is a paper screen illumi
nated by light passing through the concave lens E.             The
frame F, which carries the lens, slides on a stand G, which
has marked divisions, so that a pointer tells the distance from
the focus of the lens to the screen D.     The sides of the space
F D are of black cloth, like the sides of a folding camera; and
the inside is all blackened except the screen D. A circular
plate with three round holes of different sizes is in front of
the lens. A diaphragm of this kind is not necessary, if we can

be assured   of there being no reflection from the inside of the
box.    Beside the instrument, and containing                   the standard
candle, is a box blackened inside, in one end of which is a
screen similar to D.     IfD is the distance from the light to
the lens and d is the distance from the principal focus of the
lens to the screen; if 8 is the focal length of the lens, then,
roughly, a bundle of rays of unit solid angle gets to have, after
refraction, an angle
as   D is always great in comparison with                     If L
                                                   is the total

in passing through the lens; and by interposing thin plates of
glass between the standard candle and its screen to produce
there a similar absorption, we have no doubt that measure
ments may be made with this instrument with much greater
accuracy than is possible by the ordinary method.
    The power of the light is practically, therefore, proportional
to the square of the product of the measurable distances.       It
will be, of course, unnecessary to measure the variations both
 in D and in d, as the scale can be so graduated as to give both
distances at one reading.

       Philosophical Magazine
           H. Preece gives a discussion, in which he shows
the condition to be supplied in electric lighting, in order to
obtain a maximum effect.       In equation (2), p. 31, he gives,
for the heat distributed to the incandescent material,
                             ^—(p     +    r + iy'
  where p represents the battery-resistance, and r and I repre
  sent the resistances of the connecting wires and an incan
  descent lamp respectively.
'
    For n lamps joined up in series, we must substitute nl for I ;
while    if joined   in multiple arc, we must put         - for I. In either
 case the valueof H is found to be a maximum when the resist
ance of the lamp system is equal to that of the rest of the cir
cuit.
   Mr. Preece then proceeds on the assumption that this con
dition cannot be complied with if n is large, reaching the con
clusion that the amount of heat liberated in each lamp varies
inversely as thejsquare of the number of lamps.     This is true
in either of the twtTCases discussed by him.
   If,however, we have n lamps arranged in n' parallel circuits,
in each of which we have n" lamps, the previous equation
becomes

is explained, a0 being the decimal point ; a0 may, in general,
be taken to be the origin from which the order of the digits of
N is to be reckoned in either direction.
    The use of these results and comparisons is manifest through
 out the whole subject.      The first step in their application is to
 obtain easily the unitate to a given number. Although the
 general unitation-formula will, in all cases, furnish this value
 by substitution, there are short methods which point out dif
 ferent processes according to the algebraical form of 8 in UjN.
 The practical work in some of these methods has been illus
 trated in the papers       III., and V. but an analytical treat

                            is                         Some of these
 cases will now be examined.

U999 . . . K, and in which 8
                               = any number which has only nines
for its digits, there being n digits, includes the particular case
U9N.       U9N may be styled the normal set of unitates, just as
the method of expressing an angle in terms of the angle sub
tended by the arc equal to the radius may be called the normal
method, or the Napierian system of logarithms the normal
system.
   In the general unitation-formula (art. 31), if r = 10", n being
taken equal to the number of nines in 8 ( = 999 . . . ), the for
mula has all its coefficients (of the form (r— 8)m) = l, and it
resolves itself into adding every set of n digits in N, and
repeating the operation until a number less than 8 is ob
tained.       The examples at the end of this article will make
this short method quite plain. Any reader wishing to verify
examples of U999...N by actual division will be assisted by
knowing that all the multiples of 999 . . . are of the form
a„a„_i . . . a3a2av writing the digits au a2, a3, &c. as the number
is expressed decimally (for instance in 1760 = a4a3a2a1, a4=l,
a3=7, a2=6, a1=0), and in which an + a1=9, and
                                           999 ... ,
there being (n— 1) nines.           For instance, 9999 . 7 = 69993 ;
 999999 . 6 = 5999994 ; and so on.          Moreover the unit's digit
of the product =10 m,     —    m   being the multiplier.  The whole
form of these multiples is therefore (m— 1)999 . . . (10— m).

 of an integer and 8 must be subtracted from the amount to
 obtain the required unitate.

               tion-balance.     By Oliver           J.    Lodge, D.Sc*
1.    riiHE  telephone, considered as a scientific instrument,
       A seems destined to play an important part as a detector
of minute currents of rapidly changing intensity ; .and the
general theory of intejmifrtant purrenta is being brought onto
pxoTrnnence by its use.
   The equations to wEich most attention has been hitherto
directed have been those relating to the steady flow of a cur
rent after the initial inductive or inertia-like effects have sub
sided ; and in arrangements such as the Wheatstone bridge, a
double key is commonly used, in order to allow the introduc
tory stage to subside before any observation is taken.         The
galvanometer    is essentially an instrument for measuring steady
currents, or for giving the algebraically integrated expression
for the total quantity of electricity which has passed in the
case       of transient currents   ;    that   is,        idt,  t   being small com

   Again, the electrodynamometer has an important use as an
integrator of the current without paying attention to sign;

                                                                    0
the total duration of the current,     small.         is
   But the telephone-plate has such         very small period of
                                                            a
swing  that  the same  t,  which    vanishing compared with the
                                                 is
time of oscillation of needle, may be many times greater than
                               a
that of the telephone-plate.     Moreover the plate   not limited                is
to one mode of vibration, but can have minor vibrations su
perposed on the fundamental so that          ;can enter into the    it
changes going    on, and  render  minute fluctuations audibly ap
parent which would in more slowly moving detectors be simply
merged in the total effect.
   Thus    rapidly alternating current (such as the telephone
              a
itself produces), which     totally unfelt by
                                    is            galvanometer,          a                      is
appreciated by     telephone-plate
                       a             in its variability — the pitch
 of the note indicating the number of vibrations, even         they                    if
are so rapid as to produce     shrill whistle. The telephone, in
                                         a
fact, does not integrate the current, but gives all its fluctua
tions within certain limits.
    The complete theory of the telephone, setting forth precisely
on what the loudness of its indications depends, would be                                       a
most interesting and important investigation          but       has          ;        if
                                                                                       it
been attacked,    am ignorant of it.
                    I                   It seems probable that the
loudness of the sounds will be found to depend upon the am
plitude of the vibrations of the plate and upon their velocity
conjointly — in other words, both on the total change of the
current and on the rate at which the change takes place;         e.,                       i.
in the symbols hereafter to be used, that the loudness       direct                   is
                                                                                      a
function      o(j    4-.   I     shall not, however,                 assume anything            of
this sort, but shall content myself with simply finding the
value of the current^' as    function of the time, leaving the
                                     a
rest to be done subsequently.
   It quite true that the telephone
        is                                only an indicator and
                                                           is
                                 but so many null methods can
                                                                                                 '

be devised which permit measurements to be made with                                            a
simple detector, that       probable that
                               it   is       will have importantit
applications in this capacity also.     And   hence     think the            I
general theory of intermittent currents, or of currents in the
variable stage, will come into more prominence than hitherto.
   The induction-balance furnishes an illustration.     The thing
itself  isold and  well  known     Dove  made: experiments with
it; and Felici established the  laws of current  induction by its
aid: but its power as an instrument of research was never ap
preciated till Prof. Hughes applied to      an intermittent cur
                                                            it
rent and      a   telephone.

             and   the Theory   of   the Induction-balance.       125
   Faraday interposed blocks of copper between a primary coil
and a secondary connected with a galvanometer, and was sur
prised to find that the effect at make and break was precisely
the same with the copper as without it*.      It was, however,
afterwards found that the physiological effects were very dif
ferent, being much less when the copper was present — thus
proving that though the copper did not affect the integral flow
of electricity, yet it greatly affected the time during which
that flow took place.
  Dove repeated Faraday's experiment more perfectly by
means of an induction-balance, and showed that no non-mag
netic media produced any effect appreciable by a galvano
meter.
    Thus may numerous phenomena be overlooked with a gal
vanometer which with a telephone become obtrusively evident.
     2. My attention was more particularly directed to the sub
ject by an observation which was made by Mr. W. Grant,
 assistant in the Physical Laboratory, University College, and
which    I have his permission to describe.
     The intermittent current from a mouth-telephone,            or the
 induced current from a clock-ticking microphone and coil,
 is sent through a long helix of wire wound upon a bobbin,
 with another similar but quite disconnected wire wound along
 side it.    A telephone and ear are also arranged in the cir
 cuit of the first wire, and the loudness of the sound observed.
 The disconnected wire, which is wound on the same reel as
 the first, now has its two ends joined up so that it itself forms
 a closed circuit : the loudness of the sound is thereby consi
 derably increased.        The secondary circuit is broken again, and
 the sound again becomes faint.         The strengthening on closing
 the secondary circuit is so great, indeed, that short-circuiting
 the primary so as to shunt out all its resistance, scarcely pro
 duces any additional strengthening effect.         In other words, a
 moderate     resistance    (several ohms) may be thrown into a
 telephonic circuit without the slightest appreciable weakening
  of the effect, provided a second wire coiled alongside the first
 be arranged so as to form a closed circuit.          If a second tele
  phone   be  put   in  circuit with   this second  wire, it will give
  about  the  same    indications  as the other ; and this may some
  times be a good way of working two telephones.
     The rough general explanation        is,
                                            of course, not far to seek.
  The extra currents, which at first oppose the primary, are
  able to form in the secondary when its circuit          isclosed and
                                                                ;
  hence the changes in strength of the primary are more rapid,
and therefore      more complete.

126                Dr. 0.     J.   Lodge on Intermittent Currents
   An obvious modification                    is,
                                  to arrange both speaking and
hearing telephone in circuit Avith both the parallel coiled
wires in series, first, so that the currents flow the same way
in both wires, and then with one wire reversed       so that in     ;
the first case the self-induction    maximum, and in the other
                                                  is
                                                  a
almost zero.
   Any one who tries this experiment will at once appreciate
the very decided difference in the telephonic indications.        In
fact, resistance      of  much
                         is       less  consequence in a telephone-
circuit than      self-induction.
                    is                 This fact obviously explains
the discrepancy which has been observed between experiments
on resistance-bobbins     thrown into a telephonic circuit in           a
laboratory,   and  the  same   resistance when forming an actual
line. The resistance-coils are wound so as to have no self-
induction and they accordingly weaken the effect very little.
               ;
It surprising how many thousand ohms can be thrown into
  is
a talking circuit without stopping a conversation.        But if the
bobbins were wound all in one direction, they would be still
worse than a line-resistance.
   3.  It plain from this that the only right method of arran
            is
ging    atelephone-line        to have two wires running close
                                     is
together — one for the direct, the other for the return current.
This arrangement has,        believe, been used in order to avoid
                                   I
induction-effects from battery-currents in neighbouring wires;
but   ithas also the great advantage of diminishing the self-
induction of the wire itself. It          however,    question how
                                                        is,    a
far the increase in electrostatic capacity would militate against
this advantage in a very long land-line. It          certain to be
                                                               is
injurious   as far as    goes; but
                              it     the wires are very thin, their
                                                  if
electrostatic capacity will be but small.
   In the case of a cable the double wire would have decidedly
less capacity than      single wire and the capacity diminishes
                            a                       ;
rapidly  with   the size  of the wire. Hence        appears that
                                                              it        a
telephone-cable    should  have    pair of exceedingly fine insu
                                              a
lated wires of the very highest conductivity pretty close toge
ther in large insulating sheath.
           a
I    need hardly say, perhaps, that no advantage will be gained
 by attempting to do away with the self-induction of the tele
phone-bobbin itself by means of         second wire wound along
                                                    a
side the first and forming      closed circuit — because the inter
                                          a
mittent currents induced in this would be nearly as strong as
those in the direct circuit, and, being always in an opposite di
rection, will nearly neutralize their intermittent effect on
external coils or on the telephone-plate.
I     propose now to work out the theory of the induction-
balance, and of one or two other cases of intermittent currents,

              and   the   Theory of   the   Induction-balance.                               127
as completely as possible without taking into account the elec
trostatic capacity of the wires. It would be very interesting
to obtain the perfectly general equations ; but they are very
complex, and appear to be beyond me at present.
               General Theory         of Current-induction.
   4. The general theory of the establishment of a current in a
number of circuits of known resistance, in one or all of which
a given electromotive force begins to act, was begun by Helm-
holtz and Thomson, who independently showed that the fact
of the existence of induced currents, discovered experimentally
by Faraday, as well as the laws of the same, could be deduced
mathematically from the electromagnetic attractions of Oersted
and Ampere by means of the principle of the conservation of
energy. The complete theory, it is needless to say, is to be
found in Maxwell's ' Electricity,' and also in that admirable
digest of the whole subject, Professor Chrystal's article in the
Encyclopaedia Britannica.

       Now in the induction-balance as ordinarily arranged
        5.
there are three such circuits, with the coefficients M all con
stant, and two of them without any electromotive force.       The
first, or battery-circuit, consists of     battery and two equal
                                                  a
coils, and    also contains some kind of intermittent break or
             it
microphone    ; the second     the telephone-circuit, and consists
                                 is
of two equal coils and     telephone
                             a          and the third
                                             ;           complete            is
within the coin or other piece of conducting matter in the
neighbourhood of one pair of the coils of the other circuits.
The general value of the telephonic current at any instant
after a make has occurred in the primary would therefore be

third order with constant coefficients.
   But the problem may be simplified by observing that the
" coin " is not introduced until a                    " has been

they are conjugate to one another so that M12=0. Moreover
the coefficients of induction between the two coiled circuits
and the coin are ordinarily sufficiently small for their squares
to be neglected     in which case, as will be shown more fully
                        ;

  On  the Law of Variation of a Battery-current in a solitary
                                Circuit.
   6.  Let a battery of constant electromotive force E act in a
circuit whose total resistance may be suddenly changed from
the value R to the value S, and let L be the coefficient of self-
induction of this circuit.       Then the current t at any time t
after the change of resistance has occurred is to be found from
the equation

with the initial condition           when t=0.      This gives us in
                              i==^
the integral form
                    t
Putting R=oo, we get the well-known              expression   for the
current at   " make,"
                           i=|(i_rl')                              (5)
Putting S very large, we get an expression for the current at
partial break, provided there is no extra-current spark at the
surface   of separation,
                               E    s*

It  will not do to put S = ao , because it is impossible to make,
the resistance suddenly infinite, i. e. to stop the current instan
taneously.
   7. It is difficult to get a reasonably correct expression for
the value of the current at break.        We may suppose that, by
 separation of two portions of the circuit, the resistance is sud
 denly changed from R to a quantity which would be S if the
 current instantaneously ceased, but which is much less than
 S for a very short time, owing to the heat generated by the

after the break is to be found, we may suppose, from such an
equation as this,

where H is the cooling-constant.      The mode in which the
resistance of air changes with temperature is unknown ; so we
may assume any simple and not improbable law, such as that
the decrement of resistance is- proportional to the increment, of
temperature,       or
                                 dr— —kdO,
where k is a constant.    From these two equations r has to be
obtained as a function of the current i and of the time t ; and
then its value has to be substituted for S in equation (3).  As
a first approximation, we may imagine the time too short for
cooling, or make H = 0. Then we get
                             •r=be       Jo         ;
an expression which, as a coefficient in equation (3), to me
seems quite unmanageable.                I
                                     will therefore assume for the
future that the change in the battery-circuit resistance' is
always made suddenly from one finite value to another, no
spark or current across air-spaces being produced.

     10. Instead of varying the resistance, we may produce an
 alternating current by a periodic electromotive force, as, for
 instance, when the circuit contains an electromagnetic machine
 of constant resistance, such as a telephone itself. The electro
 motive force is then representable by a simple harmonic func
 tion or by a sum of a number of these.                 Take the simplest

 is never accurately true, as the electromotive force begins
 to fall off the instant the circuit is closed, and some dis
 crepancies between theory and experiment may arise from
 this cause.     Let us see what happens when the battery is
not constant, or when a polarizable voltameter forms part
of the circuit. According to Kohlrausch, the electromotive
force of polarization is proportional to the amount of decompo
 sition, and therefore a short time t after the current has been
established   it is

The induced current at make in this           case   therefore   has an in-

about half the rate of the current at break.
   All this is very instructive. It must be the state of things
approximated to in many arrangements.
   15. We can now see what happens in Mr. Grant's case of a
primary wound alongside a secondary, whose circuit can be
closed or unclosed ; though the state of things considered in
the last section is only roughly attained, because the telephone-
coil forms part of the battery-circuit, and adds materially to
the self-induction of that circuit without contributing to the
mutual induction.      However, neglecting this and taking the
circuits similar, we find the primary current at " make

Similarly, at the break (S= large,         R=r),     the primary current,
when the secondary is closed, is
instead of
when it was open.
   Hence the initial or maximum rate of variation of the bat
tery-current either at make or break when the secondary cut-
rent is closed, is to its initial rate of variation when the
secondary is" unclosed as L is to 2(L — M),- — a ratio which, in
the case supposed, is nearly infinite.
The Theory of Tertiary Currents as produced in an induction-
  balance — that   in a coil which
                   isj                arranged so as to be conju

   16. This    the case of the induction-balance disturbed by
              is
a coin.  .The primary   and, secondary circuits are arranged in
some conjugate position so that they have no effect on each

other—this being done practically by splitting each into two
¦equal  parts, and arranging the two parts so as to oppose each
other     ;and the third circuit is represented by the piece of
metal put near or inside the primary and secondary coils.
The primary circuit contains as part of itself a battery and an
intermitter ; the secondary contains a telephone.
     Neglecting electrostatic capacity and leakage (which latter,
by the way, must be carefully avoided in a good balance), the
current in either primary is the same, and the current in each
secondary is the same, not only on the whole, but at every
instant of time.      In fact, the separation of the two halves of
the primary and secondary is immaterial to the theory.          The
current which is induced in the secondary circuit, and which
is heard in the telephone, is a tertiary current produced by
induction from* the third coil or piece of conducting matter.
 -    Thei currents in the battery-circuit at any instant being
 called i, that induced in the metal being k, and that induced
 by this in the secondary circuit being called j, and being the
Value appreciated by the telephone, the equations for determi

   18. Having now integrated equations (2) and obtained an
expression (40) for the current passing through the telephone
at any instant, several things may be noticed about it.  First,
the current produced by the piece of metal is in general dif
ferent in character to that produced by a slight shift of the
secondary coil (that      by M being made not quite zero) and
                                   is,                                        ;
consequently      itimpossible in general to balance the effect
                       is

               and   the   Tlieory of      the   Induction-balance.        141
of metal completely by moving the other pair of coils a little
farther apart, though it may be done partially. Both effects
would then be superposed, and the two sounds would be sepa
rately heard and might differ in pitch, because there would be
more oscillations in the tertiary current than in the secondary.
It is quite possible that a musical ear would perceive that the
quasi-note produced by the insertion of a piece of metal con
tains a trace of a tone an octave above that produced by a shift
of the coils. Equation (42), however, appears to show that
when the battery- and telephone-circuits are similar the secon
dary and tertiary currents are expressible by the same func
tion of the time, and that, therefore, in this case the effect of
introducing metal may be counteracted by a shifting of the
coils.
    Next, we see that the effect is independent* of M (that                  is,
of the mutual induction between the primary and secondary
 coils); and therefore        may occasionally be well to place them
                                it
in some nearly conjugate position, so as more easily to obtain               a
balance.      In fact the four coils are unnecessary; two coils
placed   so  as not to act on each other will do; and piece of metal
                                                               a
placed near them will produce disturbance; only             will not be

 so easy to bring the metal close or parallel to both coils.
    Next the effect proportional to the produced m/i of which
                           is                                         ;

 thing    issymmetrical     with  respect to them, so that    does notit
 matter   whether    the  coin     nearest
                                      is    the  primary or the secon

 coils must be either       maximum or a minimum position of the

     Prof. Hughes long ago stated, from experimental obser-                        1
 vation, that the position of the coin which gave the loudest
 sound was half way between primary and secondary, the two
 coils being pretty close together and being equal in all respects.
  Before investigation        had felt inclined to doubt whether this
                                I
 were more than approximately true (as               was by no means

  to both coils, and the middle of the primary coil seemed a not
  improbable place for the maximum).            Accordingly   arrangedI
  two pairs of coils as an induction-balance, the components of
  each pair being          or
                           4     inches apart, but with their planes

  common axis of one pair to see what happened.             The maxi
  mum was not in the middle but there were two maxima, one
                                           ;
  on each side the middle, and every thing appeared symme-                         1
  trical with respect to both coils.       The preceding investigation

  142          Dr. 0.   J. Lodge   on Intermittent Currents
  throws light upon this, and reconciles the two observations.
  It turns out (as might have been anticipated) that Professor
  Hughes's statement is quite correct when the coils are near •
  together ; but if they are separated by a distance greater than-
  the diameter of either (the coin being supposed small), the-
  middle point becomes a minimum with a maximum on each
- side of it (see next section).
   On the  Law according     to which the disturbance   produced by oL
     small coin on  the common    axis of a pair of coils in an indue-,
     tion-balance depends on its position.               ¦
     19. The general expression for the induction-coefficient be
  tween two circular coils in any position whatever is given in
  '
    Maxwell/ art. 696. We can specialize this to the ease;
  required, viz. a coil of n turns and a "coin" or coil of one
  turn, both on the same axis.          Let the mean radius of the>
  "coil" be a, and let the distance of its circumference from
  some point 0 on the axis be c.        Also let the mean radius of
  the " coin
              " be and let d be the distance of its centre from*
                    b,
  the point 0.     Then the mutual induction-coefficient between
  the coil and the coin is (art. 699)
    ¦w^{ i + 3 4£jp£)d                + 6£!=i^l   (tf-i*) + &c.}.
  Now d we can make zero at once by taking the point 0 at the;
  middle of the coin, so that c is the distance from the mean cir-?
   cumference of the coil to the middle of the coin ; and there
   remain inside the brackets of the above expression 1 + terms,
   involving the square and higher powers of b : c, which is a
   small quantity.     Thus a very good approximation to the . hj-s
                                               ......
   ductron-coefficient between the primary and a small coin is
                              H>=  —z— .                          (43)
      Similarly the induction-coefficient between the secondary
  and the coin is the same expression with dashed letters ; hence"
                                                  ...
  the product

                       ^=^s(2^W)*.
   And this is  a maximum when cd is a minimum, a thing which
  is very easily represented geometrically.
      For let A and A' be points on the mean circumferences of
  the. coils from which c and d are measured; draw the system of
  lemniscates cd = various constants, and then draw through the
  system any straight line at a distance a from A and a' from A',

This line will represent the common axis of the two coils, and
points on it represent possible positions of the coin.    Now
the line cuts every lemniscate in four points: hence there are
four points on the axis at which the coin produces the same
disturbance. These can run together two and two at points
where the line is touched by the lemniscate; and these are the
maximum or minimum points.        They are maxima if the line
is touched on the side of A A', but minima if the line is
touched on the other side.
    Ifthe coils are the same size     e.    a = a'), and
                                             (i.       if they areif
at a proper distance apart- (viz. = 2a), all four points can run
together in the middle, which        therefore then a stationary
                                           a is
point, so that moving the coin little either way will produce
very little diference.   But if the coils are closer together than
this, two of the points of section become imaginary, and hence
there are now only two positions of the coin which give the
same noise      and these two can run together in the middle,
                 ;
which    is   now'    a   maximum.

   The term written by itself does not contain p except as an
exponential ; but it has a very great rate of variation depend

expression for the current is simply proportional to the con
ductivity, both as regards its own value and its rate of varia

what the loudness of the telephone-indication definitely depends

Hughes and by Mr Roberts, with the view of obtaining
quantitative readings from the balance.      The first consisted
in estimating the loudness   of the sound produced by the in
sertion of a coin, and then imitating it by an arrangement of
primary and secondary coils called the "sonometer" — a key
being used to transfer the connexions of the telephone quickly
from one instrument to the other.    Mr. Poynting has adapted
a formula from Maxwell which suffices to graduate the sono
meter when the secondary coil is some distance from either
primary (Phil. Mag. January), though it is rather an unwieldy
one.
   But there must always be some objection to readings
taken in this way, because of the difficulty of estimating
precisely when two sounds have the same strength — especi
ally  if,as appears probable from      18, they differ at all in

a tone mixed up with it which is shriller than any produced
by the sonometer.    (I do not know whether this has ever been
noticed experimentally.    One often notices a change of pitch
in the telephone-rustle ; but it appears to depend in some
cases on the direction of the current, L e. on whether it
strengthens or weakens the magnet.)
  If  the sonometer is to be used,                I
                                       would suggest that the
second primary coil be done away with, and that the secondary
coil be of small diameter.   It may have as much wire on it as
is wanted for long range; but the further it is away from
the primary, compared with its own diameter, the better. The
diameter of the primary does not much matter.         The in
duction would now simply vary as the inverse cube of the dis
tance from the mean circumference of the primary ; hence, if
the sonometer were graduated so as to give equal distances
from this line, its readings would only have to be turned
upside down and cubed to give comparative results.        both      If
primary and secondary coils are small, the sonometer-arm
may be graduated like an ordinary millimetre-scale.
  If  an absolute zero were wanted at any time, it might be
obtained by an arrangement for rotating one of the coils till
it was at right angles to the other.
   22. Prof. Hughes's second method of measuring, that of
the graduated zinc wedge, is a much better one, because it is
a null method and gives true readings, though they are not
easily interpretable.
                              I
   A third method has, believe, been tried, viz. a copper
damper rotating above one pair of coils ; and this seems also
                         I
pretty good ; but think it might possibly be better to modify
it by having a uniform disk (or ring) of high-conductivity
copper capable of being moved along the axis of one pair
of coils with its plane always parallel to theirs. The distance
of the disk from the middle point of the coils should be read,
and the distance apart of the coils should be constant.   Given
all particulars,     I
                   have no doubt that a mathematician could
readily interpret results so obtained.
   Another modification would be to use a coil of wire form
ing a circuit closed within itself instead of the copper disk.
It would have just about the same effect as a solid disk of the
same size ; but the data connected with it might be more
definite.

           thin piece of iron wire be held in the balance, it
powerfully disturbs it by a concentration of the lines of force
in the iron, so that M (the mutual induction between the

 iron were instantaneously magnetizable, one ought to be able
 to balance its effect by moving the other pair of coils a little
 nearer together, so as to make M zero again. But as the magne
 tization of iron always takes time, this is not completely pos
 sible, because, though M may be made zero at any one instant,
 it will not remain so during the period of variation of the cur
 rent. As regards pitch, the rustle produced by iron wire
 should agree with that produced by a shift of the coils, both
 being duller than that produced by a piece of copper.               Of
 course if a mass of iron be inserted, the effect will be compo
 site, secondary currents being induced in it which give rise
 to tertiary currents in the telephone-circuit.         But this effect
 is feeble as compared    with  the magnetic effect.
    In measuring the conductivity of a metal or of an electro
 lytic solution by means of the induction-balance, care must
be taken that it is not magnetic ; or erroneous results will be
 obtained. The conductivity effect and the magnetic effect will
 tend partially to destroy each other ; for though the effect of
a piece of copper cannot be completely balanced by introdu
 cing a scrap of iron into the same pair of coils, it can partially,
just as it might partially by shifting the coils (§ 18).
    It would be very interesting to observe an opposite effect
with a diamagnetic body — say a large bundle of thin bismuth
wires insulated from each other ; but it would not be easy to
make sure of the correctness of the observation.
 XVIII.     Examination of two new Amalgams, and a Specimen
    of Native Gold. By Walter Flight, D.Sc, of the Mineral
    Department of the British Museum*.
A SPECIMEN            of "native silver" from Kongsberg proved,
         on analysis, to be an amalgam, and, as it appears to me,
to be an amalgam new to science.             The composition of the
specimen in question was found to be : —
       Silver    .  .  75-900               ™»=0,0.

                                              100

amalgam, or a composition the converse of that of the amal-

 gam from Moschelladsberg, Ag Hg3.                      It is worth recording
 how firmly and tenaciously mercury is retained by silver in
 the molten state.       In one experiment, a fragment of the above
 amalgam    was   fused   in a glass tube and kept at a bright red
 heat for more than ten minutes.                   The bead of silver, when
 cold, was beaten flat, cut into strips, and again heated, when
 what proved to be almost an additional one per cent, of mer
 cury came off.
    Another specimen of supposed "native silver" from Kongs-
 berg was found to possess a somewhat different composition.
The analysis gave the following numbers : —
                                        I.              II.       Mean.

                   Silver                             =92-84

                                                       100-00
   This is an amalgam having the formula Agu Hg, and is new
to science.    These two amalgams are the only ones which                   I
have examined; and they both yield ratios which appear to in
dicate the existence of actual chemical compounds.

^PHE first volume of Professor Lunge's        exhaustive monograph on
     our leading chemical industry must be ranked with a well-known
work on metallurgy, of which, as metal-workers, we may be justly
proud.
   As Professor Lunge says in his Preface, the treatise is intended to
supply various wants, and appeals to various classes of readers,
and, we hope, careful studiers ; for in hardly any other text-book
or manufacturing treatise have we found such a mass of well-told
general information and accuracy of minutiae and detail as in this
work of Professor Lunge's, who also may be deservedly compli
mented on his vigorous style and use of an acquired language.
   In a brief and pithy introduction the Professor says " the manu
facture of sulphuric acid and alkali is the foundation of the whole
Chemical Industry of our time," a statement with which we fully
agree.
   The earlier chapters of the book treat on Oxides of Sulphur, on
Chemical and Physical Properties, Sulphuric Acid, and working
methods of analysis, passing to a long chapter on raw materials of
manufacture, well supplied with Tables and illustrations.
   But it is the portion of the work treating on the production of
Sulphurous Acid from Pyrites, the recovery of Nitrogen com
pounds, and concentration of Sulphuric Acid, which will be more
especially valuable to manufacturers and practical men — very
large and carefully executed drawings of plant and apparatus, mostly
to scale, and working formulae being very plentiful.
   Under " The Denitration of A'itriol " the G-lover tower is fully de
scribed, and its drawbacks and merits somewhat more exhaustively
discussed than is perhaps now necessary.
   Under " By-products of Manufacture " we are pleased to see
that, in addition to Silver, the recovery of Selenium and Thallium,
and various processes for the making of fuming acid, receive a good
share of attention.
   In the presence of so much correct and useful matter in this first
volume, from which errors of all kinds seem to have been most
thoroughly sifted, we wonder what the second may contain ; but
we can safely prophesy the same success that cannot fail to attend
the present one.

    et seq.   Vienna, 1879.
    This memoir divides itself into : — 1. A study of the relations of
the granite and schists ; 2. A discrimination of the various local
kinds of granite, as being necessary for a knowledge of the nature
and origin of the granitic masses — with both earlier descriptions of
the several granites and the author's own researches ; 3. The his
tory of the most important tin-bearing rocks and tin-works of the
district.     These chapters are illustrated with several woodcuts,
among which is a plan of the country between Carlsbad, Ebenstock,
and Schwarzenberg.           The literature relating to the subjects above
mentioned is fully indicated in each division.
      As to the origin and subsequent conditions of such granite-
systems as these of North-western Bohemia, the author considers
that, in deep water, the erupted rock-material issued from a series
 of parallel fissures, and generally became crystalline on account of
the pressure.        These eruptive masses formed themselves into one
 great whole.       The   fissures were enlarged, and gave out more and
 more eruptions,      which   formed broadly obtuse cones ; and these have
 their    main  axis   coincident    with the strike of the fissures.   Fine
 grained     mud-like   laminae   also  were intercalated on the sides of the
 cones among the erupted matter.             Here and there the consolidated
 crust burst, and the still liquid rock below was injected into the
 new fissures, thus giving rise to apophyses, which vary in appear
 ance from fine-grained rock below to veins of segregation above.
 Ultimately the whole was covered with tuff and deep-sea mud.
      The massif thus formed, having become dry land in course of
 time, was subjected to erosion.            The soft shaly coating was gra
  dually removed; and the upper crust of the ejected rock-mass was
  then worn away, until the cone-like injections appeared.             Lastly
  the granitic mass, having been furrowed throughout, was finally
  removed, leaving a system of granite veins, more or less linear and
  concentric, in the old schists.

       pp. 464 et seq.    Vienna, 1879.
       The relation of the North-Bohemian series of volcanos to the
   Erzgebirge is indicated; and then the concentric, onion-like, and
  bulbous arrangement of the phonolitic material in the Schlossberg
   of Teplitz, previously noticed by Reuss, is dwelt upon. The vol
   cano of Priesen is especially described and illustrated, as belonging

150                      Geological Society:—
to the same kind of concentrically laminated mass, formed by the
successive ejection of mass within mass of tough or viscid molten
felspathic rock from a central vent below.
    Eeyer notices its radiating veins or dykes, their nature and direc
tion as shown by the vesicles in the magma having been dragged
out by the stream or current, also its central tuff basin as the
relic of the crater, the groin-like ridges radiating from the tuff
centre, and the radiating lines of erosion on the surface.
     He also points out that the two most simple of the typical
kinds of volcanos are : — 1. The tuff cone ; 2. The effused or efflu-
vial volcanic hill (Quellkuppe), more or less dome-like.         In the
first case a highly hydrous magma, issuing from a fissure, and
resolving itself into dust, has assumed the well-known conical
form.     In the other case a magma with less water in it has welled
out, and, according to its consistency, and the levelness or slope of
the ground, has either formed itself into a dome-like and bulbous
hill, or has spread over the surface as a stream.
    These types, however, are rarely met with in the simple form ;
most volcanos have something of each kind.            The Kammerbiihl,
near Egra, is one of the least complicated instances of the associa
tion of the two types.     Dana and Von Seebach divide volcanos into
Ejection-volcanos and Tuff-volcanos, with reason.
   The type represented by the Kammerbuhl may be theoretically
varied in several ways : — 1. Had the eruptive fissure on which the
Lesser Kammerbiihl stands been larger, repeated eruptions would
have taken place, giving rise to a larger isolated volcano, with a
central tuff-cone, radiating veins, and peripheral streams.     2. Had
the fissure reached the surface at more than one point, a volcanic
series would have resulted.        3. Had the points of eruption been
very near one another, they would have given rise to a volcanic
ridge (a series united by fusion, or an elongated cone).     The Bohe
mian forms of volcanos can be readily ranked under the above-
mentioned types.       As to their local distribution, M. Jokely men
tions one case of serial arrangement along a line striking N.E.
Most probably there are more than one linear series of fissures (as
in other countries), and these all parallel to the Erzgebirge.

THE1.     " On the Portland Eocks of England."         By the Eev. J. F.
Blake, M.A., P.G.8.
    The author gave a general account of the relation of the several
Portland rocks in the areas of their development to each other, and

                  On the   Portland Rocks of England.                  151
hence deduced the      history of the Portland " episode."     The name is
used on the continent in a wider sense than in England ; and this
use was shown to be unjustifiable.         After giving an account of his
observations on the rocks at Portland itself, and dividing the lime
stones into the building-stone and flinty series, the author showed
                                              " of
that the so-called " Upper Portlandian             Boulogne corresponds to
the latter, and the upper part of the "Middle Portlandian" to the
Portland Sand. He then endeavoured to prove by the proportionate
thickness, the indications of change in the lithology, and the distri
bution of some of the fossils, that the rest of the so-called "Middle"
                                   " are
and the " Lower Portlandian              represented by integral portions
of the Upper Kimmeridge, which are thus the " normal form cor
                                                                "
responding to what the author calls the             " Boulognian episode."
The series in the Vale of Wardour has been made out pretty com
pletely. The Purbeck is separated by a band of clay from the
Portland, and is not amalgamated with it. The building-stones
 and flinty series are here seen again ; and a fine freestone occurs at
the base of the latter. The representatives of the Portland Sand
 were considered to be older than those of other districts.
     The relations of the Purbeck to the Portland rocks at Swindon were
 very carefully traced ; and it was shown that, while the upper beds of
 the latter put on here some peculiar characters, the former lie on
 their worn edges. The upper beds of the Portland, which have
 been referred to the sand, correspond to the freestone and the base
 of the flinty series of the Vale of Wardour ; hence the Purbecks of
 Swindon may be coeval with the upper beds of the Portland to the
 south.     At the base of the great quarry and elsewhere in the
 neighbourhood are the " Trigonia-beds ;
                                                 " beneath which is
                                                                      clay,
 hitherto mistaken for the Kimmeridge Clay ; and beneath this are
 the true Portland Sands, with an abundant fauna new to England.
 The limestones of Oxfordshire and Bucks were considered to repre
  sent the " Trigonia-beia
                               " only ; and as the Purbecks here lie for
  the most part conformably, it was suggested that they were formed in
  a lake at an earlier period than those at Swindon, which are of a
  more fluviatile character.
     Hence the Portland episode, considered as marine, was at an end
  in the north before it was half completed in the south.
     2. " On the Correlation of the Drift-deposits of the N.W. of
  England with those of the Midland and Eastern Counties."               By
  D. Mackintosh, Esq., F.G.S.
      The object of the author was not to dogmatize, but to present the
  subject in a concise form so as to stimulate to further research.
  His scheme of correlation was founded on the horizontal continuity
  of the deposits and their included erratics. He gave an account of
  his discovery of the continuous extension of the upper Boulder-
  clay of Cheshire, above a great thickness of sand and gravel, as far
   as Berrington, south of Shrewsbury, and its appearance at intervals
   along the Severn valley to below Worcester, where it was probably
   represented by a bed with Malvern-hill boulders above shelly sand and

gravel. Ho traced the great boulder-bearing clay and gravel around
Wolverhampton eastward through Central England, to where it
graduated    into the chalky clay of Lincolnshire ; and laid great
stress on the commingling, at Wolverhampton, in this deposit, of
erratics (chiefly granite and felstone) from the north with erratics
(chiefly chalk-flints and gryphites) from the east. He described the
clay and sand around Gainsborough, Eetford, &c.          He correlated
the " carrion," or lower Boulder-clay of the Vale of York (con
taining Carboniferous, Jurassic, and granitic erratics), with the lower
yellowish-brown clay of the Aire and Wbarfe valleys and the plain
of Craven. He likewise correlated patches of upper clay in the
latter areas with the upper Boulder-clay of the Lancashire plain,
but was not certain that they were of Hessle age. The solution of
the main question depended chiefly on the relative age of the
Wolverhampton and Stafford clay-and-gravel, which he was dis
posed to regard as the equivalent of the lower brown Boulder-clay
of the N.W. and likewise of the chalky clay of Lincolnshire.   He con
cluded by considering facts which might be regarded as opposed to
this view, and by giving his reasons for regarding the paleconto-

Volcano."      By Frank Eutley, Esq., F.G.S.
    Among the ashy beds of this district are certain amygdaloidal
schistose rocks, which the author is of opinion are really lava-flows,
 which have probably been crushed or infiltrated, and have so as
sumed a foliated structure owing to pressure from superincumbent
 beds acting on rocks thus constituted.    They are much altered, but
were probably once basalts.     The author considered it very probable
 that these schistose beds and Brent Tor, considered to be of Car
 boniferous age, are identical with beds near Tavistock and in the
 Saltash district, which are of Upper Devonian age.
    In the concluding part of the paper the author described the beds
 of alternating ashes and lava, now much disturbed by faults, which
 constitute all that remains of the ancient Brent-Tor Volcano, and
 endeavoured, from the evidence which can be thus obtained, to give
 a probable reconstruction of the former cone.

                      ON MAGNETS.         BY 0. A. S. PIHL*.
TTEE author, in his comprehensive treatise, seeks to trace the at-
 -*-
       traction of armature and magnet to the distribution of the mag
netism in the two. He first describes his multifarious and careful
experiments on the distribution of the magnetic moments in a
straight magnet when both poles are free or when iron rods are
placed at the ends, or an iron rod laid between two like or unlike
poles of magnets, and likewise in these iron rods and in one with
its extremities placed between the arms of a horse-shoe magnet.
The determinations were made by means of induction-spirals after
the method of van Bees.             In like manner were the attractions of
the magnets for their armatures at various distances determined by
forcible separation. It would carry us too far to specify the parti
cular results, which, for the first determinations, fall in with those
obtained by Erman, van Eees, "Weihrich, and others, as they also
are to be deduced from the putting into position of the molecular
magnets (gradually becoming feebler from the operating force on
wards).       Beside the graphically represented distribution of the
moments, the above-sketched distributions of the free magnetisms
are deduced.
     Accordingly, if we imagine the magnets and armatures made up
of slices which contain each the calculated amount of free magne
tism, we can calculate the attraction exerted by each slice of the
magnet upon each slice of the armature in juxtaposition with it,
assuming that it is distributed uniformly over the slices.             The sum
of all the attractions should give the attraction of magnet and arma
ture. The calculated and the observed values, however, are not at
all equal : if the armature be brought nearer to the magnet, the
ratio of the observed to the calculated attraction diminishes, until
at a distance of about
                              J- of the radius it reaches its minimum and
then with lessening distances increases.                The deviation, at all
events, lies in the well-known more copious distribution of free
magnetism at the places more remote from the axis of the magnet-
slices, which can be observed by removing them by corrosion &c,
but cannot be accurately determined, since herewith the distribution
changes.       On the approximately true assumption that one portion
of the magnetism is distributed uniformly over the cross section,
another only on the periphery of the slices, at greater distances
results are obtained agreeing better with the observations.
     If the diameters of armature and magnet are unequal, the attrac
tion becomes different, and, correspondingly, the magnetisms distri
buted in it are otherwise arranged, and of another amount, than
with an armature of equal thickness, as the curves constructed by
the author show.
     On placing two permanent steel magnets in juxtaposition the
distributian in the two is likewise altered ; only the direct action is

ON THE THERMAL ABSORBENT AND EMISSIVE POWERS OF FLAMES,
   AND ON THE TEMPERATURE OF THE VOLTAIC ARC.                EXTRACT
   OF A LETTER FROM FR. ROSETTI TO A. CORNU.
   Conclusions. — 1. The transparency of flames is very great ; conse
quently flames absorb very little of the thermal radiation which
traverses them.        If
                      the radiation proceeds from a flame of the same
nature, and if the flame through which it passes has a thickness of
1 centimetre, the coefficients   of transparency and absorption are
represented by the numbers 0-865 and 0*135 respectively, for the
white flames produced by illuminating-gas, as well as for the pale
blue flames of Bunsen burners.
   2. The transparency diminishes and the absorption increases
proportionally, if the thickness of the flames is augmented.       theIf
flame has an infinite thickness, it is athermanous ; that is to say, it
absorbs all the heat-rays proceeding from a flame of the same
nature : the transparency is nil, the absorption equal to unity.
But these limits are nearly reached with finite and not very great
thicknesses ; 1 metre thickness is sufficient to render a flame almost
completely athermanous to rays coming from another flame of the
same nature.

   3. The formula y=a — —           very well represents the intensity
                                 j   ^
of the thermal radiation emitted by flames of any thickness e what
ever, the transparency-coefficient being Jc =0-865, the thickness e
being expressed in centimetres, and a being a constant the value of
which depends on the nature of the flame.
   4. The absolute thermal emissive power of the white flames pro
duced by illuminating-gas (that is to say, the intensity of the radia
tion from such a flame possessing an infinite thickness, compared
with the intensity of the radiation emitted by lampblack at a tem
perature equal to the mean temperature of the flame) is equal to
unity.
   The absolute thermal emissive power of the pale blue flames pro
duced by Bunsen burners is represented by the fraction 0-3219 ;
that  is,    nearly one third of the emissive power of the white gas-

                                                      a
ness can be obtained by multiplying the ratio between the intensity
of its radiation and the maximum intensity (the intensity of the ra
diation from the same flame    its thickness were infinite)

     6. The electric light includes, as is known, two sorts of radiations
 — viz. the rays emitted by the incandescent carbons, and those
 emitted by the voltaic arc which springs between the polar extremi
 ties of the carbons.      The former give a white, the others a purple-
 blue light ; the resulting light is bluish white.
     7. The two polar extremities have temperatures very different
 the one from the other.       The number of degrees which expresses
 their temperature can be deduced from the formula
                          2/=mT2(T-0)-n(T-0),
 supposing that the carbons have the maximum emissive power.
     8. The voltaic arc has very little thermal emissive power, com
 parable to that of the pale blue flames of Bunsen burners.      Its tem
 perature can also be obtained with the aid of the preceding formula,
 provided that the value of the thermal emissive power of the voltaic
 arc relative to its thickness be introduced.
     9. A great number of experiments have given the maximum tem
 perature of about 3900° C. for the positive, the temperature of
about 3150° for the negative polar extremity of the carbon. For
 the voltaic arc which springs between these two extremities the
 temperature was always about 4800°, whatever the thickness of the
 arc and the intensity of the current. — Comptes Rendus de VAcademie

            ON SOME NEW LUMINOUS TUBES.            BY M. TREVE.
    If the induced current of a Euhmkorff coil is passed into a
 Fizeau's condenser, the vibratory motion of the coil is returned,
amplified, by the condenser in the form of a well-known kind of
 humming sound. If pressure, at first slight, and then gradually
increasing, be exerted upon the condenser, the humming succes
sively diminishes in intensity and at last dies away altogether.
    The cessation of the sound will be coincident with a pressure
capable of expelling from the condenser the air which was interposed
in the intervals between its tinfoil sheets. The condenser is then
as in a vacuum ; and no sound can issue from it.        This observation
led me to make the following experiment.
                                  I
    Into a large Geissler tube introduce a Fizeau's condenser. The
two poles of the induced current of the Euhmkorff end at the con
denser through the intermediation of the ordinary electrodes of this
kind of tubes, which, fused into the glass, are fixed to the eleventh
and twelfth sheets of tinfoil*.
    When the induced current passes into the condenser, the tube
still containing air at the atmospheric pressure, the usual humming
is heard.     If vacuum be gradually produced in the tube, the hum-

by MM. Alvergniat.

ming grows more and more feeble.          At last, if air be withdrawn
until only a pressure of 3 or 4 millims. is left in the tube, the ear
can no longer perceive any thing; but a brilliant white light ap
pears, springing in the form of beads from the tinfoil of the con
denser, and absolutely distinct from the pale and indistinct phos
phorescent light of Geissler tubes. — Comptes Bendits de V Academic

           on Thomson's galvanometer, by a. gaiffe.
   When electric currents are measured with the aid of Thomson's
reflecting galvanometer, the indications read on its graduated scale
are found not to be proportional to the values of the currents mea
sured, and to be exaggerated in proportion as those values increase.
   This cause of error arises from the fact that the angles of deflec
tion of the magnetized needle are doubled by the reflection of the
mirror, and consequently it is not the tangents of the real angles of
deflection that one reads on the scale, but the tangents of the
doubled angles.       If it can be assumed without inconvenience that
the tangent of the double of a very small angle is twice that of the
simple angle, the case is not the same for large angles ; and although
the deflections of the needles of this class of apparatus are limited,
with the aid either of a directing magnet or of derivations, to about
8°, the indications are already sensibly exaggerated at the extremi
ties of the scale which the 8° include.
    I essayed to remedy this defect by substituting a very fine plati
num wire (xo§o" iQ diameter) for the untwisted thread of silk by
which the system of needles of the galvanometer are suspended;
but the want of proportionality was produced in the opposite sense,
and was more considerable.
    1 then had recourse to a bifilar suspension composed of two
cocoon-threads very close to one another. The results were almost
completely satisfactory.       By this second means the errors are not
entirely corrected ; but they are reduced to less than one hundredth
 of the value measured.
    The verification-experiments were made, using the whole extent
 of the graduated scale, with the aid of three condensers charged
from one and the same constant source of electricity.          The con
 densers were first charged and measured separately, and afterwards
 charged and measured in combination. — Comptes Rendus de VAca

XXII.      Measurements and Law in Electro-optics.           By John
    Kerb, LL.D., Mathematical Lecturer, Free Church Train
    ing College, Glasgow*.
MY         last communication to the Philosophical Magazine
         contains an account of some electro-optic measurements
in connexion with carbon disulphide, cumol, carbon dichloride,
and several other liquid dielectrics. That set of measurements
was very imperfect, and of little interest except as a first trial.
In the leisure of my last summer holidays          I  resumed the in
quiry    with  better means,  and  carried it forward  for some weeks
with great care.       I  had intended to examine several dielec
trics in succession, but found time only for the first of them,
which was carbon disulphide. These new experiments form
the subject of the following paper.
     1. The dioptric actions of dielectrics are generally of one
kind — pure double refractions with reference to line of electric
force as axis ; but they vary largely in intensity, and vary
even in sign, from one dielectric to another.             Dielectrified
bodies are therefore optically equivalent to uniaxal crystals,
 and exhibit like variations, both from strong to weak, and
 from positive to negative.       Our present dielectric (carbon di
sulphide) is of the positive class ; and in regard to strength, it
 holds, as yet, a place among dielectrics like that of Iceland
 spar among crystals.        For the particular facts and the proofs
 I  must refer to my papers already publishedf.
    I  consider it probable in the highest degree that these optical

as of the other, in dielectrics as in crystals. venture there     I
fore to accept the principal result of my present experiments
as a general law, and to enunciate accordingly, although the
actual measurements were limited to one dielectric.

resultant electric force.
   2.  To prepare the way for an account of the experiments,                   I
must begin with a description of the cell which contains the
dielectric. The cell-block         composed of three thick slabs of
                                     is
plate-glass, which stand on the experimental table, with their
plate-faces vertical and in close contact.

   The diagram gives an end view of the block. The two                         di
mensions exhibited in the diagram are about 10 and          inches;    6
the third dimension of the block, or joint thickness of the
slabs,  isexactly 3]^ inches.      The inner rectangle in the dia
gram represents         atunnel,  which  passes pretty uniformly
through    the  block, leaving   wide  margins of polished surface
on all the faces of the slabs.      As in the case of the old plate
cell, the tunnel      closed by two panes of thin and carefully
                       is
selected plate glass, which lie in contact with the ends of the
block. Outside of the panes are two thick plates of india-
rubber cloth and outside of the cloths are two strong planks
               ;
of mahogany, which are a little wider horizontally than the
slabs of glass.    The planks are connected by        strong screw-
                                                                  a

   When the cell is charged with carbon disulphide, and well
closed by screw-pressure on the planks, it is almost perfectly-
tight, the trifling leakage being due to a flaw in the workman
ship. The 4-inch plate of powerfully refractive and dispersive
liquid thus obtained is perfectly transparent ; and a beam of
light, incident normally on either of the limiting panes, passes
through the plate without sensible traces of dispersion, devia
tion, or depolarization. The absence of all cement in the con
struction of the cell      is,
                           I  think,   amost important condition.
The liquid   is  in contact with nothing more than compact
masses of metal and the glass walls of the cell     ;  and accord
ingly, with fair start,
            a                  may be kept sufficiently clean for
                                 it
any length of time.
    The shaded pieces in the diagram represent the two con
ductors. The lower conductor           a thick plate of solid brass,
                                       is
which rests on the floor of the cell.     The upper is  also a plate
of solid brass, of the same length and thickness as the lower,
but much narrower      :   it supported by
                                 is          a small rafter of thin
 plate glass at each end, rafter and conductor being connected
by a bullet-headed screw, which passes freely through         a fine
 hole drilled in the rafter, and works deeply into the conductor.
 Each of the rafters rests on the two trapezoidal pieces shown
 in the diagram. These are prisms of glass taken out of one
 thick plate, the horizontal surfaces (upper and lower) being
 primitive plate-faces kept intact. These lateral supports rest
 simply on the brass floor, and extend from front to back of
the cell.
   The opposed faces of the two conductors are perfectly flat
and smooth, just as they left the planing-machine       they are
                                                          :
also sensibly parallel, and generally distant from each other
about one twelfth of an inch. All edges and corners on the
upper conductor have been carefully rounded away, as well as
the two adjacent edges on the lower conductor.       The length
of the conductors (at right angles to the plane of the diagram)
is such as to leave the brass barely short of contact with the
limiting panes.
  The dotted lines in the diagram represent three borings in
the central slab. The vertical boring admits         glass tube,

small cavity made in the upper conductor, and terminating
outwards in a perforated knob and connecting-screw. The
smaller boring on the right gives passage to a wire from the
lower conductor; the larger boring on the left          used for
                                                         is

      Working     the Cell. — The slabs, the closing-panes, and

 loO               Dr. J.  Kerr on Measurements
all the pieces that lie within the cell are cleaned with the
greatest care.   The lower conductor is inserted in the central
slab, and has its connecting-wire drawn up through the proper
boring; and the cell-block is completed by the addition of the
outer slabs. The lateral supports of glass are then put in
position, also the upper conductor and the external knob con
 nected with it.   The conductors are adjusted stably, with their
 opposed faces exactly parallel.     All the pieces are now cleared
 of dust as thoroughly as possible, and the cell is closed.
    The liquid is introduced rapidly into the large boring,
 through filtering-paper and funnel properly placed.        To pre
vent   the formation of   air-bubbles  between  the  two conductors
 during the charging of the cell, it is necessary to have the
 plane faces of the conductors inclined a little to the horizon ;
 and this is done by the temporary insertion of a thin slip of
 wood under one end of the cell-block.       The charging is con
 tinued until the liquid stands well above the balls of the upper
 conductor; but the cell is never quite filled, as that might
 result in a very inconvenient explosion. When the borings
 are now stoppered and the cell firmly closed by screw-pres
 sure, there is very little loss of the liquid by evaporation and
 leakage.
    Sometimes, in spite of all precautions, the liquid is found to
 be not sufficiently clean, a quantity of solid particles gathering
 in chains between the electrified conductors, and masking the
optical effect in some degree, or even discharging the upper
 conductor at comparatively low potentials.         In such a case
the charge is drawn off (as much of it as is possible) by the
 siphon; the cell is opened, and the faces of the conductors are
swept clear of dust, which is done well by friction with narrow
 slips of clean writing-paper.        The cell is then closed and
 charged   anew.
    These operations in preparation for experiment are some
times very troublesome and tedious, a great deal more so than
in the case of the old plate cell. Partly on this account, and
partly because of the troublesome and expensive character of
the workmanship,     I  consider the present cell very imperfect;
but these and other faults are forgotten in the presence of the
following phenomena.
    4. Electro-optic Experiment in Chromatic Polarization. —
 Here, as in all the following experiments, the cell is charged
with rather less than a pint of clean carbon disulphide. No
other optical pieces are employed at present than the charged
cell and a couple of Nicol's prisms.
    A beam of light from a bright cloud is reflected horizontally
into the room through a port in the window-shutter, passes

                    and  Law in Electro-optic-".               161
through the first Nicol, then perpendicularly through the plate
of liquid, then through the ocular Nicol. The pieces are so
levelled and directed, that the observer at the polariscope
looks fairly through the deep slit that separates the two con
ductors in the cell.    I may mention again that the dimensions
of the slit are about one twelfth of an inch, one inch, and four
inches — the first dimension lying vertically as the lines of
force, and the last lying horizontally along the line of sight.
The two Nicols are fixed, the first with its principal section at
45° to the vertical, and the second at extinction, which is here
quite pure. Wires are led permanently from the two conduc
tors — from the lower to earth, and from the external knob of the
upper to the prime conductor. To give greater steadiness and
distinctness to the progress of the optical effect, the wire from
prime conductor to cell is put in permanent contact with the
knob of a Leyden jar, whose outer coating is uninsulated.
   When the machine is set in motion at a moderate rate, the
potential of the upper conductor rises slowly, and the black
space between the two conductors is illuminated, the light
passing gradually through impure black, faintly bluish grey,
faint white, and so forward, up to a sensibly pure and brilliant
white. Thus far there is nothing new, except that the highest
potential yet reached is comparatively low, while the optical
effect is very large, and already far beyond neutralization by
the action of any hand compensator of strained glass.
   As the potential of the prime conductor still rises, the pola
riscope gives a fine progression of chromatic effects, which
descend regularly and continuously through a certain range of
Newton's scale. The luminous band between the conductors
passes first from white to a bright straw-colour, which deepens
gradually to a rich yellow, then passes through orange to a
deep brown, then to a pure and dense red, then to purple
and very deep violet, then to a rich and full blue, then to
green.    All the colours are beautifully dense and pure, cer
                             I
tainly as fine as any that have ever seen in experiments with
crystals in the polariscope.
   Generally about the point last named of the scale of colours,
at or near the green of the second order, the process termi
nates in spark-discharge through the liquid.      Sometimes, but
not frequently in my observations, it terminates at an earlier
stage, to run its regular course at the next trial.   The irregu
larity appears to be due to an accidental precipitation of dis
charge by the action of solid particles, impurities in the liquid.
   Through this whole range of effect, from the pale blue or
impure black of the first order to the green of the second
order, the plate of electrically-charged liquid acts regularly as

162                Dr. J.  Kerr   on Measurements
a uniaxal crystal, as a plate of quartz with optic axis parallel
to the lines of force, the plate increasing in thickness continu
ously and very rapidly as the potential rises.
   I   may mention here, that with the old plate cell, under
favourable conditions,    I obtain one step of the scale of colours,
that from white to yellow, but not easily nor very distinctly.
   5. By simple observation        in connexion with this experi
ment, the electro-optic     field  is seen to be sensibly uniform
through the greater part of the space between the two con
ductors, and for potentials high or low.
    Beginning at very low potentials, for which the optical
effect lies below intense white, and applying a hand compen
sator of glass,  I obtain, as the first effect of stress in the glass
against electric force in the liquid, a couple of extinction-
bands in the outer borders of the field, just as in my old expe
riments with the plate cell. As the stress of the glass, hori
zontal tension or vertical compression, is increased, the bands
move inwards, till at last, as they pass through the borders of
the field, and enter the space between the parallel faces of the
conductors, they widen inwards and meet each other, coales
cing in one wide and uniformly black band.
   At higher potentials, and using only the two Nicols, ob       I
tain equally distinct results.      Thus, at one stage of the expe
riment the band of light between the two conductors is of a
deep red, and sensibly uniform from end to end ; but at each
end, in the borders of the field, where the upper conductor is
rounded off, the band is tipped with a narrow fringe of bril
liant yellow. Similarly, another stage of the experiment
gives a violet or blue band, sensibly of the same tint from end
almost to end, and tipped at each end with a narrow fringe of
dense red.
    As an important practical effect of the characteristics of the
new electro-optic field, its intensity and uniformity,        I   have
been able to discard the old and imperfect compensator of
strained glass.    One such compensator that had been elabo
rately prepared was found quite inadequate, the action of a
fine slip of glass (not an inch wide), under a compressing
weight of 50 pounds, being neutralized and far exceeded by
the action of the plate of CS2 at low potentials.
    6.  Rate of Disappearance or Degradation of      the optical effect
 after  the stoppage   of the machine. — Some observations       were
 made upon this subject at different times ; and the results are
 worthy of brief notice in passing.      The arrangements were the
 same as in the preceding experiment.
    The light is restored from extinction up to one of the tints ;
and the effect is kept pretty constant for several seconds.

                      and Law in Electro-optics.                 163
When the machine is stopped suddenly, the tints disappear at
once and the optical effect falls very rapidly to faint white.
The subsequent rate of degradation, through faint white to
pure extinction, varies very much with circumstances.             In
damp weather the light disappears in one or two seconds, or
less ; but on several occasions, the weather being favourable,
and the external conductors very well insulated,     I have seen the
light sustained clearly for five and even for six minutes. This
continuously sustained effect was certainly due to the present
action of electric force at each instant ; for it disappeared
sharply and totally at the instant of spark-discharge of the
prime conductor, and then, a few seconds after the spark, it
was restored quite distinctly by the action of the residual
charge of the jar.
   The Leyden jar is now withdrawn, and the prime conductor
is connected simply by a wire with the upper conductor in the
cell, the procedure and circumstances of the observation being
otherwise unaltered.      There is nothing new observed in this
case, except    a more  rapid rate of degradation of the optical
effect.    In favourable circumstances     I  have seen the effect
still sustained clearly for a good many seconds — 40 to 60.
   The permanent wire from cell to prime conductor is now
detached from the cell, and its extremity is fixed in a small
ball of brass, which is held by an insulating handle of glass.
The polariscope being at extinction, and the machine in mo
tion, the ball connected with the prime conductor is brought
up towards the knob of the upper conductor in the cell, till
one small spark passes. At the instant of the spark there is
a strong restoration in the polariscope.         The effect degrades
at first very rapidly like a flash, but afterwards more slowly,
so that it is still seen distinctly, though at last very faintly,
for 12 or 15 seconds. And here, as in the former cases, the
sustained effect is certainly due to the present action of electric
force at each instant ; for it vanishes instantaneously when the
knob of the upper conductor is touched by the finger.
   There are several points proved or illustrated by these ob
servations : — that the birefringent action of the liquid is due to
electrostatic force, and not to electric discharge in any form ;
that the dissipation of the charge of electricity in damp
weather is principally from the external parts of the appa
ratus, as was to be expected; that within the cell there is
always a sensible discharge of electricity as long as the two
conductors are at different potentials ; and that the rate of this
discharge or dissipation through the liquid is very great at high
 tensions.    I  proceed now to the measurements.
    7. Instruments of Measurement. — To measure potential and

                                use a Thomson's Long-Range
Electrometer and a Jamin's Compensator.         These admirable
instruments are now so widely known that any description of
them here would be superfluous.      Besides, they are described
fully by the  inventors themselves in books which are generally
accessible*.
   8. Arrangements   and Method. — The diagram shows all the
optical pieces, in horizontal section through the observer's
eye, Q.    Several of the pieces are placed exactly as in the first
experiment (4). These are : — the reflector, B, in the window-

                                                   comes the compen

central parts  of the  electro-optic field.    After the compensator
comes     convergent lens D, which           fixed by trial in such

black band and reference-wires in the compensator.                Some
changes   were  made    afterwards   in  the   optical arrangements       ;
but Twill describe these in the proper place.
   Two wires are led permanently from the conductors within
the cell — from the lower to earth, and from the upper to prime
conductor.    Wires are also led permanently from prime con
ductor to inductric or upper plate of the electrometer, and to
the inner coating of a good Leyden jar whose outer coating               is
connected permanently with earth.
   The index of the compensator being at the zero-point, the
observer at   Q sees   astrong black band exactly midway between
the two parallel reference-wires.       When the machine        isset in

motion, the band is displaced slowly (here to the right), and
can be driven easily out of the field of the instrument.
   Each measurement requires the conjoint and repeated action
of two observers — one at the electrometer, the other at the
second Nicol.     The lower plate of the electrometer is fixed at
a chosen point of the scale ; and the screw of the compensator
is worked so as to displace the black band some distance to the
left. When the machine is set in motion, the potential of the
prime conductor rises slowly, and the observer at the electro
meter gives a continued set of sharp audible signals, which
are intended partly to inform the observer at the polariscope,
and partly to guide the worker at the machine, whose task is
to keep the index of the electrometer as steadily as possible in
or near the sighted position. The present relation of actual
to chosen potential, whether of defect, or equality, or excess,
is indicated incessantly by the signals.
   Meanwhile the observer at the polariscope has a distinct
view of the black band, and sees whether it is midway between
the wires, or to the right or left, at the time of the critical
signal. The screw of the compensator is now worked in the
proper direction, and the observation is repeated.     The screw
is again worked and the observation again repeated, and so for
ward, until at last the black band lies exactly midway between
the reference-wires when the index of the electrometer is in
the sighted position — that     when the potential of the upper
                              is,
conductor has the    value indicated on the scale of the electro
meter.    Two other observations are always made at the same
time, and the results recorded —one giving a superior limit of
the optical effect at the chosen potential, and the other an in
ferior limit and the two limits are always drawn as close as
            ;
possible.
  9.   Preliminary Work. — In mastering this method,      as also
in applying     it
                 afterwards, I was able to keep the manipula
tions, readings, and records all in my own hands; but for the
observationsI    had to depend partly on my two assistants.
The preliminary drill was found useful in respects not at first
contemplated;   for in the course of     it
                                          I  discovered several
sources of error, and saw how to avoid them       I
                                                  :   found also
that, when proper care was taken, the observer's error with
the compensator could be certainly limited within     a  definite
and small range of the scale.
   After more than    aweek of incessant exercise of myself and
assistants in this way in the practical management of the
instruments and method,     I  felt confident that good results
could be obtained in one day's work at least — one mounting of
the cell, and one setting of all the optical pieces, to be kept

166                 Dr.   J. Kerr on Measurements
unmoved from morning till night.            I  determined therefore to
make a new start, and to devote one day to a small number
of independent and very careful measurements, through a
pretty long range of potential.
    10. First Appearance of the Law. — Accordingly on one day,
Tuesday, the 12th of August,          I effected eight measurements
of potential and corresponding optical effect. Every precau
tion was adopted, every check and test that            I could think of
as likely to be of use.      All the pieces were placed and fixed
with scrupulous care. No guidance towards the results was
accepted in any case, except from the actual indications of the
instruments. The limits of error were drawn always as close
to each other as possible ; and every observation made by an
assistant at either of the instruments was repeated and verified
by myself before the result was recorded.            The work was very
tedious, some of the single measurements taking more than an
hour of time ; but the results were understood to be propor
tionately sure.
    When the day's work was done and the laboratory closed,
I  collected the results, and reduced the readings of the com
pensator, subtracting the scale-reading of the true zero-point,
and expressing the remainders in terms of a convenient unit,
which was the twentieth part of one screw-step of the instru
ment*. The final results were as follows. The numbers in
the first line are the scale-readings of the electrometer, or the
potentials of the upper conductor ; and those in the second
line are the corresponding quantities of optical effect, each
probably true to ±1.
    30      40      50        60       80       90      100      110
    12£     22      36        50       88     115       144      170
    Observe   the effects corresponding to potentials        30 and 60,
exactly   as 1 to 4 ; the effects    again for potentials 40 and 80 ;
those also for potentials 50 and 100.          It was from these num
bers, exactly as they stand, that        I obtained my first view of
        I
what was looking for — a definite relation between potential
and optical effect.      It will be apparent immediately, that the
exactness of equality of those three ratios to each other and to
J  is partly accidental ; but we shall see no reason to question
the truth of the law that is here so very clearly indicated.
    11. It appears therefore that, in the circumstances of the
present experiments, the dielectric (CS2) being given, and the
electro-optic field also given in form and dimensions, the
quantity of optical effect is proportional to the square of the
difference of potentials of the two conductors that limit the field.
   *
     The unit of potential, here and afterwards, is one screw-step of the
electrometer, the 200th part of the range of the instrument.

                     and Law in Electro-opties.                 167
     12. Dividing the square of each of the preceding potentials
by the corresponding optical effect, and keeping the quotients
true to half a unit by excess or defect, we find the eight num
bers
     72      73     69i      72      73      70£     69£       71.
There is here a very fair approximation to equality, though
it is hardly so close as might have been expected.
     13. Later Measurements. — In the next three sets of mea
surements the work was still of the same empirical and tedious
kind as formerly (8, 9, 10).       The weather was exceptionally
 favourable both for electrical and optical work; and the range
 of potential in the second set was almost as large as the in
 struments could reach in any circumstances.
                           I
     In the actual work, considered that each of the observed
 values of optical effect was very probably true to less than ±1,
 and that none of them was possibly in error by so much as ±2.
     There is no equality to be expected between the results of
 one set of measurements and those of another set ; for the
 constancy of the electro-optic field was not carefully attended
 to at present, except in each day's work by itself.
      14. On the day after the decisive experiments of (10)        I
 obtained the following set of results (potentials are given as
 formerly in the first line, and optical effects in the second): —
              60     70       90       120      130    150
              50     67      113       197      234    310
      Dividing the squares of the successive potentials by the
 corresponding optical effects, and keeping each quotient true
 to half a unit, we find the six numbers
              72     73      71$       73     72     72£.
      Applying the number 72 £ as divisor to the squares of the
  successive potentials, we find the following set of calculated
  values of optical effect, each written under the corresponding
 potential. For comparison, the observed values of optical
  effect are repeated in the third line, and the differences be
  tween observed and calculated values are written in the fourth
  line.

  The differences   in the third and fourth columns       are rather
  large (13).
       15. Next day  I obtained  the following set of results.   The

168                Dr.   J.      Kerr   on Measurements
first and second lines contain potentials and optical effects as
formerly ; the third line contains a set of numbers which are
as the squares of the first five integers 1, 2, &c. — that    as               is,
the squares of the successive potentials.
             30        60           90             120       150

   Dividing the squares of the potentials by the observed op
tical effects, and keeping the quotients true to quarter units,
we obtain the five numbers
             69£         67|            69±          69}       70.
Taking now the number 70 as divisor of the squares of suc
cessive potentials, we find the following table of results (they
are arranged, line for line, as those given in the end of the
preceding article): —

The differences in the second and third columns are still
rather large (13).
   16. The two following measurements were made as one set,
in new circumstances, and with great care. The light em
ployed was that of a paraffin-lamp and the distance of the two
                                               ;
conductors was about one eighth of an inch, which was good                 a
deal larger than in the former experiments.     The potentials
were 90 and 120    ;and the quotients of square of potential by
optical effect were as follows: —
                   ?02-213
                   38~21d'
                                              ^-215
                                              ^T~nb'
These numbers are satisfactorily near equality.        Otherwise,
the calculated value of optical effect at potential 120
                         =   £x 38 =67$,
which differs from the observed value by half unit.           a
   17. Is there any regular difference, however small, between
observed and calculated values of the optical effect       Such        ?
was the question that   specially attempted to solve in some
                         I
of my latest experiments on this part of the subject.     Some
changes   of method were adopted.       The lens    of (8) was D
withdrawn,  and  its place was   supplied by  an ocular lunette                      ;
the second Nicol, deprived of its diaphragms,   was moved  close
up to the compensator    the room also was well darkened, so
                             ;

                    and  Law in Electro-optics.               169
that all other light beside that from the port was excluded.
These alterations added greatly to the purity and steadiness of
the optical effect, and made the observations both easier and
surer.
    The electrometer was set at a convenient potential ; and the
corresponding optical effect was measured as accurately as
possible.    A new potential was chosen; the corresponding
optical effect was calculated ; and both electrometer and com
pensator were set initially as they ought, by the law of squares,
to stand finally in this new case. The machine was then set
in motion ; and the observers had to determine, without touch
ing the instruments, whether the black band lay exactly mid
way between the wires of the compensator, or perceptibly to
the right or left, when the index of the electrometer was ex
actly in the sighted position. Some careful trials were made
in this way, through various ranges of potential. Differences
did present themselves at first in one or two cases, but they
disappeared on closer examination.        Upon the whole, there
was no deviation from the law of squares made out clearly in
any case, in either direction, or in any degree (great or small).
I  must therefore leave the statement already made in (11) as
the net and undoubted result of all that has been done upon
 the subject up to this point.
    18. Second Part of the Proof. — Let D be the distance be
tween the opposed faces of the two conductors, let V be the
difference of potentials of the conductors, and let Q be the
corresponding quantity of optical effect; also let R be the
resultant electric force at any point. Comparing the present
 system of dielectric and conductors with one of the simplest
 forms of electric field imagined in the Mathematical Theory of
 Electricity (that, namely, which is limited by two parallel
 conducting planes of infinite extent, and maintained at differ
 ent potentials), we obtain the following principle as one that
 we can safely proceed upon.
    For any small given value of D, for any given value of V,
 and for all points lying between the opposed parallel faces of
 the conductors, and not very near the borders of the field, the
 force R is constant in direction and magnitude, its direction
 being perpendicular to the faces of the conductors, and its in
 tensity proportional to the quotient of V by D.
    The optical action that we are concerned with has been
 already characterized as a case of double refraction with refer
 ence to direction of the force R as axis.      The quantity Q of
 the birefringent action, or the difference of retardations of the
 ordinary and extraordinary rays, is proportional to, and may
 therefore be measured by, the reduced reading of the compen

170                Dr.   J.  Kerr on Measurements
sator.    The quantity V is measured, with sufficient accuracy,
by   the scale-reading of the electrometer.
   It is already proved that, when D is given,
                               QaV2;
and from this    it follows that
                               QaEs.
   To anticipate the effect of a variation   of D, we may simply
extend this last statement, in the form
                                       V2
                             QocR2 ocj^;
and what remains to be proved is that Q varies inversely as D2.
   Generally, we may connect the experimentally measured
quantities D, V, Q by the equation
                                   V2
                            Q=   ITU2'
and then, to complete the proof of the Law of Squares as
already stated in (1), we must find that the quantity E, or the
equivalent quantity
                                V2
                              Q.D2'
preserves a constant value when D varies as well as V.
    19. Method of Experiment. — It was necessary here to obtain
a set of exactly measured values of D. The following method
was adopted, as well within reach and at the same time suffi
ciently accurate.      I  assume that the reader remembers what
has been said about the upper conductor and its adjuncts, the
ball-headed screws, rafters of glass, and lateral supports of
thick plate (2). A sheet -of thin plate glass, chosen for its
apparently perfect uniformity, was cut up into a number of
equal slips, of about the same length and breadth as the upper
conductor.      The joint thickness of sixteen of the slips was
exactly one inch. When the slips were laid side by side on a
plane table, and tested optically and otherwise, they were found
to differ sensibly, though very little, in thickness.    Four of
them were selected that showed no such difference ; and these
were reserved as standard slips, the thickness of each of them
being taken as unit value of D.
    The pieces being all in final position for experiment, the
 cell empty and open, and the upper conductor screwed close
 up to the rafters, the distance between the two conductors
was found to be rather greater than 1.        A standard slip was
laid on the floor of the cell, between the two conductors ; and

                    and  Law in Electro-optic?.               171
the screws were worked through small distances till the upper
conductor was in close and uniform contact with the slip. The
final adjustment was obtained when the standard slip was
barely movable through the whole space between the conduc
tors, sliding with tight friction, but without lifting or drag
ging the upper conductor. The cell was now closed and
charged, the electro-optic measurements were made ; the cell
was again emptied and opened, the standard slip was again
applied, and the value of D was found to be absolutely un
altered.
     All the pieces being in position as they were left by the
 preceding experiment, an unreserved slip was thrust in per
 manently between the brass floor of the cell and each of the
 lateral supports; two of the standard slips, held togther as
 one, were laid between the two conductors ; and the screws
 were worked backwards and forwards through very small dis
 tances, till the double slip could slide without lifting or drag
 ging the upper conductor, but with tight friction as formerly.
 The cell was then closed and charged, and the electro-optic
  measurements were made for the new value 2 of D, as for
  merly for the value 1.        It was also seen here, as in the
  former case, that the faces of the conductors were parallel,
  and that D had exactly the same value at the end of the expe
  riment as at the beginning.
     Distances 3 and 4 were managed in the same way. The
  necessary time and pains were taken to make all the opera
  tions as correct as possible.    No further explanation of the
  method is required, the electrometer and compensator being
  worked here in the same way exactly as before.      The improve
  ments mentioned in (17) were retained here of course.
     20. Measurements. — As my time was now running short,        I
  thought it best to restrict the work to one very careful mea
   surement, or to two measurements at most, for each value of
   D. The limits of error of observation in the measurement of
   Q were drawn as close to each other as possible in every case;
   and, as far as I could judge, the error lay always well within
   the range ± 1 ; no observed value of Q could possibly be in
   error by so much as ±2.
      (1) D= 1. One measurement was made ; and the result was
   as follows : —
                            "V2       fiO2
                           Q.D2-63xl2
   This experiment was made in very favourable circumstances ;
   and the result was verified again and again.
      (2) D = 2. Two measurements were made and verified ; and

172                 Dr.  J.    Kerr     on Measurements
the values of  E   were as follows         : —
                       902                        1202
                                 =56,
                    36x2*:                      64x2 3=56.
    The agreement with the first case is more than satisfactory;
for  if we suppose the true values of Q to be less than the ob
served values by half a unit each, (a difference which lies well
within the range of probable error of observation,) the cor
rected values of E rise to 57 and 56*7.
    (3) D=3. Two measurements were made ; and the values
of E were as follows : —
                               ,—56,
                                ¦                      .>->=59.
                    16 x    32                  27 x32
    The agreement of these results with each other and with the
first case is pretty close, and hardly unsatisfactory; for if we
suppose the true value of Q at potential 120 to be greater than
the observed value by 1, the corrected value of E falls to 57.
    (4) D=4. Two measurements were made and verified, with
the following results: —
                  1202                        1502
                        75
                           = ftnb0,'       ai      T5=5oi. ftl2
                 15  x  4*                 24    x 4^
    The agreement with the first case is close, and, indeed, satis
factory; for if we suppose the true values of Q to be greater
each by 1 than the observed values, the corrected values of E
fall to about 56.
    The uniformity of the electro-optic field was not sensibly
perfect in this fourth case, and the increase of D could not
safely be carried further.
    21. These numerical results are as trustworthy as any that
have yet been obtained on the subject.                   Taken by themselves
also, they  afford  a  sketch     of* a  full   proof   of the Law of Squares
 in the actual case of CS2.           I  think it worth while, therefore,
 to exhibit the contents of the last article in another form, as
 in the following Table.             The calculated values of Q are ob
 tained from the equation
                                Q=5T7D2'
                             1        2        2       3          3   4     4
                           60        90      120      90        120 120   150
                           63        36       64      16         27  15    24

                     and  Law in Electro-optics.                  173
    It will be noticed that the differences between observed and
calculated   values of Q do not extend, in any case, beyond the
range ± 1 of probable error of observation.         With this Table
I  close the experimental proof of the Law of Squares in the
actual case of dielectric CS2.
                                                     I
    In proceeding now to my last experiment, may mention
that the rubber of my machine is insulated on pillars of glass,
as well as the prime conductor.        The object in view is to com
pare contrary electric forces.
    22. Experiment. — The arrangements are as described in (8),
all the optical pieces being placed as in the diagram.
    (1) As in (8), the prime conductor is connected by wires
with the cell, the electrometer, and the Leyden jar, while the
rubber is connected by a wire with earth.         A convenient po
tential is chosen ; the electrometer is set accordingly ; and the
screw of the compensator is worked as in the former experi
ments, till the optical action of the dielectric is exactly neu
tralized at the instant of the critical signal. In the final state
of the instruments, the black band lies exactly midway be
tween the reference-wires of the compensator when the index
of the electrometer is exactly in the sighted position. From
now till the end of the experiment, the electrometer and the
compensator are left untouched.
    (2) The wires connecting prime conductor with cell and
electrometer and Leyden jar are detached from the prime con
ductor, and fixed in the rubber ; and the wire connecting
rubber with earth is detached from the rubber, and inserted
in the prime conductor. The electro-optic observation is re
peated, and the effects are found to be the same in kind and
quantity as before.      As the electric force increases, the black
band moves gradually to the right ; and when the index of the
electrometer is exactly in the sighted position, the band lies
exactly midway between the wires.
    It appears thus, as might have been confidently expected,
that the optical effect of electric force is independent of the
sense of the force, being of exactly the same kind after reversal
of the force as before, equal also in amount for equal intensi
ties of the force.
    23. In conclusion,    I observe that the principal result of the
experiments,    what   I have  called the Law of Squares, may be
correctly stated in several very different forms.      The quantity
of optical effect, per unit of thickness of the dielectric, varies
either
    (1) Directly as the square of the resultant electric force, or
    (2) Directly as the energy of the electric field per unit of
volume, or
    Phil. Mag.   S. 5. Vol. 9. No. 55. March 1880.            0

174              Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet on             the
   (3) Directly as the mutual attraction of the two conductors
that limit the field, or
   (4) Directly as the electric tension of the dielectric, a quan
tity that was conceived long ago very clearly by Faraday, and
introduced afterwards definitely into the Mathematical Theory
of Electricity by Professor Clerk Maxwell.
   Faraday's and Clerk Maxwell's views as to the action of the
dielectric in the transmission of electrostatic force, and as to
the state of molecular constraint that is associated with and
essential to that action, are very strongly confirmed by tbe new
facts of electro-optics.   The dioptric action of an electrically-
charged medium is closely related to the electric stress of the
medium, the axis of double refraction coinciding in every case
with the line of electric tension, and the intensity of double
refraction varying, certainly in CS2 and probably in all other
dielectrics, directly and simply as the intensity of the tension.

XXIII.  Note on the Measure of the Intensity of Sound. By
  R. H. M. Bosanquet, Fellow of St. John's College, Oxford.
 To     Editors of
      the            the   Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
I
      Gentlemen,
      AM  happy to say that my proposal for the establishment
      of an  acoustic laboratory* is in a fair way to be realized,
      I
and hope shortly to get to work.                   I
                                        But reserve all account
of this for the present.
   The object of this note is to present certain considerations
as to the expression of the measure of sound-intensities, with
a deduction of Fechner's law in a manner which               I
                                                       do not re
member to have seen before.      Tjie point was suggested to me
by a criticism, in which it appeareaTo~15eTupposed that the
meaMremehFbf^ifferences of sensation arising from differ
ences of intensity by the ratio of the mechanical intensities
was inconsistent with Fechner's law.
   The first and simplest hypothesis concerning the difference
of the sensations due to two mechanical intensities    that the  is,
difference of the numbers which express the measure of the
sensation    proportional to the difference of the mechanical
            is
intensities. (The variations due to difference of pitch are
throughout disregarded, as that question forms         distinct  a
                     *   Phil. Mag. Oct.   1879.

                  Measure      of the Intensity of Sound.     175
branch of the subject.) It is easy to prove, from facts of ordi
nary knowledge, that this hypothesis is impossible.        For in
stance, a single diapason stop of soft quality, in the organ,
may be taken to represent a definite mechanical intensity.     If
this be added to a mechanical intensity of less, or not very
much greater amount, the addition produces a finite difference
of sensation.     If,
                    however, the full organ    being used, so that
                                                        is
the existing mechanical intensity       very  much
                                             is      greater than
that added by the single soft stop, the addition of the latter
does not affect the sensation at all.       The first hypothesis
therefore falls to the ground.
   Similar conditions may be applied to any definite loud and
soft sounds   ; but the above   sufficient to establish the point.
                                    is
   The second hypothesis in point of simplicity would appear
to be, that the difference of the numbers which express the
measure of the sensation       proportional to the ratio of the
                                   is
mechanical intensities. This      an hypothesis often practically
                                        is
employed in a vague sort of way.         shall endeavour to trace
                                             I
it to its consequences, and show that          necessary that the
                                                   it   is
measure of sensation thus defined should be connected with
another measure of sensation.     The second measure introduced

ferences of the measure in question are the logarithms of the
differences of another measure, which satisfies the conditions
of observation, and leads to Fechner's law.
   A third assumption, which may perhaps be stated separately,
is that the ratio of the sensations      proportional to the ratio
                                                is

Whence      follows that the differences of sensation (A\) are

hypothesis.    This hypothesis    therefore really identical with
                                           is
that first made, and falls with it.

subject, the only one which satisfies the elementary conditions,

is that which leads to Fechner's law.   It is possible that this
law may not be accurately and rigorously true ; that would
only be to say that our fundamental hypotheses err in the
same manner, which is not at all improbable.       But until ex
periments of a far more careful and extensive character than
any yet made come to decide the question, we may take Fech
ner's law to be highly probable.
   This law will always probably be best led up to by the phy
siological reasoning commonly employed.                   I
                                             But have thought
it not useless to examine the consequences of the various ele
mentary assumptions as to the measure of the sensation of
sound, from a different point of view.
    P.S. — Since the above was written, my attention has been
drawn to an experimental verification of Fechner's law, for
the sounds produced by falling weights (Carl Norr, Zeitschrift
filr   Biologie, 1879, p. 297).

           free path of a molecule is dependent on the amount
THE
  of obstruction     it meets with, or the density of the medium.

Kinetische Theorie der Gase),~L=        —-i—           Here   Nis the num-
ber    of molecules in the unit volume.
    I consider the  length of path in a medium of variable den
sity. At the surface of a liquid, if there is no sharp transition
from the liquid to the gaseous state, we shall have a succession
of layers of less and less dense vapours, from where there is
liquid to the surrounding atmosphere.     The layers V are what
I  refer to. The depth of these vapours            is,
                                                of course, much
magnified.
I     propose to find the pressure upon the particle p, when the
surface of the liquid    plane and when
                         is                  it   is
                                             spherical.   Taking
the molecules moving with any definite velocity, they will
reach     and give    itan impulse when they are at      distance

from     less than their mean free path.     Now the molecules
from below come from denser layers than those from above.
A   greater number will come from below than from above                 ;
there will be   atendency to driven upward. To find this ten
dency,   we  must  find how much denser the lower layers, from

This shows that, whereas the difference in density abov/                                        1

the change in this tendency may be assumed as proportional

 density takes place at p.   As   the change of density      due to                      is
an increase of pressure on p, this increase must be equal in all
directions. So       itonly necessary to consider one direction.

             Mr. L. Fletcher's Crystallographic Notes.                 181
were always twinned, and their faces dull and not very plane.
Schrauf * has observed the same form on some artificial crys
tals of this metal.       The same mineralogistf describes crystals
from Wallaroo in South Australia which exhibit the hemihedral
form ir (2 10). Zerrennerf has observed an imperfect deve
lopment of this hemihedral form on a crystal from Bolivia,
whilst a second crystal on the same specimen presented the
combination of (2 1 0) with slight (4 1 2) and (1 1 0). The
form (18 10 5) was observed by Vom Rath § on crystals of
a specimen from Lake Superior.              The form (3 1 0) was ob
served (1877) by Jeremejew|| on some crystals from Syryanow
in the Altai district; and he incidentally remarks that, of all
the native metals or alloys, it has only been met with on amal
gam.      We shall see later that it also occurs on both native
silver and native gold.
    To the list of observed forms must now be added
(410)        (530)      (730)     (740)       (411)     (511)       (531).
The form (3 1 0) has also been observed on crystals from
other localities than the above.
    Where not stated to the contrary, the instrument employed
for the determination of the angles was a reflecting gonio
meter. As images often could not be obtained, the position of
a face was in general determined by its maximum illumina
 tion. For more accurate determination of the angles, in some
 cases the faces were slightly oiled, while in others thin reflect
 ing plates were fixed upon them. A few of the observed and
 calculated angles are given in each instance.
    In the case of some of the above new forms the indices have
 been marked on the crystals for some years : they are con
 firmed by the measurements given below.
    A crystal removed from a specimen from Lake Superior
 presented a symmetrical development                of the combination
 (100) (110) (310):—

    A specimen, from the Bank Mines near Ekaterinburg is a
 fine ramose mass of crystals, in a matrix of grey crystalline
 limestone.      Some of the crystals present the combination
 (111) (100) (110) (310), much shortened along a tri
 gonal axis: —

   Several specimens from Lake Superior present forms pre
viously unobserved.           The first we shall mention is a parallel
aggregation     of  cubes   :   on some of the crystals the faces of a
tetrakishexahedron       are developed.                 The indices of this form
were found to be (4 0) :   1          —

to be (5 3 0):—

some massive copper and associated with laumontite and cal-
cite. The angles were measured with the hand-goniometer :

   A fifth specimen, from the same locality, presents some very
sharply defined crystals associated with massive copper, native
silver, and calcite.   The crystals present a symmetrical deve

   The remaining specimens to be mentioned are all spinel-like
twins, and are much shortened along that trigonal axis which
is perpendicular to the twin-plane.
   A specimen from Lake Superior presents some large crys
tals drused with quartz.         One of the smaller and very sharply
defined crystals was shown by help of the reflecting goniometer
to be a spinel-like twin of the combination (1 00) (11 0)

Cornwall.
   The first specimen is a dendritic aggregation of crystals,
mostly indistinct.    One crystal, however, from which good

by crystals of native silver from Chili.

on native copper.

    The forms already described              as  occurring on native gold
are   : —

               (311) (811) (421) (19 11 1).
 The form (3 2 1) has been observed by Lang* on an artificial
 crystal.       The forms (4 10) (81 1) were first observed by
 Lewis t- The forms (2 1 1), (4 2 1), (1 9 11 1)J have not
 been observed on any crystals in this collection.             To the list
 of observed forms must now be added (3 1 0).
    A specimen from Beresowsk in the Urals presents the
 habit shown in fig. 7, and proves to be a spinel-like twin of
 the combination (3 10) (10 0) having no reentrant angles.
 Eight different angles between a cube-face and an adjacent
 face of the tetrakishexahedron             gave values varying between
 16° and 19°, and having 18° for mean, the calculated angle
 being 18° 26'; 310.310, observed 24|°, calculated 25° 50$'.
     Some crystal-sprays from various localities in the Philip
 pines proved to be composed of small crystals presenting the
 known form (3 1 1) and occasionally twinned about the octa
 hedron-plane.

 The mineral crystallizes from fusion in the form (1 0 0).
    In this collection crystals from Wittichen and ohanngeor-   J
 genstadt presented one of the combinations mentioned by
 Miller, namely (1      1 1) (111).
    To the list of observed forms must now be added the form
 (133 . A specimen from Siebenschlehn near Schneeberg,
in Saxony, shows crystals of bismuth associated with quartz.
 Of two crystals, one presented the new form (13 3) in com
bination with a largely developed (1 1 1) and a slight (100);

from Oker : (1 3 1) (4 3 4) were observed on only two of
these crystals.
    The form (131) has since been observed by Zepharovich*
slightly developed on a crystal from near Miss in Carinthia.
    The forms (310), (2 0 3), (119), (4 34) have not been
met with on any crystals in this collection.
    Some crystals were removed from a specimen of unknown
locality : the colour of the crystals resembles very much that
of some specimens from the Lipari Isles, while the accompa
nying rock is a highly altered scoriaceous lava. One crystal,
about 3 millimetres in diameter, presented the combination
  (100)       (101) (110)          (111)       (112)      (113)    (311)
      (3 13) (31 5),
of which (311) is one of the rare forms due to Brezina : the
form (1 1 2) has been long known, but did not occur on
the crystals from Oker. Another fragment from the same spe
cimen, and about 4 millimetres in diameter, was found to con
sist of two interpenetrant crystals, one individual presenting
the combination
  (100)       (010)      (001)     (011)       (013)      (101) (110)
  (111)       (113)      (115)     (117)        (311)      (313) (315),
 of which both of the forms (3 1 1), (1 1 7) are due to Brezina,
and    in this crystal are largely developed ; the old form (0 1 1)
 presented by this individual was not present on Brezina's
 crystals.     The second individual presented the combination
         (001)     (103)     (111)       (311)       (313)     (315).
    Some small crystals from the Wheatley Mines, Phcenixville,
 Chester Co., Pennsylvania, were found to be exceeding rich in
 the development of planes, and likewise showed some of the
 rare forms mentioned above.
    A crystal of about 1 millim. diameter, from a specimen in
 which the 6ulphur was associated with anglesite, galena, and
 copper pyrites, was found to present the following combina
 tion  : —
  (011)       (010) (110) (115) (113)                      (112)   (111)
           (101) (313) (117) (311).
    A    second specimen from the same mine showed the associa
 tion   of sulphur with cerussite and quartz; a crystal of about
 1  millim. diameter presented the following forms, the magni-

 Of these forms, (1 3 1), (3 1 1), (1 1 7) were first observed on
the crystals from Oker ; (2 1 0), (0 1 1), (1 1 2) are old forms,
which did not occur on those crystals ; while (1 1 4) has not
been previously described : the faces of the latter form were
 about the same size as those of the forms (1 1 3), (1 1 7).       The
 following measurements were obtained by the method of maxi
mum illumination     : —

    This mineral, which never seems to present very perfect
crystals, has been long assumed to belong to the tetragonal
system.     Lately Schrauf* has pointed out that the crystals he
has examined present a rhombic rather than a tetragonal deve
lopment of planes; while from the measurement of angles of the
crystals, and of the striations upon the basal plane, he thinks
that the crystals really belong to even a lower type of sym
metry than the rhombic. Assuming, however, rhombic axes,
he gives the following indices of observed planes: —
 ;(010)     (160) (130) (120) (051)                    (031)    (011)
     (2 5 2) (121) (3 4 3) (111).
All the planes, with the exception of the basal plane (0 1 0)
are almost linear.     He measured five crystals, and found that
in three (1 2 0) was associated with (0 1 1), whilst tetragonal
symmetry would have required (0 21); in a fourth (12 0) is
associated with (0 3 1), while the fifth presented no measurable
planes in these zones. In one, and only one, of these crystals
(1 3 0) and (0 5 1) occur ; (121) occurs on three crystals,
(1 1 1) on two, (2 5 2) and (3 4 3) each on a single crystal.
From the above, Schrauf hopes that it may be possible to di
stinguish between the two domes.
    To the above forms may be added (1 1 0), (1 3 1), (1 4 1).
    Six crystals were measured; and of these five were removed
from the same specimen; and all came from the old locality,
viz. Nagyag in Transylvania.            The following angles were

from the other.

To these Scacchi adds” (120), (410), (2 14), (214). Hes
senbergf confirms the forms (120), (410), and adds further
the forms (101), (610), (211), (670), (221).                     To the
above Dana, in his list of observed forms, adds (414), while
he omits (670).        Groth, in his Catalogue of the Strassburg
collection, confirms the existence of the form (670), and adds
(43.2), considering that Hessenberg's (221) was in reality
this same form.
    To these may be added           (320), (310), (650), (034),
(112), (616), (15 115): the plane (414) given by Dana
has also been observed.          The unconfirmed form (214) of
 Scacchi has been met with largely             developed.     The forms
(520), (214), (101), (610), (211), (670), (221), (432)

          ingenious contrivance known as Napier's rods or
THEbones       is perhaps usually regarded as of some historical
interest,  but  as no longer of practical use. For half a century,
however, after its description in Rabdologia] it received much
attention ; .and it has often been revived in various formsj.              I
propose hereto show that, by an improvement in manipula
tion, it may still be made to give valuable aid by diminishing
labour and increasing safety and speed in calculation.

essential points, diminished linearly as4tol.                    SSBBisa
board on which, along its middle, a series of Napierian tablets
(I have discarded the form of rods) are to be arranged for use.
These have a notch at each end, so that they may be set in
their places by means of pairs of pins (figs. 1 and 2) fixed in
the board, which is about "1 inch higher between the pins than
elsewhere.
   The tablets, which carry on one side multiples of 0, 1, 2, 3,
4, carry on the other side multiples of 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, respec
tively. They are kept arranged and instantly accessible in a
magazine which, when not wanted, is deposited in a cavity (M)
in the board.

192         Mr.   J. Bridge   on a  Calculating Apparatus
   F  Gr (fig.
                3) is a frame which is movable along the board.
It  carries a number of glass slides, a, b, c, d, &c. (figs. 1 and
2), movable on it in the direction of their length. These are
made opaque except at the middle, where an aperture is left
(fig. 4) large enough to show two adjacent digits on the
tablets.
   g (fig. 1) is a fixed ridge of hard wood with notches at equal
intervals; and g* (fig. 3) is a corresponding groove in the
frame,     p, p are pins going down through the frame so that
their lower ends, which are rounded, fall into the notches of g.
By the help of a little pressure from the finger on one of them
they serve to fix the frame at any of the positions it ought to
take —namely, so that each slide is half over one tablet and
half over the next (fig. 4).
    2. Multiplication. — Suppose 74628394 to be the multipli
cand and 4736 the multiplier.           Fig. 2 shows the arrangement
required.      Tablets   headed   with the digits of the multiplicand
are set up in direct order on the board, the first filling the
space 0 to 1 of the scale S S ; and the slides a, b, c, d are set
to the lines corresponding to the digits 4, 7, 3, 6 respectively
of the multiplier.
    The frame is then moved step by step from right to left.
At each step the sum of all the digits seen through the aper
tures is taken, its units' figure recorded and its tens' figure
carried.      When F arrives opposite 0 on the scale the whole
product will have been recorded.
    3. This will be seen without explanation ; but for the sake
 of what is to follow, the process may be compared with the
arranged details of the product.

    Let the sum of each pair of adjacent digits be called an ele
 ment, each vertical series of elements a column, and each hori
 zontal series a row.       The columns will then correspond to the
 places   on   the  scale  S S, or of the digits of the multiplicand ;
 and the rows will correspond to the places of the digits of the
 multiplier, row 1 to 1st digit, and so on. The position of an
 element in the product may be described by indicating its
 column and its row, and its rank is the sum of the numbers
 indicating its column and its row.           Thus the element (6, 3)
 is that which is found in column 6 and row 3, and its rank is

answer, the number of slides on the frame and places on the
board being supposed great enough.            For example, with an
apparatus  having   the range   shown  in fig.   we can write down                   1,
the sum of the squares of two numbers of             figures, to do                             5
which in the ordinary way would require about 75 figures
more.
  5.  Division. — Let the multiplicand (divisor) be set up, as
before described, on the board, and the product (dividend)
written on paper, which        would be convenient to have ruled
                                              it
to correspond   with  the scale         Then the question S  — how
                                                              S.                                                is

  The apparatus may be made to do this by following the
ordinary process of division; and         obvious what advantages

 in column 3. Bring down d, c, b together, seeking somewhat
 less than the remainder, and subtract the number found. Put
 back d, c ; move F on to 5, and append a new figure from the
 dividend.
      The plan for any stage is—
      (a) Subtract the sum of all the elements shown by the col
 lecting slides.
      (/8) Seek somewhat less than the remainder with the trial*
 slides, and subtract the number found.
      (7) Put back all the trial slides but the one nearest F,
 move F on a step, and append a new figure from the dividend.
      At the end the quotient is to be read off backward from the
 slides.
      If  the complete remainder at any stage is required, transfer
 the frame to the right-hand side of the board and move it up
 towards the left, subtracting at each step the sum of the ele
 ments shown.
      7. It will be seen that the elements of the product or divi
 dend are taken up at successive stages in the following order
 (compare art. 3): —
                            012345678
     First stage        .   1    1     1    F
     Second stage       .   2    2     2     1    F
     Third stage        .   3    3     3    2     1     F
    Fourth stage        .   4    4     4    3    2      1    F
and so on.
    The ranks being found by adding the numbers                  indicating
the column and the row, are—
                  At  the first stage .     .  1, 2, 3
                     „ second stage         .  2, 3, 4, 4
                     „     third stage   .  .  3, 4, 5, 5, 5
and so on.
     In the above, each slide after leaving column 2 retains the
position on the frame which it got there ; the partial dividends
have (usually) 3 figures, and the remainders to be recorded
at the end of each stage 2 figures.
     If  it is agreed that each slide shall get its setting in column 1,
two     trial  slides must be used, and F for the first stage must
be placed at 2.           This will be found the more convenient plan,
unless the divisor have a small leading figure.             The estimation
    *
        The element shown by the one nearest   F is of the same rank as those
shown by the collecting slides.

   of the coming digit is sometimes less certain; but there is
   usually only one figure of remainder to record, and the result
   of the first subtraction need not be recorded at all.
      8. If a doubt occurs at any stage, it may be solved in several
   ways: —
      (1) By pushing forward the frame for a moment and so
  ascertaining what would be carried from the next rank.
      (2) By increasing the number of trial slides. Thus, sup
  posing that we have made the first subtraction, and trying for
  the new digit we are in doubt.       Put back the trial slides, ap
  pend another figure from the dividend, push on the frame a
  step, and subtract the sum of the elements shown.        Then try
  again, using one more trial slide than before.

  4 figures of quotient have been obtained.
     (3) By finding the complete remainder, recording the digits
  of the quotients already obtained, and beginning the division
 again with this complete remainder as dividend.
     With three trial slides it is very unlikely that any difficulty
  will occur before 12 figures of quotient have been obtained,
 and then only if the divisor have more (say) than 7 figures.
 The method of computing should in ail cases be exactly that
 given in Sonnenschein and Nesbitt's 'Arithmetic,' part i. p. 105.

the above only one figure was recorded at each step : and the

intervals are at each stage occupied by tablets.                       This is done
by inserting an asterisk.             Also some of the elements must be
 doubled ; these are indicated by accents.

hoping that it will be sufficient explanation of the process.

    A simplification worth noticing in this process arises from
the fact that the digits on the collecting slides, the number of
which is always odd, are equal at equal distances from the
middle.
    12. Since writing the above          I  have found analogies to the
processes described.         Lieut.-Col. Oakes, in the Journal of the
Institute of Actuaries, Jan. 1863, gives " A method of midti-
plication which may be practised mentally" the knowledge of
which from some other source led me to construct the appa
ratus.    The other processes came, as it were, by the sponta
neous action of the machine.              Methods having a partial cor
respondence      with   them     are   given   by Dr. Peacock in his
"Arithmetic" in the Encyc. Met. as Arabian or Persian
methods ; also in his 'Algebra,' vol. i. pp. 100-105.
    Napier's Promptnarium, described in the Appendix to his
Rabdologia, multiplies by a process arithmetically identical
with that given ; but the construction and manipulation of his
apparatus are very troublesome.

 the following investigations,                       intended to establish

    198              M. F. Linderaanil on        the Forms of   the
     is much rather to be specially established* ; for the twice re
     peated differentiation of each term of (1) leads to a series
     which is not convergent.           The desired proof is carried out in
     nos. 2-6.      In no. 7 it is shown that the conditions laid down
     by Christoffelt are fulfilled, under which the occurrence of an
     acute angle is compatible with the subsistence of the diffe
     rential equation (2).
          The remaining part of this essay is occupied with the stroked
     string (violin-string).        In nos. 8-14, therefore, the form of
     vibration of the violin-string is discussed without making use
     of those series. Christoffel's above-mentioned conditions of
     disconJojiuitc present the necessary means for that purpose.

    general manner.          The results therein gained correspond very
    well with the observations for the case that the stroking-place
    is a point marking an aliquot division of the string and lies
    pretty near one end (distant, at the most, but little more than
    one fourth of the length of the string from the end, as other
    wise node-points are readily formed).

         2. We will suppose the string to execute transversal vibra
   tions in one plane.         In the position of equilibrium let it ex
   tend along the positive X axis from x=Q to x—li.                      Then L
   is its length; let M denote its mass, and P the force stretching
   it ; and the form of the string at the time t is determined by
   the differential equation (2), if M . a2 = L . P.

        In order to treat the motion of the twitched string," let
   us assume that the given string is drawn on one side from its
   position of rest y=0 by means of a pointed peg, while the
  point of contact of the peg with the string, x=a, has moved
  in the positive direction to the distance b from its resting-place.

          Schlomilch, in his Compendium der hoheren Analysis, lays down con
   ditions for the possibility of differentiating geometrical series term by term
  (2nd edition, vol.
                       ii. p. 139). In the present case those conditions are
  fulfilled but not applicable ; for they imply the presupposition that the
  differential quotient of the series in question can likewise be represented
 by a trigonometrical series. But the second differential quotient of (1)
  is 0 ; and 0 can only be represented by a trigonometric series whose co
  efficients are collectively =0.

At   the time t—0 the peg is suddenly withdrawn.                      The initial
velocity for every point        of    the  string  is  then     =0  ; and at the

of the latter must, in the present case, be more closely inves
tigated.
    3. From D'Alembert's solution of equation (2) it is easily
proved that the form of the twitched string consists, at any
moment, of three straight lines, apart from single moments in
which it is composed of two or only of one line*.                         Conse-

enlarged upon.           The motion thus presented corresponds with
the delineations given by Thomas Young*.

fore a moment when the inclination takes a third value, as at
that moment the line (9) itself forms a part of the string.
This is in accordance with the circumstance that at a place of
discontinuity a trigonometric series represents the mean value.
    7. From the foregoing it follows that the series
                                                                      (1) for

0  = t = tj is constantly a complete linear function of x and                t,
and, indeed, according to the quantity of t, like the functions
occurring in the equations (8), (11), (13), (15), (16), (17).
 Therefore series (1) in fact satisfies the differential equation (2),
since simultaneously

   That the conditions for the possibility of an angle in trans
versely vibrating strings are fulfilled in the solution by means
of a Fourier series was already remarked by Christoffel I. c.
It is easy to verify this in the present case. Here the expres

have to form these expressions for the several time-intervals

in fact give identical values on both sides of the angle 7, 8.
The like holds good for the angle >/, W.

presents with approximate accuracy the motion of the several
points of the string {conf. infra, no. 16) : —
   Each point in a stroked string vibrates hither and thither with
constant velocity; this velocity is different for the different points
of   the   string.
     It will  shown that by this the motion of the string is com
                be
pletely determined,                if,
                        in addition, the amplitude     any single               of
point      the string

                                   is                                                           of
nodes.
   We shall find that the velocity of point of the string (with

sarily different from the velocity when descending.      At first
we make no hypothesis about this       we will only suppose the

   Let us consider     point x of the string, which at the time

   Therefore either a =         6,   or           is continuous.
   Further, in order to preserve the continuity of the string,
the condition
                         o(Io + X) + h=b(Z0               +   Z) + k

                      and consequently also    is continuous as
                    ^
soon as a is different from b. But if we assume that a=b, the
last condition gives h = k, and the one before made use of
gives h = aT + k ; therefore must a=b = 0, as we have already
                                                                                      dZ
remarked (at the commencement                         of this no.).          Hence         can

become discontinuous  only at a node-point   ; but we have ex
cluded the occurrence of nodes.     By this the above assertion
is proved.   It was necessary to use this demonstration, since
in Christoffel's investigations the continuous progression of
the place of discontinuity is presupposed.
   In consequence of these discussions the above conditions of
discontinuity can be applied, and, taking (18*) into conside
ration, can be written in the following form: —
                                                                                d(Z
                                                                                      -r- — -

   Hence it follows that at no place in the string can                           ^
vanish   ;for otherwise a would necessarily be = b, which is
impossible {conf. supra).      Therefore
   The function X0 + X has in the interval from x=0 to x—Jj
neither a maximum nor a minimum; it increases continuously,
or it decreases continuously.
   10. Hence in the interval mentioned there is only one value
of x which satisfies the equation t=Zo + Z. That           at any               is,
timet   the string has only one angle.     Or, since y, according

a,   b,f,g are complete linear functions, to be determined, of
x. Between them and the function % a series of relations
subsist.
  At the time T, namely, every point must again be in the
position of equilibrium ; therefore
                   0=aT+g                                                     (22)
     Further, we have
                   a%=bX + 2f,                                                (23)

and thence
                   aT=-b(T-X)                                                 (25)
   This last equation affirms that the path travelled in ascend
ing differs from that travelled in descending only in its sign,
as must be the case in a periodic vibration.
    11. Respecting X, according to no. 9 two different assump
tions can be made : either X increases when x increases ; or
X diminishes as x increases. In both cases for x — 0 and x = L,
i. e. for the extremities of the string, must
                                    2=0    mod. T.
In  the former case, therefore, we can take X=0 for x=0,
and consequently (since no nodes are supposed to be pre
sent, and since 2 increases simultaneously with x increas
ing) £=T for x=~L; that          the points in the vicinity of
                                         is,
x=0 rise very quickly and descend very slowly, while the
neighbouring points to #=L descend rapidly and ascend very
slowly. In the other case the behaviour of the two ends of
the string    exactly the reverse.
             is                     In the following we make
the former assumption    the other would be decided simply
                                ;                                               by

    According to this, x can always          be  chosen so small that,
for a given value of t.
For points of     the string which are situated sufficiently near the
end   x=0, therefore, the middle equation of (21) always holds
good ; so that for them y = bt+f.           For x=0 must y=0; con
sequently we can put
                             b=Bx, f=¥x,
where     B  and  F  denote constants.
    The function    X   reaches its greatest value for«=L. There
fore, if 2t-<T, then the first of the equations (21) holds good
in the vicinity of the end x=li ; it must give y=0 for x=li ;
we thus get
                              a=A(L— x),
where A denotes a constant.
    It then follows, further, from (22), that
                            <7=-AT(L-*).
    In  fact, g must contain the factor L— x. since for #=L and
 2<>-T the third of the equations (21) is valid.
    The function % is now determined from (25); we get
                       ~_-ftT_
                       *

     12. The constants     A  and B, by which all is expressed, can
 be reduced to a    single  constant   by means of the discontinuity-
 conditions (19) and (20).          In correspondence with the repla
  cing of equations (18) by (21), X must previously be replaced
  in these relations by %Z or by T— \X.
     For the place of discontinuity t=\X both sides of equation
  (19) become, by virtue of the values just found for a, b,f, g,
  and  X, equal to

     This relation is therefore spontaneously fulfilled.
     Equation (20), on the contrary, gives for the same place of

     The constant          A is determined                by the amplitude of any point

   According to Neumann's experiments (conf. no. 8) P de

This of the same form as the series which otherwise occur with

vibrating strings.
   According to formula (31), besides the fundamental tone all
the upper tones are contained in the sound of the string.   But
if the stroking-place happens to be at       point marking an
                                                         a
aliquot part, those upper tones are wanting (according to the
observations of Helmholtz and Neumann) which have a node-
point at the stroking-place.  This fact does not obtain expres
sion in formula (31).     Hence, although the above-described
motion of the violin-string agrees very well with Neumann's
stroboscopic observations, the hypothesis enunciated in no.                             8

account we will now give another    treatment  of  the motion of
the violin-string, more closely agreeing with the facts, for the
case that the bow acts at a node-point of an upper tone.
   15. For our purpose it is expedient at first to let the sup
position made in no. 8 stand, but now to take into account the
occurrence of node-points, which has hitherto been excluded.
   The occurrence of node-points is usually settled with the aid
of Fourrier's series.   This, however, is not necessary ; for
d'Alembert's solution conducts to similar results.     The latter
can be applied in our case also ; we can therefore assume as
known that the points

222                Mr. W. R. Birt on     the Cyclones
than Jive     hundved and seventeen thousand; and this great
number is small compared with the immense number that
must have perished in the aggregate number of cyclones that
have occurred ; consequently any addition to our knowledge
of these destructive meteors cannot fail of being interesting
to our readers, as well as to navigators and seamen.
                  Antecedents   of Powerful Cyclones.
    The   importance of a knowledge of the antecedents of
 cyclones, especially of such as are attended with great loss
 of life, cannot be overrated.        For an increase of our know
ledge in this respect we are indebted to J. Eliot, Esq., M.A.,
 Meteorological Reporter to the Government of Bengal, in his
 Report on the Madras Cyclone of May 1877.                    In order
 clearly   to  connect   the   antecedents   with  the  cyclones   it is
 necessary     to  take   into   consideration   the  two   transition-
periods : — one, in April or near the latter end of April, between
the breaking-up of the north-east monsoon and the establish
 ment of the south-west ; the other, in October, succeeding
the south-west monsoon and ushering in the north-east
monsoon.        Mr. Eliot finds that cyclones or revolving storms
 of great extent and intensity occur only at these periods,
while cyclonic disturbances of small intensity are of frequent
 occurrence during the rainy season or south-west monsoon.
 During the continuance of each monsoon certain meteo
 rological relations are established over the Bay and the ad
joining land-areas; and when a change from one monsoon
to the other occurs — in other words, when a transition-period
sets in, it implies a complete reversal as regards the preceding
monsoon of baric gradient, wind-direction, and other atmo
spheric conditions over the large area including the Arabian
 Sea, the Bay of Bengal, India, and Further India.
    These reversals of meteorological elements occurring gra
dually tend to an approximate equality and uniformity of baro
metric pressure over a large area. This approximate uni
formity of pressure over and round the coast of the Bay of
Bengal, accompanied by light variable winds and calms over
a considerable portion of the Bay with little or no rainfall,
Mr. Eliot regards as invariable antecedents of a powerful
cyclone.
                Connexion   of Rainfall with Cyclones.
    In consequence of the small rainfall about the time of the
commencements of the transition-periods, the amount of
aqueous vapour in the atmosphere accumulates and gives rise
to some peculiar sky-effects.        When the point of saturation
is attained, precipitation follows, and a heavy rainfall is con

                        of the Bay of Bengal.                  223
 centra ted over a portion of the Bay, accompanied by a strong
 in-draugbt most marked from the Indian Ocean at the
 entrance of the Bay.        Mr. Eliot regards this heavy rainfall
 as an immediate antecedent of a cyclone.         For some years,
 we believe, an opinion has existed that cyclones are connected
 with rainfall. If our memory serves us correctly, we re
 member that some time in the early part of the decade
 1850-60, a work on storms was published in which the
 author laid some stress on the fact that cyclones mostly
 originate in regions characterized by active precipitation of
aqueous vapour.       A later writer, the Bev. Clement Ley,
 speaks of extensive precipitation contributing to cyclonic
 generation as follows : — " Extensive precipitation occurring
 in a region of atmosphere previously approaching a con
 dition of tranquillity is the primary factor of every system of
 baric depression with its resulting atmospheric circulation,
 retrograde in the northern and direct in the southern hemi
 sphere." Mr. Meldrum's Mauritius Meteorological Results
 for the year 1875 furnish some evidence which appears to
indicate that the connexion between rainfall and cyclones is
 of a much stronger kind than he had before anticipated.      He
          "
 says : — The oft-observed fact that the dry weather in Mau
 ritius from December to April is accompanied by an absence
 of hurricanes in the Indian Ocean, has been repeated in 1875.
 It is remarkable that, while February is generally the wettest
month in Mauritius and the stormiest month in the Indian
 Ocean, it was in 1875 the reverse in both these respects.
 This seems to point to an intimate connexion between rainfall
and cyclones."
     Mr. Eliot, in discussing the principal facts of the Midna-
pore cyclone of October 1874, found that the rainfall on that
 occasion was conterminous with the entire duration of the
 cyclone.
             " It is," he says, " in this case, as in others, the
one meteorological factor, the introduction of which into the
previously existing conditions determined the commencement
of the cyclone ; and the intensity and situation of the rainfall
ran parallel with the intensity and position of the cyclone.
The evidence which the Midnapore cyclone thus affords of
the intimate connexion between rainfall and cyclone-generation
is very strong, and is almost equally conclusive in favour of
the condensation theory of the origin of cyclones."
            Connexion between Sun-spots and Cyclones.
    Mr. Eliot, in commenting on the passage above quoted from
Mr. Meldrum, remarks : — " This statement of Mr. Meldrum's,
when it is remembered that he has upheld the parallel-wind
              ; '

hypothesis for the explanation of the cyclones of the southern
Indian Ocean, is a very remarkable one. It may also be added,
in further confirmation of         that
                                 it,      affords some explanation
                                            it
of the connexion between cyclone-frequency, rainfall, and sun-
spot-frequency.      Mr. Meldrum's investigations have estab
lished that the frequency and energy of cyclones in the
Indian Ocean and the rainfall of the globe vary directly with
the number of sun-spots, or are subject to the same law of
periodicity.    This relation     is almost self-evident, if     be
                                                                 it
admitted that massive terrestrial atmospheric phenomena are
due solely or primarily to the action of solar radiant heat,
and that any marked periodicity in the cause (solar heat and
action) must impress     a    corresponding periodicity on the
more important phenomena of the earth's atmosphere
If   itbe granted that rainfall varies with change of the sun's
photosphere, as indicated by the number of sun-spots, and
that cyclones are due to rainfall,          probable that cyclone-
                                           it   is
frequency    will  be subject   to   the same    law of periodicity
which affects the distribution of rainfall, and, consequently,
that the occurrence of cyclones will vary with the number             of
sun-spots.    This probable mutual connexion between phe
nomena apparently unconnected appears to give additional
weight and force to the condensation theory."
   In calling attention to severe cyclones Mr. Eliot remarks,
"That severe cyclones at the head of the Bay during the
month of May have generally occurred about the period of
minimum sun-spots."        He also finds the same connexion
characteristic of the opposite transition-period, viz. October: —
" The three
              cyclones which have occurred in the month of
October during the present century, happened at or near
minimum sun-spot years."         He embodies the results in two
general propositions as follows —      :
   "First. That severe cyclones,        e. cyclonic storms
                                            i.                ex
tending   over a  large  area  and  of  considerable barometric
depression, and therefore attended by         destructive storm-
                                                     a
wave, occur at or near the minimum sun-spot period, and
that the year of minimum solar spots, or the preceding year,
appears to be the most probable.
   " Second. That,
                    during the months of November and De
cember, only ten severe cyclones have occurred during the
present century ;  or, taking every eleventh year as defining
the minimum solar-spot period, they occurred as follows —         :
1822, three storms, viz. in 1822, 23, and 24          1833, three
                                                         ;
storms, viz. in 1831, 32,  and  33   1844, one storm in 1842
                                       ;                              ;
1855, one storm in 1852      ; 1866, one storm in 1864      1877,
                                                             ;
one storm in 1876."      "Hence," Mr. Eliot says, "there              is

      On a new Action of      the Magnet    on  Electric Currents.     225
a strong probability        of at least one severe cyclone at each
minimum solar-spot period, and of its occurring in the samo
year, or in the first or second year before the year of mini
mum spots."
    [It is to be remarked that the three storms at the minimum
period of 1822 occurred in that year and the two years suc-
ceedingit.]
    Mr. Eliot proceeds : — " It will thus be seen that the con
                       I
clusions to which have arrived are quite different from those
established by Mr. Meldrum for the southern Indian Ocean.
His conclusions are that cyclones in that region are most
frequent and most intense at or near the maximum solar-spot
periods."      Mr. Eliot considers that the data are too imperfect
to attempt to assign any reason for this opposite character of
cyclone distribution in the Bay of Bengal and the southern
Indian Ocean as referred to sun-spot periods.
    For the above views, we regard Mr. Eliot as an official
authority. We have read his memoir on the Madras Cyclone,
May 1877, with great interest, and consider that it embodies
very valuable information on cyclones generally.

particularly attracted by the following passage in vol. ii.
p. 144:—
    "It    must be carefully remembered, that the mechanical
force which_urges a conductor carrying a current across the

on the conductor which carries it.               If  the conductor be a
rotating    disk  or a fluid, it  will move  in  obedience  to this force ;
and this motion may or may not be accompanied with a
 change of position of the electric current which it carries.
 But if the current itself be free to choose any path through
 a fixed solid conductor or a network of wires, then, when
 a constant magnetic force is made to act on the system,
 the path of the current through the conductors is not per

    This~sfefein^rit""seeme(i to me to be contrary to the most
natural supposition in the case considered, taking into account
the fact that a wire not bearing a current is in general not
affected by a magnet, and that a wire bearing a current is
affected exactly in proportion to the strength of the current,
while the size and, in general, the material of the wire are
matters of indifference.      Moreover, in explaining the phe
nomena of statical electricity, it is customary to say that
charged bodies are attracted toward each other or the contrary
solely by the attraction or repulsion of the charges for each
other.
    Soon after reading the above statement in Maxwell            I
                                             " Unipolar Induction "

an article by Prof. Edlund, entitled
(Phil. Mag. Oct. 1878, or Annates de Chimie et de Physique,
Jan. 1879), in which the author evidently assumes that a
magnet acts upon a current in a fixed conductor just as it
acts upon the conductor itself when free to move.
  Jindingfliese_two authorities at variance.            I  brought the
question    to- ProfT  Rowland?     He   told    me   he   doubted   the
truth of Maxwell's statement, and had some time before made
a hasty experiment for the purpose of detecting, if possible,
some action of the magnet on the current itself, though with
out success.     Being very busy with other matters however, he
had no immediate intention of carrying the investigation
further.
    I now began to give the matter more attention, and hit
upon    a method that seemed to promise ji_ solution of the
problem.      I laid my plan before rrof. Rowland! and asked
whether he" had any objection to my making the experiment.
He approved of my method in the main, though suggesting
some very important changes in the proposed form and
arrangement of the apparatus.           The experiment proposed
was suggested by the following reflection : —        If  the current of
electricity  in a fixed  conductor is itself  attracted   by a magnet,
the current should be drawn to one side of the wire, and
therefore the resistance experienced should be increased.
    To test this theory, a flat spiral of German-silver wire was
enclosed between two thin disks of hard rubber, and the
whole placed between the poles of an electromagnet in such a
position that the lines of magnetic force would pass through
the spiral at right angles to the current of electricity.           The
wire of the spiral was about        \ millim. in diameter, and the
resistance of the spiral was about two ohms.               The magnet
was worked by a battery of twenty Bunsen cells joined four

                   the Magnet    on Electric Currents.              227
in series and five abreast. The strength of the magnetic field
in which the coil was placed was probably fifteen or twenty
thousand      times  H,    the  horizontal   intensity of the earth's
 magnetism.
    Making the spiral one arm of a Wheatstone's bridge, and
using a low-resistance Thomson galvanometer, so delicately
adjusted as to betray a change of about one part in a million
in the resistance of the spiral,        I  made, from October 7th to
 October 11th inclusive, thirteen series of observations, each
of forty readings.         A reading would first be made with the
magnet active in a certain direction, then a reading with the
magnet inactive, then one with the magnet active in tbe
direction opposite to the first, then with the magnet inactive,
and so on till the series of forty readings was completed.
   Some of the series seemed to show a slight increase of re
sistance due to the action of the magnet, some a slight decrease,
the greatest change indicated by any complete series being
a decrease of about one part in a hundred and fifty thousand.
Nearly all the other series indicated a very much smaller
change, the average change shown by the thirteen series being
a decrease of about one part in five millions.
   Apparently, then, the magnet's action caused no change
in the resistance of the coil.
   But though conclusive, apparently, in respect to any change
of resistance, the above experiments are not sufficient to
prove that a magnet cannot affect an electric current.               If
electricity is assumed to be an incompressible fluid, as some
suspect it to be, we may conceive that the current of elec
tricity flowing in a wire cannot be forced into one side of the
wire or made to flow in any but a symmetrical manner.              The
magnet may tend to deflect the current without being able to
do so.    It is evident, however, that in this case there would
exist a state of stress in the conductor, the electricity pressing,
as it were, toward one side of the wire.            Reasoning thus,   I
thought    it   necessary,   in order  to  make  a  thorough investi
gation of the matter, to test for a difference of potential
between points on opposite sides of the conductor.
   This could be done by repeating the experiment formerly
made by Prof. Rowland, and which was the following : — A
disk or strip of metal, forming part of an electric circuit,
was placed between the poles of an electromagnet, the disk
cutting across the lines of force.        The two poles of a sensitive
galvanometer were then placed in connexion with different
parts of the disk, through which an electric current was
passing, until two nearly fequipotential points were found.
The magnet-current was then turned on and the galvanometer

228            Mr. E. H. Hall       on   anew Action of
 was observed, in order to detect any indication of a change
 in the relative potential of the two poles.
     Owing probably to the fact that the metal disk used had
  considerable thickness, the experiment at that time failed to
  give any positive result. Prof. Rowland now advised me, in
  repeating this experiment, to use gold-leaf mounted on a
  plate of glass as my metal strip.      I
                                         did so, and, experimenting
  as indicated above, succeeded on the 28th of October in ob
  taining, as the effect of the magnet's action, a decided de
  flexion of the galvanometer-needle.
      This deflexion was much too large to be attributed to the
  direct action of the magnet on the galvanometer-needle, or to
  any similar cause. It was, moreover, a permanent deflexion,
  and therefore not to be accounted for by induction.             The
  effect was reversed wben the magnet was reversed.            It was
  not reversed by transferring the poles of the galvanometer
  from one end of the strip to the other.          In short, the phe
  nomena observed were just such as we should expect to see if
  the electric current were pressed, but not moved, toward one
|
  side of the conductor.
      In regard to the direction of this pressure or tendency, as
   dependent on the direction of the current in the gold-leaf and
   the direction of the lines of magnetic force, the following
   statement may be made: —    If   we regard an electric current as
   a single stream flowing from the positive to the negative
   pole, i. e. from the carbon pole of the battery through the
   circuit to the zinc pole, in this case the phenomena observed
   indicate that two currents, parallel and in the same direction,
   tend to repel each other.       If,on the other hand, we regard
   the electric current as a stream flowing from the negative to
   the positive pole, in this case the phenomena observed indicate
   that two currents parallel and in the same direction tend to
   attract each other.
      It of course, perfectly well known that two conductors,
       is,
   bearing currents parallel and in the same direction, are drawn
   toward each other.     Whether this fact, taken in connexion
   with what has been said above, has any bearing upon the
   question of the absolute direction of the electric current,   it   is
   perhaps too early to decide.
       In order to make some rough quantitative experiments,          a
   new plate was prepared, consisting of          a strip of gold-leaf
   about
       2     centims. wide and 9   centims. long mounted on plate-
   glass.    Good contact was ensured by pressing firmly down
   on each end of the strip of gold-leaf      a thick piece of brass
   polished on the underside.      To these pieces of brass the wires
   from
      a     single Bunsen cell were soldered.     The portion of the

                       the Magnet on Electric Currents.                   229
gold-leaf strip not covered] by the pieces of brass was about
5£ centims. in length, and had a resistance of about 2 ohms.
The poles of a high-resistance Thomson galvanometer were
placed in connexion with points opposite each other on the
•edges of the strip of gold-leaf, and midway between the
pieces of brass.           The glass plate bearing the gold-leaf was
fastened, as the first one had been, by a soft cement to the
flat end of one pole of the magnet, the other pole of the
 magnet being brought to within about 6 millims. of the strip
 of gold-leaf.
     The apparatus being arranged as above described, on the
 12th of November a series of observations was made for the
 purpose of determining the variations of the observed effect
 with known variations of the magnetic force and the strength
 of current through the gold-leaf.
      The experiments were hastily and roughly made, but are
 sufficiently accurate, it is thought, to determine the law of
 variation above mentioned as well as the order of magnitude of
 the current through the Thomson galvanometer compared with
 the current through the gold-leaf and the intensity of the
 magnetic field.
      The results obtained are as follows : —

      Though the greatest difference in the last column above
  amounts to about 8 per cent, of the mean quotient, yet it
  seems safe to conclude that, with a given form and arrange
 ment of apparatus, the action on the Thomson galvanometer
 is proportional to the product of the magnetic force by the
  current through the gold-leaf.                This is not the same as
  saying that the effect on the Thomson galvanometer is under
  all circumstances proportional to the current which is passing
  between the poles of the magnet.               If a strip of copper of the
  same length and breadth as the gold-leaf, but £ millim. in
  thickness, is substituted for the latter, the galvanometer fails
  to detect any current arising from the action of the magnet,

 except an induction-current at the moment of making or break
 ing the magnet circuit.
     It has been stated above that in the experiments thus far
 tried the current apparently tends to move, without actually
 moving, toward the side of the conductor.             I  have in mind a
 form of apparatus which will,          I  think, allow the current to
 follow this tendency, and move across the lines of magnetic
 force.     If  this experiment succeeds/^one or two others imme
 diately suggest themselves.
    To make a more complete and accurate study of the phe
 nomenon described in the preceding pages, availing myself
 of the advice and assistance of Prof. Rowland, will probably
 occupy me for some months to come.
    Baltimore,   Nov. 10th, 1879.
    It  is perhaps allowable to speak of the action of the magnet
 as setting up in the strip of gold-leaf a new electromotive
 force at right angles to the primary electromotive force.
    This new electromotive force cannot under ordinary con
 ditions manifest itself, the circuit in which it might work
 being incomplete.         When the circuit is completed by means
 of the Thomson galvanometer, a current flows.
    The actual current througb this galvanometer depends of
 course upon the resistance of the galvanometer and its con
nexions, as well as upon the distance between the two points
of the gold-leaf at which the ends of the wires from the gal
vanometer are applied.            We cannot, therefore, take the ratio
 of C and c above as the ratio of the primary and the trans
verse electromotive forces just mentioned.
    If   we represent by E' the difference of potential of two
points a centimetre apart on the transverse diameter of the
strip of gold-leaf, and by        E  the difference of potential of two
points a centimetre apart on the longitudinal diameter of the
same, a rough and hasty calculation for the experiments
                                        E
already made shows the ratio                to have varied from about
                                        ^
3000 to about 6500.
    The transverse electromotive force E' seems to be, under
ordinary circumstances, proportional to Mv, where              M  is the
intensity of the magnetic field and v is the velocity of the
electricity in the gold-leaf. Writing for v the equivalent ex

        " On the Oligocene Strata of   the Hampshire Basin."     By Prof.
John W. Judd, F.R.S., Sec.G.S.
    The study of the succession of strata in the fluvio-marine
series of the Isle of Wight and the New Forest is attended with
considerable difficulties, partly on account of the inconstant character
of the beds composing estuarine formations, and partly because of
the thick superficial deposits which everywhere cover them.            By
Webster a Lower Freshwater Series, a Middle Marine, and an
Upper Freshwater Series were recognized ; but Mr. Prestwich
showed, in the year 1846, that at Hamstead Cliff we have both
freshwater and marine strata lying above all these ; and in 1853
Edward Forbes proved that the marine and freshwater strata seen
at Bembridge Ledge were not, as had previously been supposed, the
 equivalent of those of Headon Hill, but occupy a distinct and
higher horizon. Hitherto, however (in spite of some suggestions to
the contrary which were made by Dr. Wright and Prof. Hebert), the
strata exposed at the base of Headon Hill have been believed to be
a repetition, through an anticlinal fold, of those seen at Colwell and
Totland Bays.
    In the present memoir it is shown, both by stratigraphical
 and palseontological    evidence, that the Colwell- and Totland-Bay
beds are distinct from and overlie those at the base of Headon Hill.
 The distinctness and importance of the purely marine series ex
 posed at Whitecliff Bay, Colwell Bay, and several localities in the
 New Forest is pointed out ; and it is shown that, among the 200
 forms of Mollusca which they contain, only one fifth are found in
 the Barton Clay below.       For this important division of the strata
 the name of the Brockenhurst Series is proposed.
    In consequence of the detection of an error in the accepted order
 of succession of the strata, a rectification of the classification of the
 fluvio-marine series is rendered necessary; and it is proposed to
 divide them as follows : —
     1. The Hempstead Series (marine and estuarine), 100 feet.
    2. The Bembridge Group (estuarine), 300 feet.
    3. The Brockenhurst Scries (marine), 25 to 100 feet.
    4. The Headon Group (estuarine), 400 feet.
    By this new grouping the strata of the Hampshire Basin are
 brought into exact correlation with those of France, Belgium,
 North Germany, and Switzerland ; and the whole series of fluvio-
 marine beds in the Isle of Wight, which are shown to have a thick
 ness of between 800 and 900 feet, are proved to be the represen
 tatives of the Lower and Middle Oligocene of those countries. The

use of  the term Oligocene in this country is advocated on the
ground that hy its adoption only can we avoid the inconvenient
course of dividing the fluvio-marine series between the Eocene and
the Miocene.

  ON INTERMITTENT             CURRENTS AND THE INDUCTION-BALANCE.
         To   the   Editors of    the    Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
     Gentlemen,
TX7TTH       reference to my communication on the subject of the
 *   *   Induction-Balance in your last issue, will you permit me to
add a word in order to avoid any possible misunderstanding with
reference to section 1.
     I
     have there rather unguardedly spoken of the induction-balance
as  if   I considered that all Prof. Hughes had done was to apply
a telephone to it.                I
                               by no means intended to convey this
impression.       Of  course   it is perfectly true, and Prof. Hughes
himself points it out (Phil. Mag. July 1879), that induction-currents
had been balanced by a double pair of coils by both Dove and
Felici some time ago ; but, nevertheless, the induction-balance as
devised by Prof. Hughes must be regarded as an essentially new
instrument ; for no one could have obtained the same effects from
the old
          " differential inductor " of Dove without enormous modi
fication.
   Soon after hearing of Prof. Hughes's discovery, tried to obtainI
his effects with numerous coils which happened to be accessible in
University College Laboratory, varying the conditions in several
ways ; and          I
                  experienced the most uniform failure in getting a
good "balance" (that               is,
                                perfect silence in the telephone) until                 I
abandoned all of them and imitated Prof. Hughes's arrangement
and dimensions very closely. A
                                           " balance," in fact,     a very   is
difficult thing to obtain with such            detector in the circuit as
                                                     a                                  a
telephone; for          it influenced not only by the least want of
                             is
equality, but also by the least want of synchronism between the
two opposing electromotive forces.
   Pew persons, therefore, can appreciate more highly than               do       I
the unremitting toil which Prof. Hughes must have devoted to his
 experiments, before contriving the induction-balance and sonometer
in their present form.

 ON THE CARRYING-POWER                      OF MAGNETS.     BY PROF.    J.   STEFAN.
   In the calculation of the carrying-power of magnets three
forces are to be distinguished — the attraction of the magnetic
                                            :   1,
masses on the contact-surfaces of the magnet and armature  the                ;    2,
actions at distance which those masses undergo from the free

              Intelligence   and Miscellaneous   Articles.         233
magnetic portions of the magnet and armature ; 3, the actions at
distance of the free portions of the magnet upon those of the
armature.
   The calculation can be accomplished if the distribution of the
magnetism in the magnet and armature is known. This, however,
can only be ascertained in few cases. Two such are treated in the
present memoir : in the first the magnet and armature constitute
by their combination a ring magnet ; in the second, a uniformly
magnetized sphere.
   In the first case no free magnetic portions occur, the carrying-
power is determined by the attraction of the masses present at the
contact-surfaces alone. With this case is connected the solution
of three problems.
   The first problem has respect to the determination of the maxi
mum of carrying-power which can be imparted to a ring magnet.
This can be calculated from the greatest value the magnetic
moment of the unit volume of iron is oapable of taking, and
amounts to 12450 grams for each square centimetre of contact-
surface.
   The second problem refers to the representation of the connexion
between the carrying-power and the intensity of the current by
which the ring is magnetized. This connexion cannot at present
be expressed by a valid formula ; but probably the nature of it
can be ascertained with tolerable accuracy.        The carrying-power
rises at first in a much greater proportion than the intensity of
the current, until it attains a fourth part of its maximal value ;
thenceforward the carrying-power rises more slowly than the
current-intensity.    In the vicinity of the value above given the
carrying-power remains during a considerable interval nearly pro
portional to the intensity of the current.
   The third problem concerns the determination of the dependence
of the carrying-power on the situation of the plane which divides
the ring into magnet and armature.       When these latter form un
equal segments of the ring, the carrying-power is less, notwith
standing the greater surface of contact ; it diminishes in nearly
the same proportion as the surface of contact increases when the
plane of contact moves away from the axis of the ring.
   If the magnet and armature form a spherical magnet, all three
sorts of forces come in to be calculated.        The influence of the
free magnetic masses which are upon the surface of the sphere
diminishes the carrying-power.      The relative carrying-power    (i.e.
that which falls to the unit of surface of contact)    isgreatest when
magnet and armature are hemispheres      ;  but even in this case  it   is
 only half as great as that of     a ring magnet.     The further the
 plane dividing the sphere into magnet and armature          isfrom the
 centre, the less is  the relative carrying-power  ;  so that the total
 capacity of carrying diminishes with the fourth power of the
radius of the surface of contact. — Sitzung cler mathematiscli-natur-

  ON A METHOD OF STUDYING THE REFLEXION                  OF SOUND-WAVES.
    BY 0. N. ROOD, PROFESSOR OF PHYSICS IN COLUMBIA COLLEGE.
    It has been the custom for several years to introduce in certain
 forms of the melodeon a revolving fan for the purpose of obtaining
 rapid alternations in the intensity of the notes. This arrangement
 is called a " tremolo ;" and its action was considered by its inventor
 and by those interested in it to depend on the currents of air pro
 duced by the motion of the fan.        An examination of the apparatus
  soon convinced me that this idea was erroneous, and that the alterna
 tions in the loudness of the sound was due to reflexion or non-re
 flexion from the face of the revolving fan ; for          I   found that the
  same effects could be produced by the aid of a circular disk consist
 ing of open and closed sectors and revolving in its own plane. A
 disk of this kind constitutes a useful piece of apparatus for studying
 the reflexion of sound-waves ; and some results obtained with it
 were communicated by me to the National Academy of Sciences
 as long ago as October, 1876.
    As no account of these experiments has ever been published, a
 short description of them may not be without interest to those
 engaged in experimental researches on sound, as with their aid the
 following facts may be easily demonstrated.
     1st. At a perpendicular incidence the short sound-waves are more
 copiously reflected than those that are longer ; and the regular reflexion
 is more copious from large than from small surfaces.
    The diameter of the zinc disk was, in the first set of experiments,
 21 inches = 53-3 centimetres ; alternate quadrants were removed,
 and the rate of rotation varied from two to four turns in a second.
 The tuning-forks were mounted on their resonance-boxes, and
 gradually removed away from the revolving disk till the alternations
 could no longer be distinguished by the ear placed near the fork.
 The results are given in the table below, in which " distance" indi
 cates that of the open end of the tuning-fork from the disk : —
                                                              inches.
          Diameter of disk                                      21
          Ut3 fork,   alternations heard   at a distance  of    13
          Ut4   „            „           ,,           „         20
          Ut5 „              „           „             „        96
    When the same experiments were made with a disk having a
 diameter of only           inches or 21"5 centimetres, it was found
 necessary to bring the forks much nearer to the disk before the
alternations could be perceived.                             inches
          Diameter of disk                                      8|
          Ut3 fork, alternations heard at a distance of 2
          Ut4  ,,            ,,         ,,            ,,        3
          Ut,  it            »»         »             »         6
    2nd. When      the sound-waves  fall upon small flat       surfaces at an
acute angle, the reflexion is most copious in the same direction as with
light, but the reflected and inflected waves can be traced all around the
semicircle.

                 Intelligence  and Miscellaneous    Articles.           235
   Experiments on this point were made in the open air, the larger
disk being used with angles of 60° and 70° (from the perpendicu
lar) ; the Ut4 and TJt5 forks were employed.
   The regularly reflected waves could be heard at a distance of ten
or twenty feet from the disk, the fork being held a foot or two
from it ; inflected waves were easily distinguishable all around the
disk and even a few feet behind the fork.
    When the forks were placed in the plane of the disk the alter
nations of loudness were reduced to a minimum, but, in the open
air and in a room, never wholly disappeared.         This   I suppose to be
owing to the fact that the source of sound is not a point but a sur
face.    Even under these circumstances, feeble alternations were
heard all around the disk, the inflected waves actually returning to
their source.       With a plain, disk alternations were not perceived.
    3rd. Qualitative comparisons between the power of different sub
stances   to reflect sound can easily be made.
    Eor  example, a disk of card-board in which filter-paper is fastened
over the open sectors gives alternations, owing to the difference of
the reflective powers of the two substances.
    4th.   If a composite sound-wave falls on the rotating disk, the shorter
waves will undergo regular reflexion more copiously than the other
components.
    This experiment is most easily made with           a reed without its
pipe. Ut3, Ut4, TJt5 reeds give alternations,        but mainly in their
high overtones ; the alternations consequently        have a ringing me
tallic sound.
    5th. The reflexion of sound from very small       surfaces is easily de
monstrated.
    Li an Ut3 or TJt4 reed without its pipe be employed, alternations
 are easily obtained by moving a visiting card properly near the
reed.     By substituting a gas-flame for the card the reflexion from
 the flame can be demonstrated.        The gas-burner should be attached
to a long slender rod.
    Almost all of these experiments are so easily performed as to be
suitable for lecture-room purposes. — Silliman's American Journal,

   EXPERIMENTS        ON THE COMPRESSION OP GASEOUS           MIXTURES.
                              BY L. CAILLETET.
    When a mixture of air and carbonic acid is enclosed in the
apparatus which served me for the liquefaction of gases, the lique
faction of the carbonic acid undergoes (as already observed by
Andrews and several other physicists) a retardation often very
great : it is even possible to compress at zero C. to more than 400
atmospheres 1 volume of air and 1 vol. of carbonic acid mixed,
without obtaining any alteration of aspect in the tube.
    By compressing in the apparatus 5 vols, of carbonic acid and
1 vol. of air, the carbonic acid is readily liquefied.         If then the
pressure     be   carried  to 150 or  200 atmospheres,    the meniscus of
the liquefied acid, which till then was concave and of perfect sharps

  236              Intelligence  and Miscellaneous  Articles.
  ness,   becomes plane, loses its sharpness, is progressively effaced ;
  at last the liquid entirely disappears.         The tube then appears
  filled with a homogenous body which henceforth resists all pressure
  as a liquid would do.
       If now the pressure be slowly diminished, at a pressure which
  is constant for determinate temperatures the liquid suddenly re
  appears ; a thick mist is produced, which expands, vanishes in a
  moment, and marks the level of the liquid which has just re
  appeared.
       The following numbers indicate the course of the phenomenon : —
  The mixture operated on being formed of approximately 5 vols, of
  carbonic acid and 1 vol. of air, the liquid carbonic acid reappears at
            atm.                                                0

           The carbonic gas compressed above 350 atm.
               is no longer liquefied at                      21
      This phenomenon of the disappearance of the liquid cannot be
 explained by the heat which the compression evolves ; for in this
 experiment the tube dips in water, which keeps it at a constant
 temperature, and the compression takes place with sufficient slowness
 for the cooling to be always complete.
      In reality every thing goes on as if at a certain degree of com
pression the carbonic acid spread into the gas which surmounts it,
producing a homogeneous             body without sensible alteration of
volume.         There is therefore nothing to prevent us from assuming
 that the gas and the liquid have dissolved in one another.        I have
essayed to verify this hypothesis by colouring the liquefied carbonic
acid.      Of all the substances tried, iodine alone could be dissolved
in the acid ; but, unfortunately, in this experiment the mercury is
rapidly attacked, and the phenomenon is immediately masked by
the iodide of mercury which is deposited on the wall of the tube.
     It might, however, be supposed that the disappearance of the
liquid is only apparent, that, the index of refraction of the com
pressed air increasing more quickly than that of the liquid carbonic
acid, a moment arrives when, the two indices becoming equal, the
surface of separation between the liquid and the gas ceases to be
visible. But if the pressure of the system were then augmented
by some hundreds of atmospheres, the surface separating the gas
from the liquid would become again visible, the index of refraction
of the gas continuing, by hypothesis, to increase more rapidly than
that of the liquid.
     Now the experiment, tried up to 450 atmospheres, gave only
negative results.          "We may, then, suppose that under high pres
sures a gas and a liquid can be dissolved in one another so as to
form a homogeneous whole. — Comptes Rendus de V Academic des

1.  "DETWEEN           the years 1841 and 1846 Joule made a series
    -D     of experiments on the development of heat during
electrolysis, which led him to the conclusions : — that when
a current is passed through a fluid conductor, heat is developed
in accordance with the same law as that which he found to
obtain with a solid metallic wire, viz. that the heat produced
in a given time is proportionate to the square of the current
and to the resistance of the conductor — usually known as
Joule's law ; that if electrolysis is produced, the actual heat
developed in the electrolyte is less than that deducible from
this law by a quantity precisely equal to the amount that
would be given out in re-forming from its products of decom
position the compound decomposed ; and consequently that it
is possible to determine the " heat of formation
                                                        " of a com
pound by the inverse method of determining the heat absorbed
during its electrolysis. The actual results thus obtained, as
              "                     " of
regards the heat of formation            copper sulphate, zinc sul
phate, and water, were communicated to the French Academy
in 1846, but were not published in detail until 1852 (Phil. Mag.
[4] vol. iii. p. 481).     Some few months before they appeared,
l)r. Thomas Woods published (ibid. vol. ii. p. 268) the results
of experiments showing that in the decomposition of water by
electrolysis a quantity of heat is taken up approximately equal

    2. Joule's method of operating is described by him in the
following words:—               "I
                           take a glass vessel filled with the solu
tion of an electrolyte and properly furnished with electrodes ;
I  place the electrolytic cell in the voltaic circuit for a given
length of time, and carefully observe the quantity of decompo
sition and the heat evolved.       By the law of Ohm then ascer                    I

which would have been evolved had wire of such resistance        a
been placed in the current instead of the electrolytic cell: this
theoretical quantity, being compared with the heat actually
evolved in the electrolytic cell,        always found to exceed the
                                                        is
latter considerably.      The difference between the results evi
dently gives the quantity of heat absorbed during the electro
lysis, and      therefore equivalent to the heat which
                  is                                           due to                  is
the reverse chemical combination by combustion or other
means" (Joe. cit. pp. 493, 494).
    Put into symbols this may be thus expressed — Let              be             :         hi

the numbers found by direct determination of the heat of com
bustion of hydrogen in oxygen being close to 34100, gramme-
degrees, according to the most trustworthy experiments (vide
   3.  Joule further applied this principle to the electrolysis of
zinc and copper sulphates, and found that the heat actually
developed in the electrolytic cell was in each case less than that
which would be developed in a wire " obstructing the current"
equally with the cell by a quantity sensibly equal to the heat
that would be generated by the oxidation of the metal liberated
during the electrolysis by the oxygen simultaneously set free,
together with that produced by the solution in the dilute sul
phuric acid also formed of the metallic oxide thus produced.
That this should be so is an evident deduction from the prin
ciple of conservation of energy ; for if the total work that
could be done in the passage of a current 0 through a resist
ance R in a time t be expressed by the formula C2Ri (Joule's
law), and some of that work be performed not as heat but in
undoing chemical combination, it results that the amount of
work actually done as sensible heat must be just so much less
than CHt as corresponds to the chemical work performed.
   4. The experiments of Woods were of a far less accurate
kind than those of Joule, but were based on much the same
principles.   A current being passed through an electrolytic
cell for a given time, the heat developed was roughly measured
and the amount of decomposition ; a wire was then substituted
for this electrolytic cell of such resistance that the current
passing was the same as before (the electromotor remaining
the same).    The heat developed in this wire being determined,
was found to exceed that produced in the electrolytic cell in
the same time by a quantity sensibly equal to that which
would be generated by the recombination of the products of
electrolysis.
   The formula just deduced for Joule's method of experi
menting then becomes

                              w
for Ci=03 and     o=l.
   5.  In 1865  Joule's results were confirmed by Eaoult (Ann.
                                S2

240       Dr. C. It. A. Wright on    the Determination of
de C/rim. et de Phys. 4th series, ii. p. 317, and iv. p. 392) by a
method which will be discussed later on (§ 23). The amount
of heat absorbed per gramme-equivalent of water decomposed
was found by Baoult to be 34028, or sensibly the same as that
deduced by direct combustion ; whilst similar results were
obtained with copper sulphate.         In 1869 Kiechl published
experiments ( Wien. Akad. Ber. Ix. [2] 121) in principle the
same as Joule's, but differing considerably in the details, no
tably in that the wire was made into a rheostat, so that its
resistance could be regulated throughout the observations.
As a mean of nine accordant experiments, 33653 was found to
be the heat absorbed per gramme-equivalent of water decom
posed.    Shortly before this, Favre demonstrated in a very
simple way (Comptes Rendus, Ixvi. p. 252 ; Pogg. Ann. cxxxv.
p. 300) that as much heat is absorbed during the decomposi
tion of an electrolyte as is produced by the recombination of
the products of decomposition.       A small battery was enclosed
in a calorimeter, and the heat produced by the solution of a
given quantity of zinc determined, the current produced being
made to circulate through a coil of wire also contained in the
calorimeter; so that the total heat generated was determined.
A voltameter was then substituted for the coil of wire, when
the quantity of heat was found to be lessened by an amount
equal to 34,204 gramme-degrees per gramme-equivalent of
zinc dissolved,    i. e. of water decomposed.       Similarly when
copper sulphate was decomposed instead of water, the heat-
evolution was lessened by an amount sensibly equal to the
heat evolved in the synthesis of the salt.
   6. In 1851 Sir William Thomson carried the ideas suggested
by the experiments of Joule and others a considerable way
further. In a remarkable paper on the mechanical theory of
electrolysis (Phil. Mag. 1851, vol. ii. p. 429), he demonstrated
that the force of chemical affinity is expressible in terms of
electromotive force, and calculated, from data largely fur
nished by Joule, that the work done in decomposing water
corresponds    to an E.M.F. of 3,305,400          foot-grain-second
electromagnetic     units (equal to   1*415 x 108  C.G.S. units, or
 1*415 volt), that representing the sum of the chemical actions
in a Daniell cell corresponding to 2,507,100 (equal to 1*074
 X 108 C.G.S. units); so that the "affinity" between oxygen
and hydrogen in water is            = 1*318 times as strong as the
                              ^.q^
bum of the affinities exerted in the chemical changes going on
in a Daniell cell.     Similar calculations, based on more recent
determinations of the values involved, lead to somewhat higher
numbers, approximating to 1*502 x 108 C.G.S. units for water

           Chemical Affinity in term&    of Electromotive Force.        241
and 1*154 x      108  for the Daniell cell (vide       § 16), giving the
ratio i-TTT = 1'302.
          1-154
     7. The general proposition that the force of chemical affi
nity is expressible in terms of E.M.F. may be simply demon
strated as follows: — Let the strength of chemical combination,
or the chemical work done by the force of chemical affinity, be
defined as the absolute amount of work spent or gained in
 the synthesis from its constituents of a given weight (say
 1 gramme) of the compound considered.                This work may be
 expressed in terms of heat, and is ordinarily measured as such :
 thus in the synthesis of a gramme of water from gaseous
 oxygen and hydrogen at the ordinary pressure and tempe
 rature, an amount of work is done representing an evolution
 of a quantity of heat amounting, according to the most accu
 rate determinations, to close upon 3800 gramme-degrees
 (§ 31); whence, taking the mechanical equivalent of heat as
 42 megalergs per gramme-degree*, the work done in this
 synthesis is close to 16 erg-tens =16 x 1010 C.G.S. units.
     The experiments of Faraday first demonstrated the two fol
 lowing laws, which have since been fully confirmed by many
  other experimenters: —
     I. When a compound is electrolyzed, the weight of sub
 stance decomposed is proportionate to the quantity of electri
 city passing.      [A low degree of conductivity is supposed by
  some experimenters to be possessed by electrolytes, of such a
 nature that very feeble currents can be passed through them
 without causing any chemical decomposition ; this, however,
  even if admitted to be the case, would not appreciably inter
  fere with the correctness of the foregoing proposition.]
      II.  When a current is passed for a given time successively
  through several compounds so as to electrolyze them all, it
  decomposes quantities of them in the ratio of simple functions
  of their " molecular weights," evolving the products of decom
  position, when elementary, in the ratio of simple functions of
  their combining numbers or " atomic weights."                The quanti
  ties of compounds decomposed and of elements evolved by a
  current which evolves 1 part of hydrogen from water under
  these circumstances are called their " equivalent values," or,
  more briefly, their equivalents, in reference to the particular
  compounds decomposed.
     * The values obtained by Joule by friction of water lie somewhat
  below this figure (near to 41-5 x 10'); whilst that deduced by him from
  the development of heat by electric currents in a wire of known resistance
  lies somewhat above it (42-10 x 10"). Numbers lying somewhat above
  42x10" have been obtained by Hirn, Violle, and Regnault (vide §§ 33 &

242            Dr. C. E. A. Wright on                           the   Determination of
   Law I. may be thus expressed : — Let n be the number of
grammes of compound decomposed, and q the quantity of elec
tricity passing          ;   then
                                               n   oc q.
     Law      II.   states that,         if   a be the                "equivalent" of a given
compound,

city passing, and of the value of the
                                         " equivalent " of the
compound.
     When n= a, %=-                  ;   that      is,     %    is   the reciprocal of the quan
tity of electricity requisite to decompose a gramme-equivalent
of the electrolyte employed.       For convenience of reference,
     may be termed the electrochemical constant.

 Hence the mean of this value and that deduced by Kohlrausch
 from his own observations (viz. ^=0-00010527) may be taken

     10. If it were possible to obtain a current between the two
 electrodes of a voltameter or other similar electrolytic cell
 which would decompose the electrolyte without any disturb
 ance of the thermal equilibrium, then the difference of poten
 tial between the electrodes would represent the force of che
 mical affinity exerted between the products of decomposition
 in the compound examined ; for if e be the potential-difference
 (E.M.F. existing between the electrodes) during the passage
 of a quantity of electricity q, eq units of work will be done.

     n grammes of substance are decomposed, and is the work
 done by the force of chemical affinity in the synthesis of a
 gramme of substance from the products of decomposition, the
 total work done is also expressed by nf, which, by the defini
 tion of electrochemical equivalents (§ 8), — axif-       Hence

 Or " affinity," reckoned per gramme-equivalent, is measured
 by electromotive force divided by a quantity which is constant ;
 i. e. the work done in the synthesis of a gramme-equivalent of
 substance is expressible by a value indicated in electromotive-
 force units, just as it is expressible by a value indicated in
 heat units — the one valuation involving the constant %, the
-other   J.
    11. In practice it is impossible to realize this supposition ;
 for experiment shows that, in the passage of electricity between
 two electrodes, work is done not only as chemical decomposi
 tion but also as heat ; by determining the amount of the latter,
 however, it is easy to calculate how much of the total potential-
 difference existent between the electrodes is due to the chemical
 affinity of the constituents : thus, if h gramme-degrees         are
 evolved during the decomposition of n grammes of substance
 of electrochemical equivalent ax by the transfer of a quantity
 of electricity q, and if E represent the total potential-difference
 existent between the electrodes, the total work done in the
 electrolytic cell is Eg1, of which AJ is done as heat.       Hence
 Eg— hS is done as chemical decomposition.        Jjet this be equal
 to eq, where e is the E.M.F. representing the chemical affi
 nity to be measured ; then

    Experiments made in this way (detailed in Part II., vide
also § 32) have given numbers for the value of e in the case
of water closely corresponding with the value of e deducible
from direct combustion-experiments by the formula arrived at
above (§ 10), viz.

    12. On attentively considering the phenomena attendant on
 electrolysis, it is evident that it by no means follows that the
 direct action of the current causes the entire change taking
 place ; physical changes of state and chemical actions second
 ary to those due to the action of this current alone may occur ;
 so that the value of e thus deduced, although representing the
 E.M.F. corresponding to the nett work done in the sum of the
 total changes taking place, and consequently representing the
 " affinity    between the ultimate products in the original com*
 pound    as above  defined, is not necessarily a measure of the ten
 dency to combine together of the substances primarily formed by
 the electrolytic decomposition.     For instance, suppose that in
 the electrolysis of water the primary products are ordinary
 gaseous hydrogen and ozone, the latter becoming subsequently
 transformed (by a secondary chemical action) into ordinary
 gaseous oxygen : then, since heat is evolved in the conversion
 of ozone into oxygen to the extent of 14,800 gramme-degrees
 per 24 grammes of oxygen (Berthelot, Bull. Soc. Chim. Paris,
 1876, vol. xxvi. p. 56), or 4933 gramme-degrees per 8 grammes
 of oxygen (corresponding to 9 grammes of water), the valuo
 of  e deduced as   just indicated will  be  below the true value by

246              Dr. C. It.   A. Wright           on the   Determination       of
                                 4933
an amount equal to                        =   14"5 per cent, j           for the negative
                                 gjjQQ
term in the expression E— H^J will have been overestimated
by that quantity.
   Again, suppose that the water is brought by a secondary
physical action into a quasi-vaporous state before it is decom
posed by the current into gaseous hydrogen and oxygen         g.                        (e.
on the molecular theory of the constitution of matter, suppose
that only detached molecules of water are operated on by the
current, and not the water en masse in the liquid state); since
about 600 gramme-degrees are required to volatilize gramme                     a
of water at the ordinary temperature (the latent heat of steam
at near 15° being about 600), or 5400 per gramme-equivalent,
the value of deduced as above will be too large by about
                     e

               =^        Per cen^ because in this              case the negative        term
—
     H^J willbe underestimated to that extent.
     Consequently,         if
                     both secondary actions be supposed to take
place      (t.
          e.  the if
                   electrolysis proper takes place between de
tached molecules of water converting them into gaseous h}>

per cent, too large.
   Suppose, again, that the primary electrolytic action        'te                  is
convert liquid water into liquid oxygen and hydrogen, and
that the conversion of these liquefied elements into the ordinary
gaseous condition     due to secondary physical changes
                            is                                                      ;   it    is
evident that the value of       found as above
                                          e         too large by          is
           x         per cent., where             1^   represents the heat that     is   ab
ojjTjQ
sorbed in the vaporization of a gramme-equivalent of each of
the liquefied gases taken together.'
   Yet again, in the electrolysis of copper sulphate, suppose
that whilst the ultimate chemical change     expressed by the       is
equation
                         CuS04   +   H2   O   = Cu +       O   +   H2   SO,,

                    is

              (2) CuO             = Cu + 0;
it    evident that the value of deduced as above will be greater
     is                                       e
than that corresponding to the second change only, by an
amount equivalent to the heat absorbed during the first change.

sponding to the heat of formation            (for instance) water
from gaseous oxygen and hydrogen, and, secondly, that requi
site to produce electrolysis proper apart from secondary physical
and chemical changes.     It is evident that, if such determina
tions are practicable, the comparison of the two sets of values
might lead to interesting conclusions as to the nature of these
secondary actions, and might throw light on the internal me
chanism of the chemical changes taking place, and especially
on the phenomena connected with the " nascent state." Re
sults in this direction have already been obtained by Favre,
with this difference, that the values are expressed in gramme-
degrees, being obtained entirely by calorimetric observations.
The discussion of the observations of this kind already made
by previous experimenters, and of the writer's results (obtained
chiefly by electrical measurements),       will be resumed in a
future paper, the present essay having chiefly reference to the
determination of the E.M.F. representing the sum of the
physical and chemical actions taking place during electrolysis.
It should, however, be noticed in connexion with this subject,
that since Sir William Thomson first sketched out the Mecha
nical Theory of Electrolysis (loc. cit. supra), more exact mea
surements have shown that the E.M.F. actually capable of
being generated by a given voltaic combination is by no
means necessarily equal to the sum of the physical and che
mical changes taking place in the pile, and that it is not ne
cessarily constant for the same ultimate chemical change —
varying with the temperature, the state of dilution of the so
lutions used, &c.
   14. For example, when zinc is dissolved in dilute sulphuric
acid, the total ultimate change is expressed by the equation
                  H2 S04 + Zn = Ha + ZnS04,
which corresponds     to an evolution of somewhat     more    than
18,000 gramme-degrees      per gramme-equivalent of zinc dis
solved or of hydrogen liberated, and representing therefore
about 18000 x 0-000105 x 42 x 106=0'794 x 108 C.G.S. units
of E.M.F., or about 0-794 volt.     Similarly, when zinc or any
analogous  metal  is dissolved  in any other acid     g. hydro
                                                    (e.

nature of the second metal ; and whilst the E.M.F. produced
is rarely, if ever, precisely equal to /i^J even at first, when a
current has been made to circulate for some short time the
E.M.F. is found to have diminished to an amount depending
on the rate of evolution of hydrogen on the surface of the
other plate, the character of ite surface, the temperature, &c
This is usually expressed by saying that the plates become
" polarized," or that a " counter electromotive force " x is
set up, diminishing the effective E.M.F. of the arrangement
from E, which it was at first, to E— x, the value of x varying
with circumstances.
    From the principle of the conservation of energy it results
 that, when the current circulates, the difference between the
work hyj x Q which would be performed during the passage
of a quantity of electricity Q sufficient to decompose a gramme-
 equivalent of substance, and (E— x)Q the work which the
 current can actually perform, must make its appearance as
 sensible heat. If, therefore, E — x < J>xJ, the electromotor must
rise in temperature from this cause — irrespective of the rise
 due to the fact that, as the current traverses the electromotive
 equally with the rest of tho circuit, heat is developed therein
 in proportion to its resistance in accordance with Joule's law
 (§ 1).
         If,   however, E— #>A^J, the battery     is   of necessity
 proportionately   cooled
                        ;   andif   the experiment     isso carried
 out that the resistance of the battery    is small compared with
 that of the rest of the circuit, so that the heat developed in
 the battery in accordance with Joule's law      is  but small, the
 cooling effect may be made to preponderate over the heating
 effect, so that an absorption of heat on the whole takes place
 in the battery.
     15. This effect has been experimentally studied by Favre
  (Comptes Rendus, lxvi. p. 252, lxvii. p. 1012, lxviii. p. 1300,
 and lxix. p. 34), who has shown that under the last-named con
 ditions an absorption of heat takes place during the solution
 of zinc or cadmium in hydrochloric acid, whilst heat-evolution
 takes place   if sulphuric acid be substituted for hydrochloric.
  In other words, the secondary actions set up, as          awhole,
  absorb heat in the first case and evolve      it  in the second.
  Similarly in two-fluid batteries, such as Daniell's and Grove's,
  analogous results were obtained, although in these cases
                                                               "
                                                                 po

  produced.     With cells after Daniell's construction heat was
  found to be evolved by the secondary actions, though not to    a
  very large extent (about 4*3 per cent, of the heat due to tho

        Chemical Affinity in terms  of Electromotive Force.   249
consumption of zinc and precipitation of copper); whilst with
a Grove's battery a considerably larger heat-absorption took
place, amounting to about 11*9 per cent., of the heat due to
solution of zinc and reduction of nitric acid.
   16. This result with a Daniell cell is borne out by expe
riments of a different kind.       The E.M.F. which a Daniell
cell is practically capable of giving has been variously esti
mated by different observers, at from 1*05 to 1*14 volt, 1*10
to 1*12 being a usual average.       The E.M.F. corresponding
to the heat evolved in the reaction
                   CuS04 + Zn=Cu + ZnS04
(which expresses the ultimate change in a Daniell cell, apart
from local action) is several per cent, higher. Thus Favre
estimated the heat thus evolved per gramme-equivalent to be
27,388 (Comptes Rendus, lxiii. p. 369), and subsequently as
25,060 {ibid. Ixix. p. 35) : the mean of these two numbers is
26,224, corresponding to an E.M.F. of 26,224 x 0-000105 x
42 x 106 = 1-156 x 10* O.G.S. units, or 1-156 volt.         Julius
Thomsen has calculated (Berichte deiit. chem. Ges. 1872,
vol. v. p. 170) from his own determinations, together with
those of Andrews, Dulong, Hess, and Favre and Silbermann,
that the heat-evolutions taking place during the formation of
zinc sulphate and copper sulphate are respectively 108,460 and
56,216 per "gramme-molecule"         (these formations being ex
pressed   in Thomsen's   symbols  thus — Zn, O, S03, aq, and Cu,
 O, S03, aq). Hence the heats are 54,230 and 28,108 per
gramme-equivalent ; whence the displacement of copper from
copper sulphate by metallic zinc, forming copper and zinc
sulphate, must give rise to an evolution of 54,230—28,108 =
 26,122 gramme-degrees per gramme-equivalent, corresponding
to 26,122 xxJ= 1-152 volt.
    17. Results analogous to those of Favre have also been ob
tained by Eaoult (Ann. de Chim. et de Phys. 4th series, ii.
p. 317, and iv. p. 392) — some forms of voltaic combinations
 giving rise to the production of more heat outside the battery
 than corresponds to the heat evolved by the ultimate chemical
 and physical changes taking place therein, and others to less.
 Raoult found that the current from the Daniell cell used by
 him was capable of doing total work equal to 23,900 gramme-
 degrees per gramme-equivalent of zinc dissolved in each cell :
 this represents only 23,900 x%J= 1*054 volt, a quantity less
 by 8*5 per cent, than the value calculated above from Thom
 sen's figures as the E.M.F. corresponding to the sum of the
 chemical and physical actions taking place in the cell.
    To express the difference between the heat actually produ

250       Dr. C. R. A. "Wright    on the Determination of
cible  by the sum of the chemical and physical actions taking
place in an electromotor and that corresponding to the current
actually obtainable from the electromotor, Raoult calls the first
the chemical heat of the pile, and the latter the voltaic' heat
thereof ; whilst the terms chemical heat and galvanic heat have
been employed by Edlund to indicate these quantities respec
tively (Phil. Mag. 1877, vol. iii. pp. 428 & 501) ; so that the
above results may be indicated by saying that the chemical
heat of a Daniell battery is 26,122 gramme-degrees              (per
gramme-equivalent of zinc dissolved), whilst the voltaic or
galvanic heat is 23,900, and so on. Several points touched
upon in these papers are of interest as bearing on the problem
of the determination of the amount of E.M.F. corresponding
to the primary effects of electrolysis ; their discussion, like
that of several analogous memoirs by previous observers, is
postponed till a later occasion.
   18. In order to apply the general method above indicated
(§ 11) for the determination of the E.M.F. corresponding to
the sum of the chemical and physical actions taking place du
ring electrolysis, it is requisite to determine: — first, the differ
ence of potential subsisting between the electrodes ; secondly,
the quantity of electricity passing in a given time (known
from the weight of substance decomposed); and, thirdly, the
heat evolved as such in the electrolytic cell in that time.      The
first quantity may be found approximately by the aid of a sine
galvanometer of very high resistance.       A method which is in
principle substantially this has already been used by Raoult
(he: cit.); this will be more fully discussed further on
(§ 23).
   Another way of determining it may be based upon obser
vations with a voltameter, thus : — The amount of decomposi
tion produced in a given time t by passing a current from the
battery employed (of E.M.F. = E') through the voltameter
is noticed =% ; the electrolytic cell is then placed also in cir
cuit, and the amount of decomposition in the voltameter in the
same time t again determined = n2, and also the heat pro*
duced in the cell = h.     R being the resistance of the battery,
voltameter, and connexions, and r being the resistance of a
wire " obstructing the current equally with the electrolytic
cell," the currents flowing in the two cases are respectively
             \ji=nlxk=-^-      and Ua=«j  ^xk

and hence the expression for the E.M.F. equivalent to the
affinity to be found, E — H^J, becomes:
where a is the equivalent of water = 8*98.
   19. Experiments on the electrolysis of water have been
made by the writer in accordance with this method, and have*
furnished moderately concordant results approximating to the
value of the E.M.F. representing the affinity to be measured,
calculated from the heat of combustion of hydrogen (§ 32) ;
but as the experimental errors attendant on the method are
considerably greater than those involved when the value of
g-j-^E'     is directly determined   by means of a quadrant elec
trometer, this latter mode of operating has been adopted in
preference : the details of observations thus made in the case
of water are given in Part II. Meanwhile it is of interest to
notice that if a tangent galvanometer be substituted for a vol
tameter (the quantity of electricity passing being determined
by observing the quantity of electrolyte w decomposed whilst
a quantity of heat h is evolved), the value of the affinity to be
determined is given by the analogous formula

where     a and /S are the deflections observed with the cur
rents    Cx   and C2 respectively.       The experiments of Joule
above referred to (Phil. Mag. vol. iii. p. 481), although made
for the purpose of calculating the heat of formation of water,
copper sulphate, and zinc sulphate in a wholly different way,
contain the data requisite for the application of this mode of
observation, based on the use of the tangent galvanometer ; it
being taken for granted that E', the value of the E.M.F. of
the Daniell battery used, was m x l'lO volt, where m is the
number of cells used in the experiment recalculated.          Thus,
 Joule found the following numbers in a series of four observa
tions on the electrolysis of water in which six Daniell cells
were used:—

    The value deduced from Joule's own figures by his mode of
experimenting is 34,101 gramme-degrees per gramme-equiva
lent of water decomposed, representing 34101 x XJ = 1.504
volt; whilst the value deducible from the best determinations
of the heat evolved in the combustion of hydrogen is 34,100,
representing 1:504 volt (§ 32). In two other similar sets of
observations, Joule obtained the values 34,212gramme-degrees
corresponding to 1.509 volt, and 32,356 gramme-degrees cor
responding to 1:427 volt. Unfortunately the data for recal
culating these values, as has just been done with the first set,
are not given in his paper; still the difference between the
values of the E.M.F. of affinity, calculated as above and
from Joule's heat-values, is apparently no greater than the
differences observed in these latter on repetition.                 It is notice
able that a small error in the value of the E.M.F. of the bat
tery produces a much larger error in that of the calculated
result: thus, if in the set of observations recalculated as above                     .
the E.M.F. of a Daniell cell be taken as 1:08 instead of
1:10 volt, the calculated E.M.F. of affinity comes out 1:511
instead of 1:577 volt; i.e. a diminution of less than 2 per
cent. in the value of the Daniell cell makes a diminution of
more than 4 per cent. in the E.M.F. of affinity.

 combustion of metal to oxide, and that produced by solution
of the metallic oxide in dilute sulphuric acid — these determi
nations being made by different observers necessarily working
with different specimens of metallic oxides, and their results
being averaged.      Ditte has shown, however ( Comptes Rendus,
lxxii. pp. 762 & 878, and lxxiii. p. 108), that the heat deve
loped by dissolving a metallic oxide in an acid varies with the
degree of heat to which the oxide has previously been exposed.
 Thus, with zinc oxide and dilute sulphuric acid, the following
values were obtained per gramme-equivalent: —

The value of this "heat of solution" was given by Favre as
10,455, and by Julius Thomsen as 11,705, the temperature to
which the zinc oxide had been previously heated not being
stated.
    23. The experiments of Raoult above adverted to (§ 18)
were conducted as follows : — A current from a Daniell bat
tery was passed through a galvanometer and a voltameter
placed in a calorimeter, a derived circuit containing a sine
galvanometer being also applied to the voltameter-plates;            so
that the current in this derived circuit virtually measured the
difference of potential subsisting between the voltameter-plates.
Calling/ the "intensity of the derived current," and d that
due to a Daniell cell working through the same resistance,
and taking 23,900 as the "galvanic heat" C§ 17) of each
Daniell cell used, the total work done in the voltameter per
gramme-equivalent will be represented by
                                                 f x 23,900  gramme-

degrees : subtracting this from the heat actually developed as
such, a value in gramme-degrees is obtained representing the
work done as chemical decomposition.          In this way Raoult ob
tained the following values for the chemical decomposition of
water and copper sulphate: —
             Water.                   Copper sulphate.

256       Dr. C. R. A. Wright on    the Determination of
1-501 volt and 29,951 xJ=l'321 volt. The former number
closely agrees with the above-cited results of Joule, Kiechl,
and Favre, and with the number deduced by direct combus
tion of hydrogen (§ 32) ; the latter is somewhat larger than
the values deducible from the observations of Joule, Julius
Thomsen, and Favre, given in § 21.
    The mode of calculation employed by Baoult, however, was
far less simple than would appear from this brief account of
his results.   He complicated the work by attempts to measure
the amount of polarization set up in the voltameter; and from
the numbers thus obtained, together with the strengths of the
derived currents and the amounts of heat actually generated
as such, he calculated certain amounts of heat, to which he
applied the terms "local heat" and "voltaic heat of the vol
tameter," the difference between which represented the heat
 equivalent to the chemical decomposition — i. e. the above
 numbers.     On revising his formulae, however, it becomes evi
 dent that the determination of the amount of polarization of
 the voltameter-plates    (a determination the accuracy of
 which is open to some criticism) is in no way involved in
 the determination of the heat equivalent to the chemical de
 composition, inasmuch as the terms involving the amount of
 polarization in the expressions for the
                                             " local heat " and the
 "voltaic heat of the voltameter" are identical, and conse
 quently become both eliminated in the expressions represent
 ing the difference between these two quantities — i. e. the che
 mical decomposition.
    24. It is evident that any method that will give a direct
 valuation by electrical measurements of the work done in the
 formation of a given compound in terms of E.M.F. will,
 when compared with the direct determination of the " heat of
 formation" of the same compound by means of the calori
 meter, enable a new valuation to be deduced for      J, the mecha
 nical equivalent of heat ; for the work done in the formation
  of a gramme-equivalent of the compound being found by the
 one method to be measured by e C.Gr.S. units, and by the
 other by h gramme-degrees, the relationship
                           AJ=eQ=       -
                                        X

   25. In the case of water, a number of determinations of h
(the heat evolved by the union of oxygen and hydrogen by
combustion) have been made by various observers, but for the
most part with slightly different values for the heat unit.
Leaving out of sight the first approximate determinations of
Dulong, Hess, and Grassi (respectively 34,743, 34,792, and
34,666 gramme-degrees per 9 grammes of water formed), the
following comparisons of these different determinations may
be made, reducing them all, as far as possible, to the same
conditions — viz. supposing the oxygen and hydrogen origi
nally used per gramme-equivalent of water (respectively 7-98
and 1 gramme) and the water produced (8-98 grammes) to be
all at 0° and 760 millims., the value of a gramme-degree being
defined as the heat required to raise 1 gramme of water from
0° to 1° 0.
   The most recent of these determinations is that of Schuller
and Wartha.     By introducing hydrogen and oxygen at 0° into
a slightly modified Bunsen's ice-calorimeter, burning them,
and weighing accurately the water formed, these observers
found (Pogg. Ann. [2] ii. p. 359), as the mean of four closely
concordant valuations, that when 8*98 grammes of water are
produced from 1 gramme of hydrogen and 7-98 of oxygen, the
materials and products formed being all at 0° and 760 mil
lims., the heat produced is sufficient to raise 341*261 grammes
of water from 0° to 100° ; i. e. defining what they term a
" mean calory " to be          of the heat required to raise a
gramme     of water  from   0°  to 100°, the heat developed is
34126-1   " mean calories."    According to Ptegnault (Memoires
Acad. Sciences, 1847, vol. xxi.), the specific heat of water at
various temperatures is given by the formulae
                   Q = t + 0-00002 e + 0-0000003     13,
                   S= 1+0-00004*     +   0-0000009   12;
where   Q    the quantity of heat required to raise
            is                                         unit of
                                                           a
weight of water from     to
                          0   and
                               f,     the specific heat at i°;
                                      S   is
so that the mean specific heat between 0° and 100°      e. the
                                                           (t.

    258      Dr. C. R. A. Wright on          the   Determination of
               " mean calory
    value of a                 ") is 1*005. On the other hand,
    Bosscha has revised the data on which Regnault founded his
    formulae (Pogg. 'Ann. Jubelbd. p. 549), and gives the two
    following expressions for the quantities Q and S: —
                            q=t     +0-00011         12,
                            S   =
                                l   + 0-00022*;
    whence the mean specific heat between 0° and 100°   1*011,      is
    a value largely exceeding Regnault's. Employing Regnault's
    value, the heat-evolution observed by Schuller and Wartha
    becomes 34126'1 x 1*005 = 34,297 gramme-degrees    whilst   ;        if
    Bosscha's formula be employed (as was done by Schuller
    and Wartha in comparing their results with those of other
    observers),  the heat evolution becomes 34126*1x1*011-=
    34,501 gramme-degrees.
       26. Shortly before these experiments were published, von
    Than found, by nearly the same mode of operating, that               1
    gramme of hydrogen and 7*98 of oxygen, at 0° and 760
     millims., liberate, in forming water, 33,928 gramme-degrees
     {Deut. chem. Ges. Ber. 1877, vol. x.        947). The chief dif

    ference between his experiments and those of Schuller and
     Wartha was that, whilst the latter weighed the mercury
     sucked into the calorimeter through the melting of the ice,
     von Than measured   it    in   acapillary tube according to Bun-
     sen's plan, using Bunsen's value for a gramme-degree as above
     defined in terms of mercury sucked in.       Schuller and Wartha
     calculate, from  Bunsen's    data,  that the quantity of mercury
                             "  mean
                                              "     0*01541 gramme,
     corresponding to   a              calory           is
     whilst their own determinations give 0*015442; von Than
    used values corresponding to the former number, whilst
     Schuller and Wartha employed the latter.          The differences
    between each of the values used and the true value are
    included in tho experimental errors of determination in
    the two heat-evDlutions — viz. 34,297 (Regnault) or 34,501
    (Bosscha), found by Schuller and Wartha, and 33,928 ob
    served by von Than.
        27. A few years previously Julius Thonisen found (Pogg.
    Ann. 1873, vol. cxlviii. p. 368), from three accordant obser
    vations, that the formation of 17*96 grammes of water from
    dry oxygen and hydrogen, all materials and products being
    at near to 18°, produces an evolution of heat sufficient to raise
    the temperature of 68,207 grammes of water 1°, the water
    being to start with at close to 18°; the heat required to raise
    the temperature of the water produced being allowed for in
    the determination.      From Regnault's formula           25) the
                                                               (§

34103-5 x 1-00101 = 34138, or to 34103-5x1-00396=34239
gramme-degrees per 8-98 grammes of water, according as the
specific heat of water is calculated from the one or the other
formula. If, however, the combination of the oxygen and
hydrogen took place at 0° (producing water at 0°) instead of
at 18° throughout, the amount of heat-evolution would be
increased by a— b; where a is the heat given out by 8*98
grammes of water in cooling from 18° to 0°, and b the amount
o( heat required to raise 1 gramme of hydrogen together with
7*98 grammes of oxygen from 0° to 18°.         Since the specific
heats for equal weights under constant pressure of oxygen and
hydrogen are respectively 0-218 and 3-405, the value of a— b
is sensibly 69 gramme-degrees ; so that Thomsen's value be
comes 34,207 if Eegnault's formula is used, and 34,308 if
Bosscha's be employed.
    28. Favre and Silbermann found (Annates de Chimie [3],
xxxiv. p. 357) that when 9 grammes of water were formed
from oxygen and hydrogen, the gases being at a mean tempe
rature of 9° (at 6° to commence with and 12° to end with),
and the water produced being at 6° (the heat required to raise
the temperature of the water produced being taken into ac
count in determining the water-equivalent of the calorimeter),
the average heat-evolution sufficed to raise 34,462 grammes
-of water 1°, the water being at the average temperature of 9°.
 According to Regnault's formula the specific heat of water at
 9° is 1-00043, and according to Bosscha's 1-00198; whence
 the heat-evolution per 8-98 grammes becomes
                 ^    x 34462 x 1-00043=34400,
 or
                 ^9
                      x 3|462 x 1-00198=34453,
 according as the one or the other formula is used. To this
 must be added a quantity c— d to reduce the value to that
 which would have been produced had the gases and water
 produced been all at 0°: c is the heat given out by 8-98
 grammes of water in cooling from 6° to 0°, whilst d is the
¦heat required to raise the hydrogen and oxygen from 0° to 9°;
•whence c—d is sensibly 8 gramme-degrees.        So that the heat-
 evolution   becomes  34,408 by Eegnault's   formula,  and 34,461
 by Bosscha's formula.
    29. Andrews found (Phil. Mag. 1848, vol. xxxii. p. 321)

260          Dr. C. B. A. Wright on      the   Determination of

the water being at an average temperature of 20o,7, and the
calculation not including the heat required to raise the water
produced from the average initial temperature of 190,7 to the
average final temperature 210,8.   Since a litre of hydrogen at
0° and 760 millims. weighs 0-089578 gramme (Begnault),
the corrected heat-evolution per gramme of hydrogen burnt

                                is     according to Bosscha's

= 33952 (Eegnault's formula), or 33911x1-00455 = 34065
(Bosscha's formula).    To this must be added     quantity e—f   a
to reduce the value to that which would have been produced
had the gases and water formed been all at 0°,        being the       e
heat given out by 8*98 grammes of water in cooling from
190-7 to 0°, and   /that required to heat up the constituent
hydrogen and oxygen from 0° to 190-7        so that e—f ;   sen              is

becomes 34,028 by Eegnault's        formula, and 34,141 by

That     the average of these different determinations indicates
       is,
that by the combustion of      gramme of hydrogen and jfj98
                                     1

being at 0° and 760 millims. throughout, the heat produced
would raise the temperature of 34,174 or 34,268 grammes of
water from 0° to 1° C, according as Eegnault's or Bosscha's
formula for the specific heat of water used. It    is noticeable      is
that the latter formula makes Schuller and Wartha's most
carefully made experiments appear abnormal, by showing                                a
much greater divergence, both from von Than's (made by
essentially the same method) and from the general average,
than   isthe case when Eegnault's formula       employed     and
                                                            is                ;

hence an additional reason is derived for viewing Bosscha's
alleged corrections of Eegnault's numbers as being more open
to objection than these numbers themselves.
     Ifthe combination of the oxygen and hydrogen be supposed
to take place at 20° instead of 0°        e.  the gases used and
                                                     (i.    if
water produced be all at 20°), the heat-evolution will be less
than that calculated above by g— gramme-degrees, where
                                                    h                              g

     As these values are mostly calculated                       per   9 grammes of            A
water, this average value should be reduced in                         about the pro-"
                  8*98
portion of -g— but since the increase of temperature of the
                         ;
calorimeter observed represents a slightly higher number of
gramme-degrees than that stated, on account of the increase
of the specific heat of water with the temperature, the average
value requires slightly raising from this cause.   After making
all probable allowances for these corrections, however, the
mean^
       value still remains perceptibly lower than that calcu
lated as above from the results of Schuller and Wartha, von
Than, Julius Thomson, Andrews, Favre, and Silbermann.
   On the whole, the data at present extant may be taken to
show that when 8'98 grammes       water are formed from gaseous
                                               of

to raise 3797 (or practically 3800) grammes from 0° to 1° C,
this value being taken from the reductions by Eegnault's

 262       Dr. C. R. A. Wright on          the  Determination of
 formula    as being probably more accurate than those made by
 Bosscha's alleged corrected formula.
    32. A number of observations, the details of which are
 given in Part II., show that, admitting the accuracy of Lati
 mer Clark's valuation of the E.M.F. of his standard cell (Proc.
 Roy. Soc. 1872, vol. xx. p. 444) as being 1-457 x 108 C.G.S.
 units at 15°, the value of e in the expression e=E — H^J
 (§ 11) is 1-5003 x 108 C.G.S. units when water is electrolyzed
at a temperature of 15°-20°, the value of               J  being taken as
42 x 106— the probable error of the mean result being ±0-0048,
 or ±0*32 per cent.          Owing, however, to certain causes de
tailed in Part     II. (§   39),  this value is slightly too low — this
result being esentially due to the impracticability of collecting
every trace of gas evolved, so that the value of H (the heat
evolved per gramme-equivalent of water decomposed)                       is
slightly overvalued, and hence e slightly undervalued.
    From the combustion experiments of previous investiga
tors, summarized in the preceding eight paragraphs, it results
that the value of e in the expression e = H'^J (§ 11) is
l"5038x     108  (since   II' = 34,100),    J   being, as before, taken as
42xl06.        These     numbers, 1*5003 x 108 and 1-5038 x 108,
accord so closely as to show that (so far as these experiments
can decide) the value of         J cannot be far from 42 x 106.        Ap
plying   the  formula                    .   .

                               J=(H    + H')*
(§ 24) to the experimental data given in Part II., the average
value deduced for       J  is 41-96 x 10s, this value for
                               —
                                                              J giving the
following    values   for  e :
      From formula       e=E-HxJ              .   .   e= 1-5023 x  108
           „      „       e=H'XJ         .   .    .   e= 1-5024 xlO8.
   Since, however, the mean value of H is slightly overvalued,
it results that the value of        J finally deduced is slightly above
41-96 x 106, with a probable error of less than ±0'4 per cent.,
i. e. of less than ±0-016 x 106, due to the electrolytic experi
ments, the probable error in the determination of H/ not being
taken into account.
    33. It is evident that, considering the nature of the data
from which this conclusion is drawn, not much dependence
can be placed on the final value of              J  deduced except as an
approximation. It is noteworthy, however, that this value of
J  very closely agrees with that deduced by Joule in 1867
B. A. Reports, 1867), by determining the heat producible
in a wire of known resistance by a known current, and that

       C/iemical Affinity in terms     of Electromotive Force.          263
both are perceptibly higher than the value obtained by-
Joule by means of water-friction &c. in 1850 (Phil. Trans.
 1850, p. 61); whilst this older value is completely corrobo
rated by his recently made experiments on water-frietion &c.
 (Phil. Trans. 1878, p. 365). In 1850 Joule found that the
heat required to raise 1 lb. of water (weighed in vacuo) from
t to t + 1 (where t lies between 55° and 60° F.) corresponded
                                        ...
to the following number of foot-pounds at Manchester : —
            By friction of water                     772-692
                 „     „      mercury        . .     774*083
                  „    „      cast iron      . .     774-987
   Of these   values the first was considered probably the most
accurate; and     as a little vibration and sound was unavoidable
in the experiments, the round number 772 was adopted as the
most probable value.          The 1878 value finally arrived at is
that the heat required to raise 1 lb. of water (weighed in vacuo)
from 60° to 61° F. corresponds to 772-55 foot-pounds, and is
hence sensibly identical with the former result.                 The 1867
values, however, were as follows, expressed in foot-grain-
second units: —
                                                     Per grain degree F.

Of these   the last value was taken as most exact          ;  when reduced
to water weighed in vacuo it becomes 25187.                As in this series
the average temperature         of the  calorimeter       was  18°*63 C. =
65°-5 F., the final result is that, to raise the temperature of 1
gramme of water from 65° to 66° F., requires 25,187 foot-
grain-second units of work.
   34. When reduced to C.G.S. measure and degrees Centi
grade the three values, 772-692 foot-pounds, 772-55 foot
pounds, and 25,187 foot-grain-second work units, become
respectively 41-60, 41-59, and 42*14 megalergs per gramme-
degree, the value of g at Manchester being taken at 981*3.
 (Compare illustrations of the C.G.S. system of units, by Prof.
Everett, p. 51.) Since, however, the specific heat of the water
at the three assigned temperature-limits, 55°-60°, 60°-61°,
and 65°-66° F., is not quite the same, on reduction to the
gramme-degree taken above as unit (the heat requisite to raise
1 gramme     of water from 0° to 1° C), these values become
    41*60                 41*59          . .     ,    42*14

of   J  is 41/555 megalergs from the two sets of friction
experiments (1850 and 1878), and 42*10 by the electric-cur-
                                                             42* 10
rent method (1867) — the latter consequently being jjnnjg =
1'0131 times the former, or 1*31 per cent, in excess.              The
value for  J  deduced above from the writer's experiments (viz.
                          41-96
41'96 megalergs) is               = 1'0098 times that got from
                         41.555
Joule's friction experiments, showing an excess of 0"98 per
cent.    Hence, on the whole, the writer's numbers and Joule's
 1867 values concord much more exactly than might have been
anticipated, each showing an excess over Joule's water-friction
value (1850 and 1878) of about 1 per cent., Regnault's
formula being employed for reducing the observed rise of
temperature to gramme-degrees at 0°— 1° C.
   35. Reasons have already been given (§ 32, vide also Part II.
§ 39) for supposing that the value 1-5003 found for the E.M.F.
representing the affinity for oxygen and hydrogen in water is
                          The effect of an error of this kind would
slightly understated.
be to raise the value of   J  deduced by the formula
and hence to make the excess of the value of         J  thus deduced
over Joule's  water-friction   value  to  be somewhat  more   than the
1 per   cent,  or thereabouts just calculated.       It is worthy of
notice that there is also reason for supposing that Joule's 1867
value is understated.     Experiments are described in Part         II.
the result of which is to show that an unobserved source of
error existed in Joule's 1867 experiments, the effect of which
was to diminish the value of      J  thence deduced by an amount
probably equal to some tenths per cent.; so that on the whole
Joule's 1867 value, when corrected, is probably from 1*5 to
2'0 per cent, higher than his water-friction value (1850 and
1878).
   This difference between the two values is precisely that
which would subsist did an error to an equal amount exist in
the B.A. resistance-unit valuation : i. e. if the B.A. unit were
T015 to T020 earth-quadrant per second instead of being
exactly 1 earth-quadrant per second, the value of deduced  J
from Joule's 1867 experiments would be 1"015 to 1'020 times
the true value ; for it is calculated by the formula
                                  C2R*

where 0 is the current, II the resistance, t the time, and H the

B.A. unit would cause a precisely corresponding error in La
timer Clark's valuation of the E.M.F. of his standard cell
(Proc. Roy. Soc. 1872, vol. xx. p. 444), this valuation being
based on the determination of the resistance R between two
points traversed by a known current 0, the potential difference
E between the points being equal to the E.M.F. of the cell,
so that by Ohm's law E = CR ; and the effect of this would be
to cause a precisely similar error in the value of      J   deduced
                          E
by the formula    J=             as m the writer's experiments.

    36. In confirmation of the supposition that the B.A. unit of
resistance is too large, Kohlrausch's experiments may be cited
(Phil. Mag. 1874, vol. xlvii. pp. 294 & 342). A careful compari
son of several copies of the B.A. unit with coils standardized by
himself in absolute measure led Kohlrausch to the conclusion
that the B.A. unit is really 1-0196 earth-quadrant per second,
or 1-96 per cent, too large ; for he found that the resistance of
certain coils graduated in Siemens mercury units averaged
0-9717 x 109 C.G.S. units, whilst the B.A.-unit coils averaged
1*0493 times the resistance of the Siemens coils, giving there
fore for the B.A. unit the value
              0-9717 x 1-0493 x 109= 1-0196 x 10".
    On the other hand, it is to be observed that Lorenz has
made a determination of the value of a Siemens mercury unit
with a lower result (Pogg. Ann. 1873, vol. cxlix. p. 251), viz.
 0*9337 earth-quadrant per second.         Lorenz's mercury-tubes
 were made by himself ; and it does not seem from his paper
 that any evidence was obtained of the purity of the mercury
 used other than the fact that its specific gravity at 50,3 C. was
 13-586 after digesting for a long time with nitric acid.      These
 mercury-tubes do not seem to have been compared directly
 with any B.A.-unit coil so as to give the value of the B.A. unit
 in absolute measure ; on comparing them with a reputed Sie
 mens unit, Lorenz found a difference of nearly 1 per cent.
 (0-943 x 109 as against 0-93 37 x 109)— the difference between
 Lorenz's mercury-tube value of a Siemens unit and the value
 of the latter in B.A. units, as deduced by Kohlrausch, being
 nearly exactly double this amount, or nearly 2 per cent., Vmya

  observers considerably higher than that deduced from Joule's

      On the whole, it is evident that further experiments are de
 sirable as to the development of heat in circuits of resistance
 measured in terms of the B.A. unit by known currents, so as
 to establish as accurately as possible a connexion between the
 values of    J   and of the B.A. unit, so that if the first is assumed
 to be correctly given by Joule's water-friction value the error
 (if any) in the B.A. unit can be calculated, or so that the value
       J
 of can be determined afresh when the precise value of the
 B.A. unit is known from further experiments.                        The writer
 hopes shortly to be enabled to communicate the results of ex
 periments in this direction made by a method differing from
 that employed by Joule in certain important points, so as to
 avoid the sources of error existent in Joule's 1867 experiments
 (Part II.).

 XXXIII. A             Suggestion in regard to Crystallization, on the
      Hypothesis that Molecules are not infinitely Hard. By S.

 IN what   This   is
                                is assumed
                      not contradicted by any
                                             (1) that  molecules are elastic.
                                                    evidence, and is power
 fully supported by spectroscopic observations.                      (2) It is
 assumed that molecules possess an open structure.                     This in
 ference is equally not opposed to any observed facts, and is
 indeed strongly upheld by many. (3) The basis of the con
 stitution of the setter, developed by the present writer in the
 Philosophical Magazine (Sept. and Nov. 1877, and Feb. 1878)
 is taken as a groundwork. Briefly stated, according to this
"^EriB~8etherts      to be regarded as a gas whose atoms are so small
 that their mean length of path is far greater than any planetary
 distances, the atoms automatically adjusting their motions
 (according to principles investigated in connexion with the
 kinetic theory of gases) so as to be capable of producing gra
 vity under the sheltering principle of Le Sage.
       Since the elementary rvng'f is evidently the simplest form of
 open structure for a molecule, this form is taken (in the cases
 to be considered).            The rings (relatively very large) consti
 tuting      the  molecules^of gross matter are, accordingly, to be
 regarded        as   pervaded through and through (in their open
  structure) by streams of minute aether atoms, which automa
 tically and inevitably adjust their motions so as to move equally
 in all directions.         If  we conceive (for the purpose of illustra
  tion)    a  number     of  rings [molecules] to lie in one plane with
  their peripheries touching, or very close, then, owing to their
  adjacent parts being now sheltered from the streams of aether
  atoms, which impinge with full energy elsewhere, the peri
  pheries of the rings will be impelled towards each other (ac
  cording to Le Sage's principle).             As the ring molecules are
  (by assumption) elastic, they           will naturally bend, and the con
  tiguous surfaces will flatten (somewhat) under the powerful
  impulsive action of the streams of aether atoms, which tend to
  bring as much as possible of the mutually sheltered peripheries

      t  I have before   had occasion to remark that the common tacit assump
  tion of molecules being solid throughout involves a waste of material that
  violates one of the first principles of large-scale architecture, where super
  fluity of material is recognized to be.one of the worst faults, detrimental
   alike to the elasticity and stability of the structure.       Dynamical prin
   ciples are admittedly independent of scale.       The elasticity of molecules
   (demonstrated by the spectroscope) would also sufficiently indicate an open
  structure, so as to allow a relative mobility of parts consistently with in
  separability.

 into contact.     If we suppose the impulsive influence to be
 powerful enough to bring (sensibly) the entire peripheries of
 all the rings into mutual contact, the rings bending (from
 their elasticity) for this purpose, then it would appear that the
  whole must form a system of hexagons, as the annexed dia-

 gram (fig. 1) may serve roughly to illustrate. For the condi
 tions of equilibrium would not allow any thing else.            It is
 true that squares might conceivably be formed if the bending
 were sufficient for that purpose (and by a somewhat different
 arrangement of the rows), but it must evidently in any case
 (from the conditions of equilibrium) be some regular or geo
 metric figure. Might joot thj&possibly be capable of throwing
^onjaJight ^n tibejghenomena of crystallization t It appears
 evident that the ring"molecules, under tEese conditions, could
 also form hollow solid figures of geometric shape, if the rings
 were to unite at their peripheries or edges in a regular manner.
 But it will be seen that the tendency for the rings to unite
 at their edges or boundaries in a regular manner is auto
 matic, since at their edges alone shelter exists, the streams of
 asther atoms passing freely through the open parts of the
                                        " lines of impulsive action"
 rings, so that there exist virtually
 directed symmetrically from edge to edge, producing automa
 tically a guiding action, or (crystalline?) "building.
    If there were any foundation for these data in reality, it
 would follow as an a priori conclusion, that leaving the ring
 molecules to themselves in an unhampered manner (as, for ex
 ample, occurs in the process of melting or solution) would be
 most favourable to crystalline building.       Also it would appear,
 equally  a priori, that if the ring molecules were artificially
 interfered with (as by hammering for instance) they might
 (especially from their elasticity) be crossed or jostled up
 together irregularly, and so not unite symmetrically at their

this   case   acertain amount of sliding or play of the ring
molecules over each other would be possible before they finally
separate (which occurs when the substance             broken into   is
parts). On the other hand,            appears equally evident that
                                            it
this sliding or play would be impossible in that case where
the molecules are united symmetrically at their extreme boun
daries or edges, so as to build up the crystalline structure.
The above inference would at lea3t be consistent with the ob
served fact that non-crystalline masses (such as hammered
iron, for instance) are found to allow certain amount of play
                                                     a
or sliding of their ultimate parts over each other, before they
finally separate.    Crystalline masses, on the other hand (cast
iron, for example), are found to break with any attempt to
alter the position of their parts.       These conditions of ring
molecules (capable of bending into various forms within cer
tain limits) might also possibly throw some light on the fact
that the same substance may have occasionally various crys
talline forms and sometimes even no crystalline form at all.

non-crystalline (amorphous) state, when          can be stretched
like india-rubber.     Other examples might be given.
    It appears evident that, in addition to the bending of the
peripheries of the elastic rings, the transverse sections (where
in contact) would also flatten somewhat under the pressure
due to the streams of aether atoms, which tend energetically
to cause a closer approach.      Under this flattening of the con
tiguous    surfaces  the lines  of  contact would come to have                     a
measurable (though small) breadth, thereby increasing the
 area of shelter, and consequently the energy with which
 the ring molecules are made to cohere.         This flattening of
the contiguous surfaces would also have the effect of increas
 ing the limits of elasticity of the whole structure. When the
 ring molecules are gradually pulled apart, there would first
 naturally be gradual recoveryof the circular form of periphery
                  a
 and diminution of the flattening (where contact exists), the
 area of shelter thereby becoming less and less, until finally,
 when the peripheries of the ring molecules are nearly separate,
 their energetic natural tendency to recover their normal (cir
 cular) form would no doubt cause them to spring apart, pro
 vided the tendency to recovery of form predominated over the
 residual impulsive tendency to approach (produced by the
 streams of atoms).      Might not this possibly be capable of
 throwing some light on the observed mutual repulsion of the
 parts of substances when first brought into proximity, and
  their (contrary) impulsion towards each other (union) when

 bent and flattened, but the surface of contact
 is not yet sufficient to afford shelter enough
 to satisfy the condition that the impulsive

 of the rings to preserve their normal circular shape).                   The
 rings accordingly bound back (repel) directly the artificial
 pressure is removed*.          Fig. 3 may serve to
 illustrate the case where the ring molecules
 have been previously pushed into such proxi
 mity, that the bending and flattening of the
 contiguous surfaces has gone far enough to
 increase the shelter to such an extent that the impulsive ten
 dency to approach can predominate over the residual elasticity
 of form, and so the molecules are impelled closer together (the
 shelter increasing with the contiguity of parts).              The sudden
 flying of some substances into fragments (such as badly an
 nealed glass for instance), under certain conditions, where the
 elastic ring molecules would be in a state of strain, and per
 haps nearly at the point at which they would naturally spring
 apart in virtue of their elasticity of form, may perhaps serve
 as rather a confirming illustration of this view.
     The writer at least ventures to think that the points dealt
 with may not be without interest or unworthy of attention, on
 account of the simplicity of the premises, by which some degree
 of insight would seem to be afforded into certain interesting
but obscure phenomena, and under physical conditions that
 could not of themselves be said to be independently improbable,
 and which are even supported by some inductions and obser
vations of modern science.            Any light whatever that these
premises might      be  capable of throwing on obscure facts might
then legitimately be regarded as some additional confirmation
 of the validity of the premises, which themselves have been
inferred on independent grounds.

    getlier with Examples. By W. H. Walehn, Mem. Phys. Soc.

 40.     rTIHE     next algebraic forms of 8 that claim attention are
          -L those comprised under the formula U*„N, k being a
 fundamental base such as 9 or 11, and n a whole number as a
 multiplier.        This set of unitates may be said to be the entry
 to the domain which enables unitation to furnish easily the
 remainders to divisors in general.
     41. In dissecting the expression Ut»N, it is observable that
 the next less number exactly divisible by k is N— U*N, and
 that Ujfc»N = UftN + km, in which m is a function of U„(n — UtN).
 Each of the multiples of k up to kn may give a separate value
 when unitated to the base n. Let the multiples of k be a1? a2,
 </3, . . . a„ (so that k=ai,2k=as, 3k=a3> &c.) j then the series
  TJ»(oi, a2, a3, . . . a„) may be 1, 2, 3, 4, ... n, or it may be other
 values. •     If  !!„(%, a2, a3, . . . a„) = l, 2, 3, 4, . . . n, this is the
  same sequence in which the multiples of k enter into Ua„n,
 and wi = Ub(n— U^n) ; if U„(ai, a2, a3, ...a„) gives other
 values, means must be found to reduce them to the set of
 values 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . n, if Ufc,N is to be used for obtaining the
  remainders to the divisor under consideration.
     42.    If A=9, then a1} a2, a3, . . . n=9, 18, 27, 36,... n; and
 to test whether U*„N is applicable when An = 72, for instance,
 it is necessary to obtain U8(9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72).
  This is found to be =1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 0 ; therefore U*"N is
  applicable in this case in a direct manner.            U*B is not appli
  cable when kn=27 ; for then U3 (9, 18, 27) = 0, 0,0: this
  result is also evident from the simple consideration that 3 is a
  submultiple of 9.      If U*n = 45, U6(9,18,27,36,45) = 4,3,2,l,0;
  this can be reduced to the required sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 0 by

                 XXXV.       On the Motion   of Glaciers.
                 By R. H. Koch and Fb. Klocke*.
             measurements      hitherto made upon glacier-motion
THEhave         either been only approximative determinations of
the annual or daily mean velocity, or have been executed for the
purpose of showing that the motion of glaciers corresponds
 with that of liquids ; while investigations upon the actual
 course of this downward motion are wanting — whether, namely,
 it proceeds continuously in the same direction, or whether it
is discontinuous, stoppages or even reversals of the motion
 taking place.      From the observations made by M. Pfaff on
 the nev^f the latter is probable even for the motion of glaciers.
     Our investigations were limited to the observation of a point
 of the surface in a vertical plane parallel to the longitudinal
 direction of the glacier ; the measuring of the lateral motion,
 and the motion of the deeper layers of the glacier, as well as
 observations during the night, were for the time excluded.
Nevertheless, from the facts which have up to the present time
been observed, it can already be concluded that the motion of
a glacier is not at all uniform ; for one and the same point may
now move toward the mountain, now toward the valley, now
 ascend, now descend.         It was further found that two points
 of the surface, distant from 50 to 60 metres from one another,
 can move in different, nay, in opposite directions.
     The method chosen for the observations was that employed
by M. Pfaff, and already used for other purposes. Two scales,
 one perpendicular to the other, were fixed upon the glacier so
that the one was vertical and the other horizontal ; their move
ments were observed on the cross-threads of a firmly placed
telescope.      The number of scale-divisions travelled over by the
 cross-threads gave then directly the horizontal and vertical
 components of the motion^.
     The examinations were made in the days from the 28th of
August to the 6th of September, on the west side of the Mor-
teratsch glacier.      The observing-station was about 1| kilo
metre distant from the lower principal extremity of the glacier.
This situation was selected on account of the firm ground

 which it presented for the setting-up of the instrument (a con
 dition not everywhere fulfilled), and also because at this spot
 the glacier formed a tolerably continuous mass, without any
longitudinal, transverse, or marginal fissures worth mention
 ing ; here, too, was the best prospect of being free from acci
dental anomalies of the motion.
    In setting up the scales we proceeded in the following
 manner. The stake on which the scales were fixed was sunk
into the ice to the depth of half a metre, and a mound of ice
 30 centims. in height raised around      it, in order as much as
possible to prevent melting away of the ice at this spot.        The

 resembled one of the well-known earth-mounds.              A stake
thus planted was perfectly stable and Could be employed for
the observations for about four days.       The reading-telescopes
were set up firmly on the bank, and sufficiently sheltered from
the action of the sun. The readings were nearly always exe
cuted by both of us, each independently of the other.            The
scales were graduated in half-centims.; millimetres were esti
mated.     The uncertainty of the estimation amounted, with
unfavourable illumination or with trembling of the image in
consequence of unequal heating of the intervening air, to about
0"1 centim.; but  it  sometimes rose to 0*2 centim.; in normal
circumstances, however, the readings of both observers were
perfectly concordant.
    In order to convince ourselves that the motions observed on
the scales were not motions of the scales themselves, but really
indicated the motion of the point in question of the glacier,
near one of the signals   a  second was fixed in the ice, and so
close to the first that both appeared in the field of the telescope.
With this arrangement the observations showed that both pairs
of scales moved in close conformity to one another.
   We select as evidence for our above-expressed assertion the
observations of the 3rd and 4th of September, because on those
days the motions of the glacier took place under different con
ditions the 3rd was all bright and cloudless, while the sky
       :
during the forenoon of the 4th (the time of the greatest mo
tion) was covered with cumulus clouds and the glacier was
only at times exposed to the sunshine.
    The times in the following Table are reckoned from midday
to midday.     The numbers give the horizontal and vertical
motions in centimetres.       + denotes a downward motion, —      a

    Let us first consider the motion of scale I. (distant about
35 metres from the margin of the glacier).         During the after
noon the point moves but little,      horizontally  as well as verti
cally, and that in the positive direction. In the later hours
p.m. this motion constantly diminishes, and at last entirely
ceases. After this, during the night (6h-18h), the point moved
vertically upwards, and horizontally towards the valley. As
soon as the sun's irradiation commences (about 19h), absolutely
irregular motions take place, which last till noon ; then (from
0h onward) again commence the slow downward movements,
and all is repeated in like manner.
    With Scale II. (more towards the middle of the glacier) the
course of the movements is similar.        During the afternoon a
tolerably uniform motion takes place both horizontally and ver
tically, in the positive direction ; at about 4h the glacier comes
to a stand.    But in the night, in the horizontal direction a con
siderable retrograde movement came in (the opposite of what
took place with Scale I.), possibly amounting to 9*9 centims.,
while the vertical motion almost always remained but feeble.
Then, as in the case of Scale     I.,
                                   with the commencement of the
solar irradiation begin the irregular movements, which last on
till midday, and thereupon pass over again into the regular
downward motion.
   Even at point situated about
           a                           kilometre further up the
                                           1
glacier similar movements of the ice were ascertained. Briefly,
at all points observed by us the maximum of the variations of
the motions falls in the forenoon, commencing with the irra
diation of the glacier by the sun. Thus, everywhere (at least
on the west side of the glacier) the sum of the motions during
the night was  a  going back toward the mountain.
   The observations of the 4th of September, finally, show that
with less intense irradiation the motions of the glacier become
     a
correspondingly less considerable.    The motion of the glacier
was similar on the other days of observation.
   From the observations which have at present been made         it
is not yet possible to perceive which of the more or less pro
bable hypotheses would explain the actual motion of the ice.
We intend to continue these labours on larger scale at the
                                               a

XXXVI.     Acoustical Observations. III. By Lord Rayleigh,
   F.R.S., Professor of Experimental Physics in the University
   of Cambridge*   .
                         Intermittent Sounds.
        the Philosophical Magazine for May 1875, Prof. A. M.
IN Mayer describes         some experiments on this subject, made
 by rotating a perforated cardboard disk between a resonator
 and a vibrating fork.      " When the disk is stationary with one
 of its openings opposite the mouth of the resonator, it is evi
 dent that the ear will experience a simple sonorous sensation
 when a tuning-fork is brought near the mouth of the resona
 tor.    On revolving the perforated disk, two additional or
 secondary sounds appear — one slightly above, the other
 slightly below the pitch of the fork. An increasing velocity
 of rotation causes the two secondary sounds to diverge yet
 further from the note of the beating fork, until, on reaching
 a certain velocity, the two secondary sounds become separated
 from each other by a major sixth, while at the same moment
 a resultant sound appears, formed by the union of the sound
 of the fork with the upper and lower of the secondary sounds.
 This resultant is the lower second octave of the note given by
 the fork.   On further increasing the velocity of rotation of
the disk, the two secondary sounds and the resultant disappear,
and the ear experiences only the sensation of the simple sound
produced by the fork, whose beats at this stage of the experi
ment have blended into a smooth continuous sensation."
    In concluding his paper Prof. Mayer calls attention " to
the evident difference existing between the dynamic constitu
tion of the sonorous waves belonging to beating pulses pro
duced by the action of a perforated rotating disk on a con
tinuous stream of sonorous vibrations, and those waves which
cause beats, and which are formed by the joint action of sono
rous vibrations differing in pitch.        That these two kinds of
beats are alike in their effects when following in the same
rapidity I  have assumed to be the fact in this paper."
    At the time when Prof. Mayer's paper first appeared,     I ex
amined this question more closely ; and some of my results
were referred to in a discussion before the Musical Associa
tion. The difference between the two kinds of beats is con
siderable.   If  there are two vibrations of equal amplitude and
slightly differing frequencies, represented by cos ^.irn^t and-
cos 2irn2t, the resultant may be expressed by
                 2 COS 7T («! — n2)t COS 7T (wx + «2   )t,

and may be regarded as a vibration of frequency £ (% + %),
and of amplitude 2 cos ir (n^—n^t. Hence, in passing through
zero, the amplitude changes sign, which is equivalent to a
change of phase of 180°, if the amplitude be regarded as al
ways positive. This change of phase is readily detected by
measurement in drawings traced by machines for compound
ing observations.    If a force of the above character act upon
a system whose natural frequency is ^(ni + n^), the effect
produced is comparatively small.      If the system start from
rest, the successive impulses cooperate at first, but after a time
the later impulses begin to destroy the effect of former ones.
The greatest response is given to forces of frequency ni and
n2, and not to a force of frequency ^(ni + n2).
   On the other hand, when a single vibration is rendered in
termittent by the periodic interposition of an obstacle, there
is no such change of phase in consecutive revivals.     If a force
of this character act upon an isochronous system, the effect
is indeed less than if there were no intermittence ; but as all
the impulses operate in the same sense without any antago
nism, the response is powerful. An intermittent vibration
or force may be represented by
                  2(1 + cos 2-Ktnt) cos 2-irnt,
in which n is the frequency of the vibration, and m the fre
quency of intermittence. The amplitude is always positive,
and varies between the values 0 and 4.       By ordinary trigo
nometrical transformation the above expression may be put
into the form
               lirnt + cos 27r(n + m)t + cos 2ir{n—m)t ;
           2 cos
which shows   that  the intermittent vibration is equivalent to
three simple vibrations of frequencies n, n + m, and n—m.
This is the explanation of the secondary sounds observed by
Mayer.                                       J
          When m is equal to n, n + m : n— m = 5 : 3, or the
interval between the secondary sounds is a major sixth. The
frequency of the resultant sound is rn (that          \n) and its  is,   :
pitch is two octaves below that of the original vibration.
   In the Edinburgh Proceedings for June 1878, an experi
ment similar to Mayer's          described by Professors Crum
                                        is

 the two new ones differing twice as much as before from
 that of the primary sound.
     Other cases might be treated in the same way ; but my object
 at present is to describe a modified form of the experiment
 which   I  planned some years ago, but first carried out last
 summer.                          Fig. 1.
    The desired forces were obtained electromagnetically.            A
 fork interrupter of frequency 128 gave a periodic current, by
 the passage of which through an electromagnet a second fork of
 like pitch could be excited.         The action of this current on
 the second fork could be rendered intermittent by short-cir
 cuiting the electromagnet.         This was effected by another in
terrupter of frequency 4, worked by an independent current
 from a Smee cell.       To excite the main current a Grove cell
was employed.        When the contact of the second interrupter
 was permanently broken, so that the main current passed con
 tinuously through the electromagnet, the fork was, of course,
most powerfully affected when tuned to 128.                Scarcely any
 response was observable when the pitch was changed to 124
or 132. But if the second interrupter was allowed to operate,
so as to render the periodic current through the electromagnet
intermittent, then the fork would respond powerfully when
tuned to 124 or 132 as well as when tuned to 128, but not
when tuned to intermediate pitches, such as 126 or 130.
    The operation of the intermittence in producing a sensitive
ness which would not otherwise exist, is easily understood.
When a fork of frequency 124 starts from rest under the in
fluence of a force of frequency 128, the impulses cooperate at
first, but after \ of a second the new impulses begin to oppose
the earlier ones.     After  J  of a second, another series of im
pulses begins    whose   effect  agrees with that of the first, and so
on.    Thus  if all these impulses are allowed to act, the resul
tant effect is trifling ; but if every alternate series is stopped
off, a large vibration accumulates.

    Some   years ago*,    I observed     that a light pivoted blade is

set into rapid rotation when exposed to wind. The phenome
non is of the same character as the rotation of a slip of paper
falling freely in air, which was discussed a long while since by
Prof. Maxwell*.         In both cases the rotation may occur in
either direction, proving that its cause is not to be looked for
in any want of symmetry. But the view expressed by Max
well does not appear to apply to the pivoted blade ; and                I
think that the real explanation is yet to be discovered.              At
present, however,       I  am concerned merely with an applica
tion.                             Fig. 2.

    In fig. 2, A is a blade cut out of sheet brass and provided
with sharp projecting points, which bear in hollows at the
ends of the screws B, C.         These screws pass through a small
wooden frame        F  G, and are adjusted until the blade can turn
freely but without perceptible shake.           D and E are pieces of
 cardboard or sheet metal, fitting pretty closely to the blade
 when in the same plane with them, so that in this position of
the blade the passage through the frame is almost closed. As
 the blade turns, it acts the part of a revolving stopcock.
     In the summer of 1878 1 made several sirens on this plan,
 which performed well- One of them is represented about
 full size in the figure. If the wind from the bellows is ad
 mitted symmetrically, they will revolve in either direction,
 and soon acquire sufficient speed to give a note of moderate
 pitch. The position of maximum obstruction is for small dis
 placements a position of stable equilibrium.            Tf a larger dis
 placement    is  given,  the vibration   tends of itself to increase up
  to a certain point, or even to pass into continuous rotation ;
  but the precise behaviour in this respect probably depends
  upon the details of construction.
            The Acoustical Shadow       of a Circular Disk.
     In a well-known experiment, suggested by Poisson, a bright
  point is observed in the centre of the shadow of a circular
  disk on which waves of light are directly incident. It is some
 years since    I first attempted to obtain the acoustical analogue
              * Cambridge and Dublin Math, Journal, 1864.

 282         Lord Rayleigh's Acoustical Observations.
  of this beautiful phenomenon ; but my efforts were without
  success until a few months since.     The difficulties to be over
  come are entirely different in optics and in acoustics, on
 account of the immense disproportion of wave-lengths.             In
 the former case the disk must be small and accurately shaped,
 and the source of light must be of very small angular magni
 tude — in practice, an image of the sun formed by a distant lens
 of short focus.    In the latter case the difficulty is to arrange
 the experiment on a scale that shall be adequate in comparison
 with the wave-length of the sound.
     The best way of considering the subject theoretically is with
 the use of Huyghens's zones.       The plane of the disk is divided
 into zones by its intersection with spheres whose centres are
 at the point under consideration,       and whose radii form an
                                                                "
 arithmetical progression     with  common    difference          The
 vibrations due to these zones are at first nearly equal, but gra
 dually diminish to nothing, unless the outer boundary of the
 aperture is circular; and thus the aggregate effect is repre
 sented by a series of which the terms are of opposite sign and
 of slowly diminishing magnitude. Now the sum of such a
 series is equal approximately to half its first term ; so that the
 whole effect of the aperture outside the disk is independent
 of the disk's diameter — that is to say, is the same as if no
 obstacle at all were present.
    This way of regarding the matter shows at once what
degree of accuracy is required in the figure of the circumfe
rence, which must not sensibly encroach upon the first exterior
zone.   If  x be the radius of a circle in the plane of the disk,
b the distance of the point under consideration, and r2 = x" +    b2,
dx=rdr x; so that
         \

                                                        If,therefore,
x be the radius of the disk, the radial curve should be       asmall
fraction of rX 2x.
               |
    In like manner, we may form an estimate of the size of
the bright spot,   a subject which has been treated analytically
by Airy*.    If  the disk be moved laterally through the width
of one zone, it   isclear that the effect at the old point will be
materially changed.      Hence the diameter of the bright spot
is  comparable  with  rX
                       \   x, and its apparent magnitude as seen
from the disk  is  comparable with    X |
                                          x. For the full success
of the experiment, the apparent magnitude of the luminous
source should be of the same order.
    When we pass to the analogous experiment in acoustics,        it
is of course impossible to retain any approximation to optical
conditions.    Instead of a ratio of  X   x, equal to, say, tttoooj

hardly be sufficient free space on all sides.         Ihave tried             a
considerable variety of sources of sound, including electric
sparks,     small electric bell, and

    On November 20 the source was           bird-call blown with

pressure of 4" water, and was placed about 20" from the
 15" disk. The observation was made at a distance of 24" on
 the further side of the disk, and was successful both with the

                                                        a
the hole was opposite the ear-passage.        The head was moved
about until the position of maximum sound was determined,
and was then withdrawn, leaving the plate in situ. In order
to verify conveniently that the position of maximum sound
was reallyat the centre of the shadow,      hole was bored through
                                                  a

the adjustment of the ear-plate.        When the adjustment was
 complete, the cork was removed; and then the eye placed
behind the ear-plate would see the source of sound through
the two holes.    With little practice the central point could
                                a
be picked out almost as well by ear as by eye.
        With a sensitive flame the observation        was even      easier.
The most suitable       that from
                           is        pin-hole burner brought
                                         a

                                    a
water. To get the best result, the pressure must be care
fully adjusted; and in order to avoid disturbance,           ad    it   is
visable to move the source rather than the flame.        When
the place of maximum effect has been determined, the cork
    removed from the central hole of the disk, and the gas
is is
    lowered.   By looking just over the burner       then easy
                                                        it   is
to see whether or not the source of sound occupies the central
position.
    On November 24 the toy reed was substituted for the bird
call, the disk and distances being the same as before.   In the
case of this source the experiment succeeded better with the
flame than with the ear.
    On subsequent occasion larger disk, of 30" diameter, was
          a                         a
tried   but the results were not so good, probably in conse

walls     of the room.

The boundary conditions at the surface of separation of two
media are : —
    1. That both the electric and magnetic displacement resolved
along the normal to the surface of separation should be the
same in both media.
    2. That both the electric and magnetic forces resolved
parallel to the surface of separation should be the same on both
media.
    If the medium is at rest, the equations reduce to the form
  which corresponds to a wave-motion propagated                  with a velo
city      ,.   .    In  the media we are concerned           with,    /* differs
 from unity only by a very small fraction            ; so  that the velocity
 of propagation is very nearly         —

                                             .  Now,  if the specific induc-
tive capacity of a dielectric depended upon the number of
 times in a second the electric displacement was reversed, the
 velocity of the different coloured rays would be different ;
 i. e. there would be dispersion.           There seems to be evidence
 that the specific inductive capacity does depend on the rate at
 which the electric displacements are reversed ; for Schiller and
 Gordon, reversing the displacements about 2000 times in a
 second, found the specific inductive capacity of glass was much
 smaller than when it was found in the usual way (Electrical
 Researches of the Hon. H. Cavendish, Appendix).                        To ex
 plain dispersion,       the  specific   inductive  capacity ought to in
 crease with the rapidity of reversal ; and as in light the dis
 placement is reversed billions of times in a second, it is no
 argument against its doing so that the specific inductive capa
                                      X2

288                     Mr. J. J.   Thomson   on
city is less for 2000 reversals a second than when the dis
placement is not reversed.         It would be interesting, however,
to see whether, with the rate of reversal obtainable in a labo
ratory, the specific inductive capacity altered more quickly
with the rate of reversal the greater the refractive index of the
medium.
    The boundary conditions will enable us to determine the
intensities of the refracted and reflected rays produced by a
ray of plane-polarized light incident on a reflecting surface.
According to Maxwell's theory, the electric displacement is
perpendicular to the plane of polarization, the magnetic dis
placement is in the plane of polarization, and both these dis
placements are perpendicular to the direction of propagation
of the ray.
    Let us calculate, first, the intensities for the reflected and
refracted ray for light polarized perpendicular to the plane of
incidence.
 Let

 the motion of the dielectric on the velocity of light.                  To take

 velocity u in the direction of propagation of the light, which
 we shall take as the axis of x.

hence we see that the velocity of the light is increased by one
half the velocity of the dielectric. This result is confirmed in
a very remarkable way by some experiments made by Fizeau,
and of which an account is published in the Comptes Rendus,
t. xxxiii. He found the difference in the velocity of light pass
ing through a tube filled with water when the water in the
tube was still and when it was moving; he was able to do this
very accurately by measuring the displacement produced in
some interference-fringes ; and he found that the velocity of
light was increased by half the velocity of the water.
    When the dielectric does not move uniformly as a rigid
body without rotation, the differential equations to find the
 electric and magnetic displacements are no longer the same.

desirable that the value should be accurately measured, at any
rate for our own college in the capital, Tokio.   Consequently
in 1877 an elaborate series of experiments was carried out by
some of the students under our supervision. The method first
employed consisted in experimentally finding two parallel axes
in a pendulum on opposite sides of the centre of gravity, and
in a plane with      such that the times of oscillation about
                       it,
either axis would be the same. The distance, then, between
these axes experimentally found would, as       well known, be

  Two Kater's      pendulums were employed — one made                       by
Messrs. Elliott, and the other by Messrs. Negretti and Zambra.
Borda's method of coincidence was employed          that   ; one ofis,
the Kater's pendulums was suspended exactly in front of the
pendulum of a clock, consisting of wooden rod carrying
                                                 a                          a
brass bob and beating approximately seconds.         One observer
watched the two pendulums, vibrating one in front of the
other, through     telescope some ten feet away; and at the in
                   a
stanta  pointer attached to one of the pendulums exactly coin
cided with a  line drawn on the other (the coincidence taking
place in the axis of the telescope as observed by the cross- wires),
a signal was given, and the time of the clock noted by two
independent observers.       A very large number of successive
coincidences was in this way observed, then the Kater's pen
dulum inverted, swung on the other knife-edge, and the same
thing repeated.     From these experiments the exact time of
vibration  of  the  Kater's   pendulum about either knife-edge
was ascertained, and one or both knife-edges moved to di
minish the difference in the time of vibration, and the whole
 experiment repeated.
   But although these observations, first with one of the
 Kater's pendulums and then with the other, were continued
for some months, many thousands of vibrations being observed
by the students, who worked at these experiments in their
usual most praiseworthy way, the results were always unsatis
factory. For an approximate value of for any part of the

         On the Acceleration  of Gravity for Tokio, Japan.    293
earth's surface can be calculated by a formula developed by
Clairault, who from pendulum-experiments made at a variety
of latitudes on the earth's surface has shown that, approxi
mately, for any latitude X and any height h centimetres above
the level of the sea,
                980-6056-2-5028    cos X-0-000003 h.
    As the latitude of the Imperial College of Engineering,
Tokio, is about 35° 39', Clairault's formula gives for g the
value 979-7 centimetres per second per second.       But the value
obtained by the series of experiments made with the Kater's        i
pendulums differed too much from this and from one another j
to allow of our trusting them.
     We therefore decided on employing a totally different me
 thod and a much less laborious one: — A brass ball 2352-2
 grammes in weight was suspended by a long steel wire 0*45
 millimetre in thickness, and in the earlier experiments 978*7
 centimetres in length.     The wire was supported from a steel
 knife-edge resting on a brass plate.      Both the brass ball and
 the bob of the seconds-pendulum of the standard clock' were
 fitted with fine pieces of platinum wire, either of which dipped
 into a small cup of mercury when the pendulum to which it
 was attached was vertical.     The mercury-cups &c. were then
joined up with a battery and resistance-coils to a quick-run
 ning Morse instrument, as seen in the figure, in which M is

 294    Messrs.    Ayrton and Perry on         the   Determination

 seconds-pendulum,     L the long pendulum, C, C the mercury-
 cups, R a resistance small compared with that of M plus that
 of the coil r, but large compared with that of M alone. The
 whole constituted what is known as a " break-circuit chrono
 graph;" that     is,
                    acontinuous ink mark was made on the paper
 run out by clockwork, broken by a very small gap each time
the wire attached to the bob of the seconds-pendulum       passed
through the mercury. These breaks, then, in the ink line in
dicated seconds    ;    however, both pendulums were simulta
                         if,
neously in the vertical line, no break was made. Hence the
absence of a   break in the line at the end of any special second
indicated coincidence of the two pendulums and in this way
                                                       ;
the times of a   large number of coincidences could be automa
tically registered.
   During this set of experiments we could not measure the
length of the long fine steel wire with as much accuracy as
was desired, since, although we had two or three brass scales,
the makers had omitted to record on them at what tempera
tures they were correct.  However, assuming that one of them
was accurate at 0° C, then a rather large number of experi
ments gave, as the value           of g, 978'8 centimetres per second   as
a first rough approximation.
   Subsequently we obtained from the Finance Department of
Japan the loan of two very beautiful standard brass scales,             by
 Deleuil of Paris, and guaranteed correct at 0° 0. One was
graduated in millimetres      the other consisted of
                                   ;                   brass rod
                                                             a
with two pieces at its ends at right angles to the rod, and the
distance between the two planes of the inner surfaces of the
pieces was exactly     metre at 0° C.
                         a               We now had, then, the
means of making       far more complete series of experiments
                        a
than before;   but as our trial pendulum was nearly ten times
as long as the seconds-pendulum      of our clock, the method of
coincidences was an inconvenient one         and so we merely
                                                 ;
adopted the following — The long pendulum alone controlled
                               :
the " break-circuit chronograph;" so that the number of breaks
in the line during any time indicated the number of vibrations
of the long pendulum in that time. At the commencement of
the experiment, after the pendulum had been set swinging
and the paper was running out at a fairly uniform speed,                a
mark was made on        by tapping sharply the armature up with
                         it
the finger when    chronometer, lying beside the Morse instru
                   a a              and after an hour or so, the
ment, indicated     certain time        ;
paper being kept running all the time, a second mark was
sharply made on the paper when the chronometer indicated                a
certain other noted time.    So much paper had then run out

         of   the Acceleration      of Gravity for Tokio, Japan.                    295
in  the interval of time shown by the chronometer; and the
breaks in the line, counted carefully afterwards by two inde
pendent students, gave the whole number of vibrations of the
pendulum in that time.     The fraction of a vibration could also,
of course, be ascertained by comparing with the length of the
lines in the neighbourhood the length of the first line made
after the first break had been produced, on tapping the arma
ture, and repeating the same process at the end of the paper.
The experiment         is,
                     of course, independent of the rate at which
the paper runs out, provided, of course,        never allowed to
                                                    it   is
run so slowly that there     any difficulty in distinguishing the
                                  is
different breaks electrically made by the long vibrating pen
dulum.     The mean temperature of the wire was carefully
taken at each experiment.      A sample of one or two of the
many experiments recorded in the students' laboratory note
book follows.

   Frequent sun-observations were made to check the rate of
the chronometer, which      comparatively easy in Japan, as
                                   is
during the winter there the sun   seen almost daily from sun
                                          is
rise to sunset.
   The next point was to measure accurately the length of the

  296     Messrs. Ayrton and    Perry    on the   Determination
  wire. As it was impossible to do this satisfactorily with the
  wire hanging up, it was taken down without disconnecting
  either the knife-edge carrying it or the ball at the other end.
  The knife-edge was then fixed at one end of a horizontal rail,
  and the other end of the wire close to the ball hung over a
  wheel with very little friction.     By this arrangement the wire
  in a horizontal position was, of course, stretched as much as it
  was in the vertical position, as far as the effect of the weight
  of the ball was concerned.     A correction had, however, to be
  made for the weight of the wire itself, which of course caused
 the tension to be a little less at the bottom than at the top
 when the pendulum was hanging up vertically.               A few cen
 timetres of similar fine steel wire being weighed, a simple inte
 gration gave the small additional weight necessary to be added.
 This being done, the final result obtained was that the length
 of the pendulum equalled 939-09 centimetres at 0° C; and the
 consequent value of g in air for Tokio, Japan, calculated from
 the result of about eighty thousand vibrations of the long pen
 dulum, would be 980*06 centimetres per second per second,
if the pendulum could be regarded as a simple mathematical
pendulum.
                         Correcting Factors.
    1. The two most obvious corrections to apply to this result
are the corrections for infinitely small arcs and for the air-
friction — neither of which were found of any practical conse
quence, on account of the very small angle through which the
pendulum usually swung, and that the decrement of the am
plitude of the vibrations was imperceptible even after many
swings. Although, however, such a pendulum as we were
using approaches very nearly a perfect simple pendulum, there
are certain causes of possible error arising from its flexibility
and slight elasticity which would not affect a rigid compound
pendulum. To estimate the practical effect of these possible
errors, it is necessary to solve generally the complete problem
of a heavy ball supported by an elastic wire, one end of -which
is soldered to the ball and the other end to a steel knife-edge.
When a suspended ball is swinging in the arc of a circle, we
know that near the end of a swing the attachments of the ball
have to resist a tendency for the ball to turn.         For since the
ball has been   turned  in passing    from  its  lowest to its highest
position, it would continue to     turn  were   it not stopped by the
wire itself. At the end of every swing, then, there must be a
slight kick ; so that in fact the ball will make minor swings
about its point of attachment all the time of the motion.           To
make this kick   less perceptible,   we  must     make  the  fastening

          of the Acceleration of Gravity for Tokio, Japan.              297
of the wire to the ball capable of resisting the tendency of the
ball to continue its turning motion. If we do this by solder
ing the wire, a smaller kick will result, and will be due to the
bending-moment of the wire resisting the turning action.            If
there were no difficulty of construction, it might be better to
get rid of this kick difficulty by making the bob capable of
rotating in the plane of swinging about an axis through its
centre of gravity.
    The investigation of the general problem of the swinging of
a heavy ball soldered to an elastic wire, the upper end of which
is attached to a knife-edge, may take somewhat the following
form: — Let A be a ball, of mass m and radius a, suspended
from a free hinge at B by a chain of n— 1 links, each of
length a and hinged to one another, the last hinge being on
the surface of the ball. Suppose at any hinge where two ad
jacent links make an angle 6 with one another, equal and op
posite couples act in them of moment c6 tending to bring them
 into the same straight line. As n is made greater and greater,
 we approximate more and more nearly to our actual case of
 an elastic wire. Let n be very great, and <j>i, d>2, . . . $n-\
 the inclinations of the 1st, 2nd, . . . (n— l)th link to the vertical,
 the nth link being the radius of the ball up to the hinge, and
 its inclination <f>„. If now we know the mass of the links per
 unit of length, it is easy to state the values of yfr1} ifr2). . . .
 tys) ' - •   the couples acting on each respective link : thus

care being taken to remember that the form      of ^r, is different
from that of      or of y(rn.
     If
      the inclination    <f>  everywhere very small, we find,
                               is                                v,     if
is the velocity of the end of link     thats,

less proceeding further with the solution.

of period P, determined by assuming the connexions as rigid,
combined with motions of much shorter periods P1} P2, P3, . . .

                                         as in our experiments, very
thin,  the kick cannot    be  much    less than the time of complete
                                                               a
vibration of the ball when freely suspended by a point on its
surface, or
where a   is the radius of the ball.      But this periodic time              is
0*528 seconds, or about one twelfth of that of the pendulum
moving as     awhole, which       about
                                  is       seconds.

    Since the tendency of the ball to add this quick vibration to
its motion      due to its rotational energy,
               is                                may be diminished

by lessening the moment of inertia of the ball (that            by      is,
making the ball small), or by diminishing the angular velocity
of the pendulum (that       is,by making the pendulum as long
and its swing as small as possible). We may regard, then, the
motion of the ball as compounded of a pure harmonic motion
with an amplitude of about 30 centimetres and a periodic time
of seconds, with another motion having very small ampli
    6                                                 a

                    a                        second.
                                               a      But we have
proved in the paper on our seismograph*, that in such a case
the compound motion would differ very slightly from that of
a  pure harmonic motion, even         there were no internal fric
                                       if
tion in the substance of the wire (supposing the pendulum
started without shock); but as internal friction, of course,
exists in the wire, this error becomes exceedingly small.
    2. Next, with regard to the stretching of the wire arising
from variations in the centrifugal force of the ball while
swinging.     Since the time of a complete vibration of our pen
dulum was nearly       seconds and the arc about 30 centimetres,

               ^6
hence the pull on the wire, which at the end of the swing was
equal to the weight of the wire, or 2352"2 grammes, was in
creased by
                 2352-2 x (15-7)2

                   939x979-7
at the middle of the swing. But this is less than a gramme,
so that no practical extension of the wire arose from centri
fugal force.
   3. Shortening of the length of the wire, due to its curvature,
arising from the resistance of the air making it concave in the
direction of motion. It is easy to see that the shortening of
the pendulum due to this cause is excessively small, and is of
the same order as the lengthening arising from the centrifugal
force; so that these two very small errors may be regarded as
balancing one another.
   Also, since it may be calculated that the period of transverse
vibration of the wire is less than one fortieth of the periodic
time of the pendulum, the resistance of the air cannot tend to
cause amplification of the lateral vibrations in the wire itself.
    We may therefore assume that our pendulum vibrated like
 a rigid body, consisting of a ball of brass, a straight steel wire,
 and a triangular steel prism of which the edge was the fixed
 axis.
                             Calculation of g.
     The complete formula        is,   of course,

  was therefore 3'3803 x 106 (gramme, centimetre), and the dis

I                for the Imperial College of Engineering, Japan —
  a result agreeing extremely closely with the number 979*7
  obtained above from Clairault's formula.
     In beginning this series of observations we expected to find
 g to be greater than what Clairault's formula gives it.         Our
 reason was this : — Clairault's formula assumes a circular
 equator ; Capt. Clarke has found that the equator is ellip
 tical, one extremity of its major axis being in 15° 34' E.
 longitude ; and therefore Tokio is in longitude nearer a minor
 axis than a major one. We find, however, a reason why g
 satisfies so well Clairault's formula, in spite of this excentricity
 of the equator. The greatest depression of the earth's surface
 is only a few hundred miles to the east of Japan; and probably
 the diminution in g produced by this cause just counter
 balances the increase of g produced by ellipticity of the
 equator.      As for local perturbations, it is to be remarked that
 Tokio is situated on a very large plane, there being no hills
 of any magnitude within eighty miles. We think that the
             of Japan is of special interest on account of the great
 feodesy
   'acific depression, and on account of the very gradual slope
 of the earth's surface from Japan to China, which causes Japan
to be a sort of ridge.
     Probably the best method of determining the value of g

        of   the Acceleration      of Gravity for Tokio, Japan.            301
would be to use a rigid homogeneous pendulum, of such a
shape that its moment of inertia could be easily calculated with
accuracy from its linear dimensions measured at any tempe
rature — for example, a sphere at the end of a cylindrical rod
with a knife-edge, all cast in one piece and turned true in the
lathe, or a cylindrical bob cast at the end of the cylindrical
rod. The only possible objection to this method would be the
possible want of homogeneity in the metal.           This might be
                                      —
allowed for in the following way : Instead of casting the cy
lindrical bob in one piece, make it consist of a number of con
centric tightly fitting cylindrical shells accurately turned.
Experiments would then be made first with the cylinders all in
one position, then with some of them twisted slightly round,
and so on until in the mean result the errors of eccentricity
of mass would probably be eliminated.
   Another, and perhaps the best of all methods, would be for
rigid compound pendulums to be accurately timed experimen
tally at Greenwich at a number of different temperatures, and
sold with a scale of temperature-corrections for the time of
vibration attached.
   One set of experiments, then, with one of these pendulums
anywhere would at once give the value of g; and such a pen
dulum would undoubtedly be the most suitable for surveys
and expeditions in foreign countries. The fact                   is,
                                                         the mathe
matical beauty of the principle involved in the Kater's pendu
lum has, in our opinion, caused far too much importance to
be attached to      it as a practical instrument for determining
experimentally     the  value of the acceleration of gravity.
   We   have  to  thank   several of our late students, and especi
ally Messrs. Honda, Kikkawa, A. Kasai, J. Nakahara, and
H. Nobechi for assistance rendered us during this investi
gation. And    it  may here be mentioned that this investigation,
like the many others we have been enabled to carry out during
the last few years, has resulted from the plan we have followed
of teaching the laboratory students not, as            customary in
                                                            is
Colleges, to repeat well-known experiments, but to endeavour
in their investigations to advance, in some small degree at any
rate, the bounds of existing knowledge.          And this system of
enlisting  the   assistance  of even  quite young students in ori
ginal research we have found to create an enthusiasm in ex
perimental work otherwise unproducible.

Geology  of Wisconsin. Survey of 1873-77. "Vol.        II.  8vo, 768 pp. ,
   with numerous Plates and other Illustrations       ; accompanied     by
   an Atlas of Maps.    Published under the Direction of the Chief
   Geologist, by the Commissioners of Public Printing, in accordance
   with Legislative Enactment.       [Madison.]    1877.
^THOUGH entitled the " second," this volume of             the Geological
      Survey of Wisconsin is the first in order of publication, the initial
           "
or " first volume being delayed until the Survey shall have been
completed and the general conclusions        and economical applications
required by the law establishing the Survey to be given in vol. i.
shall have been arrived at.      By far the greater part of the State
has been distributed among the Geological Surveyors ; but in this
volume the results of the examination of only about half of the
area (namely the eastern, south-central, and south-western Counties)
are given ; and this alone comprises more than 30,000 square
miles.    Fourteen large topographical and geological maps illustrate
the region.
   The "Historical" division of this volume includes the "Annual
                                   "
Reports of progress and results for the years 1873 and 1874, by
the late Dr. I. A. Lapham, who lived to be Chief Geologist only two
years, and for the year 1875 by Dr. 0. W.Wight, who was on duty
for one year.    These Annual Reports had not been previously pub
lished. That for 1876, by the present Chief Geologist, T. C. Cham-
berlin, was published ; and, together with the separate and local
Reports from the individual Surveyors, Assistant Geologists, Che
mists, Naturalists, and Palaeontologists, it has been incorporated in
the elaborated chapters of the finished volume, as far as concerns
those portions of Wisconsin now described.
    Part II. of this volume treats of the Geology of Eastern Wis
consin, more than 12,000 square miles, by T. C. Chamberlin
(pp. 93-405), freely illustrated with sections, plans, and maps.         A
bibliographic list of previous observers and writers is first given ;
and then the Topography of the district forms Chapter I., pointing
out : — (1) the features due to geological agencies in Pre-Glacial,
Glacial, and Post-Glacial times ; (2) the valleys (especially of Pox
River, Rock River, and Lake Michigan), their peculiarities and
commercial importance ; (3) the dividing ranges ; and (4) elevations,
in a long alphabetical list. Chapter II., on the Hydrology, is well
 occupied by : — (1) the Drainage, the Mississippi and St. Lawrence
 being the great recipients ; (2) the origin and geological relations
 of the Lakes of Eastern Wisconsin.       Lake Michigan, it is pointed
 out, " has been the theatre of powerful glacial action ; and to this
 cause its present regular outline and great depth and breadth are
undoubtedly due" (p. 137). Many of the smaller lakes have been
similarly formed ; whilst some have been dammed up by moraines,

                    Notices respecting New Books.                     30S-
and others confined between drift-ridges.       Many lake-areas have-
been limited, or quite filled up, by sedimentary deposits, now-
forming valuable land.        (3) Water-supply by springs and wells,
also local water-power, and changes of drainage, especially by the
felling of timber, are duly noticed.
    Chapter III. treats of the Native Vegetation, dividing itself into : —
A. Upland Vegetation ; B. Marsh Vegetation ; C. Intermediate
groups. The relation of rocks and soils to the local vegetation is
carefully kept in sight. Soils and their origin form the interesting
matter of Chapter IV. ; and Chapter V. has a full treatment of the
Quaternary formations, or Drift, of the district under notice. In
the first place, (1) morainic ridges, and (2) boulder-clay or till, are-
 described as " Primary Drift ;" secondly, the sands and gravels of
lake-beaches     and lacustrine deposits of clay are described           as
 " Secondary or modified Drift ;" thirdly, many       local deposits due
to streams and small lakes are referred to. Glacial movements and
 the results of ice-action come within the subject-matter of these
                                                       "
 pages; and the Kettle Range, with its "Pot-holes or " Sinks" and
 its mounds and ridges of sand and gravel, is particularly described.
 The Kettle Range proper is parallel with Lake Michigan, but con
 tinues south, west, and north, in an elliptical curve, as the boundary
 line of a great radiating ioe-drift from the north-east. In its-
 eastern portion it has been accumulated between the above men
 tioned and another, similar, parallel, south-west driftage, which
 came along the Lake Michigan area.          The economic uses of the
  Drift-deposits for bricks, pottery, &c, and the shell-marl and peat
  of obliterated lakes, are also treated of.
     Four chapters are next occupied with a description of the geolo
  gical formations which constitute the substructure of Eastern Wis
  consin, namely : — (1) Devonian : the Hamilton group.        (2) Upper
  Silurian: the Lower Helderberg and the Niagara. (3) Lower
  Silurian: the Cincinnati, Galena, Trenton, St. -Peters, Lower Mag-
  nesian, and Potsdam formations. (4) ArcJwean : the Huronian and
  Laurentian.
     In Part III. of the volume we have the " Geology of Central Wis
  consin," by Roland D. Irving (pp. 407-636).       This tract comprises
  an area of about 10,000 square miles, and exhibits Laurentian,
  Huronian, Primordial (namely, 1. Lower or Potsdam Sandstone,
  and 2. Beds of Passage, as the Mendota Limestone and Madison
  Sandstone), Canadian (namely, 1. Lower Magnesian Limestone, and
  2. St.-Peter's Limestone), and Trenton (namely, 1. Trenton Limestone,
  2. Galena Limestone) groups (see Table, with details, at p. 460).
  Above these Lower Silurian rocks are Quaternary deposits of the
   Glacial, Champlain, and Recent formations. This report is illustrated
  with numerous and especially neat sections and plans, with the pro
   portional scales systematically given. Among the many interesting
  details supplied, the definition and description of the western
  portion of the Kettle Range, consisting of morainic drift (pp. 615 &c),
  alluded to above, are especially noteworthy. To this Report is an

 portion of the rock-material collected by the Survey in Central
 Wisconsin (pp. 637-642).
     Part IV. (pp. 643-752) gives an account of the geology and topo
 graphy of the Lead Region, by Moses Strong, with many illustra
 tions. This is the south-western corner of Wisconsin, in the angle
  between the Wisconsin river on the north and the Mississippi on
 the west, with Illinois on the south.          The plan of surveying, list of
 elevations, topography, including drainage and surface-features, are
 noted and described.       The diminution of river-water is noticed as
 due probably to the removal of forests.           Many old water-mills now
  stand neglected ; but at the same time some mines have been
 reopened and profitably worked, owing to the lessened quantity of
 underground water. The surface-geology shows soils, subsoils, and
 drift, which are duly noticed ; and the deeper geological formations
 are described as fully as space permits.            They are Potsdam Sand
 stone, Lower Magnesian Limestone, St.-Peter's Sandstone, Tren
 ton (buff and blue) Limestones, with ores of zinc and lead, Galena
 Limestone (dolomite), with ores in nests, sheets, &c, and the Cin
 cinnati group.       The " Lead Region " proper is then described
 (pp. 689 &c.), namely the area of the exposure of the Galena
 Limestone, about 1776 square miles. The local mining terms are
 explained : and the mineralogy of the district is shown by a list of
 classified local minerals.       " The minerals appear to have been
 deposited in the following general order : —
                                   Galenite.
                                          I
                                  Sphalerite.
                              Dolomite.     Calcite.
                      Pyrite.  Marcasite.     Chalcopyrite.
                                    Barite.

              Cerussite.   Smithsonite.     Malachite.   Azurite."
    Exceptions, however, and obscure conditions are far from being
uncommon.
    The present condition of the mines and diggings in the various
districts (pp. 694 &c.) is described in some detail ; and the statistics
of all the mineral produce are given.
    A full, clear Index completes this volume, which is well worthy
of every geologist's consideration and study. Being a highly praise
worthy production, at the hands of the geologists, artists, printers,
and all concerned, it brings honour to the statesmen of Wisconsin,
who are wise enough to have a good Geological Survey, and liberal
enough to get it done in a creditable manner.

    Minchin, M.A. Dublin, Professor of Applied Mathematics in the
    Royal Indian Engineering College, Cooper's Hill. Second Edition,
    Corrected and Enlarged.          Oxford, at the Clarendon Press, 1880.

    "We noticed the first edition of this work at the time of its pub
lication (p. 386, vol. iv. fifth series), and      expressed our sense of its
great merits as a comprehensive treatise on Statics. We need not,
therefore, do more on the present occasion than mention the leading
points in which this second edition differs from its predecessors.
There are, of course, numerous minor alterations and corrections,
 such as those which are almost invariably required in the second
 edition of a mathematical work abounding in examples, or as the
 division of chapter 6 of the first edition into chapters 6 and 7 of
 the new edition.       Besides these alterations there are additions of
importance     — such   as the articles in chapter 5, on the force polygon
and the funicular polygon, and on the construction derived from
them of the resultant of a given system of forces in one plane ; and
those on " Astatic Equilibrium," a subject on which an interesting
 paper was published not long ago by the author in the Proceedings
of the London Mathematical Society. The most important addi
tion, however, is chapter 16, on what we pointed out as an omitted
subject in our notice of the first edition. It treats of the Equilibrium
of an Elastic Solid, and consists of three sections, viz. the " analysis
 of small strains," the "analysis of stresses," and the " expression of
stress in terms of strain."           Although the chapter runs to the
length of sixty-two pages, it may be surmised that the author felt
himself rather in want of space, or he would hardly have given so
                              "                                         "
important a theorem as the equation of three moments in the
form of an unworked example.              However, the chapter is a most
valuable addition to the work, and one that will require and repay
the student's closest attention.
   The present edition is issued as a volume of the Clarendon Press
series, and is printed in the ordinary octavo form.               The latter cir
cumstance has greatly improved           its appearance   ;  it has also given it
the air   of having   been  greatly enlarged    ; but  so far   as we have com
pared   the  two  editions   this   does   not  seem  to   have   been the case,
except   so  far as  chapter  16  is concerned.

  ON THE TEMPERATURE            OF FROZEN LAKES.            BY F.-A. FOREL.
TN    1879 some interesting thermometric soundings beneath the ice
     of the Scotch lakes were published in ' Nature,' vol. xix. p. 4Sij
by Mr. J. T. Buchanan, which have considerably modified the
accepted ideas upon the limit of the vertical propagation of cold
in fresh water.         Instead of finding at the bottom, as was ex
pected, a layer of water with the temperature of 4° C. (that of

306             Intelligence      and Miscellaneous      Articles.
the maximum density of water), Mr. Buchanan ascertained that, in
Loch Lomond, the temperature of the water gradually rose from 0°
at the' surface to 2°"4 at 20 metres depth, but did not rise higher.
Must we infer from this the incorrectness of the classic theory of
the congelation of lakes ? According to that theory, water, after
cooling throughout its mass down to 4° under the action of thermal
convection currents, becomes colder only at the surface, being stra
tified in layers the colder the more superficial they are, conformably
to the order of their densities. The following observations prove
that the depths reached by Mr. Buchanan were not sufficient to
show the limit of the superficial cooling, which descends to a much
greater depth than has ever been supposed.
    I  have repeated these researches in some Swiss lakes which are
deeper than those of Scotland.              My soundings, executed with a
Negretti-and-Zambra          thermometer,    were made in the Lake of Morat
 on December 23, 1879, and the Lake of Zurich on January 25,
 1880.

    From  these numbers    I draw the following conclusions : — '¦
    1. The old theory of the freezing of lakes, which assumes a pro
gressive cooling of the whole mass down to 4°, and then a further
lowering of the temperature of the superficial layers stratified from
0° to 4° according to the order of their densities, is perfectly correct.
    2. The penetration of the cold into the upper layers may descend
to a depth of 110 metres (Zurich).
    3. It was in consequence of its comparative shallowness that
Loch Lomond did not exhibit to Mr. Buchanan the temperature of
4° in its bottom layers.
    4. The penetration of cold into the upper layers takes place pro
gressively and very gradually.       The curve which can be drawn
from my numbers from the Lake of Zurich presents neither leaps
nor jerks ; it is altogther analogous to the curves of superficial
heating of a lake in summer. This, it seems to me, is quite suffi
cient to put aside the supposition that the cooling, which penetrates
so deeply, takes place either by way of thermal convection or by
mechanical mixture under the action of waves and currents — with
the exception, perhaps, of the upper layer of from 5 to 10 metres
thickness.
    Must this penetration of cold be attributed to phenomena of
conductivity, or to phenomena of radiation, either of the water
itself or of the soil through the water? The experiments have not
 supplied me with any elements for answering this question.
    5. On comparing the two series of soundings made in the Lake
 of Morat, separated by an interval of forty days,       I find that the
 mean temperature remained exactly the same.         Therefore the layer
 of ice absolutely stopped the cooling of the water, and the action
 of the exterior cold was all expended in increasing the thickness of
 the ice.
     6. During these forty days the water of the Lake of Morat be
 neath the ice underwent an equalization of temperature ; the colder
 upper layers were warmed a little, while the warmer bottom layers
 were cooled ; but we are still very far from finding complete unifor
 mity of temperature in the entire depth of the lake on the 1st of
 February. — Comptes Hendus de VAcad. des Sciences, Eeb. 16, 1880.

 tion-variables ; and thereby the equation for the distribution of
 velocities in a moved gas is simplified.    Here the velocities meant
 are everywhere those before impact.        The determination of the
 coefficient of friction by the development of a series, exact account
 being taken of the distribution of velocities, is then encountered by
 no difficulty.

RESEARCHES ON THE RELATIVE INTENSITY OF THE SPECTRAL
     LINES OF HYDROGEN AND NITROGEN IN REGARD TO THE CON
     STITUTION OF NEBULA.           BY CH. FIEVEZ, ASSISTANT ASTRO
    NOMER AT THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY AT BRUSSELS.
    Huggins's observations* having shown that the spectrum of the
nebulae 37    HIV.    Draconis, 73  HIV.   Cygni, and some others con
 sisted of a few bright lines, one of which, brighter than the others,
coincides with a nitrogen-line, and another, finer, corresponds with
 the line F of hydrogen, he was led to investigate whether the com
 plicated spectrum of nitrogen might not be simplified by extinction t.
    He remarked that, by causing the induction-spark to spring be
 tween platinum electrodes placed before the objective of a telescope,
 only one line of nitrogen was visible in the spectroscope applied to
  the ocular extremity.
    Afterwards, examining the spectrum of nitrogen with a spectro
 scope having a prism of 60°, and placing near the eye a neutral-
 tint prism corrected for refractiou and possessing equal absorptive
 power for all parts of the spectrum, he saw that the two groups
 of nitrogen-lines in the orange were nearly extinguished, while
 the lines in the green were very bright.           And on employing a
  small direct-vision spectroscope, fluggins found it possible, by in
  creasing the distance between the instrument and the spark, to
  obtain a position in which the double line in the green (Pliicker's
  group IV.) X coincident with that of the nebula was alone visible.
  The spectrum of the spark in nitrogen then resembled that of the
  nebula.
     Huggins's researches do not appear to have been carried further
  in this direction ; nevertheless he believes that, if the spectrum of
  hydrogen were reduced in intensity, the line F, which corresponds
  with that of the nebula, would alone remain visible after the line
  C and the other more refrangible ones had become loo faint to affect
  the eye.
     The verification of this hypothesis is connected with a very im
  portant question, viz.
                            " Do the lines of the spectrum of a nebula
  represent the total light emitted by that body ? or are they merely

the most marked, the others having been extinguished by the effect
                "
of distance ?
    Moreover, if it were proved that the other lines of the spectra
of nitrogen and hydrogen are stopped in their passage, we might
regard this as an indication of the extinctive power of cosmic spaces.
For this reason we have endeavoured, in imitation of Huggins, to
ascertain by experiment if an alteration in the luminous intensity
of a gas, without modification of the temperature and pressure of the
gas, would correspond with the disappearance of one or more lines
in the spectrum.
     The method we have employed consists in projecting, by means
of a lens, a real image of the luminous body upon the slit of
the spectroscope,      and then altering the intensity of that image,
either by reducing the aperture of the projecting lens, or by shift
ing a diaphragm pierced with a circular aperture between the lens
and the projected image.        All the observations took place in a dark
room, the apparatus being arranged as follows : —
     (1) A Melloni optical bench supporting the projection-objective
and the diaphragm. The objective has a clear opening of 8 centims. ;
the diaphragm is that of Melloni's apparatus.
     (2) An automatic reversing-spectroscope of Toung, with a vari
able dispersion of from two to ten prisms, placed behind the optical
bench.
     The observing-telescope is of the same focal length, parallel, and
twinned with the collimator.         The two objectives are thus shifted
 simultaneously, and to the same extent, at the time of adjusting.
 The slit of the spectroscope is horizontal ; and the optic axis of the
 collimator coincides with that of the projection-objective.
     (3) A Pliicker's tube coated all over with lampblack, with the
exception of a small portion of the straight part, is placed vertically
(upon a movable foot, permitting it to be fixed at a suitable height)
 in front of the projection-objective.
     The distances from the tube to this objective, and from this to
 the slit, are so combined that the width of the projected image is
 less than the length of the slit, and that the whole of the luminous
 pencil passing through the slit is received upon the objective of the
 collimator.     This last arrangement, devised by Lockyer, constitutes
 a most important advance in the improvement of the methods of
 spectral observation : it permits us to recognize in a spectrum the
 long lines and the short lines, which were first discovered by that
  accomplished English physicist.
      In our experiments the Pliicker tube was placed at 40 centims.
  from the front lens of the objective, and about 1*3 metre from the
  slit of the spectroscope.
     The induction-current was furnished by a Gaiffe induction-coil of
  large dimensions, set in action by a battery of eight couples with
  bichromate of potass, and capable of giving a spark of 50 centims.
  in free air. The intensity of the current was regulated by the
  greater or less immersion of the polar plates in the acid solution.
      A condenser, formed of ten fulminating squares having a total
  surface of 5 square metres, and arranged either in tension or in

                     Intelligence   and Miscellaneous     Articles.           311
quantity, could         be put in communication with the two poles of the
bobbin.
      A small coil, giving a spark of a few millims. in free air, was
also used when a very feeble current was required.                  The experi
ments were repeated a great number of times ; so that they present
a fair degree of certainty.
                                 Hydrogen Spectrum,.
      Experiment 1. — The large coil was employed, with the condenser
arranged in tension, the dispersion of the spectroscope consisting
of six prisms, and the three lines C, F, and H being distinctly
visible under these conditions.              The luminous pencil being then
progressively         narrowed    by  means  of a diaphragm pierced with an
aperture         of 7  millims.  diameter,  on  moving this diaphragm further
from the slit, and consequently bringing it nearer to the objective,
the length of the lines is observed to diminish, and at last the line
 H becomes invisible, while C and F are still bright.
      Exp. 2.— Conditions the same ; dispersion of four prisms ; aper
 ture of the diaphragm 2 millims.             By operating as before, the line
 H is first extinguished, then the line C ; and on placing the dia
phragm close to the projection-objective, the line F only is visible.
      Exp. 3. — Conditions the same, the same dispersion, condenser
 arranged in quantity, aperture of the diaphragm 2 millims.                   The
 same results are obtained ; but it is not necessary to move the dia
 phragm so far from the slit to cause C to disappear.
 ,    Exp. 4. — With the small coil, without a condenser, and with
 a dispersion of six prisms, the lines C, F, and H are well shown in
  the spectrum.          By then interposing the diaphragm of 2 millims.
 aperture, the lines are observed, at first to grow fainter and shorter ;
  then the line H disappears, and afterwards the line C, the line F
  remaining then alone visible. By employing a dispersion of six
  prisms the same effect is produced more rapidly.
                                   Nitrogen Spectrum.
       It   is known that the line spectrum of nitrogen, called also the
   spectrum of the second order, is formed of several groups of lines,
   indicated by Pliicker
                                * by the numerals I., II., III., IV., and V.
                  —
       Exp. 1 . With the large coil, the condenser in quantity, and a
   dispersion of six prisms, group I. was faintly visible ; the others
   were very marked. By interposing the diaphragm of 7 millims.
   aperture, groups I., III., V., II., and the lines of group IV. with
   the exception of the double line coinciding with that of the nebulas
   37 HIV. and 73 H IV., are successively extinguished.
       Exp. 2. — Same conditions, dispersion of two prisms, and dia
   phragm of 2 millims. aperture. The same results were obtained ;
   the groups successively disappear, and the double line alone remains
    visible.
       If in any of the preceding experiments, at the instant that ex
    tinction of a line is produced the slit of the spectroscope be opened
    wider, the line immediately reappears — which demonstrates that
    the disappearance is caused by the weakening of the luminous in-

tensity.    It seems, therefore, well established that a gas, although
possessing several spectral lines, may manifest itself in the spec
troscope by the presence of a single line, the others remaining invi
sible on account of the want of brightness of the luminous body.
There is, then, a great probability that a known element exists in
a celestial body when a line belonging to that element has been
proved to exist in the spectrum. And as the spectra of the nebulae
37 HIV. &c. show those lines of nitrogen and hydrogen which
longest resist extinction, we may, with Huggins, regard those
nebula? as including nitrogen and hydrogen among their constituent
substances, and attribute the relative invisibility of the other lines
to absorption by space, acting equally upon rays of every degree of
refrangibility.    We say " relative invisibility," because it is probable
that the lines now invisible could be perceived with more powerful
telescopes than those which we possess at present. — Ball. Soc. de

   ON THE ELECTROMOTIVE         FORCES WHICH APPEAR IN FREE JETS
                                OF WATER,
    We have been favoured by the author, M. J. Elster, with a copy
of his Inaugural Dissertation* on the above subject, which appears
to have been prepared under the guidance of Prof. Quincke.                  It
is considered as proved by these investigations : —
    1. That if an electromotive force is to arise in a free jet of water,
it is necessary that the water particles ba in contact with a solid body ;
    2. That the evolution of electricity takes place only where the
particles of the liquid undergo friction, so that only a relatively
small portion of the water-jet contributes any thing to the deve
lopment of electricity ;
    3. That when the velocity of a jet issuing constantly from the
same orifice is varied, the electromotive forces are proportional to
the vires vivce of the liquid particles — a relation the reason of which
is found in the law of the conservation of energy ;
    4. And, lastly, that the electromotive force is dependent on th e
nature of the body which is in contact with the liquid.
    Prom these results the author draws the following conclusions : —
    1. The motion of a fluid does not by itself produce any electro
motive force. Consequently the inference deduced by Edlund from
his unitary theory of electricity has not been confirmed.
    2. Capillary electric currents are conditioned solely by the fric
tion of the particles of the fluid in motion —in nonhumectant fluids
by their friction against the particles of the solid wall, in humec-
tant fluids by friction on the particles of a layer of the same fluid
condensed upon the surface of the solid body, which behaves towards
the less dense layer like a heterogeneous substance.
    3. The capillary-electric   currents discovered by Quincke are
identical with the friction-currents, first observed by Zollner, which
make their appearance in the rubber of an electrical machine.

              the many subjects of physical inquiry which have
AMONG
   claimed       the attention of investigators during the past
thirty years, one of the most interesting and at the same time
not the least important has been that of the diffusion of liquids.
Leaving out of consideration the experiments of Jolly f, Lud-
wigj, Cloettafj, and others, who observed the progress of dif
fusion between two media separated by a membrane, and
whose results, besides being somewhat contradictory among
themselves, have a physiological rather than a physical or
chemical interest, we come first, in the consideration of the
literature, to the work of Graham         which, as has been re

314                      Dr.     J.   H. Long on      the
quantity of water in vessels upon whose bottoms the phials
stood.   By carefully removing these from time to time and
analyzing the contents of the vessels, the amount of substance
diffused was found.    In these experiments Graham dispensed
with a membrane entirely, and thus avoided a source of error
which had robbed the investigations of his predecessors of
much of their scientific value.    In the two papers read before
the Royal Society in 1850, he established among others the
following facts : —
    1. The velocity of diffusion is in general different for each
substance in solution.
    2. The amounts of salt diffused in the same time from solu
tions of the same substance, but of different concentrations,
are very nearly proportional to these concentrations.
    3. The amount of salt diffused from a given solution in
creases with the temperature of the solution.
    From his investigations Graham was led also to believe
that a relation exists between the boiling-points of solutions
and their rates of diffusion, and that no simple relation seems
to exist between the molecular weight of a salt and its rate of
diffusion when dissolved.     These and other points of Graham's
work will be referred to again later, as will also the results
he obtained by means of the method of jar-diffusion, as he
termed      it*.
   The chief characteristic of the earlier Graham experiments
(those of 1850       I
                  mean) is that they were concerned, not so
much with an investigation of the theory of diffusion (that                        is,
with the purely physical side of the question), as with the rela
tion of various substances to each other as regards diffusion,
an inquiry more chemical than physical in its nature.       This
is not the case, however, with an investigation published by
Fick in 1855f. He regarded the work of Graham as possess
ing qualitative rather than quantitative value, and remarked
      a                                 a
that gave no clue to the fundamental law of the phenomenon.
      it
He showed that liquid diffusion may be compared to the con
duction of heat — that       that the spread of salt-particles
                                  is,
through water     in many respects analogous to the spread of
                    is
heat in    conducting body, and that similar formulas to those
           a
established by Fourier for the latter case may be applied in
the former.
   Fick described several methods by means of which the law
of diffusion may be determined experimentally, one of which
isthe following.    A vertical glass cylinder open at both ends
was fitted tightly below into vessel containing saturated salt-

solution, and then carefully filled with water and placed in a
large reservoir likewise containing water.         Here it stood for
several weeks, the water in the outer vessel being removed
from time to time and fresh added. The concentration of the
liquid in the cylinder was then determined at different heights,
and from these data the amounts of salt diffused to the same
heights reckoned.
     It was found that these amounts decreased from below
upwards, and indeed in such a manner as to satisfy the require
ments of this previously assumed hypothesis : — " If in a cylin
 drical vessel dynamic equilibrium exists, the concentration-
 differences of any two layers must be related to each other as
 the distances separating them ; in other words, the densities
 must decrease from below upward as the ordinates of a right      8
 line."
     In                _
         another experiment, Fick arranged three tubes of equal
 diameters but of unequal lengths in the same manner, and
 allowed the salt to diffuse through them into large vessels of
 water. He found in this case that the amounts of diffused salt
 were inversely proportional to the lengths of the tubes, the
 concentrations in the reservoirs below being the same.
     These results can be expressed in the following equation,
 in which S is the amount of salt passing the horizontal section
 q in the time t ; wx and w2, the concentrations of two layers ; and
  I, the distance separating them, supposing that a condition of
  constancy (Beharrungszustand) has been reached ; k is the
  so-called constant of diffusion, depending on the nature of the
  salt in question.
      Beilstein* was the next who published on the subject. He,
  as Graham, considered the chemical rather than the physical
  side of the problem; and the method employed by him was in
  substance as follows.      A glass tube about 3 inches long was
  bent at one end, and the shorter arm ground off until it was
  not more than a millimetre in length ; the other end was
  drawn out and fitted with a ground glass stopper.         This dif
  fusion-cell, resembling somewhat a very short siphon-baro
  meter, was filled with salt-solution of known strength and
  suspended vertically in a large vessel of pure water.     Diffusion
  now took place between the solution in the short arm of the
  glass and the medium above.        After allowing this to continue
  a few days, the small vessel was removed and the salt still
  remaining in it determined ; subtracting this from the original

amount, the portion diffused was known. The amounts diffused
from similar solutions of t«n different substances are given by
Beilstein; but, owing to the fact that he failed to state the exact
dimensions of his diffusion-glass (he mentioned that it con
tained about 5-5 cubic centims.), it is impossible to compare
these results with those of Graham.        The determination of
Fick's diffusion-constant from Beilstein's work          of course,    is,
impossible.
   In paper published in 1857, Simmler and Wild* have
        a
shown that in certain cases     possible to determine the dif
                                         it    is
fusion-constant from condition of the solution not yet sta
                               a
tionary, as they claim was the case in the experiments of their
predecessors.
   They also suggested several new methods of observation.
One of these, a so-called optical method, was some twenty
years later applied by Johannisjanzf; and in the meanwhile
another optical property of certain solutions was made use of
by Hoppe-Seylerf and Voit§ in similar investigations.
   Hoppe-Seyler and Voit experimented with substances pos
sessing the property of rotatory polarization — solution of            a
grape-sugar for instance.      Such a solution was placed in a
glass vessel with parallel sides       layer of water was then
                                                   ;     a
brought over this without mixing with it. The sugar, diffu
sing into the water above, imparted to this latter the rotatory
  ower.   By observing the amount of rotation at different
 eights  in the glass vessel, data were obtained from which the
diffused sugar at these points could be calculated.
   Johannisjanz used       hollow glass prism as diffusion-cell.
                               a
The lower half of this was filled with salt-solution, the upper
with water.    As the salt diffused upwards the refracting-power
of the latter was altered; and upon this was based the method
of determining the amount of diffused salt. For the details
of these processes     refer to the original articles mentioned
                          I
above.    Although these three investigations were evidently
conducted with great care,         was found, however, that the
                                              it
results obtained          by
                      Hoppe-Seyler and Voit did not agree with
each other, and that the value of      as determined by Johan
                                                         k,
nisjanz for NaCl, was quite different from that obtained by
Fick.
   The cause        of these discrepancies
                                    remained unknown until
very recently, when Stefan showed that the optical methods
                                         ||
are based on    false assumption, and that they can give

 whose     density varies from below upward, as is the case in a
 diffusing salt or sugar solution, must act as a prism whose
 refracting angle is turned upward, and hence that a ray of
 light which enters such a medium in a horizontal direction
 cannot pass through it in the same straight line, but must ex
 perience a refraction downwards.               This conclusion of Stefan
 is strengthened by the fact that the values found by means of
 the optical methods are much smaller than those required by
 Fick's theory.         Any further discussion of these methods is
 unnecessary in this place.
     Marignac* published the next investigation on diffusion.
He followed exactly the process of Graham ; and his work
differed from that of the latter only in this, that he observed
the simultaneous diffusion of two salts, instead of that of solu
tions of single salts, as did Graham in most cases.                  We shall
have occasion to refer to his work again.
     About a year ago H. F. Weber published a very interesting
                               "
paper, under the title           Untersuchungen iiber das Elementar-

                                    I
method employed by him refer to his paper, and will mention
here only some of the results.               He experimented with solu
tions of ZnS04, and found the constant k for this substance
 corresponding to several different concentrations and tempe
ratures of the solution. From his results it appears that k
very slowly decreases in value as the concentration increases,
and that, on the other hand, it increases very rapidly with the
temperature, as shown bv the following figures : —
                        k = 0-1252 when T= l°-2 C.
                        £=02421 when T=18°-5
                        £=0-4146 when T=44°-7,
which results can be expressed in the equation
                        £=0-1187[l + 0-0557T].
Weber was led to conclude from his experiments that Fick's
law is approximately correct.
     Since Weber's still another investigation of the subject has
appeared.        In the Philosophical Transactions for 1861 % is an
article by Graham, " On Liquid Diffusion applied to Analysis,"
which seems to have escaped the notice of succeeding investi
gators.
     Stefan§, however, has quite recently reviewed this work,
and has deduced therefrom the values of k for a number of

318                    Dr. J.  H. Long on  the
substances.    A short description of Graham's method will not
be out of place here. Into a cylindrical glass vessel 87 millims.
wide and 152 millims. high was poured 0-7 litre of water ; and
under this, by means of a small pipette, Ol litre of salt-solu
tion was carefully brought.       The water was displaced upward
by  the  heavier  solution ;  and the surface separating the two
media remained sharply defined.          The total length of the
liquid column was 127 millims.
   The vessel was now allowed to remain at rest a number of
days; and at the end of that time the liquid was carefully drawn
off, layer by layer, in sixteen equal portions, of 50 cubic cen-
tims. each.     The amount of diffused salt was determined in
each one of these portions separately, with the exception of
the two lower ones, which were analyzed together.
   As an example of these determinations the following may
be  given: —

    Graham experimented with a large number of substances
according to this method, and arranged the results in tables
 similar to the above. These results Stefan has made the sub
ject of an analytical investigation, whose object was to ascer
tain whether or not they stand in harmony with the theoretical
 requirements of Fick's law.        This he has shown to be not
always the case.      But in many instances, however, the agree

     I
     have thus far mentioned briefly the chief results of the
work done on diffusion. The several investigations may be
divided into two classes : — (1) Those which are concerned
with the physical side of the question — that        is, the determina
tion of the constant     k    for a single substance   :    to this class
belong    the  investigations    of  Tick,   Simmler    and  Wild, Voit,
Hoppe-Seyler, Johannisjanz,         Weber,    and  Stefan.     (2) Those
which are concerned       with  the   chemical   phase  of the  subject —
that is, the comparison of many different substances as to their
rates of diffusion to this class belong the investigations of
                     :
Graham, Beilstein, and Marignac.            In regard to the first class,
it may    be  said  that  there   a  very satisfactory end has been
attained.     The proof   of Fick's    law by Weber and Stefan, and
the determination of the influence of temperature and concen
tration of solution by the former, leave little to be desired in
connexion with this part of the subject.           The same cannot be
said, however,     of the  other —  the   chemical  phase of the ques
tion. The experiments        of  Beilstein   are  too  few to establish
any thing with certainty and those of Graham and Marignac,
                             ;
while rather numerous, and agreeing very well among them
selves, seem to establish nothing as regards the dependence of
diffusion on the molecular weight or other physical property

of the substance employed.      Their accuracy has also been
questioned  more  than once*.
   The importance of the subject seemed to make another in
vestigation necessary ; and this, at the suggestion of Professor
Lothar Meyer,           I
                   have undertaken. The method described in
the following pages was likewise proposed by him; and part of
the experiments were conducted in his laboratory at Tubingen.
Another part of the work was performed in the physical labo
ratory of Professor 0. E. Meyer in Breslau.          would take                I
this opportunity of expressing to both these gentlemen my
sincere appreciation of the many kindnesses shown me by them
during all the time spent in their laboratories.
                                  The New Method,
    There are several serious objections to the methods of Gra
ham, Beilstein, and Marignac.           In applying them, one is un
 able to follow the progress of the diffusion ; that         one cannot        is,
tell with any accuracy how much salt diffuses from hour to
hour, or from day to day even, nor when the condition of con
stancy has been reached and how long              lasts.          it
    These methods give only the average velocity of diffusion
for the duration of the experiments.           During the first days                      it
may    be  relatively large,  and  during    the last relatively small.
Another objection to the methods                         is,
                                             that in them the diffusion
takes place into        medium of constantly increasing density.
                            a
This increase, being different for different substances, must
exert in each case       different disturbing force, whose amount
                            a
we have no means of determining.             Hence seemed desirable       it
that method should be employed in which these and other
      a

a b with the solution to be investigated.             Distilled water is
then allowed to drop very slowly from a Mariotte's bottle into
the receiving-tube w. This water gradually displaces the
solution in the whole length of arst and flows out at b. In
i it stands at the level ef, though this is not independent of
certain other influences to be mentioned shortly. Diffusion
                                               f
takes place between the solution below e and the water above,
the diffused particles being carried away and discharged at b.
The concentration in i soon becomes less, and fresh portions
of salt then enter from below and around g h, at which level
the concentration changes, but very slowly, as above this is
the whole of the solution in the beaker-glass.            This is equiva
lent to saying that the diffusion takes place between a level of
constant concentration at g h and a level of concentration zero

   As a matter of course, the first portions of water which flow
through the apparatus become nearly as saturated as the ori
ginal solution ; and some time must elapse before this mecha
nical mixing gives place to the real diffusion. The first expe
riments tried were on this point. The glass was filled with
solution of NaCl at 8 h. 30 m. a.m. and the flow of the water
started.     The portion carried over until 9 h. was thrown
away ; that flowing after this time was saved and titrated with
 ^-AgN03 solution*.           The   results for the first twenty-four
hours were as follows, the velocity of the flowing water being
40 cubic centims. per hour : —

322                    Dr.  J.  H. Long on   the

of about thirty hours the titrations show a constant quantity
of salt diffused per hour. The time required for this constant
rate to be reached is not always the same, varying between
twenty-four and forty-eight hours. Another experiment, made
under exactly the same conditions as the above, with a similar
tube, gave results as follows : —

   The constant rate     was reached here in about twenty-four
hours.    Many other     experiments gave similar results ; but in
no case was the time     required less than twenty-four hours.
   As was stated, the    velocity of the flowing water in the above
experiments was 40        cubic centims. per hour. Thinking it
possible that this might have some influence on the rate of
diffusion, experiments were tried in which this velocity was
very variable. The beaker was first filled with normal BaCl2
solution, and after the constant state had been reached the
velocity of the water was varied, as in the following Table.
   For convenience, the amounts of diffused salt will be given
here and in the following in cubic centims. AgN03 used per
hour in titration.

   The change of velocity seemed to have no disturbing influ
ence in this case.     To decide the matter fully, other solutions
were operated upon in a similar way ; and the results are given

                                      Diffusion of Liquids.                                                      323
below. But perhaps it would be well to explain first how
this changing the velocity of the H2 0 can be readily accom
plished. Into the caoutchouc stopper of the lower tubulure of
a Mariotte's bottle was fitted a tube bent twice in planes at
right angles to each other, and having the outward end drawn
to a fine point. Now, turning the tube in the stopper has the
effect of elevating or lowering the orifice — that       of diminish                          is,
ing  or  increasing  the distance   between  this and  the  lower end
of the vertical air-tube    in  the flask.   Upon this distance de
pends the velocity of efflux, that being proportional to its
square root; and hence to attain the desired velocity          simply                               it    is
necessary    to move  the orifice  up  or down,  as the case  may  be.
By   this  means        it

    From the Tables given above it is seen that the rate of dif
fusion is constant for 30 hours at least. To ascertain how
much longer this constancy might continue was the object of
the next experiments.        Two tubes of the same size were filled,
one    with n and the other with 2nNaCl solution.                   After
waiting until the rate of        diffusion  had    become    uniform, the
titrations were commenced with the following results.                 The
velocity of the flowing water was 40 cubic centims. per hour.

    As the results for the last days are no smaller than those
for the first, it must be concluded that the duration of constant
diffusion is rather long, for NaCl at any rate.
    Indeed this seems to be true of the chlorides in general. In
the case of the weaker of the above solutions the glass con
tained at the outset 14-5 grams salt, and the whole amount dif
fused was only 0-2 gram in the 138 hours.             It is probable that
the same rate would have been conserved for a much longer
period.
    The above Table also shows something regarding the effect
of concentration.      As stated, one solution was twice as strong
as the other ; and the titrations show that, of the stronger,
nearly twice as much has diffused as of the weaker solution.
 This corresponds with the observation of Weber on ZnS04

     The results obtained from the n and 2n solutions agree
 very well with those obtained from the two NaCl solutions.
 In both cases the amount diffused from the 2n solution is
 slightly less than twice the amount from the n solution. But
 the results obtained from the 3rc solution are somewhat ano
 malous and require an explanation.                        This will lead me to
  speak of the chief sources of error in connexion with the
  method.
      In some     of the earlier experiments of the investigation,
  solutions    of  the greatest possible concentration were used, in
  order to make the determinations                   of the diffused salt easy
  because of its greater quantity.              But it was soon noticed that
  in such cases this amount was much larger than was expected.
  Five solutions of NaCl for instance, n, 2n, 3n, 4n, and 5rc,
   diffused in the same time quantities of salt proportional to 1,
   2-1, 3-8, 6-4, and 8.
       Something similar was observed in the case of strong solu
   tions of CaCl2 and SrCl2.             These unexpected results seemed
   to point to the correctness of the opinion expressed by Beil-
   stein*, that from different solutions of the same substance the
   amounts diffused increase at a greater rate than the concen
   trations. About this time, however, in the hope of clearing
   up the matter, another little experiment was tried, the results
    of which were so important for the understanding of the whole
    method that      I will describe it fully here. To the water in the
    supply-bottle      a small amount of indigo solution was added.
    The blue liquid flowing down through the tube arst displaced
                                       *  Loc. cit.

326                  Dr.   J.   H. Long on     the
the solution, which at the time being was rather concentrated,
from the tube i. The amount of this displacement was much
smaller than was expected.      Instead of sinking to ef or lower,
the blue layer remained stationary at c d; and the surface sepa
rating this from the solution was very sharply defined and
perfectly reflecting. This remained the case during the day,
and, left to itself several days longer, was but little changed ;
a sharply-defined surface was still to be seen.
   This allowed of but one explanation, viz. that with a solution
of this concentration the position of equilibrium between it and
the water was such that their surface of separation could only
be found quite high in the tube L       In such a case," not only
diffusion but also a mechanical carrying-over of salt was ob
served.    An NaCl solution of much smaller concentration
(r07) was next taken, and qiiite a different result obtained.
At first the sharply-marked surface was seen as before, but
                                               f
lower in the tube, and in the position e (fig. 1). Left until
the next day the surface of demarcation was still very plain,
but its reflecting-power was gone ; and on the third day the
surface itself had become indistinct, disturbed by the diffusion
from below.     The experiment was repeated several times with
different solutions, and always with the same result ; from
which it was seen that in general for solutions of sp. gr. 1*10
and over, and for velocities of the flowing water not exceeding
70 cubic centims. per hour, the position of equilibrium of the
liquids in the tubes was such that their surface of separation
was above the line ef, and the progress of the diffusion
remained for a great length of time obscured more or less by
an excess of mechanically removed salt.
   On the contrary, if the solutions be weaker, the surface of
separation is found at the outset in the position ef or there
abouts.    A real diffusion soon commences in i, and gradually
extends itself to g h, below which point the concentration can
decrease but very slowly, as explained above.      It is now easy
to account for the anomalous action of the 3 n KC1 solution.
This has a density of 1*18 — that        is,
                                          somewhat greater than
that which was experimentally found to stand at the level ef.
While in the case of solutions of medium density the diffusion
may be considered as taking place between          and
                                                     h

lower level and an upper level      c    which
                                        d,         above ef, and
                                                     is
more directly in the path of the flowing water.
   One would expect in this case that more particles would be
carried over than are really diffused; and this the results show.
   By means of the blue water the influence of velocity can be
nicely illustrated. The experiments undertaken to decide this

                        Diffusion of Liquids.                    327
point showed that for velocities up to 70 cubic centims. per
hour the amount diffused was independent of this factor, hut
for velocities above this it rapidly decreased. It was not until
the indigo-water was resorted to that this action was explained.
It was then found to be as follows : — For ordinary velocities,
the reflecting surface occupies in the beginning the position
  f
e nearly, as shown above ; and this is true whether the velo
city be 30 or 70 cubic centims. per hour. However, if it be
increased to 80 cubic centims., a change takes place : the
reflecting surface no longer remains stationary at ef, but is
pushed downward in i until finally the salt-solution is entirely
expelled from this part of the apparatus, and blue particles
ascend outside    of i to the free surface above.      The  cause  of
this is evident.    The water now flows in at w faster than it
can be discharged at b, and it must make a place for itself by
passing through i into the solution outside.        It thus appears
that the narrow opening at b exerts a rather great capillary
resistance, which makes itself manifest as soon as the velocity
of the water reaches a certain limit. The salt being expelled
from i, allows the blue water to stream in visible currents out
ward and upward ; and these currents, instead of permitting
the diffusing particles below g h to pass into i, carry them
along upwards on its outside. This continues, of course, until
the increasing height of the liquid column in the beaker is
capable of holding the water in equilibrium at the level g h.
An undisturbed diffusion can then commence again ; but some
time must elapse before a condition of constancy is attained
in i; and until this is the case the amount diffused must appear
too small.
    Something similar is observed when, instead of increasing
the velocity of the flowing water, the capillary resistance at b
is increased.    Indeed, if this increase be but slight, the action
is exactly the same as in the above case ; but if the increase
 of resistance be greater, as when, for instance, the inside of
the tube b is covered for a short distance with a thin film of
•wax, the action is as follows: — At first no liquid at all drops
from b, as a convex meniscus is formed which exerts a pressure
in an opposite direction. As a consequence the solution is
 expelled from t, the level moves upward in w and in the beaker,
until the excess of pressure thus produced is sufficient to over
come the resistance at b.       As soon as this limit is reached the
action is entirely reversed : the water now commences to flow,
and drops out quite rapidly ; the level sinks in w and in the
beaker ; and the surface of separation rises in t. This continues
until the excess of pressure has entirely disappeared, when the
flow suddenly stops at b, and does not recommence until again

a head   of water accumulates     as before. There seems to be no
 limit to this cycle of operations : on  one  occasion they were
 seen to take place during the whole of a day ; and at the same
 time the amount of salt diffused was about one fourth of what
 was expected.     The same phenomena were several times ob
 served when, before filling the apparatus, the thorough cleans
 ing of the tube b was neglected.     A small amount of greasy
 substance at this point seemed to exert a very great disturbing
 force, and if not guarded against could become a source of
 serious error, as was the case in many of the earlier experi
 ments, which were thus rendered quite worthless.               I
                                                             have
 described at some length the influence of excessive concen
 tration of solution and the influence of capillarity at b, but at
 no greater length than the importance of this part of the sub
ject demands.
    It was only by guarding most carefully against these sources
 of error that constant results, and results comparable among
themselves when different tubes were used, could be obtained.
 It has been seen that the height ge at which the solution
 stands in i at the beginning of the experiment,       and upon
which depends the amount of salt diffused, depends in turn,
not only on the concentration, but also to a certain extent on
the velocity of the water, and on the amount of the resistance
at b.    By keeping these elements within certain limits con
stant results can be obtained, even when different tubes are
used, as shown below.
    Thus far nothing has been said of the influence of tempera
ture on the progress of diffusion. During the continuance of
the above experiments, most of which were conducted in the
cellar of the laboratory at Tubingen, the temperature remained
quite constant at 14°-15° C.        Experiments undertaken to
decide this point of the influence of temperature were not very
successful, and chiefly for the reason that it was found very
difficult to keep any other than the ordinary temperature con
stant for the necessary length of time.    The experiments were
arranged as follows: — In a wooden box with double walls,
used as an ice-chest, were placed two diffusion-cells with the
necessarj- water-flasks.   The remaining space on the bottom
 of the box was occupied by vessels containing pounded ice.
Two thermometers were hung in different parts of the box. It
was possible by this means to obtain a temperature of 10° C.
inside the box when that of the outside was 15° C. But the
difficulty lay in keeping this 10° constant long enough to
complete an experiment— that         for four or five days.
                                    is,                       The
chest was not large enough to contain a great deal of ice; and
replenishing this from day to day disturbed the glasses always

  On   the Relative Intensity of       the Spectral Lines of Gases.     329
more or less. Refilling the water-flasks had also a disturbing
effect.    Taking these facts into consideration, it cannot be
wondered at that at this temperature the results were rather
inconstant. The tubes gave, when filled with n NaCl solution,
at 15° an amount of salt represented by 1*1 cubic centim.
40 AgN03 per hour.           But usually, when in the ice-chest, the
salt diffused from similar solutions             required for its titration
1*5-2 cubic centims.        ^AgN03         per hour, indicating that the
progress of the diffusion was disturbed.                On one occasion,
however, for a period of about 14 hours, 6 p. m. to 8 a.m., the
diffused amount was equivalent to 0"87 cubic centim. per hour.
This rate did not continue during the next day ; opening the
box to renew the ice and water disturbed it as usual.                  The
experiments at a higher temperature were somewhat more
successful.       Instead of the ice a Bunsen burner was placed in
the box, and a tolerably constant temperature of 25° was ob
tained. The amount of AgN03 solution required now per
hour varied between 1*3 and 1*4 cubic centim.                   Assuming
that for the lower temperature the result 0*87 cubic centim.
was correct, the amounts diffused from solutions of the same
strength at three different temperatures may be thus tabu
lated : —

of a more complicated spectrum, concealed partly by want of
brightness in the aurora itself, and partly by the medium,
more or less dense, in which that phenomenon probably occurs.
As Geissler's tubes were at the time under examination, they
were found convenient for this purpose.         Nitrogen- (in the

were specially tested; at least they are not recorded.       have,       I

           a             that the bright double  line in the green

    It was noticed in the foregoing experiments that, on with
 drawing the tube from the slit, the colours of the spectrum
disappeared in the following consecutive order — red, yellow,
violet, and, lastly, green.      It thus seems pretty clearly proved
that the brighter line or lines of         aspectrum may be seen
 singly as a    matter  of intensity.
    This, however, must be treated as independent of the exal
tation or suppression of individual lines of spectrum by such

   It easy to conceive that the celestial bodies may be liable
      is
to these influences to a very considerable extent, and that
modifications of their spectra may thus arise which we do not
produce in the laboratory and which are not dependent on the
question of intensity alone.

    In the case of water acidulated with sulphuric acid, the
 following results were obtained.    The voltameter consisted of
 a wide test-tube of about 30 millimetres diameter, into the neck
 of which was fixed an india-rubber cork perforated with three
 holes: through the centre one passed a delivery tube of small
bore for the collection of the evolved gases ; through the
 other two, copper rods 5-6 millims. in diameter.    To the lower
ends of these were soldered equally thick platinum rods,
the free ends of which were previously forged into spade-like
plates which were arranged parallel to one another ; the sol-
derings and the portions of the copper rods inside the test-tube
were imbedded in a thick mass of gutta-percha, with the three
fold object of keeping the plates at an invariable distance from
one another (the voltameter being also intended for some other
experiments in which this was essential), of protecting the
copper and soldering from corrosion by the acid and the con
sequent introduction of metals into the solution electrolyzed,
and of filling up the upper space in the tube, so that any error

332     Messrs.  Wright and Rennie on    the Determination of
quent retention therein of varying quantities of gas should be
rendered negligible.      The projecting ends of the rods were
passed through small india-rubber corks and amalgamated ;
by then fixing short pieces of wide glass tubing over these
smaller corks and pouring mercury into the cups thus formed,
connexion by mercury-cups could readily be established be
tween the battery and the voltameter-plates.
     This arrangement of mercury-cups was also applied to the
copper Daniell-battery cells, a thick wire bent downwards and
amalgamated at the end being also soldered to each zinc plate so
as to dip into the mercury-cup of the next cell.     Much trouble
in brightening      connexions  &c. was  thus  saved; the current
 could readily be broken instantaneously by simply lifting one
 of the zinc plates an inch or so, so that the wire no longer
 dipped into the mercury ; whilst an easy means was afforded
 of introducing more cells or shutting some out from the cir
 cuit when required without actually interrupting the current.
     39. A number of attempts were made to utilize Bunsen's
 ice-calorimeter for the measurement of the heat evolved ; the
 construction of apparatus sufficiently large to enable conside
 rable amounts of heat to be measured accurately, however,
 was found to present some difficulties ; whilst with smaller
 apparatus the errors of measurement of the amount of gas
 evolved became considerable, even when the voltameter was
 connected with the gas-measuring apparatus used for Frank-
 land and Armstrong's water-analysis process ; for the occlu
 sion of the evolved gases by the electrodes, the absorption of
  oxygen by the acidulated water of the voltameter, the pro
 duction of ozone or of hydrogen dioxide, and the removal of
 hydrogen whilst still nascent from the one electrode by com
 bination with dissolved oxygen, and of oxygen from the other
 by combination with dissolved hydrogen, present sources of
  diminution in the amount of gas actually evolved, which mostly
 become relatively greater with weak currents, such as would
  have to be employed with a small ice-calorimeter.     Although
  it did not appear to be impracticable to overcome these diffi
  culties, yet it was found that to do so would require a consi
  derable amount of time and trouble; and therefore we reverted
  to the use of an ordinary water-calorimeter, employing cur
  rents of sufficient magnitude to furnish upwards of 500 cub.
  centims. of mixed gases during the time which the experiment
  lasted (from ten to forty-five minutes, according to the battery
  power used).      Even with the strongest currents used, repre
  senting   about   0'65 C.G.S. current-unit, the amount of sub
  stances formed capable of liberating iodine from potassium
   iodide corresponded to no more than '001 to '002 gramme of

          Chemical Affinity       in terms of Electromotive Force.    333
iodine per 500 cub. centims. of gas produced, representing a
diminution in the volume of gas evolved practically quite in
appreciable. The gas-measuring apparatus in our possession
being incapable of measuring so large a quantity as 500 cub.
centims., we employed the method used by Joule for deter
mining the volume of gas produced, viz. collection over water
in a bottle, the weight of which was known when filled with
water and closed by a stopper. To determine the gas collected,
the bottle was immersed for some minutes in a large bucket
of water, the temperature of which was known ; when the gas
had attained the temperature of the water, the bottle was
raised until the level of the fluid inside and out was the
same      e. until the pressure was atmospheric)
          (i.                                       the stopper

was then inserted and the bottle removed, wiped dry, and
weighed. In this way        close approximation to the quantity
                                 a
of gas produced was obtained, the error being one of defect,
owing to the sources above mentioned and the absorption
of oxygen by the water during the process of collection. From
the number of cub. centims. of mixed gases thus obtained
(reduced to dryness, 0° C, and 760 millims.) =v, the weight of
water decomposed, w, was calculated by the formula

   40. The calorimeter employed        in these experiments con
sisted    of  glass
                a   beaker   capable  of  holding about 1500 cub.
centims.,  fitted closely inside   polished tin cylinder supported
                                       a
(on  a wooden block and several folds of wadding) concentri
cally inside a similar tin cylinder, so that about an inch of air
space everywhere intervened between the two tin surfaces, the
two tin cylinders being kept in the same relative positions by
cork wedges.      This outer cylinder was weighted with lead and
sunk inside third similar larger cylinder filled with water; so
                    a
that the calorimeter itself was surrounded on all sides, saving the
top, by water jacket. Polished tin lids for the calorimeter and
          a
the outermost vessel were provided, perforated with holes for
the passage of the voltameter (in the axis of the cylinders),

334    Messrs. Wright and Rennie on     the   Determination of
of the thermometers employed, and of the stirrers ; these latter
consisted of annular horizontal metallic plates, with stout
vertical wires attached, so that by moving them up and down
a very effective agitation could be accomplished.    The ther
mometers were graduated in millimetres, and were carefully
calibrated and checked against one another and against a
Kew-standardized thermometer.       The one used for the inner
vessel was found to be sensibly uniform in calibre at the part
where the observations were made (chiefly that corresponding
to 12°-20° C); and at this part the value of 1°C. was 11-28
millims.   Several careful determinations of the water-equiva
lent of the calorimeter (including the stirrer, thermometer-
bulb, and voltameter, which always contained 20 grammes of
acidulated water containing 22 per cent, of H2S04,) gave
numbers varying from 1092 to 1097, and averaging 1094'5
grammes when 1000 grammes of water (weighed in a vacuum)
were placed therein.
   41. In order to obtain with as great a degree of accuracy
as possible the corrections for radiation with this instrument,
a large number of observations were made of the rate of al
teration of the reading of the calorimeter-thermometer under
various conditions, viz. when the water jacket was hotter or
colder than the calorimeter, and when the calorimeter was
warmer or colder than a thermometer-bulb placed a few inches
above the outer lid, so as to indicate the temperature of the
air together with the effect produced by radiation from the
hand during stirring.     It was found that all the observations
could be expressed   with  a fair degree of accuracy by the for
mula
                 a!=F0-16   (M-m) + 0-0225N,
where x is the alteration of the calorimeter-temperature (loss
of heat) in millimetres per hour, M the difference between the
average readings of the calorimeter and water-jacket thermo
meters during the period of observation, m a small correction
(derived from a specially constructed table) to reduce the scale-
reading of the second of these thermometers to that of the
first, and N the difference between the average temperature
of the calorimeter and that of the air, as indicated by the
third outer thermometer and expressed in terms of the scale
of the calorimeter-thermometer. Thus, for example, the fol
lowing table illustrates the observed and calculated values of
x. It is noticeable, en passant, that whilst the heating or
cooling effect of the air on the calorimeter exerted through
the double lid  is, for equal differences of temperature, much
less than that of the water jacket,    it   isstill not negligible,
amounting to about    \  of that of the jacket.

   42. It is evident from these numbers that the difference
between the observed and calculated rates of alteration per
hour rarely exceeds 0'2 millimetre, and averages much less ;
so that the difference between the results deduced by the for
mula and those attained by direct observation is practically
negligible for all experiments lasting for only half an hour or
less.  In order, however, to diminish any error in the radia
tion-correction caused by the use of the formula, a threefold
determination was made, as follows, the average of the three
observations     being taken.          First, the correction was esti
mated from the observed average values of M and N through
out the experiment.          Secondly, the rate of alteration of tem
perature   of  the   calorimeter     (rising) before the experiment was
commenced was determined by observations made for 30-60
minutes before commencing; and, similarly, the rate of altera
tion (falling) was determined by observations made for 30-60
minutes after concluding, and the mean of the two rates
taken. Thirdly, the rate of alteration at the commencement
of the experiment was calculated from the values of M and N
then observed; and similarly the rate of alteration at the close
was calculated from the then values of M and N, and the mean
taken as before.        The three values rarely differed from their
mean by so much as 0'1 millimetre per hour.                    Thus the fol
lowing  values    were    obtained    in an   experiment lasting eighteen

     43. The above correction, however, is not the only one to
 be applied ; for the water in the voltameter gets heated more
 quickly than the calorimeter, and after the end of the experi
 ment some time is required for the heat retained in the volta
 meter to become uniformly diffused throughout the calori
 meter by passage through the glass wall of the voltameter.
 It was found that 6 or 7 minutes sufficed to bring about
 perfect equalization of temperature;         so that during the first
 5 minutes      or so the temperature of the calorimeter slightly
 rose, and then began to fall again from the cooling effect of the
radiation. Accordingly, to determine the true amount of rise
 in temperature during the experiment, the thermometer was
 read 8, 10, and 12 minutes after the conclusion — the loss by
 radiation during these several periods of 8, 10, and 12 minutes
 being added on to the observed temperature at the ends of
 these periods severally; the mean of the three numbers thus
obtained was taken as the true temperature that would have
been observed at the end of the experiment had the heat re
tained in the voltameter been diffused throughout the calo
rimeter at that moment. The loss during these three periods
is calculated from the data in the latter two methods just

   Since the water-equivalent of the calorimeter &c. is 1094-5,

the amount of heat actually produced is
             #: x 1094-5–3328              gramme-degrees.
   44. Two other small corrections also have to be applied to
the heat-evolution thus determined. In the first place, the
escaping gases pass out saturated with moisture, the evapo
ration of which absorbs a certain amount of heat.                  In each
experiment the average temperature was close to 15°, at which
 º
temperature the tension of aqueous vapour is 1:27 centim. or
      atmosphere,   -1.67      per cent.       Hence every 1000 cub.
centims. of evolved gas would contain 167 cub. centims. of
water-vapour (at 0° and 760), weighing 0:0134 gramme; the

838     Messrs.  Wright and Rennie on tlie Determination of
latent heat of water-vapour at 15° being nearly 600, this
would represent very nearly 8 gramme-degrees per litre of
evolved gases.      Inasmuch as the gases were evolved not from
pure   water  but   from  water containing 22 per cent, of sul
phuric acid, it is likely that the gases actually evolved con
tained slightly less moisture than the normal saturating
amount ; but as in most of the experiments only about 500
to 550 cub. centims. of gases were evolved, the total correc
tion is only about 4 gramme-degrees, and a trifling error in
its estimation is negligible.
    In the next place a minute amount of heat is absorbed in
 separating from sulphuric acid the water electrolyzed.        From
 the experiments of Favre and Quaillard (Comptes Rendus, 1.
p. 1150), 98 grammes of sulphuric acid already mixed with 216
 of water (forming a dilute acid of composition H2SO4 + 12H20)
 evolve 483 gramme-degrees when 72 grammes more of water
 are added (forming H2S04 + 16H20).         The further addition of
 72 grammes more of water evolves 222 gramme-degrees, whilst
the addition of a third 72 grammes (forming H2S04-r-24H20)
 evolves 141 gramme-degrees.        From these numbers, by in
 terpolation, it results that acid of strength H2S04 + 20H2O
 (containing 22 per cent, of H2S04) will evolve close upon
 2 5 gramme-degrees when 1 gramme of water is added to such
 a quantity of acid as not sensibly to alter its composition by
 dilution ; i. e. that for every gramme of water decomposed by
 electrolysis 2*5 gramme-degrees are absorbed.
    In the experiment the calorimetric details of which have
just been given, the corrected heat-evolution finally becomes
 as follows : —

     45. The value of E, the average difference of potential be
 tween the voltameter plates, was found thus. Before the experi
 ment commenced the scale of the electrometer was standardized
 by means of a Clarke cell, several readings being taken by re
 versal so as to obtain total readings each equal to double the

          Chemical Affinity in terms      of Electromotive Force.           339
deflection ; after the experiment was concluded the scale was
again similarly standardized.            The difference between the two
 standardizings was always very small or nil, but frequently was
just perceptible, owing to leakage of electrometer charge ;
the mean of the two standardizings was taken to represent a
 potential diference of
                    1-457  {l-(<-15)x       0-0006}    volt,
 where t is the Centigrade temperature, and 0*0006 the altera
 tion in E.M.F. per 1° C. (equal to 0*06 per cent, per 1°). As
 in the whole series of experiments taken together the average
 temperature of the cell was very close to 15°, the cell was
 assumed        to  have    the  constant average value 1*457 volt
 throughout.         Throughout the experiment the potential diffe
 rence between the electrodes was determined at as nearly as
 possible equal intervals of time by reversal, the quadrants
 being connected with the mercury-cups of the voltameter
 through the reversing-gear. As a general rule, the indicated
  potential-difference rose steadily throughout the experiment
  to the extent of from 3 to 6 per cent, of its initial value
  (owing to polarization of the electrodes); but in some cases
  this effect was just about compensated by a gradual diminu
  tion in current-strength, so that the potential difference re
  mained nearly the same or slightly fell*.             In the experiment

   produce no effect at all on the end result. In just the same way, it is
   immaterial whether the electrodes are perfectly parallel and equal in size,
   whether the current passes more between their edges than between their
   centres, of what material they are made, and so on ; for what is actually
   done is to measure the difference of potential between the mercury-cups
   at the ends of the thick copper rods connected with the electrodes, and also
   the quantity of electricity passing, and hence the total work done between
   the cups. The resistance of the cups and thick copper rods being inappreci
   able, all this work must he done inside the voltameter between the elec
   trodes, either as heat or chemical decomposition ; the former being mea
    sured directly, the amount of the work representing the latter is known

Experiments on a possible Source of Error in Joule's Valuation
                 J
              of made in 1867 (Brit. Assoc. Heports).
   47. The method used by Joule in these experiments con
sisted essentially in the comparison of the resistances of a
platinum-silver wire (made into a coil and immersed in a calo
rimeter) and of copies of the B.A. unit, and then passing a
current, measured by a tangent-galvanometer, through the
coil and determining the amount of heat produced therein
in a given time.       The mean temperature of the calorimeter
throughout a series of observations being determined, the re
sistance which the wire would possess at that temperature was
 calculated from the observed resistance at some other tempe
rature, the rate of variation in resistance of the wire with tem
perature used being known.              Calling this calculated resist
ance E, the average       current   being C, and the time t seconds,
                 J
the value of was deduced by the formula J=^y-, where H
                                                          C2Rf
is the heat evolved.
    It is evident that any error in the valuation of R must
 produce an error to exactly the same extent in the value of            J
 thus deduced ; and that such a source of error must have
 existed is evident from the circumstance that inasmuch as
heat was continuously developed in the interior of the wire,
 and as an interval of time must necessarily elapse before heat
 could pass from the interior of the wire into the water by
 conduction, the temperature of the interior of the wire, and
 consequently the mean temperature of the wire as a whole,
 must have been somewhat higher than the mean temperature
 of the calorimeter.      Apart from this, too, the wire must have
 been heated to a small extent above the whole mass of water
 in the calorimeter, owing to the adhesion to the wire of a film
 of warmed water which could not possibly be displaced by
stirring absolutely pari passu with its becoming warmed. The
 very efficient      automatic    continuous stirring-arrangement
 adopted by Joule in the third series of investigations detailed
 in the paper referred to must necessarily have reduced this
 source of superheating of the wire to a minimum ; but it is

   342     Messrs. Wright and Rennie on              the Determination       of
   doubtful if it would wholly remove the additional tendency to
   superheating from this cause.
      48. In order to form some idea of the possible extent to
   which the wire might thus become superheated by currents of
   the magnitude used by Joule*, a platinum wire about 50
   centims. long and 1'15 B.A. unit resistance was twisted into
   a spiral, the ends of which were soldered to thick copper rods
  surmounted with mercury-cups and passing through an india-
  rubber cork to keep them together : this spiral was immersed
  in a beaker containing about a litre of distilled water, the tem
                                                0o,l degree by a thermo
  perature of which was read off to
  meter placed with its bulb           almost    touching the centre of the
  spiral ; by means of a broad horizontal ring of metal attached
  to a stout wire the water could be briskly agitated, to a much
                                              be safe with a calorimeter in
  greater extent indeed than would
  which splashing must             be  avoided.        Currents of different
  strengths were then passed through            the   coil for periods of time
  varying from 20 minutes to an hour, a voltameter being also
  included in the circuit, and the total gas evolved collected as
 previously described.            During this time the water was kept
 continually stirred, and        its temperature observed at equal inter
 vals of time, whilst the difference of potential existing between
 the ends of the wire was observed as frequently as possible by
 connecting the mercury-cups with a quadrani>electrometer
 standardized by a Clark cell before and after the experiment,
 precisely as above described.            During the first two or three
 minutes the electrometer-readings             always diminished through
 diminution of current by polarization of the voltameter-plates;
 afterwards they remained nearly constant, gradually rising
 through the increasing mean temperature of the wire, or
 slightly sinking if the current-strength diminished through
 continued use of the battery. During the first few minutes
 the readings were accordingly taken every 10 or 15 seconds
 without reversal, so as to obtain a large number of observa
 tions giving the mean potential difference during this period ;
 subsequently the readings were taken by reversal at the rate
 of one pair per minute, the readings being divided into a

    Since the average temperature of the water surrounding the
wire was nearly the same throughout, not differing by more
than a few tenths of a degree from the mean 8°*75, the values
in the last column are fairly comparable with one another ;
whence it is evident that a notable rise in resistance of the
wire is produced by each successive increase in current-
strength. The resistance of the wire for a current of very
small value would clearly lie under 1*1495 x 109; so that the

the wire over that of the surrounding water this would re
present, the fourth experiment was repeated, using warm water
(at about 27°) to surround the coil: in this way the following
numbers were obtained : —     .

   Since an increase in resistance of 0-046 corresponds to 19-05
degrees, an increase of 0-0200 to 0*0225 would correspond to 8*3
to 9*3 degrees ; i. e. currents of 0-24 to 0-30 C.G.S. unit caused
a superheating of the wire above the temperature of the sur
rounding water to an extent averaging 80-3 to 90,3*.             it   If
be admitted that in Joule's experiments a similar superheating
to the extent of 8° to 9° may have taken place, the effect on
the calculated resistance of the platinum-silver used would be
to cause the amount to be underestimated by about 8 x 0*031
= 0-25 per cent, to 9 x 0*031 = 0*28 per cent., 0*031 being the
percentage increase in resistance per degree of the alloy used
by Joule (this alloy was purposely not used by the authors,
in order to make the alteration in resistance, if any, more per
ceptible); that    is,the value of  J ultimately deduced would be
about 0*25 to 0*28 per cent, too low.
   51. In order to see whether an increased amount of super
heating would be produced by only stirring the water sur
rounding the wire at intervals of one or two minutes instead
of continuously, some of the above observations were repeated
 *   This increase in resistance with temperature amounts to ahout 0*21
per cent, per 1° C. Matthiessen found the average increase of pure metals
to he ahout 0-37 per cent, per 1° C, that of an alloy of platinum and iri
dium containing 33 per cent, of the latter heing only 0*00 per cent, per 1°  ;
prohahly, therefore, this platinum wire was somewhat impure, very likely
containing iridium.

       52.     In order     to see whether any analogous effect would be
   produced by varnishing the wire, as was done in Joule's ex
   periments (owing to possible diminution in rate of passage of
   heat from wire to water through diminished conducting-power
   of the varnish), a thin coat of clear filtered shell-lac varnish was
   lightly applied to the wire ; and after two days drying, some
   of the observations were repeated, with the result of show
   ing that whilst the effect of the varnishing was inappreci
   able with a weak current, it became noticeable with currents
   of 0-14 to 0-24 C.Gr.S. unit. To make sure that the resist
   ance of the wire itself had not been altered permanently by
   strain &c. during varnishing, the varnish was dissolved off by
   immersion in alcohol, after which the resistance-value again
   diminished to its former amount.                     Thus the following numbers

346   Messrs.  Wright and Rennie on         the Determination of
Apparently, therefore, with the stronger currents the varnish
produced an increase in resistance about equal to that due to
an increase in temperature of from 4° to 5°; so that if the
varnish in Joule's experiments produced a similar effect, the
total superheating must have been near 12° to 14°, represent
ing 0*37 to 0*43 per cent, of error in deficiency in the estima
tion of R, and consequently of       J.
   53. Yet another source of error, and in the same direction,
in these experiments of Joule's lies in the fact that, in compa
ring the resistances of the B.A. unit and the experimental
wire employed, the method adopted consisted in determining
the angular deflections a, 0, and y produced in a tangent-gal
vanometer on passing the current from a given electromotor
(1) through the galvanometer only, (2) through the galvano
meter and B.A.-unit coil, and (3) through the galvanometer
and experimental wire — the resistance of the experimental
wire being called x, and that of the unit coil = 1,

   Now, were the currents used so feeble that no appreciable
amount of heat was developed by them in either wire, or were
the two wires compared similarly sized and situated so as to
be heated to equal extents, the .value of x thus deduced would
be subject to no other errors than the instrumental and obser
vational ones ; but as the B.A.-unit-coil wires are imbedded
in solid paraffin whilst the experimental wire was immersed
naked in water (save for the film of varnish), it is evident that,
if any heat at all had been generated by the currents employed,
the B.A.-unit coil must have been more heated than the expe
rimental wire, as the heat developed could not pass away
readily through the badly conducting solid paraffin.           The cur
rents actually employed were sufficient to cause deflections of
36° to 37° with a galvanometer         of nine turns and 17 inches
diameter, and of 34° to 50° with a galvanometer of eighteen

about O04 C.Gr.S. unit.        In a wire of 1 B.A. unit resistance
a current of this magnitude would produce per minute
0-04 x 0-04 x 10" x 60      OD
                          =2-3  gramme-degrees, which, assuming

the wire to weigh 10 grammes and to have the specific heat
O04 (approximately that of an alloy of one part silver to
                                                2-3
two of platinum), would raise its temperature  —  ttt^j or
                                                x
nearly 6° per minute.
    It would therefore seem from this rough estimate that the
heat-development produced in the B.A.-unit coil by the cur
rents used may have been sufficient to raise its temperature
perceptibly above that attributed to it ; while the same result
would not be produced to any thing like the same extent with
the experimental wire, owing to the latter being immersed in
water instead of solid paraffin.       If it be assumed that this heat-
development       sufficed  to raise the  average temperature of the
B.A.-unit    coil  during    the  observations 5° above that of the
experimental wire (an amount of heating not at all unlikely
to have occurred), the ultimate effect of this would be to
cause the underestimation of R, and consequently of J, by
5x0-031 =0-15 per cent.
    54. Hence, finally, putting together this source of error and
that due to the superheating of the wire (increased by varnish
ing), there is reason for supposing that the value of obtained J
by Joule in 1867 by the electric-current method may be at
least 0"5 per cent, too small ; that      is, instead of giving    value
                                                                   a
1-31 per cent, larger than that deduced from Joule's water-
friction experiments of 1850 and 1878 (Part               I.   §34), the
corrected value would probably be at least 1*8 per cent, larger
than the water-friction value.
    The practical conclusion to be drawn from these experi
ments, then,  is  that, in any determination in which     it
                                                           is necessary
to pass a   current through a wire for any length of time, an
appreciable error, through increase in the resistance of the
wire, will be brought about by its becoming superheated above
the temperature of the medium in which          it   isplaced when the
current exceeds      a  certain limit, the exact value of which ne
 cessarily depends on the conditions. This source of error will
affect determinations of E.M.F. made by such methods as those
 used by Latimer Clark in the valuation of his standard cell
 (Proc. Roy. Soc. xx. p. 444), and will similarly affect any
 experiments on the determination of      J      by methods based on
the same principles as those involved in Joule's 1867 observa
 tions, unless the mode of experimenting be modified in such
way as to eliminate this source of error, or at least to render
                                                                        it a
 negligible.    We propose to examine certain such modifications
 which have occurred to us as being likely to reduce this source
 of error to an inconsiderable amount.

XLIV.   Supplementary Paper on Primary Forms. By Sir
  James Cockle, M.A., F.R.S., F.R.A.S., F.C.P.S., Mem.

16.       TN
           my original paper (printed in the Number t for
          J-
          February 1875) certain forms of binomial biordinals,
regarded by Boole as distinct, were shown to be allied.
Boole's four constants, «„ u%, B1} Bt, were replaced by three,
A, .33, and E. The systems are connected, through a and e, by
                        1—A—a,     A— a=Pu 02 ;
                        1+B-e,     -(E + e)=«1-2,     «3-2;
           «i + «s-A-A=2(a-«) + 4 = 2(^E + l);
wherein A and E are two-valued and M may take either sign.
  17. These relations give
                   A-&=±(1-2A),               ai-«2=±(l + 2E);
and when A and E are integers we have the case of art. 2, and
Boole's 1st case (pp. cit. pp. 430, 431).
   18. For a— /S the relations give the four expressions
                   -33±(A + E) + 1;      ^-1±(A-E       +   1);
                   I
whereof denote the first two by K and Q, and the last two
by S and U, respectively, reading the upper signs first. When
any one of the four is an even integer we have the cases of
arts. 3 and 4, and Boole's 2nd case (ib. p. 431), wherein a
factor disappears.
   19. When E is an integer and 2iE an odd integer we have
Boole's 3rd case (ib.), a so-called primary form.
   20. When A is an integer and 2iE an odd integer we have
Boole's 4th case (ib.), a so-called primary form.
   21. The distinction between primary and other, say regular,
forms may (see arts. 13 and 14) be obliterated by transforma
tion.          I
          shall now show that from a given system A, M, E
we may derive five others by the following rule, viz. : — Vary
at pleasure the order of the symbols A, M, E, subtracting from
 a symbol half a unit at each direct step made by           and          it,
 adding to    symbol half
                       a     unit at each retrograde step which
                                    a
it makes.
   22. These transformations can be effected by algebraical
changes of the independent variable x, the change of x into
y(rx being accompanied by that of the dependent variable                         y
into (ty'x)ly. Differentiations with respect to x shall denote
                                                            I

on y. we may,    being any one of them, put

The transformations    and   /                <f>,

we may pass directly from the first of these forms to any other

                 Sir James Cockle on Primary Forms.                351
while to    2L — M— |      corresponds
    (2L-M-i)-L-(i-^2) + l=^N+i,                           =(E+£)2,
a quantity formed from the bracketed constituents in the last
line of art. 26 in the same way that M is formed from L, M,
and N..
    33. Take the third lines.            To        corresponds M +
because
while to 2N— M—         | corresponds
                   (2N-M-f)-(i-^2)-N                +  l,
                    = -L + i,      =(A-i)2.
    34. The roots of the squares are inserted instead of the
squares themselves ; and the middle quantities in the system of
art. 31 might take the double sign.
    35. From the system of art. 31 a second might be formed
by substituting 1 — A for A, a third by substituting — (1 +E)
for E, and a fourth by making both substitutions simultane
ously. With art. 10 the concluding sentence of art. 11 should
be incorporated.
    36. Now let us consider cases in which the conditions of
arts. 17-20 are satisfied.                      I
                                  To this end symbolize the regular
case,   that  of art. 17, by   R;  the four cases of art. 18 by K, Q,
U, and S respectively ; the first primary form, that of art. 19,
by P, and the second, that of art. 20, by p. Then we have
seven cases, viz. R, K, Q, 8, U, P, and p.
    37.  If we arrange these symbols horizontally, and denote
the primitive arrangement by 1, the five transformations will
enable us to form the following table, viz : —

XLV.      On Induction in Telephonic Circuits.       By W. Grant *.
                        used in the     following experiments      was
THEsuchapparatus
              as was ready to hand in the laboratory.          The par
ticulars given are intended merely to show the conditions
under which the results described were obtained ; there is no
reason to suppose that moderate, or perhaps even considerable
alterations in the dimensions of the apparatus would have
caused the results to be essentially different.
   One of the appliances used is a coil which consists of two
similar No. 20 copper wires of equal length wound side by
side throughout, forming a coil of 2"3 centimetres internal,
and 12*7 centimetres external diameter, and about 12*5 centi
metres in length.       The resistance of the two wires connected
end to end is 28 ohms.        This is afterwards referred to as the
double helix.
   Two other coils, afterwards spoken of as " flat " coils, con
sist of approximately equal lengths of No. 19 copper wire,
wound in rectangular grooves in two flat wooden reels.             The
inside and outside diameters of these coils are about 10 centi
metres and 15 centimetres respectively.             The resistance of
each is roughly 1 ohm.
   Two rough coils of copper wire, in the state in which they
came from the manufacturer, were also employed in the first
experiment described ; but as they are not afterwards referred
to, their dimensions need not be given.
   If  four separate circuits are so arranged that the primary
one includes a battery, a microphone which is actuated by a
watch, a telephone, and one of the wires of the double helix —
the secondary includes the other wire of the double helix, a
telephone, and a rough coil — the tertiary includes another
rough coil in proximity to that in the secondary circuit, a
telephone, and a flat coil — the quaternary includes another
flat coil in proximity to that in the tertiary circuit, and also a
telephone, — a current of a different order circulates in each of
the separate circuits, and the following effects are observed.
   The loudness of the sounds in the telephones in the primary
and secondary circuits is as nearly as possible the same, in
fact no difference can be detected between them ; but in the
tertiary and quaternary circuits the sounds are not so loud,
partly no doubt because the mutual induction between the
secondary and tertiary circuits, and between the tertiary and
quaternary, was less than that between the primary and
secondary, seeing that the coils by whose mutual induction
the effects were transferred from the secondary to the tertiary
         * Bead  before the Physical Society, January 24th, 1880.

               On Induction in Telephonic Circuits.            353
circuit, and from the tertiary to the quaternary, were wound
separately, and consisted of a smaller length of wire than the
two which were wound side by side to form the double helix
used to transfer the induction from the primary to the secondary
circuit.
    The pitch of the sound, however, is found to be the same
in all the four circuits. Now, if the rate of the pulsations of
induced currents is greater as the order of the current is
higher, and if the telephone is capable of vibrating in unison
with these pulsations, it follows that the pitch of the sound
should be higher in some of the telephones than it is in others.
But as the pitch of the sound is the same in all, either the
telephones do not vibrate in unison with the rapid pulsations
of the currents of high order, or the sameness of pitch must
be due to some other cause.
    The arrangement of apparatus      in the next experiment     is/'
shown in fig. 1.                                            S-        /
     There are three separate circuits. The primary includes a
 battery B, a telephone T, a flat coil C, and a microphone M ;
 the secondary includes a flat coil C, a telephone T', and one of
 the wires of the double helix H ; the tertiary includes the
 other wire of the double helix and a contact-key K. L is a
 condenser.
     The coils C and C are placed with their faces in contact
 and their axes coincident; and the microphone is actuated by
 a watch.
     When a battery-current circulates in the primary circuit
 under these circumstances,       currents are induced in the
 secondary and tertiary circuits, and it is observed, when the
 ear is applied to the telephone in the secondary circuit, that
 the loudness of the sound is increased when the key is depressed
 and the tertiary circuit is closed, and that it again becomes
 weak when the key is raised and the tertiary circuit is opened.
 The increase in the loudness is most readily observed when
  the sound is rather faint when the tertiary circuit is open ; for
  if the sound is already loud the increase is not so marked.

  354                 Mr. W. Grant on Induction
      The increased loudness seems to be due to an increase in
  the strength of the secondary current, caused by the reaction
  upon it of the currents induced in the tertiary circuit when
  the key is depressed.     When the tertiary circuit is open, the
  self-induction of the secondary circuit opposes the variations
  of the secondary current; but when the tertiary circuit is
  closed, the mutual induction between it and the secondary
 circuit neutralizes to a great extent the effect of the self-in
 duction of the secondary current, the strength of which is in
 creased or augmented by the inverse currents in the secondary
 circuit, due to the reaction of the tertiary current upon it.
     If  the condenser L, fig. 1, is connected to the tertiary cir
 cuit by joining the wires at a a', and b V, it will be brought
 into action when the key is raised, and short-circuited when
 the key is depressed.      If its capacity is three quarters or half
 a microfarad, the sound in the telephone T' retains its normal
 pitch when the key is depressed ; but when the key is raised
 and the condenser is brought into action the pitch of the
 sound rises ; and the rise is greater with half than with three
 quarters of a microfarad.       With a capacity of from about one
 to five microfarads, the sound retains its normal pitch.
     The arrangement for the following experiment will be in
 telligible from fig.  2.
                                 Fig. 2.
    The primary circuit is the same      as that in fig. 1, where B,
T, C, and M, represent the battery, telephone, coil, and micro
phone respectively.       The secondary circuit includes the coil
C, the telephone T', the double helix H, and a commutator
A, by means of which the direction of the current can be re
versed in one of the wires of the helix.         K  is a key which,
when it is depressed, short-circuits the double helix ; R is a
box of resistance-coils.
    If  the commutator is so placed as to cause the current to
pass through both wires of the double helix in the same

                      in Telephonic Circuits.                            355
direction, the self-induction is strong, the current is weakened
by   it,and the sound in the telephone T'          weak in conse
                                                  is
quence.    If the current passes in opposite directions through
the two wires of the helix (or returns on itself as in                    a
resistance-coil), the self-induction     is  eliminated,   and the
current, having only to overcome the resistance of the circuit,
is stronger than before, and the sound in the telephone T'                is
considerably louder in consequence.
   If the self-induction has been eliminated and the sound                is
already loud, no further increase in the loudness          observed
                                                            is is
when the key    is depressed and the double helix         short-cir
cuited. If the self-induction has not been eliminated, and the
sound      weak,
           is    it   becomes loud when the key          depressed
                                                            is
and the double helix    is  short-circuited, and   itrequires 3000
ohms to be introduced     at R in  order that the loudness may be
the same whether the current passes through the resistance-
coils and key or through the double helix. With               largera
pair of coils substituted for the flat coils  C and C,        it
                                                            requires
5000 ohms to be introduced at it in order to produce                      a
similar result. As the resistance of the double helix           onlyis
28 ohms, these results show, on the one hand, the deleterious
effects which are produced by the self-induction of even a
small coil, and, on the other, the importance of eliminating in
duction in conducting-circuits.
   In the following experiments speech was transmitted by
Bell's telephone, and two observers were employed, one at
either end of the line.
   The coils, keys, &c. were placed at one end of the line, and
were under the control of one observer, whose chief duty was
to read paragraph of newspaper in monotone the loudness
           a            a               a
of which was kept as nearly as possible constant, so that the
inflections of the voice might not be mistaken by the observer
at the other end of the line for an increase or diminution in
the loudness of the tone resulting from the manipulation of
the apparatus while the reading was progressing.
   When     asingle circuit was employed which included one
wire of the double helix, the loudness of the sound increased
when the other wire of the helix was joined up as separate    a
circuit — result similar to that obtained (as already men
            a
tioned) by joining up the tertiary circuit fig.        1.
   When two separate circuits were employed, each of which
included one of the wires of the double helix, the helix acted                 >
as   a" relay," and messages were transferred or translated
from one circuit to the other with perfect facility from either
end of the line, and conversation was carried on with the same
distinctness as when  a  single circuit only was employed.

356              Mr. S. Tolver Preston on Method
   A  single circuit was arranged         as shown     in fig. 3.
                                   Fig. 3.
   T and T' are the telephones, H is the double helix. The
helix was joined up as shown in the figure, one end of each
of its wires, a and b, being left unconnected and insulated.
Thus arranged, there was a break in the continuity of the
circuit, but nevertheless speech was transmitted with perfect
distinctness, and conversation carried on with the same facility
as in the previous experiments, the helix acting not as a con
ductor, but as a condenser, its two wires replacing the two
sets of plates ; and it made no difference which of the ends
of the wires of the helix were connected to the line-wires, or
whether the currents entered the wires of the helix in the
same or in opposite directions.
   The helix in the last case having been replaced by a con
denser, the other arrangements remaining unaltered, speech
was again transmitted with as much facility and clearness as
if the circuit had been complete — the capacity of the con
denser, which was one microfarad, being amply sufficient to
allow conversation to be carried on.

ments, when resting on definite physical conceptions, may be
illustrated by the splendid results of the kinetic theory of
gases ; its complete powerlessness, in the absence of such con
ceptions, may be equally well exemplified by the inquiry as
to the constitution of the aether.           Nowhere, perhaps, have the
 spiritualistic assumptions about "force"* been so indiscrimi
 nately applied as here, to the complete exclusion of all that
 can be called clear physical conceptions.              This has naturally
 resulted from the fatal step taken at the time of Newton, of
                                          "
 putting forward that notion of action at a distance," which
 he characterized as a " great absurdity," and out of which
 inevitably sprang the endless train of "forces ;" of which it
 is aptly remarked by the writer of the article on " the Atomic

 Theory of Lucretius             (North British Review, March 1868,

 perhaps the worst of all                 No attempt was made to show
 how or why the forces acted ; but gravitation being taken as
  due to a mere ' force,' speculators thought themselves at
  liberty to imagine any number of forces, attractive or repul
  sive, or alternating, varying as the distance, or the square,
  cube, fifth power of the distance, &c."
       Sir W. Thomson observes on the waste of mathematical
  skill due to the speculations about " force," much in the fol
 lowing terms t : — " The eighteenth century forms a scientific
  school of its own, where in place of the not unnatural asser
  tion of the ancient schoolmen — ' a body cannot act where it
  is not,' the most extraordinary of all paradoxes was set up —
  '
     contact does not exist.'       This strange notion took deep root ;
  and out of it sprang a barren tree, which exhausted the
  ground and overshadowed the whole field of molecular phy
  sics, and upon which so much useless work of the great mathe-
      * It will perhaps be said that the notion of "force " (in the sense of an
   action across space without the intervention of matter) is now almost
   abandoned, at least in this country.     But then there is a great difference
   between the mere tacit relinquishment of an assumption or theory and
   that practical indication of its complete rejection which is afforded by the
   stirring-up of the mind to active inquiry and realization of the physical
   conditions that can alone replace the assumption.       That this result is far
   from being generally attained yet, more especially in regard to that which
   must be expected as to the functions of the aether, where the physical
   deductions inevitably following on the rejection of "force" would be of
   immense practical interest,  I       I
                                   think shall sufficiently prove in the sequel.
   Indeed it will become apparent that the former vast influence of the notion
              "
    of " force still remains almost undiminished in relation to the sether.
          I                                                          I

    have by me) from the work ' Reprint of Papers on Electrostatics and

     Faraday, Davy, and Rumford are known to have opposed
 the notion of "action at a distance."              It is thus refreshing to
 see that the greatest leaders of physical science, those who
 have added most to knowledge and contributed most to real
 progress, have always been averse to this kind of spiritualistic
 doctrine.
  -
     In the Report of the British Association for 1862 is a
 paper by Prof. Stokes, entitled
                                           " Report on Double Refrac
                        I
 tion"*, to which refer here, as this paper gives an account
  serving well to, illustrate some of the differenJL^OFiesjSlJilii
 aether.     I  would particularly beg of those who are singly in ter-
 ested   in  the  advancement of knowledge, and who would desire
 to take an unbiassed and unprejudiced view of the case, to give
 a share of attention        to the following points which            I  shall
 develop.       I need not add that      I  do not enter on this subject
 lightly, having already devoted some years of study to the
 question.       First the theory of Fresnel is mentioned ; and the
 Report states of it (p. 253) that the aather
                                                           " is regarded as
 consisting of distinct material points, symmetrically arranged,
 and acting on one another with forces depending, for a given
 pair, only on the distance."
     Here, it will be observed, we have the arbitrary assumption
 about "force" (or "action at a distance").                      It is stated
 further in the Report that " Fresnel distinctly makes the sup
 position that the sether is incompressible, or at least is sensibly
 so under the action of forces comparable with those with which
 we are concerned in the propagation of light."                 Prof. Stokes
 then raises the probably not unnatural question whether this
                     "
 supposition of incompressibility is not inconsistent with the
assumed constitution of the aether" (given above); and 'he
 adds (page 253),         I
                        " have mentioned these points, because
 sometimes they are slurred over, and Fresnel's theory spoken
of as if it had been rigorous throughout."
     The theories of Cauchy and Neumann are then referred to.
 It is stated that, according to their view (page 254), " the
 tether is supposed to consist of distinct particles, regarded as
material points, acting on one another by forces in the line
joining them which vary as some function of the distances ;
and the arrangement of these particles is supposed to be dif-
    * My   attention was directed to this Report by a reference to it by the
                                              " Ether " in the new edition
late Prof. Clerk Maxwell, in the article                                    of
the Encyc. Brit, where it is also remarked — The modulatory theory, in
                                                  "
the form which treats the phenomena of light as the motion of an elastic
solid, is still encumbered with several difficulties."

ferent in different directions. The medium is further supposed
to possess three rectangular planes of symmetry &c."
     We see that the same arbitrary speculations about " force"
are applied here. "Alluding further on to a particular result
deduced by Cauchy, Prof. Stokes observes (page 259) : —
 " This result is,   however, in the present case only attained by
 the aid of two sets ef forced relations that
                                           ;       is, relations which
 there is   nothing a priori to indicate, and which are not the
 expression of any simple physical idea, but are obtained by
forcing the theory, which in its original state           of a highly
                                                         is
 plastic nature,   from  the  number
      contains."    (The number of these arbitrary constants
it                                                                   is
 further on stated to have been twenty-one         !)   Probably this
 may be sufficient to illustrate the waste of the highest mathe
 matical skill on this subject.        It said that these specula
                                          is
 tions were inserted in the Exercices de MatMmatiques            ;   so
 that possibly as an exclusively mathematical study (apart from
  any physical applications) the labour may not have been
 altogether lost.
      Prof. Stokes makes the remark (on page 262) — " The argu
                                                         :
  ments in favour of the existence of ultimate molecules in the
  case of ponderable matter appear to rest chiefly on the che
  mical law of definite proportions, and on the laws of crystal
  lography, neither of which of course can be assumed to apply
  to the mysterious aether."
 I       would venture to put the question here, whether the best
  argument for the molecular constitution of the aether (as of
  gross matter)  is   not to be found in the fact that the aether    is
   observed to have certain properties, and that these properties
   would be totally inexplicable unless the aether were assumed to
   be molecular.     This was the argument of Lucretius, adopted
   and expounded by Newton in regard to gross matter (and
   applies equally to the aether).     We can only have recourse to
   arbitrary assumptions about
                                    " force," or to dogmatic affirma
   tions, which exclude all possibility of an explanation, unless
   we regard the aether as molecular.       In paper "On the Dyna
                                               a

                                 (Phil. Trans. 1867, page 49), Prof.
   Maxwell has made a remark which       I    have before had occasion
   to quote, viz. — " The properties of a body supposed to be
               :                                                     a

   cally,  but  cannot  be   explained mathematically."       It. would
   follow from this that, unless the aether be inferred to be mole
   cular, its properties can only be affirmed dogmatically, or no
   rational account can be given of properties that can exist
   solely in virtue of the explanation that underlies them.

 been invented, it is difficult to see how it could have occurred
 to any one to imagine that the aether could be in any respect
 different from gross matter, excepting as to the scale or the
 degree of motion of its parts.     For let it be noticed that the
 endless assumptions that have been made about the aether — as
 to its being essentially different from gross matter (as if there
 were two kinds of matter in existence), as to its being impon
 derable (as an occult quality) — and all the mysterious attributes
 that have been ascribed to        rest in their totality upon the

 assumption of force," and are therefore completely gratui
 tous, or of the invention of those who invented " force."                     If
 this notion of the existence of " force

 forward,   itcould not fail to have been seen that the only con
 ceivable way in which matter can be physically affected          by      is
motion; and the supposed " laws
                                      " of nature
                                                   (in  the sense of
mere arbitrary fiats, which are based upon no dynamical con
ditions, but upon the notion of force

the phantom "force"*.        The distaste that at present exists
for the study of that magnificent physical agent the aether,
may be no doubt largely attributed to the spurious mystery
thrown over the subject by the occult notion of " force " and         ;
this dislike for the study would probably disappear with this
notion  ;  progress would be rendered possible.        The one fact
of the aether forming the physical groundwork of the science
of optics should surely be enough to exite interest in this agent.

the light of the principle of the Conservation of Energy), as
    * It would no doubt be unjust   if  the blame for these vagaries in regard
 to "force" were entirely attached to the present generation, without
 keeping fully in view the fact that it   was inoculated by some of its pre
 cursors, who (in spite of the protests of Newton) imagined that without
 any addition to knowledge, but by the mere invention of phrase ("force,"

 of gravitation.    Kumford's words of protest against this were, " Nobody
 surely in his sober senses has ever pretended to understand the mechanism
 of gravitation."    Huyghens, Hobbes, Leibnitz, Descartes, (Newton him
 self), and all the leading men of that period, as Lange relates in his notable
historical work Geschichte des Materialismus (vol.    i. p. 264), were of the
 same view as Rumford.       But not only (as justly remarked in this work)
 did those who invented " force (or " action at distance") bring forward

in gross matter on every hand, ever assert themselves in the face
of a spiritualistic theory (based on "action at a distance")^,

form), that energy can in fact have a duplex nature (kinetic

    At least it appears to the writer that to explain the observed
absence of resistance to the passage of bodies through the
aether is very important.           It is difficult to imagine what is
supposed     to  take  place  in  these   " statical " theories, where the
aether is supposed to consist of material particles in fixed posi
tions and assumed to be acting on each other by " forces
                                                                       " at

of these plastic theories, when taxed to their utmost extent,

elementary.
    There would seem to be sometimes a certain looseness of
 reasoning or carelessness in regard to the treatment of the
 aether, that would be considered out of place in ordinary
mechanical problems.            Sir John Herschel, whose expositions
are known in general to have been distinguished for their
 clearness and lucidity, seems to have made an exception in the
 case of the aether.        In referring to the speculation as to the
aether being a
                      " solid," he
                                       (' Popular Lectures,' page 285)
 defines the solidity of the aether in the sense, that none of its
 elementary molecules are to be supposed capable of interchanging
places f, or of bodily transfer to any measurable distance from
 their own special and assigned localities in the universe."
 What (one might ask) becomes of the molecules of aether in
 capable
           "  of bodily transfer from their own assigned localities,"
 with a planet careering through them, or the solar system in
 its proper motion of several miles per second through space ?
    The vague and loose reasoning occasionally applied to the
aether, may perhaps be partly accounted for from the feeling of
utter hopelessness as to making any advance when all efforts
are paralyzed by the boundless labyrinth of speculation involved
in the assumption of "force." Can it be seriously believed
   * The  proposed mode of accounting for the transverse vibrations of
light, given in the article ir. ' Nature,' was based on a suggestion or hint
thrown out by Prof. Clerk Maxwell, under subject " Ether" (Encyc. Brit.

for one moment that this complete helplessness is in truth a
necessary thing, or that it is any thing more than the natural
consequence of a single departure from the strict and defined
path of reason, by making an assumption without a definite con
ception to base it upon ? .A single false step may well be fatal
if it involves the departure from a system (or the overthrow
of a guiding principle).
    No doubt the above theory, suggested as a groundwork for
the constitution of the aether, will, from its very definiteness,
be specially liable to attack, since there will not be the power
of" saving appearances," by introducing first one hypothetical
" force " and then another, that belongs to the plastic statical
theories.      My object, however, has not been so much to
suggest theory as to point to the necessity for a system in
           a
order to find one. Difficulties may naturally be expected to
present themselves at first.      If,
                                   however, the theory suggested
were only capable of explaining       single fact, such for instance
                                      a
as the absence of resistance of the aether to the passage of bodies,
then even this might fairly be regarded as more satisfactory
than those dogmatic assumptions that exclude all possible ex
planation so long as they are adhered to. The theory at least
shows the aether to be a body necessarily uniform as to density
and pressure, and enclosing       a store of concealed energy of
probably enormous value in         a small volume of space, this
latter quality being precisely that required to render the aether
fitted to be   a  powerful motive agent, capable of playing      a
most important part in the everyday operations of nature.

 but in practice. After the recognition of this fact, then the
 inquiry into the mode or process involved in the derivation of
 the motion from the material agent, becomes the next step,
 which presents itself as an engineering problem of great
 practical interest.
 I      venture to think that the critical remarks made in this
 essay will not be considered inopportune.             May it   not well be
 conceivable that the immense success of experiment in this age
 has caused the value of a strict and pure system of theoretic
 reasoning to be less appreciated than would otherwise have
 been the fact  ?    or that the danger of wandering from such               a
 system   is  greater (because its effects are less felt) when we
 have the resource of experiment to fall back upon                ?     The
 ancient Greeks, who had not recognized the worth of ex-                         ¦
 perimental research, were consequently thrown back upon
 theoretic reasoning as        sole guide and the value of a strictly
                                  a            ;
 rational system was every thing to them           ;  and the remarkable
 progress they     made   in just  theoretic    views  as to natural facts
is   admitted (some of their fundamental deductions remaining
 unshaken to this day).         One may well imagine the confusion
that would have resulted, had the notion of " force
                                                                  " and the
attendant wandering into            maze of spiritualism, occurred to
                                      a
them,    without   the  backstay    of  experiment to put     a    curb on
these vagaries.
     Nevertheless, although the worth of experiment can scarcely
be overestimated,       it   no doubt none the less true that the
                             is
general agreement upon            uniform and strict theoretic system
                                      a

this. Indeed, when one compares the enormous advantage we

 the progress made in the present day in obtaining an insight
 into the hidden nature of physical causes has not kept pace
 with this increased knowledge of facts ; and this would hint
 again at the evil attendant on the want of a method. Also the
 lull of any great discoveries in the field of pure physics during
 the last few years would seem to make the direction of atten
 tion to any fresh pathway all the more opportune.

             XLVII.      On Berthelot's Thermo-Chemistry.
                          By   J.   P. Cooke,   Jun*
            new work of M. Berthelot, entitled Essai de Micanique
THEChimigue         fondie sur la Thermo-chimie^ presents for the
  first time in a systematic form the results accumulated during
  the past ten years from one of the most fruitful fields of inves
  tigation ever opened to the chemist.       The book supplies a
  most important want ; for     the details of the work, published
 in numerous separate papers rapidly following each other in
 the chemical journals, have been almost unintelligible, except
 to those who have followed the investigation from the begin
 ning, and no connected statement of the general principles
 involved was accessible to the student.     The work in this new
 field has been done almost wholly by two investigators — Ber
 thelot, of Paris, and Thomsen, of Copenhagen.         Guided by
 different theoretical views, these skilful experimenters have
 gone over very nearly the same ground ; and their united tes
 timony, concurrent as it is in most cases, gives a certainty to
 the results obtained which is as fortunate as it is unusual when
 the field explored is so extensive as the one we are considering.
 These two men alone could write authoritatively on the sub
ject ; and it      is,
                   perhaps, fortunate that the first presentation
should come from M. Berthelot, who has the usual skill of his
nation in exposition and generalization.
     In bis introduction,- Berthelot enunciates the fundamental
principles of thermo-chemistry under the three following
heads:   —
                 Principle  Molecular Work.
                                    of

tion.

 changes, which bring       it into a new condition without produ
 cing any mechanical effect on external bodies, the amount of
 heat evolved or absorbed, as the total result of these changes,
 depends solely on the initial and final states of the system,
 and is the same, whatever may be the nature or order of the
  intermediate states.
                     Principle of Maximum Work.
       III. In any chemical reaction between a system of bodies
  not acted on by external forces, the tendency is toward that
  condition and those products which will result in the greatest
  evolution of heat.
       The first two of these principles are direct deductions from
  the mechanical theory of heat ; but the third is a generaliza
  tion which Berthelot claims as original ; and if so, it is his
   greatest contribution to this department of the science.        In
  the work before us the first two principles are discussed in the
  first volume, and this discussion, together with a description
   of the methods of experimenting and an enumeration of the
   numerical data thus far obtained, fill nearly 600 large octavo
  pages; while the discussion of the third principle occupies a
   second volume which is still larger.      We will follow the same
  order    in the  few  remarks    which the limits of a short notice
  permit.
       As the announcement of an almost axiomatic principle of
  thermodynamics, which every investigation of thermo-che-
  mistry necessarily assumes, the first of these general principles
  has an appropriate place at the opening of a discussion of the
   subject.    In regard to heat, as in regard to other manifesta
  tions of energy, the total effect is equal to the sum of all the
   partial effects. But Berthelot adds to his statement of the
   Principle of Molecular Work the remark, "This principle
   furnishes the measure of chemical affinities." When, how
   ever, we come to his discussion of this general principle, we
   are disappointed to find that the whole subject is summarily
   dismissed without giving the reader any clear conception of
   the distinction between the two modes of change whose results
'
   are inextricably blended in all chemical processes.
       Were we able to distinguish between chemical and physical
   change, the first principle would undoubtedly give us a mea
   sure of what we might then clearly define as chemical affinity
   or chemism.      Not only, however, is it at present impossible to
    eliminate from our results the effects of physical changes, but,
   moreover, when we study the details of the chemical processes
   with which we are most familiar, we are surprised to find to
   what a large extent the thermal effect depends on the changes

                   Berthelot's Thermo- Chemistry.              369
in the obviously physical condition which the process involves.
For example, in the formation of hydrogen gas from diluted
sulphuric acid and zinc, the passing of a solid into a liquid, on
the one hand, and the development of a gas from a liquid, on
the other, involve physical changes which very largely control
the amount of heat developed in the process, and therefore
also, according to the third principle, control the process.
Indeed, as is well known, all chemical action ceases as soon as
the water becomes saturated with zinc sulphate, although a
large excess, both of sulphuric acid and zinc, may be present.
 But, after making all allowances for the potency of physical
 conditions, it would undoubtedly appear, from the present
 standpoint of Chemistry, that there must be certain differences
of qualities inherent in the atoms which correspond to differ
ences of chemical affinity, and which are important factors in
determining chemical changes ; and it is certainly legitimate
to seek to measure what we may call the relative potential of
the atoms when in a state of indefinite expansion.       It is ob
vious, however,    from  Berthelot's discussion of the subject,
that we are as yet far from realizing such a result.       In fact,
the only case in which he claims that we measure directly the
heat of chemical action independently of physical changes is
in the well-known reaction H2 + Cl2 = 2 HC1, which is attended
with the evolution of 22 units of heat for every 36-5 grams of
hydrochloric acid gas formed.      Since in this case the volume
 of the aeriform compound is equal to the sum of the volumes
 of the two elementary gases from which the compound has
 been formed, and since, moreover, there has been no essential
 change in the specific heat, we may reasonably infer that the
 heat evolved results from chemical action only.      But, accord
 ing to the theory which is accepted by the great majority of
 chemists, this chemical action is by no means so simple as the
 direct union of two gas-volumes would seem to indicate ; for,
 as our symbols show, the process implies the parting of the
 similar atoms which are united in the molecules, both of hy
 drogen and of chlorine gases ; and, unless we misinterpret a
 very large number of facts, this separation implies the expen-     •
 diture of a not inconsiderable amount of mechanical work, and
 may imply    a change  of physical condition as well. Berthelot,
 in common with afechool of French chemists'jyejects the mo
  dern theory based on the assumption of the equal molecular
  volumes of all substances when in the state of gas, and uses
  throughout his work the chemical equivalents of the older
  chemistry in place of the atomic weights of the new.       At the
  same time he accepts fully the  mechanical   theory of heat, and
  the conceptions of molecular work which this theory implies.

 370                        Mr.   J.   P. Cooke on
 To those who consider that Avogadro's law, and therefore the
 modern theory of chemistry, are direct deductions from the
 mechanical theory of heat, this course seems inconsistent ; and
 this inconsistency deprives the work of a very considerable
 degree of simplicity which might otherwise have been secured.
 The remarkable progress made in organic chemistry during
 the last twenty years has resulted almost wholly from the cir
 cumstance that the investigators have worked back from the
   elementary substances to the elementary atoms, and discussed
   the various modes in which these atoms might be grouped in
   the molecules.     In_the same w&y, in thermo-chemistryive
   shall find no satisfactory basis until we go back~tikewise to
   the atoms, and discuss the thermal effects which attend their
   union or their separation.   One generalization we can already
1 make in           to  atomic work  with a great degree of cer
             regard
          —
  tainty that the union of atoms is attended with the evolution
   of heat, and the parting of the same atoms in the same asso
   ciations with an equal absorption of heat: and it must be
   remembered that, as defined by modern chemistry, atoms are
  definite masses of matter ; so that in enunciating this general
  principle we refer to a palpable effect as resulting from a well-
  defined process, entirely independently of the theoretical views
  we may have in regard to the nature of the chemical atoms or
  of the modes by which they are united and grouped together.
  The general principle just stated explains a great many facts
  of thermo-chemistry which are otherwise anomalous and ob
  scure.    It, moreover, gives us the basis for a clear theoretical
  distinction between a chemical and a physical process — the
  first consisting in the separation or union of atoms, the last in
  the separation or drawing together of molecules.        It is true
  that the distinction here drawn      as yet, theoretical; but the
                                          is,
  theory involved gives us basis from which to work, and this
                                a
is   enough for the present.     The problem of finding what we
  have called the thermal potential of the atoms          not more
                                                             is
 remote than many problems         which  have   been  successfully
  solved in organic synthesis; and          in this direction, as
                                            it   is                    it
  seems to us, that we can alone expect to reach a measure of
 chemical affinity.     It may, indeed, be found that the pro
 blem cannot be solved; and attempts to solve             may lead
                                                             it
 to results which will modify or supplant     our present theories.
 It may appear that the difference between           chemical and
                                                         a
a    physical process      one of degree, and not of kind
                          is                                    but,
                                                                  ;
 whatever the result may be, there can be no doubt that the
 investigation will lead to larger knowledge and clearer con
ceptions.
     As   it   seems to us, the principle       of molecular work should

                  Berthelot's Thermo-Chemistry.                371
be supplemented      by the principle of atomic work ; and it is
certain that neither clearness of conception nor definiteness of
statement has been gained by the obvious attempt to avoid the
recognition of the modern theory of chemistry.
   We readily accept Berthelot's second fundamental principle
of thermo-chemistry when enunciated as above, because it so
obviously falls under the general law of the conservation of
energy; but it is obvious that this principle could not have been
assumed prior to its experimental verification, any more than
could the principle of the .conservation of mass, prior to the
experiments of Lavoisier ; and as Lavoisier worked out this
last great principle with the balance, so Berthelot and Thom-
sen have demonstrated with the calorimeter the corresponding
fundamental principle of thermo-chemistry, which must be
regarded as a generalization from the results of their work.
Moreover, although in cases of simple direct combination the
principle under discussion is almost self-evident, and has been
long admitted, yet, before the investigations of Berthelot and
Thomsen, no chemist conceived of its application in the very
complex and indirect reactions by which the greater part of
the thermo-chemical data have been obtained.           It must be
remembered that very few processes of direct chemical combi
nation fulfil the conditions which an accurate measure of the
accompanying thermal change involves ; and a vast amount of
chemical knowledge and ingenuity has been shown in devising
indirect methods by which the results could be reached.        The
general theory   of these indirect methods   may be stated thus: —
We arrange two systems of reactions, both of which begin
with the same factors in the same conditions, and end with the
same product in the same conditions.        In one of these series
of reactions there must be no process whose thermal result, if
not already known, cannot be measured with the calorimeter.
In the other series the chemical combination or decomposition,
whose thermal effect we are investigating, enters as an un
known term, the effect of the other chemical changes involved
being known or capable of measurement, as in the first series.
It follows now, from the principle we are discussing, that if
we subtract the sum of the quantities measured in the second
series from the sum of those measured in the first series, we
shall have the value of the unknown quantity. An example
will make the method more intelligible.
   It is required to determine the heat evolved when aluminium
combines with bromine to form Al2 Br6 ; and in the following
scheme we assume, as is usual in this subject, that the che
mical symbols stand for a number of grams corresponding to
the atomic weight, and that the amount of heat is expressed

 so as to fulfil the conditions we have assumed : —

     In studying these two series of reactions, it will be evident
 that we begin in each case with the same amounts of the same
 elementary substances, namely K6, Al2, Br6, Gl6, and that we
 end with aqueous solutions in the same condition.         Hence the
 total amount of heat evolved in each of the two series must
 be the same, and we can at once deduce the value of the only
 unknown quantity. In this determination, the only quantities
 which had to be measueed at the time were the heat of solu
 tion of aluminic chloride in an aqueous solution of potassic
 bromide on the one hand, and the heat of solution of aluminic
 bromide in an aqueous solution of potassic chloride on the
 other, using, of course, equivalent quantities in each case.
 The other values given had previously been determined by
 indirect methods ; and it can easily be seen that the investiga
 tion displays, not only a great command of knowledge, but
 also a great fertility of invention ; and yet this is a compara
 tively simple case.
     As deductions from the general principle of the conservation
 of energy, Berthelot gives a large number of theorems which
 serve to illustrate the extent and variety of its application to
 the study of the thermal changes which accompany chemical
 reaction. We give two as examples : —
     Theorem III. — In two series of reactions starting from dif
ferent initial conditions, but ending in the same final state, the
 difference in the quantities of heat evolved is equal to that which
 would be evolved in passing from one of the initial states to the
 other.
    This theorem     enables  us to   determine    very simply    the

                  Berthelot's Thermo- Chemistry.               373
amount of heat evolved in the formation of the definite hy
drates, although it would be very difficult, if not impossible,
to form these substances with a definite composition in the
calorimeter. Thus, to determine the heat evolved in the reac
tion S03 + H2 0 = H2 S04, we have only to dissolve in one ex
periment S03 and in another H2 8O4 in a comparatively large
amount of water, when the difference in the heat evolved in
the two cases will be the quantity required.       So also the heat
of formation of a hydrocarbon may be determined, by com
paring the heat of combustion of the compound with the heat
of combustion of the hydrogen and carbon of which it consists.
Thus the heat of combustion of acetylene, C2 H2 (26 grams),
has been directly measured, and is equal to 321,000 units,
while the heat of combustion of C2 (24 grams), plus the heat
of combustion of H2 (2 grams), only amounts to 257,000 units.
Hence it is evident that, in the formation of 26 grams of ace
tylene, 64,000 units are absorbed.     Acetylene, indeed, belongs
to a class of compounds whose formation is attended with the
 absorption of heat. This class of compounds, which have a
 special interest in thermo-chemistry, are said to be endother-
 mous; while by far the larger class of compounds, whose for
 mation is attended with an evolution of heat, are said to be
exothermous.
     Theorem   VI. — When    a compound gives up one of its ele
 ments to another body, the heat evolved in the reaction is the
 difference between the heat offormation of the first compound and
 that of the resulting product.
     Thus, when an aqueous solution of chlorine is used as an
 oxidizing agent, for every 18 grams of water decomposed
  9600 units of heat are evolved ; and this amount is the differ
 ence between the heat of formation of H2 O and 2 HC1. As
 can easily be seen, the same theorem applies to the problem
 presented by explosive agents of various kinds, and simplifies
 the solution to a remarkable extent.
     These few illustrations will serve to give a general idea of
 the mode of investigation in this new field of thenno-chemistry ;
 but they are wholly inadequate to show either the extent of
 the field or the great skill with which it has been cultivated.
  We must reserve for another number a notice of some veiy
  interesting relations which, under his third fundamental prin
  ciple, Berthelot discusses in the second volume of his great
 work.

          XLVIII.        The Influence     of Friction upon the Generation   of a
               Voltaic Current.         By Shelford Bidwell, M.A.*
               '            '
                 Nature of March 4th Prof. Barrett calls attention to
        IN    the fact (which        I believe had been observed before) that
        the electro-motograph, or receiving-instrument of Edison's
        loud-speaking telephone, is capable of generating an electric
        current. He considers that we have here a new source of
        electricity, the current generated being due to the motion of
        a chalk cylinder under a metallic surface.            His chalk, he adds
        in note,
            a          had    been  impregnated some      months   before with a
        solution of phosphate of soda, but was, when used, practically
        dry.
           The construction of the motograph is essentially as fol
        lows : — One end of an arm of brass is joined to the diaphragm
        of the instrument ; the other end, which is faced with platinum,
        is pressed by a spring against the upper surface of a horizontal
        chalk cylinder.          This cylinder is mounted on a thick brass
        core or spindle, and can be made to rotate and rub against
        the platinum on the arm by turning a winch-handle.                   The

        cylinder is impregnated with certain chemical substances, of
        which    I   believe caustic potash is always one, though it is not
        mentioned by Prof. Barrett.
           It will be seen that there are here two metals, brass and
        platinum, connected by a medium containing caustic potash ;
        and the arrangement looks so much like a voltaic couple that
        I was not surprised, on connecting the brass and platinum to
        a galvanometer,         to find a small + current flowing from the
        platinum-faced arm.            The cylinder was not rotated, and had
        not been moistened for some months.              On turning the handle
        the galvanometer at once indicated a much stronger + cur-

         Influence of Friction upon a Voltaic Current.            375
rent passing from the platinum.          The effect of the friction
was to greatly increase the strength of the current.
  I  then faced the brass arm with zinc instead of platinum.
On connecting the instrument to the galvanometer a small
deflection was again observed ; but this time the + current
flowed, as   Iexpected, not from the zinc-faced arm, but from
the brass core of the cylinder.     The substitution of the zinc
for the platinum had the effect of reversing the current, brass
being positive to platinum and negative to zinc. In this case,
too, rotation of the cylinder largely increased the current.
   I now laid aside the motograph, and connected to the two
wires of the galvanometer a sheet of brass and a sheet of pla
tinum.    Between these metallic plates      I  placed a thin slice of
dry chalk; the galvanometer indicated nothing.           I  rubbed the
metals successively against the chalk ; still the galvanometer
remained motionless.       For the pure chalk 1 substituted a
chalk plate which had been soaked in a saturated solution of
phosphate of soda and thoroughly dried ; again there was no
result. Neither was there when          I  used dry blotting-paper
which had been saturated with phosphate of soda. But with
a piece of blotting-paper which had been saturated with a
solution of caustic potash and made as dry as possible, the
results were just the same as with the electro-motograph :
brass and platinum gave a + current from the platinum ;
brass and zinc gave a + current from the brass ; and in both
cases the current was much increased by rubbing.
    This experiment was repeated with the following pairs of
metals — brass and platinum, zinc and lead, zinc and copper,
lead and copper, tin and copper, zinc and tin — covering one of
 every pair of metals successively with a wet cloth and rubbing
 the one so covered with the other.       In every case the friction
 seemed to considerably increase the current which was gene
rated on mere contact.        If, for instance, a piece of lead is
covered with a wet cloth and a piece of copper is pressed upon
it, a + current will of course flow from the copper.           On rub
 bing, this current  is very greatly increased.       If the copper be
 the metal covered, and the lead rubbed against        it, the current
 from the copper will again be greatly increased, but apparently
 not quite so much so as in the former case.            And believe
                                                             1
 that this difference in the effect produced according to the
 metal covered, occurs in the case of all the other pairs of
 metals which    Itried. In some cases      it   is very notable ;   in
 othersit    small,
            is        and extremely   difficult  to  detect  without a
 machine for producing uniform friction.          But, as far as can
                                                                 I
judge, the effect on the current      is always greatest when the

positive element is covered and the negative element exposed
to friction.
   It seems, therefore, that Prof. Barrett's experiment is only
an illustration of the effect of friction on one of the elements
of a voltaic couple in increasing the current. This effect                   is,
however, so very remarkable that                 was induced to make
                                                  1
further experiments.

                                                  I         this — Take
                                                                is   :
two plates of the same metal, cut from the same sheet, and
connect them with a galvanometer                cover one of them with
                                                  ;
a  wet cloth and bring the other down upon it.                 If the two
pieces of metal are in the same physical condition there will
be no material deflection of the galvanometer.             Now rub the
covered metal with the bare metal.             As long as the rubbing
continues, the galvanometer indicates             current of electricitj',
                                                      a

current invariably flows from the plate which                covered by

I     have made the experiment with plates of tin, lead, copper,
brass, and zinc, with the same result in every case.
I     do not suggest an explanation of the above-mentioned
phenomena.         When the two plates of a single metal are used,
it  appears that friction renders the one rubbed relatively
electro-positive.       But in the case of two metals, friction seems
generally to have          greater effect upon the negative than the
                           a
positive element,       and     makes the negative element not more
                               it
positive but more negative.             Any possible explanation that
occurs to me of the one case            inconsistent with the other.
                                        is
    Certain speculations led me to try the effect of passing
 battery-current through           pair of metallic plates, separated
                                    a                                        by a
a piece of wet rag or paper, while they were being rubbed
together   ;  and I    found that when the current passed from the
 covered to the uncovered plate,             remarkable diminution in
                                             a

produced no such result.            Iexhibit little apparatus for ren

rPHESE       publications constitute the latest instalments of the re-
        suits of meteorological inquiry so energetically pursued in
India. The first testifies to the unwearied perseverance of the
Reporters to the different Governments in India ; and the second
treats of the Eainfall, with its variations, in the northern parts of
India.
    One of the most striking features, we may say, of both publications
is the connexion of the condition of the sun's surface with the
state of the earth's atmosphere as manifested by its meteorological
phenomena ; and we are disposed to consider, from a careful perusal
of the first, that our Indian meteorologists are in a fair way, if not
of fully solving the problem of solar influence on terrestrial phe
nomena, at least of throwing much light upon it.       In this connexion
we shall extract some of the most important passages bearing on it.
    " A branch of physical enquiry, the close connexion of which
with Meteorology has been fully recognized only within the last few
years, is that of the physical condition of the Sun.      So long ago as
the beginning of the present century, Sir William Herschel specu
lated on the probable variation of the sun's heat, and the consequences
of such variation on terrestrial meteorology, and secondarily on
agricultural produce. But it was not until the British Association
meeting of 1872, that attention was prominently drawn to this
subject, by the late Colonel Strange, since which time the study of
Solar Physics has more and more been recognized as inseparable from
that of the meteorology of our planet. Hitherto such coincidences
as have been traced out, with more or less distinctness or vague
ness, between the variations of the sun's condition and the atmo
sphere and other physical phenomena of our planet and its inhabi
tants, have been purely empirical.      To take, for instance, the case
which is perhaps the most firmly established of all, viz. the variation
of terrestrial magnetism, — all that can be said is, that the various
changes in the sun's condition and position with reference to the
earth, such as the diurnal and annual periods of the earth's re
volution, cyclical variation of sun-spots, the sun's periodical revolu
tion on his axis, &c, are faithfully reflected in the variations of the
 terrestrial magnetism, in the varying intensity and direction of
 the force. But as to the chain of physical causes through which the
 solar variations thus react upon the earth — whether, for instance
    Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 9. No. 57. May 1880.                  2E

378                    Notices respecting New Books.
the influence is such as one magnet exerts upon another, or whether
the terrestrial magnetism is affected mediately, owing to a variation
in the intensity of the solar radiation,     are points on which various
opinions are held."
      " The coincidences between solar and
                                               meteorological phenomena
are less certainly determined ; but such as they are, they are of the
 same character, viz. simple empirical coincidences, the physical
reason of which is still obscure ; and this obscurity cannot be re
moved until we have answered beyond all cavil the fundamental
              "
 question, Does the intensity of solar radiation vary pari passu
 with the visible changes of his surface, and if so, what is the law
 of that variation ?" The only attempts that have been made to
 answer this question, by direct observation, are two —viz., a dis
 cussion by Mr. Baxendell of the recorded temperatures of sun-ther
 mometers at the Radcliffe observatory at Oxford, and at Eccles near
 Manchester ; and a discussion of the recorded radiation-tempe
 ratures at ten stations in different parts of India. In both cases
 the conclusion was the same, and distinctly indicated.          The sun
 emits the more heat the greater the visible agitation of the photo
 sphere as indicated by the greater number of spots, of red flames
 and faculse.      But the sun-thermometer is justly regarded as an
 instrument inadequate to decide a question so important as that
 of the variations of the sun's heat." [In consequence of this inade
 quacy]
            " some persons have drawn the conclusion that the varia
 tion of the solar heat is the opposite of that indicated by the sun-
 thermometer.         Others, again, have arrived at a similar inference,
  reasoning from the ascertained fact that sun-spots emit less heat
  than the general solar surface ; and forgetting apparently that sun-
  spots and facul» increase and decrease together.           The question,
  therefore, still remains for final decision ; and there is no more
  important inquiry in the whole range of the science."
       In the introductory remarks to Mr. Hill's paper on the Variation
  of Rainfall in Northern India, we have the following passage : —
   "Early in 1877 Dr. W. ~W. Hunter published a pamphlet entitled
   '
      The Cycle of Drought and Famine in Southern India,' in which it
  was shown that there is a remarkable tendency to a deficiency in
  the rainfall of the city of Madras, at times when the surface of the
   sun is free from spots — a phenomenon that had previously been
   pointed out, though perhaps upon somewhat insufficient evidence,
  by Mr. J. Norman Lockyer.            Dr. Hunter also stated, upon the
   authority    of Sir W.   Robinson  of the Madras Council, that severe
   famines and scarcities in various parts of the Southern Presidency
   also tend to recur at intervals of about eleven years, this being the
   approximate length of the cycle of the solar maculation."
       It having appeared from discussions by Mr. Blanford, Mr. Hill,
   and Mr. E. D. Archibald, that although the registers examined
    were not sufficient to establish a relation between sun-spot area
    and rainfall, yet they seemed to lend some support to the theory that,
     underlying very great irregular and non-periodic variations, there
    is a fluctuation of the total annual rainfall coinciding approximately
     with that of sun-spot frequency. Mr. Hill, in order to test the
     soundness of this conclusion, and also of inquiring into the truth

                      Notices respecting New Books.                    379
 of the   supposed cyclical variation of the annual rainfall, examined
 all the   available rainfall registers for the North-west Provinces and
 Oudh,    as well as many others placed at his disposal by the courtesy
of the    Meteorological Eeporter to the Government of India, and of
the Secretary to the Financial Commissioner of the Punjab, from
which Mr. Hill selected the registers of twenty representative sta
tions, several extending over a period of twenty or more consecutive
years. The country included by the discussion extended over
more than eleven degrees of latitude and twenty-four degrees of
longitude.
     In carrying out this discussion Mr. Hill divided his material
 into two series, viz. summer and winter rainfall. The summer
rains afford a result fairly accordant with the assumption that there
is an eleven-year cycle of rainfall similar to that obtained by Mr.
 Blanford ; but he has this remark : — "Neither Mr. Blanford's result
nor this can therefore be said to lend unequivocal support to Mr.
Meldrum's hypothesis ; for the character of the oscillation in the case
of the rainfall is very different from that of the sun-spots— the
fall from maximum to minimum occurring in three years and the
rise from minimum to maximum occupying eight, whereas in the
 average sun-spot cycle the fall occupies seven years and the rise
only four."
     The discussion of the winter rainfall furnishes a considerable
 degeee of uniformity as regards the epoch of maximum and mini
 mum of four cycles of eleven years each, from 1834 to 1877, and is
 illutrated by a series of curves, of which that of Wolf's sun-spot
 numbers (inverted) for the same cycles, is compared with that of the
 winter rains, with the following result : — " The maximum of winter
 rainfall would therefore appear to be reached on the average rather
 more than a year before the minimum of sun-spots ; and the mini
 mum rainfall appears either to coincide with, or to follow the
 maximum of sun-spots at about an equal interval.            The two phe
 nomena cannot, therefore, be directly related to each other as cause
 and effect, though they may both be the effects of a common cause."
     Since the establishment by General Sir Edward Sabine of a
 connexion between the variation of sun-spots and that of terres
 trial magnetism, to which allusion is made in Mr. Blanford's Report,

  J-     1. « On the Geology         of Anglesey."      By Prof. T. M'Kenny
 Hughes,     H.A.
     The author brought forward evidence to show that, resting on
 the central gneissic axis of Anglesey, there was a series of conglo
 merates which he referred to the base of the Cambrian ; that the
 Lingula-flags had not yet been recognized ; that the conglomerates
 were followed by the brown sandstones hitherto referred to Caradoc,
  but which he identified by the included fossils with Tremadoc ; that
  the lower part of the Black-Shale Group was Arenig, as shown by
  the Graptolites ; while he thought that the higher parts of the
  Black-Shale Group might turn out to be Lower Bala ; that the
  Black Shales pass under the Gnarled Schists. He then adduced
  evidence to show that these Gnarled Schists were not foliated or in
  any way true metamorphic rocks, but only crumpled laminated beds
  in which all the alteration that had taken place was of the nature
  of vein-structure, and a kind of universal slickenside, consequent
  upon the crushing of a rock consisting of thin laminse of different
  texture ; and suggested that the whole might be, hike the green
  slates &c. of Chapel-le-dale, in Yorkshire, the water-sorted out
  lying equivalents of volcanic rocks elsewhere, and be contempo
  raneous with the Snowdon volcanic series.

Sewage-Farm at Sandford-on-Thames."           By E. S. Cobbold, Esq.,
F.G.S., Assoc.M.Inst.C.E.
    The beds noticed in this paper belong to the Kimmeridge Clay
and the upper and middle part of the Oxford Oolite.           They were
exposed (over   an  area  of  about 1^  mile by 1 mile)  in making deep
trenches for a sewage-farm, about 4 miles south of Oxford.           The
author described variations in the Coralline Oolite and Coral Rag,
which become, in places, a marl without corals.          The Calcareous
Grit also is variable in character.     On either Bide of this tract, at
Headington and Cumnor, are coralliferous strata.        Thus it appears
to indicate a gap in the reef.     The clay may indicate the proximity
of some river, which thus caused an interruption.       The author gave
reasons for thinking that it came from the S.E., and suggested
that it may have descended from the Paleozoic ridge beneath
London.     The paper also included some notes on the Ximmeridge
Clay and a peat deposit.
   3. "A Review and Description of the various Species of British
Upper-Silurian Fenestellidse." By G. W. Shrubsole, Esq., F.G.S.
    In this paper the author passed in review the forms of Fenes-
tellidse which have been described from British Upper Silurian
rocks. These amount to nine in all — six described by Lonsdale, two
by M'Coy, and one by Portlock.        From the imperfect condition of
the specimens at the command of these authors, and especially from
their characters being masked by an incrusting growth of corals &c.
and by subsequent matting, it is in most eases impossible to identify
them, only one of the nine species, namely F. rigidula, M'Coy,
being recognizable.     The author discusses the peculiarities of these
supposed species, of which he adopts only F. rigidula ; and describes
the other forms known to him under the following new names :—
Fenestella reteporata, F. lineata, and F. intermedia.        The author
further discussed the relations of the Silurian Fenestellidse to those
of the Carboniferous and to other organisms.

    In this paper the author, after referring to his previous paper on
the geological age of the Glengariff beds (Quart. Journ. Geol. Soo.
vol. xxxv. p. 699), in which he showed that between them and the
succeeding Old Red Sandstone in the south of Ireland there existed
a very great hiatus, proceeded to compare the sections of the rocks
of the south of Ireland with those of North Devon, and to show
that the hiatus in question is represented in the latter locality by
the whole of the Middle and Lower Devonian rocks.                He then
discussed the relations of the Devonshire rocks to those occurring
north of the Severn,- in Scotland, and in Belgium ; and from this

called — represented in Devonshire hy the Pickwell-Down Sandstone,
in Ireland by the so-called Upper Old Red Sandstone (including the
Kiltorcan beds), in Scotland by the so-called Upper Old Red Sand
stone, and in Belgium by the " Psammites du Condroz ;

that the so-called Old Red Sandstone of Herefordshire is the estua-
rine representative of the Middle and Lower Devonians of Devon
shire, and that the so-called Lower Old Red Sandstone of Scotland,
 with its fish-remains, is the lacustrine representative of the Upper

     1. "The Newer Pliocene Period in England. — Part I. Com
prising the Red and Fluvio-marine Crag and Glacial formations."
 By Searles V. Wood, Esq., Jun., F.G.S.
     The author divided this part of his subject into five stages, com
mencing with
     Stage I. The Red Crag and its partially fluvio-marine equivalent.
 The Red Crag he regards as having been a formation of banks and
foreshores mostly accumulated between tide-marks, as shown by the
 character of its bedding.         The southern or "Walton extremity of
 this formation, which contains a molluscan fauna more nearly allied
 to that of the Coralline Crag than does the rest of it, became (as did
 also the rest of the Red Crag south of Chillesford and Butley) con
 verted into land during the progress of the formation ; while at its
 northern or Butley extremity the sea encroached, and an estuary
 extending into East Norfolk was also formed ; during which geo
 graphical changes a change took place in the molluscan fauna, so
 that the latest part of the Red Crag proper and the earliest part of the
 fluvio-marine (both containing the northern species of mollusca and
 those peculiar forms only which occur in older glacial beds) alike
 pass up without break into the Chillesford sand and laminated clay,
 which form the uppermost member of the formation.                He also
 regards the principal river of this estuary as flowing into it from
 North Britain, through the shallow preglacial valley of chalk in
 which stands the town of Cromer, and in which the earlier beds of
  Stage II. accumulated in greatest thickness.       The forest and fresh
 water beds, which in this valley underlie the beds of Stage II., he
 regards as terrestrial equivalents of the Red Crag ; and having ob
  served rolled chalk interstratified with the base of the Chillesford
 clay in Easton-Bavent cliff, he considers this to show that so
  early as the commencement of this clay some tributary of the Crag
  river was entered by a glacier in the Chalk country, from which
 river-ice could raft away this material into the estuary.        He also
 regards the copious mica which this clay contains as evidence of ice-
  degradation in Scotland having contributed to the mud of this
 river.
     In Stage II. he traced the conversion of some of this laminated

            On the Newer Pliocene     Period in England.           383
clay, occupying sheet 49 and the north-east of sheet 50 of the Ord
nance    map, into land, the accumulation against the shore of this
land of thick shingle-beaches at Halesworth and Henham, and the
outspread of this in the form of seams and beds of shingle in a sand
originally (from its yielding shells in that region) called by him
the Bure-valley bed, and which Prof. Prestwich recognized under
the term " Westleton Shingle."       As the valley of the Crag river
subsided northwards as the conversion of this part of the Chil-
lesford clay into land occurred, there was let in from the direc
tion of the Baltic the shell Tellina balthica, which is not present in
the beds of Stage I. The formation thus beginning he traced south
wards nearly to the limit in that direction of the Chillesford clay
about Chillesford and Aldboro'.     The Cromer Till ho regards as the
modification of this formation by the advance of the Crag glaciers
into the sea or estuary where it was accumulated, such advance
having been due partly to this northerly subsidence, but mainly to
the increase of cold.     Then, after describing a persistent uncon
formity between this Till and the Contorted Drift, from the eastern
extremity of the Cromer cliff (but which does not appear in the
western) to its furthest southern limit, he showed how the great sub
mergence set in with this drift, increasing much southwards, but
 Btill more westward towards Wales. The effect of this was to sub
merge the area of Red Crag converted into land during Stage L, so
that the Contorted Drift lies upon it 50 feet thick, and to cause the
 retreat of the ice which had given rise to the Till to the slopes of
the Chalk Wold; whence masses of reconstructed            chalk were
brought by bergs that broke off from it and were imbedded by their
grounding in this drift, contorting it (and in those parts only) by
the process.    He then traced, in the form of gravels at great eleva
tions, the evidences of this submergence southwards and westwards,
 showing it to have increased greatly in both directions, but mostly
in the western ; and he connects these gravels with the Contorted
Drift by the additional evidence of one of these marl masses, in
which he found a pit excavated near the foot of Danbury Hill, in
 the London-clay country of South Essex, which hill is covered
 from base to top by this gravel. The gravel which thus covers
Danbury Hill, of which the summit has an elevation of 367 feet,
 rises in North Kent to upwards of 500 feet ; to between 400 and 500
 feet on the Neocomian within the Weald ; to 600 feet in North
 Hants (where it overlooks the Weald), and also in Wilts, Berks, and
 the adjoining parts of Bucks ; to 420 feet in South Hants ; to 540
 feet in Oxfordshire ; to 400 feet in Cornwall ; to upwards of 700
 (and perhaps 1000 and more) in the Cotteswolds ; to 1200 feet in
 Lancashire, and to 1340 feet in North Wales. Eastwards, through
 Kent towards France, the elevation falls, and in the north of
 France appears to be about 130 feet, whence northwards the evi
 dences of the submergence are furnished by the Campinian sands
 and the diluvium of North Germany and Holland.
    In Stage III. the author traced the rise from this depression, the
 increase of the ice from the greater snow-interception caused by it
 on the Pennine chain, and the consequent advance of the glacier- or
 land-ice.   This advance gave rise to the Chalky Clay, which was the

384                       Geological Society:  —
morainic mud-bank which, preceded this glacier, and was pushed by
it as it advanced, and the land rose partly into the shallow sea
(where it covered and protected for a time the gravel which was
 synchronously forming there), and partly onto the land ; and by
 the aid of maps he showed the islands that were overwhelmed by it.
 He then showed, by a line on a map, the limit up to which this ice,
 as it thickened, cut through and destroyed this first deposited mo
 raine and the gravel which it had covered, as well as such beds of
 Stage II. as were formed there, all this material being pushed on to
 add to later deposited moraine.        Outside this line the gravel, for
 the most part, remains undestroyed, its contents, particularly in
 the uppermost layers, showing that it was fed by the approaching
 moraine. By the level at which the junction of this gravel with
 the moraine clay occurs he traces the position of the sea-line at this
 time (towards the end of the formation), and finds it to rise along
 the south-eastern edge of the clay, from 40 feet in N.E. Suffolk
 to 160 feet in South Essex, and from that along the south-western
 edge to upwards of 350 feet in North Warwickshire and the parts
 of Northamptonshire adjoining, all this agreeing with the original
 increment of submergence in Stage II. He then showed, from evi
 dence afforded by the Yare and Gipping valleys, that this ice,
  ceasing to advance in East Anglia, shrunk into the valleys of that
 district, exposing the moraine it had previously laid down to the
 growth of vegetation, and issued only through these valleys to the
 sea.    The Hoxne palaeolithic brick-earth he regards as the deposit
 of a lagoon produced from the interception of the drainage of this
 surface by the glacier-tongue thus passing through the Waveney
 valley. The Brandon palaeolithic brick-earth he regards as connected
 with the same state of things.
     In Stage IV. he described the plateau and cannon-shot gravels
  of Norfolk as resulting from the washing-out of the morainic clay
  by the melting of this ice, which, though shrunken into the valleys
  of the East of Norfolk, still lay high and in mass in West Norfolk ;
  and showed that, by having regard to the different inclination of the
  land thus traced, the position of this gravel is reconcilable in no other
  way.     The cannon-shot part of it he attributed to the torrents
  pouring from this high-lying ice over the west side of the Wensum
  valley ; and the plateau gravels to the deposition of other parts of the
  same spoil carried into East Norfolk at the commencement of the
  process and while the ice had not thawed out of the valleys, this
  gravel afterwards, as the valley-ice thawed, being deposited in them.
  He also traced the excavation of the trough occupied by the Bain
   and Steeping rivers in Lincolnshire to the same cause.         The finer
  or sandy part of this material has an extensive spread in South
  west Norfolk, forming thick beds, and in a thinner form spreads
  over North-west Suffolk, where it wraps the denuded edges of the
  Hoxne and Brandon palaeolithic brick-earths.
      In Stage V. he traced the line of gravels that overlie the Chalky
   Clay where this clay entered the sea.      This entry to the sea over
  the Severn drainage-system      took place by way of the watershed
  between the Welland and Avon, and by the valley of the latter.
   Its entry into the sea over the Thames system was by way of the

             On the Newer Pliocene    Period in England.             385
watershed between this system and that of the great Ouse in South
Bucks, as well as by the valley of the Colne, Lea, and Boding, and
over the lower part of the watershed in South-east Essex.             It3
entry     into  the North  Sea was  by  the   valleys  of the Blackwater,
Gipping, and other Essex and Suffolk valleys, the entry by the Yare
and Waveney being far out beyond the present coast-line.          He also
traced, by similar evidence, the extent to which the sea entered the
Trent system after the ice vacated it.         This line of gravel (after
allowing for the case that the elevation of the junction of the gravel
beneath the clay represents that of the sea-bottom, while that over
the clay more nearly represents that of the sea-top), he showed to
 correspond with that of the junction of the gravel beneath the clay
 so far as this is not destroyed in the parts where the ice did not
 shrink into the valleys ; and it also agrees with this line, sup
 plemented by the amount of rise in the interval where the ice did
 so shrink.      Along the south-western edge of the clay this line of
 gravel, subsequent to the clay, falls from near 400 feet in Bucks
 to 150 feet in South Essex ; whence northwards along the south
 eastern edge it falls uniformly to Ordnance datum in central East
 Suffolk, and probably continued to fall to 100 feet or so further to
 the extreme point where the ice from the Tare valley entered the
 North Sea, far beyond the present coast. Along the north-western
 edge of the formation this line falls northwards in a corresponding
 way to that on the south-eastern edge, save that, starting there from
 near 350 feet, it does not fall below, if even quite down to, Ordnance
 datum near the Wash. He then traced the extent to which the sea
  on the west, deepening in that direction in accordance with the
 original depression of Stage II., entered the valleys of the area
  covered by the ice of the Chalky Clay as this vacated it ; the carrying
  out through the Wei] and and Avon valleys of the red and white
  chalk spoil of the Bain-Steeping trough, and its deposition in the
  Cotteswold gravel up to a high level, coming from the Avon system
  over the Gloucestershire water-parting into the valley of the Even-
  lode, a part of the Thames system.
      All river-gravels north of the point where the line of gravel over
  the clay sinks below Ordnance datum, he regards as concealed below
  the alluvium, and at depths proportional to the fall of that line.
  Examining in detail the grounds for the contrary opinion heretofore
  held by himself and by geologists in general, that the great sub
  mergence succeeded the principal glaciation of England, he rejected
   that opinion ; and no longer regarding the basement clay of Hol-
   derness (with its ancient molluscan facies) as identical with the
   Chalky Clay, but as moraine synchronous with the Till of Cromer, he
   considered the gravels with shells at extreme elevations in Lancashire
   to have preceded all glacial clays but these, and to have escaped
   destruction by the advance of the ice during the rise only at the south
   end of the western slope of the Pennine chain, those on the eastern
   having been wholly swept away, but that gravels were deposited
   on the east side of the Pennine after the dissolution of the Chalky -
   clay ice up to the reduced height of the sea-level at that time, and
   so far as the ice of the purple clay allowed the sea to come.        He
   then relinquished the opinion formerly held by him that the passage

386            Intelligence    and Miscellaneous     Articles.
of the Shap blocks was due to floating ico, and referred this to the land-
ice crossing the Pennine chain consequent upon greater snow-inter
ception from the progress of the rise : and to the same cause he
referred the drift which rises high on the eastern Blope of the Pennine
ridge north of the Aire. To this crossing of the ice having diverted
first a part and then the whole of the ice-supply of the Chalky-clay
 glacier, he attributed first the shrinking of that glacier into the
valleys in East Anglia, and afterwards its dissolution by the agencies
always rife in the Greenland ice (but which are there balanced by
continual reinforcement), when by this diversion its reinforcement
by ice from the Pennine chain ceased. The purple clay of Holderness,
being thus in its lowest part in Holderness coeval with the valley-
formed portion of the Chalky Clay of Norfolk and Suffolk (or "third
                " of
Boulder-clay          Harmer), was the moraine of this invading ice,
which, after crossing at Stainmoor, divided against the eastern
moorlands of Yorkshire; and one branch going north of these
moorlands through the valley of the Tees, sent off an arm down
their eastern flank, the moraine from which is the narrow belt of
purple clay which skirts the Yorkshire coast north of Holderness,
and spreads out wider in Holderness.           This arm from the Chalky-
clay  ice  not  having,   in  consequence   of  the westerly increment of
depression,  descended    the  eastern slope of  the Wolds, found sea then
 covering the basement clay of Holderness, in which sea it stopped
between the Humber and the Wash, by means of which the lower
part of the purple clay up to the level of about 150 feet, contains
intercalated in it beds of sand and gravel, and contains shells and
shell-fragments, as does the Lancashire clay similarly extruded
beneath the sea.       The other branch came south along the western
flank of the east moorlands and through the Vale of York, where it
ended, and became stationary in the sea as this entered the Trent
system on the final dissolution of the chalky- clay glacier.
    The author discovers no trace of any thing like the intercalation
of warm periods up to the stage with which he concludes this part
of his memoir ; and leaves the description of the later beds, as well
as an examination how far arboreal vegetation and the coexistence
of Pachyderms and Proboscideans can be reconciled with the con
tiguity of extensive land-ice, for the concluding part of it.

          NOTE ON SUPERNUMERARY RAINBOWS.              BY CH. MONTIQNY,
                 MEMBER OF THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF BELGIUM.
         " When a rainbow is very brilliant, there are often seen inside of
      the interior and outside of the exterior bow coloured bands, which
      are designated secondary, supplementary, or supernumerary bows :
      immediately after the violet, red is distinguished, then green and
      violet.   Sometimes    these colours are repeated several times in the
      same order along the inner margin of the principal bow ; they ap
      pear more rarely outside of the second bow." M. Daguin, from
      whom   I   borrow these statements, adds that the supernumerary
      bows are only seen in the culminating portions of ordinary rain
      bows, and only when the altitude of the latter is considerable ; no
      traces are seen of them near the horizon*.
          Kaemtz, in his Traite de Miteorologie, states the same particulars,
      from Langwith and other observers, who have never noticed supple
      mentary rainbows near the parts of the principal bow in the vicinity
      of the earth.
          Contrarily to these facts, I have recently had an opportunity of
      observing some supernumerary rainbows which were visible only at
      the lower extremities of the principal bow. The circumstances
      were, perhaps, exceptional ; but it is important to make them known.
          On the 30th of August last, after a rainy day,                  I
                                                              was with some
      other persons in the vicinity of Eochef ort a little before sunset. A
      few moments after a fresh shower of short duration we remarked
      in the east, in which direction the rain continued, two ordinary
      rainbows.     The colours of the principal bow lost some of their
      brightness in the lower regions of the air. These were sensibly
      darkened up to a certain height by a misty tinge, forming a broad
      zone perfectly distinct from the rain-cloud entirely above                           it,
      upon which the two bows appeared brighter. Moreover, at the
      inner side of each lower extremity of the inner bow, and conse
      quently near the ground, four supernumerary rainbows could be
      distinguished, which appeared to rise on each side into the misty
      zone of the air to about one third of the altitude of the inner bow.
      The colours of these eight supernumerary portions possessed but
      little brightness the red and dark violet were alone distinct.
                       :                  a                                               I
      observed no supplementary bow outside of the large bow.
         In this observation, which took place twenty minutes before the
      disappearance of the sun below the horizon, the production of super
      numerary bows at the extremities, and not at the culminating por
      tion, of the principal bowj constitutes      manifest exception to the
                                                      a
      facts hitherto observed.     This exception can be explained        the        by
ls"
      circumstances which accompanied the observation, as we shall see.

390           Intelligence and Miscellaneous   Articles.
   We know that Young, Arago, and Babinet attributed super
numerary rainbows to effects of diffraction.      Airy has developed
this theory by mathematical analysis. The results which he ob
tained have been verified by Miller with respect to bows of this
kind produced by the sun's rays meeting water-drops from        j  to ^
of a millimetre in diameter.
   According to this theory, the necessary condition for supernu
merary rainbows to be separated so as to be distinct is that the
effects of diffraction be produced by a great number of very small
and sensibly equal rain-drops.      The larger the drops become, the
more do the fringes diminish in breadth and the less distinct are
they. Thus is explained how it is that in ordinary cases supernu
merary bows are seen only in the upper regions, where the rain
drops are usually smallest — while they do not appear near the hori
zon, where the drops have become larger (Daguin).
   At the time of the observation of Aug. 30 the rain-clouds,
moving away from us towards the east, formed two distinct
layers : — the one, higher, on which appeared the upper portion of
the principal bow, destitute of supernumerary bows ; and the other,
appearing nearer to us, extending between the former and the misty
zone above mentioned, in front of which the four supernumerary
bows that bordered interiorly each extremity of the principal bow
seemed to be delineated.     Those cloud-arrangements are sometimes
exhibited during days of almost continual rain in hilly regions such
as that in which    I happened to be.
   If it be admitted that the drops of rain proceeding from the se
cond, relatively lower layer of clouds, when near the ground pre
sented still the minuteness necessary to the production of super
numerary bows, their having been seen at the two extremities of the
principal bow, near the ground, will be intelligible.    If, contrarily
to the facts hitherto observed, these bows were not distinct at the
upper part of the ordinary bow, it is because the rain-drops which
traversed the upper regions of the air, proceeding from clouds much
more elevated than those of the second layer, were doubtless large
enough to render impossible the effects of diffraction which pro
duce the supernumerary bows, the appearance of which is, more
over, often enough an exception.        Under these conditions the
effects of the phenomena of refraction and dispersion which pro
duce ordinary rainbows were alone visible in the higher regions of
the air. — Extrait des Bulletins de VAcademie Royale de Belgique,

         ON THE DETERMINATION        OF HIGH TEMPEEATTJBES.
          BY H. SAINTE-CLAIEE DEVILLE AND L. TBOOST.
   A certain number of chemists are at present engaged in the
more or less precise determination of elevated temperatures.         At
the meeting of the Academy on the 23rd September, 1878, one of
us in conjunction with M. Debray announced, in a Note upon the
dissociation of the oxides of the platinum group, that the measure
 ment of those temperatures had been accomplished by means of the

                   Intelligence and Miscellaneous            Articles.                  391
apparatus employed by us in 1863 (for determining the coefficient
of dilatation of porcelain), subsequently simplified by the employ
ment of a Sprengel pump, which permits us, as often as we wish
it, to take out and measure the thermometric material (nitrogen)
contained in the reservoir and to calculate the temperature.
   We have now to describe this method, which          manifestly more
                                                               is
expeditious than that (V. Regnault's manometric method) which
we formerly employed.
   A cylindrical vessel of Bayeux porcelain, having its two ends
spherical, and with capacity of at least 50 cubic centims., serves
                           a
as thermometric reservoir.      To this capillary tube
                                                    a         cemented,  is
likewise of porcelain, about 30 centims. in length. This apparatus
is cemented to     glass threeway cock, which puts

                                               of an   almost  capillary

   The desired temperature being attained, the flow of the oil                           is
determined so that the nitrogen neither dilates nor contracts any
more at that temperature. The fulfilment of this condition                               is
easily ascertained — because the cock carries           drying-apparatus

                                          is              tube which can
                                                                  a

temperature.

                                is

At that instant the leaden tube which joins the threeway cock to
the pump         completely emptied; turning the cock again, we

that which      would be at 0° and 760 millims.
                  it                                  If by preliminary
experiment we have determined the volume of nitrogen contained
in the reservoir at 0° and 760 millims., we have the principal ele
ment of the calculation of the temperature attained.
   But     will be noticed that in this apparatus there
          is it                                                     space      is   a

   In   order to make withaccuracy the correction due to this space,
¦we   join to the capillarytube another tube of exactly the same
length and the same diameter as the thermometer-stem. This tube,
which we have named compensator, is closed at one end ; it is
attached by means of mastic to a threeway cock, permitting it to
be put in communication successively with the outer air and with
the Sprengel pump. We close the cock of the compensator at the
same time as that of the reservoir of the thermometer ; and after
the exhaustion of the nitrogen contained in the latter, following
the same order of operations we determine the volume, reduced to
0° and 760 millims., of the gas contained in the compensator, and
consequently the volume of the prejudicial space. Deducting this
volume from that of the gas extracted from the thermometric reser
voir, we obtain exactly the quantity of nitrogen which remained in
the thermometer at the temperature reached.        With all these
numbers, introduced into a very simple formula,
                                                  '
                                1+cue       760
we have all that is necessary for calculating, with a high degree of
accuracy,  the temperature to be determined.
   We will only remark that the determination of the temperature
and pressure of the gases successively collected in the graduated
tube must be made with the greatest exactness.        All the precau
tions necessary for determining these numbers should be taken
with minute precision, following the most exact methods indicated
by Regnault.     A mode of connexion must also be adopted, between
the thermometer and the compensator on the one hand, and the
Sprengel pump on the other, such that the volume of the prejudi
cial space in the thermometer shall be precisely equal to the capa
city of the compensator. There are many means of satisfying this
condition ; and it is needless to describe them here.
   A drawing of the apparatus, together with the arrangements we
have adopted, will be given in a memoir which we shall publish in
the Annates de Vilcole Normale superieuref. — Oomptes Rendus de
V Academic des Sciences, March 29, 1880, t. xc. pp. 727-730.

have established (Comptes Rendus,   t.  lix. p. 169).
 t    We have merely to add that the Sprengel pump ought to be con
structed without the employment of caoutchouc, and that the vertical
tube which serves as pump should, in the part where the impact of mer
cury against mercury takes place, be furnished with tube of steel or plati

memoir by one of us and M. Mascart.

       relation
              as is
                   to pressure,     volume, and temperature, gases
                    well known, with a certain degree of approxi
mation, the laws of Mariotte and Gay-Lussac, which can in
common be expressed by the following equation —
                                  J»=BT,                              (1)
wherein    p represents the pressure, v the volume, and T the
absolute temperature, while R is a constant dependent on the
nature of the gas.       The further the gas in question is removed
from its condensation-point the closer is the approximation to
these laws.      With those gases which under ordinary circum
stances are so far from their condensation-point that, until
recently, their condensation could not be effected, and which
were therefore named permanent gases, the approximation is
so close that for a long time it was believed that they followed
these laws exactly, until Regnault, in his distinguished inves-
tigationsf, first demonstrated some slight deviations.            Some
                          J
what later, Natterer showed that on the application of very
powerful pressure very considerable deviations from Mariotte's
law are obtained ; and the deviations observed by him were

 394          Prof. R. Clausius on      the    Behaviour of Carbonic Acid
 of a different kind from those found by Regnault.     That is to
 say, while Eegnault    had found  that,  with all the gases ex
 amined by him, the pressure increases more slowly than the
 density, in Natterer's experiments it turned out that with very
 great pressure the case is reversed, and the pressure increases
 more quickly than the density : with air, nitrogen, and car
 bonic oxide gas the pressure already reached an amount of
 about 3000 atmospheres when the density had only become
 from 700 to 800 times that which exists under the pressure of
 one atmosphere.
    UpoiL.the causes on which these deviations of the gases
 from Mariotte's and Gay-Lussac's law depend, in my treatise-
 <rUeber die Art der Bewegung, welche wir Warme nennen"*,
 I expressed
   "
              myself as follows : —
     In order that the law of Mariotte and Gay-Lussac, and
the laws in connexion with               it,
                                   may strictly hold good, the gas
must,  as  regards its molecular   state, satisfy the following con
ditions —
   "
              :
     (1) The space actually filled by the molecules of the gas
must be vanishingly little in comparison with the entire space
taken up by the gas.
   "
     (2) The time of       collision
                              a          e. the time required by
                                                 (t.                              a
molecule, when       strikes against another molecule or solid
                         it                                              a
obstacle, in order to alter its motion in the manner in which
it    altered by the collision) must, in comparison with the
       is
time which elapses between two collisions, be vanishingly
short.
      "
    (3) The influence of the molecular forces must be vanish
ingly little. This implies two things. In the first place,                   it   is
required that the force with which all the molecules at their
mean distances attract each other vanish in comparison with
the expansive force arising from the motion.        But the mole
cules are not always at their mean distances from one another                     ;
often in the course of the motion one molecule comes into the
immediate vicinity of another or of        solid obstacle likewise
                                                        a
consisting of operative molecules      and at such moments the
                                                ;
molecular forces of course come into action.     Hence the second
requirement      that
                    is those parts  of   the path described by                    a
molecule   on  which the molecular forces have an influence,
perceptibly altering the motion of the molecule in direction and
velocity, vanish when compared with the portions of the path
on which the forces can be regarded as inoperative.
      "If
        these conditions are not fulfilled, deviations in various^
directions from the simple law of the gases take place^-wEch

      in relation   to   Pressure, Volume, and Temperature.                      395
become so much the more considerable as the molecular state
 of the gas corresponds less to these conditions."
    The deviations here mentioned must make themselves mani
 fest, so far as the pressure is considered at a given tempera
ture and a given volume, in this being either greater or less
than it should be, according to Mariotte and Gay-Lussac's
law, taking as the starting-point the highly rarefied state of
the gas. The space above-mentioned (under 1) actually filled
by the molecules conditions an augmentation of the pressure,
since by  it,  at given volume of the gas, the free space for the
                a
motion of the molecules          lessened, and accordingly the num
                                is
ber of the collisions      increased.
                          is               The molecular forces men
tioned under    3  effect, when attraction prevails,        diminution  a
of the pressure. The circumstance mentioned under namely                    2,
the time that passes during          collision, has a more complicated
                                     a
effect, since,  when   two   molecules     rush against one another,
first an acceleration, and only after this the retardation and
reversal of the motion take place            hence, in considering the
                                               ;
total effect, that of this circumstance can be joined partly to
that of the first, partly to that of the last circumstance.
    Of the two opposite effects of augmentation and diminution
of pressure, the one or the other may preponderate, according
to circumstances.       The above-mentioned experiments of Reg-
nault and batterer show in hydrogen                universal preponde
                                                       a
rance of the increase of pressure, while they make known that
in the other gases diminution of pressure predominates when
the densities are less, and increase of pressure when the den
sities are greater.
    The behaviour of substance becomes still more complicated
                         a
when on condensation           does not still remain gaseous, but
                               it
changes   its  aggregate-state by becoming liquid.         On the con
nexion of this process with those previously discussed some
very fine experiments have recently been made by Andrews*.
Submitting carbonic acid at various temperatures to powerful
compressions, and observing the increases of pressure that took
place, he found that there          an essential difference in its be
                                     is
haviour, according      as the  temperature        above or below 31°.
                                                           is
Above 3l°, only the above-mentioned deviations from Mariotte
and Gay-Lussac's law are shown, while below 31° at              certain     a
pressure condensation takes place.
   Andrews represents the relations between pressure and
volume observed by him by curves which have pressure and
volume as abscissae and ordinates.            The curves referring to
temperatures above 31° exhibit              continuous course

those referring to temperatures below 31° are broken, as with
diminishing volume the pressure at first increases, but from                      a

certain volume onwards, at which condensation begins, subse
quent diminution of volume takes place without increase of
pressure, and only when the volume has become much smaller
and the entire mass is liquid, does the pressure again com
mence to increase as the volume is diminished, the increase
tben being rapid.     The portion of the curve corresponding to
the occurrence of condensation is a straight line, met at both
ends by the continuously curved portions of the curve.           A
slight curvature delineated by Andrews at one extremity of
 the straight line appears to depend on a slight mixture of air,
 and hence may here be left out of consideration.
    Two years afterwards James Thomson*, whose ingenious
speculations have already so much contributed to the enlarge
ment of mechanical and physical science, supplemented An
drews's curves by adding, at the places where in them a
straight line is found, a curved line which joins on to the two
 curved portions of the curve given by Andrews in a conti
nuous manner and represents a gradual transition from the
gaseous to the liquid state, in which the entire quantity of the
 substance is found continuously in a similar state — a kind of
transition which is theoretically thinkable, but cannot actu
ally occur, because it contains intermediate states in which
 no stable, but only unstable, equilibrium exists.       In fig. 1

      Andrews's figure is reproduced with Thomson's supplementary-
      curves added, drawn in dotted lines ; only the external
      arrangement of the figure is altered, in a way first brought
      into use by Maxwell.             Namely, Andrews represented in his
      figure     the   pressures by the abscissae, and the volumes by
      the ordinates ; but it is now customary, in the mechanical
      theory of heat, to represent the volumes by the abscissae and
      the pressures by the ordinates, and the figure is redrawn in
      accordance therewith.
         In the curves belonging to the temperatures 130,1 and
      21°*5, a e and fk are the above-mentioned                  straight lines cor
      responding to the occurrence of condensation, which J. Thom
      son has replaced by the dotted curved lines abcde and
     fghih.
         J.   Thomson drew his conclusion respecting the form of
      these lines merely from the form of Andrews's curves belong
      ing to the higher temperatures — tracing how these latter gra
      dually change as they approach toward the temperature 31°,
     and then continuing the same kind of change below 31°.
      Upon an investigation of the reasons for this peculiar confor
      mation of the pressure-curves, and the formation of a mathe
      matical expression corresponding to them, he did not enter.
         As regards the latter point (the mathematical treatment of
      the subject), attempts have been made by various authors,
      some before and some since Andrews's experimental investi
      gation, to express the deviations of the gases from Mariotte
      and Gay-Lussac's law by an equation.
         Eankine* constructed an equation in place of (1), with
      which also an equation derived by Sir W. Thomson and Joule t
      from their experiments on the changes of temperature that
      take place during the expansion of gases very closely agrees,
      and which in its simplest form can be written thus,
               ¦   •       •    ¦

          Hirnf      effected upon equation (1) a transformation, in
      which the two above-mentioned circumstances that preemi
      nently occasion deviation by gases from the law of Mariotte
       and Gay-Lussac, namely the volume of the molecules and

400    Prof. R. Clausius on   the   Behaviour of Carbonic Acid
homogeneity of the motion would be admissible in considering
only the ideal state, which we call the perfect state of a gas ;
but when we have to investigate the deviations of a gas
from the perfect state, that assumption appears to me to be
inadmissible.
   I   will not here advance any definite theory about the way
in which the motion changes when a gas leaves the perfect
state ; but I   will take leave to adduce a mode of alteration as
at least a possible one.     For the perfect gaseous state it may
be assumed that every two molecules that rush together sepa
 rate again after the collision.   On the contrary, when the gas
 is condensed to liquidity, a quite different behaviour takes
 place : namely, the molecules are in general held together by
 their mutual attraction ; and only exceptionally, on a specially
 favourable coincidence of the phases of motion, do individual
 molecules separate themselves from the rest of the mass. Now,
 between these two extreme cases one can well imagine an in
 termediate state of this kind: — As a rule, indeed, the molecules
 separate again after the collision ; but it sometimes happens
 that two molecules after meeting do not again separate, but
 only oscillate about one another while carrying out the pro
 gressive motion in common, until, by the change that takes
 place in the motion on further collision, the separation is again
 occasioned.    The number of such pairs of attached molecules
 would then become so much the greater the lower the tempe
 rature (and hence the less the mean vis viva of the motion)
 became ; and on a further fall of the temperature there might
 supervene instances of not merely two, but several molecules
 holding together and executing as groups the progressive
 motion in common.
     If such a behaviour occurred, the mean strength of the mu
 tual attraction of the molecules would be thereby increased,
  since the molecules remaining united would of course, on
 account of the greater nearness, attract one another more
  strongly ; and, accordingly, it would not be allowable to regard
  the quantity which represents in tlie formula the mutual attrac
 tion of the molecules as independent of the temperature, but one
 would be obliged to admit that it becomes greater with falling
temperature.
   Van der Waals has, further, from theoretical considerations,
drawn the conclusion, also already expressed by others in their
formulae, that the decrease of pressure conditioned by the
mutual attraction of the molecules is inversely proportional to
the square of the volume.    It may be granted that for larger
volumes this conclusion is approximately correct ; and yet no
universal and rigorous validity need be ascribed to     but one
                                                        it,

may assume that from it also a deviation takes place which
becomes the greater the smaller the volume becomes.
          I
   Now have tried to construct for p a formula which retains
what appears to me to be correct in previous formula?, but at
the same time makes allowance for the above-mentioned mo
difying circumstances, and, while as simple as possible, is in
satisfactory accordance with both the older and the newer ob
servations of Andrews, as well as with the other extant obser
vations. This, on account of a peculiar circumstance, is beset
with great difficulties. The formula to be formed for p has,
as may be seen even from the equations (2), (3), (4), and (5)
when solved with respect to p, the peculiarity that it is the
difference of two quantities which may both have much higher
values than p.    The effect of this   that inaccuracies which
                                                 is,
in proportion to the two single quantities are but little may
yet inp   produce deviations from experiment considerable in
comparison with its value, and therefore each single quantity
must be so much the more precisely determined.

402     Prof. R. Clausius on            the  Behaviour of Carbonic Acid
    In order to test the accordance of this formula with experi
ment,   I  selected for comparison the three newer series of obser
vations made by Andrews which relate to the temperatures 60,5,
64°, and 100°, and three of the older series, referring to the
temperatures lb>0,l, 310-1, and 48°*1.                   In each of these series,
I  selected for consideration, out of the volumes therein occur
ring, a number which are distributed as equally as possible
over the entire interval of observation.                     I have, however, to
remark that Andrews has not so expressed the volumes that
all the numbers have one and the same unit for a base, but
with each temperature he has taken as unit that volume which
the carbonic acid, under the pressure of one atmosphere, occu
pies at that temperature.             The volume thus expressed he de
signates by e.          In order to calculate from this the volume we
designate by v (which has for its fundamental unit the volume
occupied by the carbonic acid at the freezing-point under the
pressure of one atmosphere), we must know the coefficient of
expansion of carbonic acid under atmospheric pressure.                          For
this the value found by Regnault, O00371, and which Andrews
used in his calculations, is employed.
    The values thus obtained of v are, together with the respec
tive temperatures, inserted in the formula, and then from these
the values of p belonging to them calculated.                          These values
are designated in the following Tables by "p (calc.);" and
below them are the corresponding observed values, designated
by "p (obs.)."            A denotes the differences between the ob
served and the calculated values of p.                        At each series it is
stated whether it belongs to the older or the newer series of
Andrews's observations.

   From these Tables it is evident that there is in general a
satisfactory, and in part a strikingly good accordance between
the values of p calculated from the formula and those observed;
nevertheless, at the greatest densities of carbonic acid reached
in the experiments, amounting to four or five hundred times
the densities occurring under the pressure of one atmosphere,
considerable differences are met with.                  These at first induced
me to undertake another modification of the formula, by intro
ducing into the second term a temperature-function as a factor
in order to balance the differences.                  Through this, however,
the formula lost its simplicity ; and the question arose whether

  404     Prof. R. Clausius on      the BeJiaviour of Carbonic Acid
  these differences were really of so much importance as to jus
  tify such an alteration of the formula. This question, upon
  closer consideration of the matter, 1 believed must be answered
  in the negative.
      For the differences change their signs in quite a striking
  manner : at 13°'l the greatest difference is negative, at
  310,1 positive, at 64° negative, and at 100° again positive.
  So frequent a change of sign does not make for the suppo
  sition that the cause of the differences lies in the formula, but
  rather that it is to be sought in errors of observation; and in
 the case in question such errors are very well conceivable, even
 with the most careful observation.          The volume of the highly
  condensed carbonic acid was measured in capillary tubes.
 Now, when it had become so small as to amount to only one
 four- or five-hundredth part of its original magnitude, errors
 might easily occur in the reading, which, though absolutely
 very small, were relatively great enough to cause, in the for
 mula for p, of which the value very rapidly changes with v
 when the values of v are small, differences from the quantities
 in the Table.
     Besides, the air-manometer used for the determination of
 the pressure consisted of a capillary tube, in which the air,
 when the greatest pressures occurred, occupied volumes so
 small that a slight error of observation must have exerted a
 very great influence upon the pressure deduced from the ob
 servation.
     Further, it is to be remarked that Andrews, in deducing the
 pressure from the data supplied by the air-manometer, started
 from the hypothesis that air follows Mariotte's law up to the
 greatest pressures employed in the experiments, which reached
 more than 200 atmospheres.              But this, it is well known, is
 not the case ; at such pressures considerable deviations take
 place.    I  at first tried to take advantage of the observations
 of Cailletet and Amagat on the compression of nitrogen, in
 order to correct the pressure-quantities deduced from the ma
 nometer-indications ; but        I   found that the results of their
 observations are not sufficiently accordant with each other to
 be employed with safety for such a correction.           Hence  I have
 simply quoted in the Tables Andrews's values of p.
     Lastly,  I must call attention to a peculiar distinction which
 appears   in  the  differences between the observed and the cal
culated values of p : namely, in the older series the differences
are almost all positive, and in the newer almost all negative.
This also makes for the hypothesis that the differences origi
nate rather in the circumstances            affecting the experiments
than in the formula.

      in relation  to Pressure, Volume, and Temperature.         405
    For all these reasons it must be concluded that some un
certainty still attaches to the highest observed values of p ;
and consequently accordance between the calculated and the
observed values must not be too strictly insisted on.        I there
fore abandoned the above-mentioned complicating alteration
of the formula, and reverted to its original and most simple
form, which seems to me, not only in respect of practice, but
of theory also, to deserve preference.
    By rather laborious calculations     I  so determined the con
stants of the formula that the resulting values of p agreed as
well as possible with both the newer and the older results of
observation obtained by Andrews, and that, of the differences
remaining at high densities of the carbonic acid, about as
many are positive as negative.        With these values of the con
stants there is also a satisfactory accordance with Regnault's
results of observation, which in regard to the condensation of
 carbonic acid do not extend so far, by a long way, as those of
 Andrews.      I therefore think that these values of the constants
 correspond   with    sufficient accuracy to the stock of observa
 tions at present existing, which is more complete as regards
 carbonic acid than with respect to any other gas.
    To the other gases the general equation (7) can, in my
 opinion, be applied ; but of course the constants must be de
 termined for each gas.
    In connexion with the foregoing another question must be
 discussed, which forces itself upon us in the consideration of
 the curves drawn by Andrews and completed by James
 Thomson.
    When a gas, e. g. carbonic acid, is compressed at a tempe
 rature below the critical temperature, at a certain volume
 condensation begins ; and therewith a state enters in which
 one portion of the substance is liquid and the other gaseous.
 As long as this state continues, with the further diminution
 of the volume the pressure remains constant, and the corre
 sponding part of the isothermal pressure-curve is consequently
 a horizontal straight line.      Beside this straight line, one can
 imagine, as was discussed above, according to James Thomson,
 another isothermal pressure-curve, representing that pressure
 which would take place at the same change of volume if this
 proceeded in such wise that constantly the entire quantity of
 the substance was in the same state.          Although this latter
 kind of change of volume does not really take place, because
 the states of equilibrium occurring in it are in part unstable,
 yet it must be regarded as theoretically possible ; and, in fact,
 the latter pressure-curve represents the pressure determined
 by our formula.

    But now comes the question, In what position do this theo
 retical pressure-curve and the horizontal straight line corre
 sponding to the actual process stand to each other ?
    James Thomson has expressed no opinion upon                   but has
                                                                 it,
 only,  in Andrews's    figure (reproduced     in fig. 1),   added  to the
 pressurve-curves referring to the temperatures         130,1   and 21°*5
 the curve-portions there drawn in dotted lines.              These were
 probably only intended to give rough idea of the possible
                                        a
 form and position of the portions of the curves.            In that form
 they  cannot   be accepted   as really  correct.
    Maxwell, in the first edition of his Theory of Heat,' p. 125,
                                            '
 goes into the matter more closely.         If one of the theoretical
 continuous pressure-curves, e. g. that belonging to the tem
perature 130,1, be imagined to be given, and            ifthe horizontal
straight   line be  drawn  at  different  heights,  two   points a and      e
are always obtained as the extreme points of the straight line.
The difference between the two values possessed by the energy
of the substance in the states corresponding to those two
points differs in magnitude for the different positions of the
straight line. Now, says Maxwell, that position of the straight
line at which this difference    is    maximum         the correct one.
                                                    is is

In the fourth edition, however, the passage             altered and the
position of the straight line left undetermined. It must there
fore be assumed that Maxwell afterwards relinquished his pre
vious view on this point.
    Van der "Waals says (in p. 121 loc. cit.), " have not suc
                                                     I
ceeded in finding in any of the properties of saturated vapour
a  characteristic by which      it  could be determined where the
 [straight] line must be drawn through the isotherms."
   After this the question what position the horizontal straight
line giving the pressure of saturated vapour has in the iso
thermal pressure-curve may well be regarded as still an open
one and
    ;     I     wish to be permitted to communicate here the
answer to this question which has presented itself to me on
consideration of the subject.
    When the pressure-curve drawn by Andrews and com
pleted by James Thomson for the temperature of 130-1,                  ex
                                                                       is
amined,  it      seen to be single from m to a and again from
              it is
                                                                            e
to n, while         double between a and e.
                      is                             Between the two
states of the substance corresponding to the points a and            (and
                                                                       e
which we will briefly name states a and            e) there are conse
quently two ways in which the substance can pass out of the
one into the other.      The transition can take place on both of
these paths, under perfectly similar circunlstances, in the direc
tion from a to        and also in the direction from
                           e                                 e to a    the
                                                                       ;
respective    changes are therefore both        to be designated as re
versible.

     in relation   to   Pressure, Volume, and Temperature.       407
   Now, if we imagine the substance making the transition
from a to e along the path represented by the curve abode,
and returning from e to a along the path represented by the
straight line e a, we have a reversible cyclical process. Hence,
for the positive or negative quantity of heat communicated
from without to the changing substance in the course of this
process, an element of which may be called dQ, the well-known
equation
must hold good.     And since in the present case the tempera
ture T is constant, and the lines which graphically represent
the cyclical process are only isothermal lines for one and the
same temperature, the equation simplifies itself into
                               jcZQ = 0.
Therefore the positive and negative quantities of heat commu
nicated to the substance eliminate one another.
   It hence follows, further, that the positive and negative
parts of the external work done during the cyclical process
must also counterbalance one another.       The excesses of the
positive  work  over the negative belonging to the two sections
of the cyclical process are represented by the areas occurring
in the figure : the area cdec above the straight line represents
a positive, and the area abca beneath the same line a nega
tive excess. Consequently these two areas must, in order to
give 0 for the value of the total work, be equal the one to the
other.   Hereby, when the theoretical pressure-curve corre
sponding to the homogeneous state is given, the position of
the horizontal straight line answering to the actual processes
of vaporization and condensation is also determined.
   The foregoing condition can be expressed as a proposition
thus: — The pressure of the saturated vapour is so great that the
external loork performed at the vaporization is equal to that
which would be performed         if,
                                 the increase    volume being the
                                                      of
same, the substance remained homogeneous.     This can also be put
still more briefly thus: — The pressure     the saturated vapour
                                                of
is equal to the mean pressure     the substance remaining homo
                                   of
geneous  while receiving an increase    volume corresponding to
                                           of
complete vaporization.

LIII.     The use  of Silver Films in improved Instruments of the
         Camera-Lucida Class.          By John 0. Douglas*.
               instruments are divisible into two classes, viz. : —
THESE   that in which a reflected image of the object is seen
while the tracing-point is seen direct; and the other class, in
which the object or tracing is seen by reflection, but the tra
cing-point or object is seen by light transmitted through a
plate which acts at the same time as a reflector.
    The forms in most common use are the camera lucida and
the steel disk or Soemmering's mirror (of the first class), and
the parallel plate or tinted glass reflector (of the second class).
There are other forms, less common, but each referable to one
of the two classes described above. Instruments of the first
class give a brilliant and well-defined reflected image ; but
they are fatiguing to use, and some persons experience great
difficulty in using them.         Instruments on the other principle
are far more easily used, they cause less fatigue ; but the re
flected image is not so brilliant.       In the case of the plane glass
reflector the definition cannot be so good, as both surfaces of
the glass reflect, and there are therefore two superimposed
images which do not exactly coincide ; the second reflection,
however, is weakened by using tinted glass ; and this colour
ing also serves to reduce the transmitted light, which would
otherwise flood out the weak reflected image.
    What is required in an instrument of this kind is the bril
liancy and clear definition of the camera lucida, combined
with the simplicity and ease in use and the cheapness of the
tinted plane glass reflector, with facility, where desired, for
using two reflections in order that the reflected image may not
be reversed.
    I believe these requirements are attainable by the use of
silver films on glass.      Silver films are so highly reflective that
two or more successive reflections may be used if desired ; by
transmitted light the colour of the film is suitable for tinting
the glass.    The thickness of the film maybe regulated accord
ing to requirements — a thick film being used when reflection
only is required, and a thinner one according to the ratio de
sired between the reflected and transmitted light.            The reflec
tive power of the thinnest film is greatly superior to that of
glass.     The silver film is applicable to most forms in use, and
it may be used not only on plane but on curved surfaces : e. g.

410       Mr.   J.   0. Douglas on   the use   of Silver Films in
a plane concave lens silvered on the plane side might be used
by a shorted-sighted person instead of the common plane re
  flector used in sketching microscopic objects ; a slight curva
  ture of the first or second reflecting surface in the camera
  lucida might be used to render it unnecessary to employ a lens
  to equalize the sensibly different distances of the images of the
  object and plane of delineation.     The cost of silver films on
  glass is very trifling ; and if taken care of they last for years.
  A number might be made at intervals ; or they might be sup
  plied for a trifling sum by the opticians.
     For many purposes the films might be deposited on thin
  glass and varnished, or protected by glass, when they would
  be very durable and would bear handling.       For some purposes
  the film might be thickened by electro-deposition and removed
  from the glass. As the films are so cheap, a number of gra
  duated thicknesses might be kept, and a suitable one selected
  in each case to adjust the relative brilliancies of the reflected
  and transmitted light ; or the films might be applied as the
 dark glasses usually supplied with the camera lucida : but this
 seems less simple and convenient than the use of a thicker or
 thinner film as transmitting reflector.     A silver surface may
 reflect upwards of 90 per cent, of the incident light ; a total
 reflecting prism has been found to reflect only about 75 per
 cent, or less, the loss being due to reflection at the first sur
 face and absorption ; the superiority of the silver surface is
 evident, particularly where several successive reflections are
 required.     Even if the highest attainable brilliancy be not
 generally required, still the higher this is the greater the range
 of adjustment without alteration of the source of light. The
 strictest regularity in the film not being essential, suitable
 films are very readily obtained.     With strict cleanliness, pure
 chemicals, care that the glass is wetted equally in every part
 by water or alcohol at the moment of immersion in the silver
ing solution, and care that the solution is properly mixed        e.     (i.
homogeneous),       success isreadily attained.
I      find* that Professor Govi, of Rome, has devised         form  a
of camera lucida in which       metallic film
                                 a               used.
                                                   is    He simply
gilds the reflecting surface of the camera-lucida prism with                   a
thin film of gold, and cements to this surface with Canada
balsam another similar prism.         M. Nachet has adopted this
improvement in the construction of various forms of camera
lucida.
    The greater advantages of the silver film are obvious.       By
the use of silvered glass, instruments of various forms and
of large size may be readily constructed for a trifling sum

by any ingenious person ; thus an instrument may be de
vised and readily constructed for any special purpose.         The
following is a description of the instruments exhibited at the
meeting: —
     (1) An ordinary tinted glass reflector for use with the mi
croscope.       The tinted glass usually used was replaced by a
piece of glass covered with a thin film of silver. The silvered
side is turned towards the eyepiece and reflects the magnified
image. In this form several reflectors, differing in the thick
ness of the silver film, should be available for regulating the
ratio between the transmitted and reflected light ; but a cer
tain thickness of film will be found which is applicable to most
purposes ; so that change of reflector is seldom necessary.
    ( 2 ) Camera lucida with double
reflection (fig. 1). The first re                  Fig. 1.
flection is from a thick film of
 silver ; the second is from a
thinner film. The thickness of
 the second film may be adjusted
 as described     above.   It will be
 seen that the plane of delinea
 tion is seen through the second
 reflector, not past it as in the
 ordinary instrument.         In the
 diagrams     the thick oblique lines
 are the silver films, the thin
 lines the directions of the light ;
 the arrows the object, and the dotted line the paper on which
 the object is to be drawn.
     (3) A form of reflecting camera for sketching microscopic
 objects (fig. 2).    This instrument            Fig. 2.
 being fitted to the eyepiece of the
 microscope, the paper and pencil-
 point under the larger reflector
 appear in the field of the micro
 scope.      The object is seen direct.
 The second mirror in the instru-
 mentexhibited was aninchsquare.
 This instrument may be used with
 the body of the microscope at any
  angle, it being merely necessary to place the drawing-paper
  in a plane parallel with that of the microscope-stage.     In the
  figures 2 and 3 the mirrors are represented as parallel ; they
  should usually be inclined to each other, to increase the dis
  tance between the plane of delineation and the object.

                                    ^
  from the paper; the field
  was about 4£ in. square.
  This instrument may be
  used horizontal or in
  clined ; and it is admi
  rably adapted for draw-
                                 <
  ingsuchobjectsasinsects,
  leaves, shells, &c.     If the vertical distances between the mir
  rors and the object and paper respectively be constant, in in
  struments of this form the relative magnitudes of object and
  drawing will obviously vary with the distance between the
  reflectors.    It is evident that by the use of reflectors in instru
  ments of this class, the reflecting surfaces may be larger and
  the distance between them greater than if a prism were used.
  The above are only examples of the application of silver films
  to a particular class of instruments ; it is evident that they
  offer great facility for giving this class of instruments its
  maximum development.           It is obvious also that silver films
  are applicable with advantage in many other cases where
  prisms are used at present, particularly where it is desired to
  divide a beam of light into two ; e. g. if fig. 3 be turned up-
, side down and the two eyes of the observer be in the place of
  the arrow and the dotted line, the diagram represents an
  arrangement suitable for a non-stereoscopic binocular micro
  scope, the inclination between the mirrors being varied to suit
   the distance between the eyes.        The loss of light in such an
  arrangement would be very little ; and the brilliancy of the two
   images might be rendered very nearly equal.              To illustrate
   how cheaply such instruments may be made, the mirrors in
   the instruments exhibited were mounted in tubes of thin sheet
   zinc, which is readily cut with ordinary scissors and bent into
   shape with pliers ; a coat of asphalt varnish used for making
   shallow cells was applied for the sake of appearance.
      The instrument, fig. 2, was fastened to the eyepiece by a
  piece of zinc bent half round the eyepiece-tube,             and held
  against it by a small elastic rubber band.         The tinted reflector
  was supported by a bent plate of zinc, hung on the milled edge
   of the eyepiece by a groove passing almost half round the
  eyepiece : this is a most convenient method of attaching the
  reflector or camera to the eyepiece, as it is quite firm enough,
  and yet removable in an instant without disturbing the micro
   scope.

     Note. — Silver films might possibly       be found useful in the
  construction of illuminating apparatus for the microscope.          If
  well varnished, they might well replace the usual mercurial
  reflecting surface used in illuminating-mirrors, as the mercurial

                 LIY.     On the Diffusion   of Liquids.
        By John H. Long, of Lawrence, Kansas, U. S. A.
                         [Concluded from p. 329.]
         the above I have explained the general workings of the
  IN method       and discussed its chief sources of error.          It
 remains now to mention several other causes of error.           From
 the tables given it is seen that the amounts diffused undergo
 slight fluctuations from time to time.           Various causes can
 he assigned for this.         The temperature undergoing slight
 changes has its effect, of course, in producing currents in the
 solutions, besides changing for the time being their rates of
 diffusion.    Other disturbing currents are produced when, by
 any cause, the diffusion-vessels are jarred, as when, for instance,
 a door in their vicinity is rapidly closed.         In order to avoid
 another source of error, it is to be observed, of course, that the
 table upon which the vessels stand be horizontal, in order that
 g h be parallel to ef.
     I turn now to the experiments relating to the comparison
 of different salts as to their rates of diffusion — the real object of
 the investigation.       This necessitated the performance of a
 great number of single experiments ; and in order that the
 results of these be comparable, it was necessary that the con
 ditions be in all cases the same. This end could be attained,
 of course, by diffusing all the salts, one after the other, from
 the same tube, observing the above-mentioned points regard
 ing concentration &c. But to carry the investigation out in
 this way would require a very long time.           The only alterna
 tive was to make use of a larger number of diffusion-tubes ;
            I
 and this did. Twelve tubes and beakers, having as nearly
 as possible the same dimensions and of the form represented
 in fig. 1, were obtained, and compared by filling them with
 2n NaCl solution and observing the amounts diffused in equal
 times, the velocity of the water being in all cases 40 cubic
 centims.     Some of these tubes were almost immediately re
jected   : in one the section of i had been left elliptical instead
 of circular by the glassblowcr ; in another the point b was too
 small and did not allow the water to pass through fast enough ;

414                   Dr.   J.   H. Long on   the
 and a third was rejected for still another cause. After a num
ber of trials six were found which gave constant results, and
 diffused amounts of salt in equal times proportional to 17, 18,
 17, 17, 17, 17.   Of course these rates were subject to slight
fluctuations ; but the averages for any length of time were
constant.     In searching for the cause of the larger amount
diffused from the tube No. 2, it was found that in it i was
slightly shorter than in the others.      A normal NaCI solution
                                              f
stood in the six tubes at the height e when the velocity of
the water was 40 cubic centims.        The exact dimensions of the
tubes are as follows — the internal diameter of arst 1*5 mil-
lim., the diameter at b 1 millim., the diameter of i 14*5 mil-
lims., the distance ge 11 millims., and the distance gk 15
millims.     The beaker-glasses, when filled to the level a b, con
tained 240 cubic centims.          All the experiments described
below were performed with these six tubes, and those with the
coloured solutions above also.       The other experiments cited
above were performed with other tubes having slightly differ
ent dimensions.      In these the part i had a slightly greater
diameter (about 16 millims.) and was somewhat shorter.
    At the beginning of the series of experiments given below
each tube was filled with a different salt-solution ; but this
plan was soon abandoned, and two salts were then diffused
simultaneously — that    is, in three of the glasses solution of
                                                        a
one salt, and in the other three      a solution of the other.       In
some cases the amounts diffused from each of the three glasses
of each set were determined separately; and in other cases (with
the nitrates and sulphates always) the amounts from the three
tubes of each set were determined together.       The values given
below are in all cases the averages reduced for one cell.
    The amount given by tube No.         was first reduced to the
                                          2
standard of the other five.
    The velocity of the water was maintained constant at 40
cubic centims.; and the temperature of the room was 14°-16° C.
As explained above, after filling the tubes, about 48 hours
were allowed to elapse before the determinations of the diffused
salt were commenced.       The appearance of the diffusion-cells
as they stood when in operation      isshown in fig.    3 (PI. VII.).
    The Mariotte bottles held in some cases         8 litres, and in
others 4.    The latter are here represented.
    The salts made use of were in most cases obtained quite
pure in other cases
      ;                  it was necessary to purify them myself
(LiCl, LiN03 for instance). Where possible, the solutions
were made by weighing out the required number of grammes
of dry or well-crystallized salt and dissolving this in        a  litre
of water. The strength of this solution was then afterwards

determined       control.
                as a        In the case of some few salts (CaCl2
for instance) only the latter method could be well applied.
   The first experiments were on solutions of the chlorides ;
and the diffused amounts were determined by means of
^ AgN03        with K2 Cr04      as   indicator.         The burettes        were fur
nished with Erdmann's floats, and their accuracy tested by
comparing them with a standard.
   The results of the experiments are as follows : —

    The last value can be considered only an approximation
to the truth, as the cyanide contained a little cyanate, and,

                           Diffusion of Nitrates.
    The first difficulty in connexion with these salts was the
accurate determination of the small amounts diffused.                      This
was finally accomplished, however, by means of the " Marx
                                                                              "
method, which, as is well known, depends on the decoloration
of a solution of indigo by free HN03.
    An indigo solution was prepared as recommended by Marx*,
and was of such strength that 8 cubic centims. corresponded
to 1 milligram N03.            The liquid containing diffused salt was
evaporated to a small volume and 25 cubic centims. taken.
To this were added 50 cubic centims. concentrated H2 S04, and
the indigo was run in immediately from a burette.                    If   more
than 30    cubic   centims.    of this were required, the operation was
repeated with a weaker liquid.              By means of this preliminary
titration it was possible to determine approximately the amount
of N03 in the solution to be examined.              This should not contain
more   than   4 or  5  milligrams     in 25 cubic   centims.    The first test
was soon found to be unnecessary, however, as a few titra
tions showed about how much salt was to be expected for a
certain number of hours.                Then, by making two titrations,
the first a near approximation, it was possible to obtain pretty
accurate results.       Enough solution was always taken to require
from 30 to 50 cubic centims. indigo solution. Observing these
precautions, the following experiments were made: —

series of experiments gave '0025 gram per hour. The mean

and
               0.0353 gram          LiNO, in      24 hours.
   This LiNOs was prepared from Mg-free Li, CO3. This was
digested a number of times with hot water, and after filtering
and drying was found to contain but the merest traces of
Na2CO3, as shown by the spectroscope.      The Li, COs was
then converted into nitrate.
                      Diffusion of Sulphates.
  Six different   salts    of this class, each in        º   solution, were    in
vestigated as to their rates of diffusion. An accurate titration
of the diffused salt was, of course, impossible in this case; and
weight analyses were resorted            to.
   At first the liquid obtained         in
                                    three           or

But this method was soon found to be inconvenient and ve
inaccurate, as the weight of substance dissolved from the glass
vessels during the evaporation was about equal to that of the
diffused salt.  For a similar reason, it was found unsafe to
evaporate in glass and precipitate with BaCl2. These sources
of error were finally avoided by evaporating the whole of the
liquid obtained in 24 hours in platinum dishes, then precipi
tating with BaCl2, and weighing as BaSO4. The results of
the experiments are as follows, the values being reduced for

reach a condition of constancy, was not a period long enough

the above discrepancies, it would be well to compare my
results with those of previous experimenters.                    Of all the
results obtained by others only those of Graham can be readily
 compared.       Beilstein neglected to give the dimensions of his
diffusion-cell with sufficient accuracy to allow a fair compa
 rison to be made; and Marignac's experiments were conducted
 in such a way that a direct comparison is impossible.                    His
 results can be considered only with reference to each other ;
 and, besides, he has shown that the relative rates of two salts,
 when simultaneously diffused, are often quite different from
 their relative rates when diffused alone.
      But, fortunately, Graham's work was so performed and his
 results given in such a form that their reduction and compa
 rison with my own can be more readily made.                 Graham's dif
  fusion-cells,   mentioned    at   the   beginning    of this  paper, con
 sisted of small phials, 9-64 centims. high, holding 134*8 cubic
  centims. to the base of the neck.              The neck itself was 12"7
  millims. high and slightly conical, being on the upper surface
  31-49 millims., and on the lower 30*48 millims. in diameter.
  These phials were filled to the base of the neck with the solu
  tion to be examined ; and the neck was filled with pure water
  in such a manner as not to mix the two liquids. The phials
  were placed in large vessels containing 567 cubic centims.
  water, and here allowed to remain a number of days.                   At the
  end of this time the water was drawn off and the amount of
  diffused substance analytically determined.               The results of
  these determinations are given in tables, of which the follow
  ing may serve as a sample. It is from Graham's second paper
  on the subject*: —

constructing   a  curve from   these data,  have   taken out the        I
value corresponding to the amount of salt used per litre in my

     It will be seen from the above that the correspondence in
 the results for the chlorides, bromides, iodides, and some of
 the nitrates is as close as could reasonably be expected from
methods so different as were the two here employed.                    But the
differences in the cases of BaN2 06, SrN2 06, and the five sul
 phates are far greater than could be allowed for errors of
 observation or accidental disturbances.                    Most of Graham's
 values represent       the    mean rates of diffusion for periods vary
 ing from 5 to 8 days. The values for BaN2 06 and SrN2 06,
however, are the mean rates for 11 "43 days ; and those given
 for MgS04 and ZnS04 are the mean rates for the period of
 16-16 days.        The other sulphates were diffused for 8 days.
 The discrepancies might be accounted for, in some cases, by
 assuming that the periods chosen by Graham were too long to
 admit of a fair comparison.                  Indeed it would seem from
 my    results   obtained      with    the  sulphates,     that had they been
 diffused longer and the mean values taken, they would have
been equally as small as those found by Graham.                        It will
be of course recognized that a chief advantage in the method

424                      Dr.    J.    H. Long    on the
employed by me rests in the fact that it allows any variation
in the rate of diffusion, as in the above case, to be followed
from day to day.     For the present              I
                                       must leave the cause of
these variations unexplained.
   The question now presents itself, Do the phenomena of dif
fusion bear any relation to other known physical pheno
mena? or, in other words, are the relations which molecules
of different substances bear to each other as regards diffusion
analogous to those depending on other molecular actions?
From the Tables given above no simple relation is recogni
zable ; but if instead of giving the results in grams of sub
stance diffused, they be given in number of molecules diffused,
several very interesting relations will appear.   Of course we
have no   means  of knowing  the absolute  number  of molecules
which undergo a change of place ; but it is quite easy to ex
press the relative numbers diffused in any given length of
time.
   In  the Tables above the salt diffused is expressed in grams
per   24   hours ; now if each one of these values be divided
by the molecular weight of the salt, the quotients thus ob
tained will be proportional to the numbers of molecules dif
fused from the solutions in question in equal times.
   It will be remembered that the solutions submitted to
diffusion were normal, half-normal, and quarter-normal —
that     is,were made to contain a definite number of mole
cules per constant volume        and  ;  will be interesting to see
                                             it
how many molecules diffused in equal times from solutions
which contained originally the same number.           This     pre          is
sented in the following Table.       In order to have these values
in the form of whole numbers, the quotients as obtained above
have been simply multiplied by 1,000,000, which of course
does not alter their relative values.    The results obtained from
salts diffused in half- or quarter-normal solution have been mul
tiplied by two or four to make the comparison easier.       This                   is
not absolutely accurate, as the amounts diffused are not quite
proportional to the concentrations       but the error will not be
                                              ;

  This arrangement             of the results shows several very inter-

                                Diffusion of Liquids.                                        425
esting peculiarities. For instance, the chlorides, bromides, and
iodides of the alkali metals form a series in which NH4 stands
between K and Na. KC1, KBr, KI, and KCy have nearly
the same rate. The same can be said of the corresponding
 NH4 and Na salts as far as investigated.
    The chlorides of the dyad metals Ba, Sr, Ca, and Mg are
 also seen to form a series as to their rates of diffusion.        In
the case of the alkaline nitrates something similar is seen to
 exist ; but these and other analogies will be better understood
 when presented in tabular form below (p. 426).
     If we compare the results in the above Table with those ob
 tained by Kohlrausch*, on the electrical conducting-power of
 liquids, several other interesting relations will be observed.
 It seems to be true in almost every case that those salts which
 offer the least resistance to the passage of the galvanic current
 when in solution are the ones which have the fastest rate of
 diffusion. These analogies will also be found below.
    Another relation will be found when we compare the rates
 of diffusion with the molecular weights and the molecular
 volumes of the salts dissolved.        In most cases it will be seen
 that those salts having the greatest molecular volumes diffuse
 the best.     Another very interesting relation will be found
 when the rates of diffusion of the anhydrous salts are compared
 with their thermal action on being dissolved.         Here it appears
 that those salts which absorb the greatest amount of heat on
 going into solution — that          those upon which the greatest
                                           is,
 amount of work has been expended and which are, as               con-                 a
  quence,  in the  finest  state of division — are the ones which  dif
  fuse the most rapidly.
     As these several phenomena have in all probability the same
  or similar causes,      will be well to present the several series
                           it
  of constants, molecular volume, electrical conducting-power,
  heat-absorbing power, and rate of diffusion of the various sub
  stances in   asingle Table.      The specific gravities of the salts
  from which the molecular volumes are computed were taken
  from F. W. Clarke's collection of Tables           and are the mean   t,
  values of those there given for the substances in question.
      The values for the electrical conductivity are from Kohl-
  rausch's papers      %cited above. They are referred to that of
   Hg as unit, and are multiplied by 107. The solutions were
  also normal — that        is,
                            similar to those used by me.

       A    consideration of the Table shows the completeness of the
   analogies referred to above.                      Taking the alkaline chlorides
   '"    '   "'
   first, it will be seen that they stand in the same order as
   regards molecular volume, rate of diffusion, conducting-
   power. , and latent heat of solution.                    Exactly the same is true
   of the corresponding bromides and iodides ; and the cyanide
   of potassium has very nearly the same rate of diffusion and
   electrical conducting-power as the chloride, bromide, and
                          *

                               It is probable that the rate have
 found for the bromide of sodium is somewhat too small, being
considerably smaller than that found by Graham for the same.
    In the next series it is seen that the order of the salts is the
same as regards rate of diffusion and electrical conductivity,
and the same in respect to molecular volume and latent heat
of solution. Ammonium nitrate precedes potassium nitrate
in regard to rate of diffusion and conducting-power, and fol
lows it in regard to molecular volume and heat-absorption.
    Barium nitrate precedes strontium nitrate in every known
respect ; to my knowledge, its conducting-power has not yet
been determined.
   In the series of the dyad chlorides the order is the same in
respect to rate of diffusion, conductivity, and latent heat of
solution as far as is known.     The molecular volume of stron
tium chloride seems to be slightly greater than that of barium
chloride ; but as the values of the specific gravities from which
the volumes were calculated differed considerably among them
selves, it is possible that the mean taken does not represent
the true value.
   In the case of the sulphates the order is the same respect
ing rate of diffusion and electrical conductivity. The sul
phates of magnesium, copper, and zinc agree with each other
very well in both respects ; and it is interesting to observe
that the rates of ammonium and sodium sulphates, while also
agreeing pretty well in both respects, are much larger than
those of the dyad sulphates.    The molecular volumes and heats
of solution are here quite irregular; indeed the anhydrous
sulphates of magnesium, zinc, copper, and manganese stand
in exactly reversed orders in respect to their rates of diffusion
and latent heats of solution.      But a correspondence in this
case could hardly be expected, as these substances, on going
into solution, combine with large quantities of water and in
variable proportions.
  It will be seen also from the Table that Graham was scarcely
correct in stating that no relation exists between molecular
weight and rate of diffusion.
   Before seeking for an explanation of these several analo
gies, it might be well to cite a few more data bearing on the
subject.   Kohlrausch has shown, in his paper referred to, that
the conducting-powers of the acids HC1, HBr, HI, and HN03
are nearly the same.     It would be interesting to know how
these substances act as regards diffusion.        Ihave not at
tempted   an investigation  of them ; but, fortunately, Graham
has experimented upon all four ; and his results, reduced to
the same standard as above (that     is,
                                      relative number of rnole

below.      The heats of solution for one equivalent of each acid
are also given.

    It is seen that the analogy is still preserved ; the four acids
are as closely related to each other in respect to rate of diffu
sion as to electrical conductivity.         The heats of solution of
the three similar acids are also nearly the same ; that of HN03,
however, is less.
    Of all the above relations, that which seems the most natural
and most readily explained is the analogy between rates of
diffusion of similarly constituted salts and the amounts of heat
they absorb on going into solution. The rendering latent of
a large amount of heat indicates the performance               of a corre
spondingly large amount of work. The work in the present
case is probably the division of the molecules into smaller
aggregates ; and these, as is quite plain, are able to move
through the solution with greater facility than those which are
not so finely divided.        Opposed to this, however, we should
not expect from a salt having a large molecular volume a
rapid rate of diffusion. Now it is possible that the large latent
heat corresponds to, and compensates for, the large volume,
and the rate of diffusion may not depend upon either.                What
the true explanation of these facts is        I   cannot at present say,
but must content myself with the mere indication of the several
data and their analogies.                           \-
    On an entirely different footing stand the analogies between
rate of diffusion and electrical conducting-power.                In both
cases a molecular motion is concerned ; and although at first
sight an explanation may seem as difficult as before, we have a
means of bridging the difficulty.          In the first place, it will be
well to call to mind the theory of the constitution of solutions
as advanced by Clausius *, Williamson         f  , and others.    Clausius
believes that in a solution of a salt, as NaCl for instance, the
two atoms cannot be assumed as remaining attached closely
together, or even as vibrating within limits near each other ;
but, on the contrary, they fly about in all directions, forming
or dissolving connexion with other atoms just according to the

intensity of the attractions acting upon them at any particular
instant of their course.        Moreover the velocities with which
these two atoms move may be quite different, and what may be
 spoken of as the velocity of the molecule NaCl in solution is
compounded of the velocities of its two atoms Na and CI.
     The action of the galvanic current on such a system would
then be as follows : — The atoms would still continue to fly
about, but in directions more nearly parallel to that of a line
joining the two electrodes ; and the tendency of these latter
to draw to the one side the negative atoms, and to the other
the positive, would be facilitated by their continually recur
ring states of liberty. If a partition be imagined in the vessel
in which electrolysis is taking place, say halfway between
the two electrodes and perpendicular to the line joining them,
it is clear that more positive than negative atoms pass this
partition in a positive direction, and more negative than posi
tive atoms pass it in a negative direction in a given time.
 But positive atoms moving in a negative direction, and nega
tive atoms moving in a positive direction, compensate for each
other, and there remains only the excess of motion in each
 direction ; which amounts to saying that a certain number of
 positive atoms cross the partition in a positive direction, and
 a certain number of negative atoms cross it in a negative direc
 tion, in a given time.
                              " These two numbers need not be the
 same, as they depend not only upon the impulsive force which
 for both is the same, but also on the degree of mobility, which
 for several reasons can be different for different substances"*.
     Now the ratio of the number of negative atoms which cross
 the partition to the number of molecules which may be con
 sidered as decomposed in a given time is designated by Hit-
 torf, in his well-known papers on the
                                                        " Wanderung der
  Ionen"f, with the letter n, and called by him the "Ueberfiihr-
 ungszahl"        He shows further that this n is equal to the ratio
 of the velocity of the negative atoms to the sum of the velo
 cities of both negative and positive atomsj.                 Kohlrausch, in
 his papers referred to above, expresses this relation thus,

to dilute solutions.  He has also shown that v, the velocity (Be-
weglichkeit, mobility) of a negative atom, as CI, is the same in
all its compounds from which it may be electrolyzed, in HC1,
KC1, BaCl2, and so on. The same is also true for any positive
atom, as      K
             in KC1, KOH, KN03, &c.
   If the values of n for any series of salts as found by Hittorf
and reduced by Kohlrausch be compared with the rates of dif
fusion of the same, it will be found that in the cases where n
is large the rate of diffusion is small ; and, indeed, in each
series the product of n and the latter, which        shall call d, is                   I

of the velocities with which its component atoms move during
electrolysis.
  We shall now         be    able to understand                                   the analogy between

                         Diffusion of Liquids.                  431
my results and those of Kohlrausch; for the latter has shown
that the molecular conductivity of a salt in solution depends
also on the velocities of its component parts.     From this stand
point he has calculated the conducting-powers of the sub
stances    for which n is known; and the results thus obtained
agree very well with those obtained by experiment.
    It appears, then, that the law of the independent migrations
of the ions is as applicable before as during the electrolysis
of salt in solution; otherwise what is the meaning of the above
analogies   ?
    There are also several other phenomena showing a close
relation between diffusion and conductivity.          Both increase
with the temperature, as one might expect ; and from Gra
ham's experiments it appears that the increase in the case of
diffusion is about the same as Kohlrausch found in the case of
conductivity.      The influence of temperature on diffusion has
been as yet, however, determined but for few substances; and
there is of course more or less uncertainty in these determi
nations.
    Another point of analogy is this. Graham has shown that,
in the case of nearly every substance investigated by him, the
increase in the rate of diffusion is less as the concentration in
 creases.    This is also true of the conductivity of the same
 solutions; and the explanation is the same in both cases.       As
remarked by Kohlrausch, in concentrated solutions the mole
cules interfere with each other's motions ; and this interfe
rence is manifested in the one case by a decrease in the rate
of diffusion, and in the other by a decrease in the conducting-
power, both relative of course.
    Indeed, considering all the above data, it will be seen that
the most perfect analogy exists.       In the one case the number
 of particles, in the other the force transmitted by the same is
 the element observed; and that a correlation should be found
is not at all singular.
    Whether the velocity of the salt-molecules is the same
during diffusion as during electrolysis        I cannot say ; but it
 seems to be established by the above that, if any increase take
 place in the latter case, the fraction representing this increase
 must be the same for all substances of each series.
    But before proceeding any further with this subject, there
 are several other points which must be investigated.           For
 instance,  the rates of diffusion of chlorine and bromine  in water
 must be more exactly determined; and, if possible, more cor
 rect determinations of the influence of temperature should be
 made.
    The alkaline hydrates     present  also a very interesting field

432                       Prof. H. A. Rowland on
of investigation      ;  and if the above analogies be general, these
bodies must be characterized by a rapid rate of diffusion as
well as by good conductivity.             There are several phosphates
and carbonates which likewise deserve investigation; and these
          I
points expect to make the subject of future examination.

      LV. Preliminary         Notes on   Mr. Hall's Recent Discovery.
                            By H. A. Rowland*.
             recent     discovery by Mr. Hallj of       a new action of
 THEmagnetism             on electric currents opens a wide field for
 the mathematician, seeing that we must now regard most of
 the equations which we have hitherto used in electromagnetism
 as only approximate, and as applying only to some ideal sub
 stance which may or may not exist in nature, but which cer
 tainly does not include the ordinary metals.           But as the effect
 is very small, probably it will always be treated as a correction
 to the ordinary equations.
     The facts of the case seem to be as follows, as nearly as they
 have yet been determined : — Whenever a substance transmit
 ting an electric current is placed in a magnetic field, besides
 the ordinary electromotive force in the medium, we now have
 another acting at right angles to the current and to the mag
 netic lines of force.         Whether there may not be also an elec
 tromotive      force    in  the  direction of the current has not yet
 been determined with accuracy; but it has been proved, within
 the limits of accuracy of the experiment, that no electromotive
  force exists in the direction of the lines of magnetic force.
  This electromotive force in a given medium is proportional to
  the strength of the current and to the magnetic intensity, and
  is reversed when either the primary current or the magnetism
  is reversed.      It has also been lately found that the direction
  is different in iron from what it is in gold or silver.
      To analyze the phenomenon in gold, let us suppose that the
  line A B represents the original current at the point A, and
  that B C is the new effect. The magnetic pole is supposed to
  be either above or below the paper, as the case may be.            The
  line A C will represent the final resultant electromotive force
   at the point A .       The circle with arrow represents the direction
   in which the current is rotated by the magnetism.

    It is seen that all these effects are such as would happen
were the electric current to be rotated in a fixed direction with
respect to the lines of magnetic force, and to an amount de
pending only on the magnetic force and' not on the current.
This fact seems to point immediately to that other very im
portant case of rotation, namely the rotation of the plane of
polarization of light.      For, by Maxwell's theory, light is an
electrical phenomenon, and consists of waves of electrical dis
placement, the currents of displacement being at right angles
to the direction of propagation of the light.          If the action we
are now considering takes place in dielectrics, which point
Mr. Hall is now investigating, the rotation of the plane of
polarization of light is explained.
     I give the following very imperfect theory at this stage of
 the paper, hoping to finally give a more perfect one either in
 this paper or a later one.
     Let .0 be the intensity of the magnetic field, and let E be
 the original electromotive        force at any point, and let c be a
 constant for the given medium.           Then the new electromotive
 force E' will be
                              E'=c.0E,
 and the final electromotive        force will be rotated through an
  angle which will be very nearly equal to c.£).            As the wave
  progresses through- the medium, each time it (the electromo
  tive force) is reversed it will be rotated through this angle; so
  that the total rotation will be this quantity multiplied by the
  number of waves.       If X is the wave-length in air, and i is the
  index of refraction, and c is the length of medium, then the
  number    of waves will be   —
                                 ,   and the total rotation

  434             On the new Action   of Magnetism.
     The direction of rotation is the same in diamagnetic and
  ferromagnetic bodies as we find by experiment, being different
  in the two ; for it is well known that the rotation of the plane
  of polarization is opposite in the two media, and Mr. Hall
  now finds his effect to be opposite in the two media.          This
         I
 result anticipated from this theory   3  of the magnetic
                                                     *      rotation
  of light.
     But the formula makes the rotation inversely proportional
 to the wave-length, whereas we find it more nearly as the
 square or cube.    This  I consider to be a defect due to the im
 perfect theory; and it would possibly disappear from the com
 plete dynamical theory.       But the formula at least makes the
 rotation increase as the wave-length decreases, which is accord
 ing to experiment. Should an exact formula be finally obtained,
 it seems to me that it would constitute a very important link in
 the proof of Maxwell's theory of light, and, together with a
 very exact measure of the ratio of the electromagnetic to the
 electrostatic units of electricity which we made here last year,
 will raise the theory almost to a demonstrated fact. The de
 termination of the ratio will be published shortly ; but     I may
 say here that the final result will not vary much, when all the
 corrections have been applied, from 299,700,000 metres per
 second ; and this is almost exactly the velocity of light.      We
 cannot but lament that the great author of this modern theory
 of light is not now here to work up this new confirmation of
his theory, and that it is left for so much weaker hands.
    But before we can say definitely that this action explains
the rotation of the plane of polarization of light, the action
must be extended to dielectrics, and it must be proved that
the lines of electrostatic action are rotated around the lines of
force as well as the electric currents.      Mr. Hall is about to
try an experiment of this nature.
    I  am now writing the full mathematical theory of the new
action, and hope to there consider the    full consequences of   the
new discovery.
                I
    Addition. — have now worked out the complete theory of
the rotation of the plane of polarization of light, on the assump
tion that the displacement currents are rotated as well as the
conducted currents.       The result is very satisfactory, and
makes the rotation proportional to         which agrees very per
fectly with observation.      The amount of     rotation calculated
for gold is also very nearly what is found     in some of the sub
stances which rotate the light the least.       Hence it seems to
me that we have very strong ground for          supposing the two
phenomena to be the same.

LVI.     On some Effects of Vibratory Motion in Fluids ; on the
    Attraction due to the Flow of Liquids from an Expanded Ori

           On some Effects of Vibratory Motion in Fluids.
          causing a stream of coal-gas to bubble through a liquid
ON       contained in a flask, it may by careful adjustment be
made to issue from a suitable jet in an oscillatory manner, in
the plane which would contain a sensitive flame issuing from
the same jet.     Thus a flame may be sensitive when the dis
turbance is imparted from within.
    An analogous experiment with water was attempted as fol
lows :— An electromagnetic engine was made to oscillate a
lever, pressing against an india-rubber tube, conveying water
from a height of 14 feet to a partially closed tube, such as
would emit a sensitive flame under a moderate pressure.                     The
water issued in a pulsatory manner,               but  showed   no  new   form.
    On comparing the two experiments, it will be seen that the
bubble of gas, in passing through the liquid, is gradually in
creasing in volume, and when it reaches the surface, probably
expands to a size it could not permanently retain.                     Such is
not possible    with  water    ;   for    though    its  elasticity is  greater
than that of air, the range through which it acts (which may
be called its amplitution) is much less.                To provide for this
amplitution, an air-chamber was introduced between the lever
and the jet (fig. 1).       The water then issued in exactly the
                             Fig.    1  (section).

same manner as an excited sensitive flame, breaking into two
streams lying in one plane.             The motion of the lever upon the
flowing    water  produces    in    the     latter a sinuous wave ; and as
the troughs and      crests   reach       opposite sides of the jet, they

 streams with about 400 vibrations per second.               On substitu
 ting a straight tube for the jet, figures of great beauty were
 obtained.
    Fig. 2 shows a simple wave free from harmonics. The
 phase of the wave relatively to the lever's motion is so strongly
 marked, that it is not destroyed by passing through tortuous
 tubes 2 feet long.    When the lever presses the tube at any
 but a right angle, the figures are more complex and show a
 tendency to rotation.
    A wave with harmonics produces minor streams (fig. 3) in

 (Oct.  3,  1878) that  a  flame    is  capable   of producing harmo
 nics of its primary note ; and this makes the analogy complete
 between gaseous and liquid columns, in their behaviour to
 sensible vibratory motion.
    The experiment analogous to the ordinary sensitive flame
 was attempted by immersing a sensitive jet in a vessel of water

 a higher pressure   than   ^ in.  water    was used.   Near  the critical
 point  I  could not produce any marked effect by applying to
 the water a 4-inch tuning-fork.             Possibly larger apparatus
 would give better results.        While working with this, was      I
 struck with the great depth to which a stream of the liquid
 will descend under a very small pressure from a non-sensitive
jet, made by contracting a |-inch test-tube to about -fe inch,
 and cutting off some distance below the contraction.            When a

  passage    of vibration being more rapid in water tban air, then
  globules of mercury, bromine, and bisulphide of carbon, all of
  which have a greater velocity for sound than water, should
  either float or show some tendency to do so.          A great number
  of experiments, under varying conditions, failed to show that
  they were in any way affected.
     As an air-bubble sinks as rapidly as a grain of sand would
 do,   I tried hydrogen in place of air, and mercury in place of
  water in the tube A. When the hydrogen reaches the mercury
 it rests a little, and then suddenly sinks with the same appa
 rent velocity as the air in water.
     If in these experiments the bubble is large it does not de
 scend; and this points to the close analogy with the experi
 ments of Guthrie (Proc. Roy. Soc. 1870, pp. 35—41), who
 found that the vibration of a solid body caused the "approach
                                                                       "
 of a piece of cardboard from a considerable distance.              We
 might say,     conventionally,   that  the attraction was less between
 the air and the sounding body than the cardboard and the
 latter.    Now in the tube A, C being a node, any particle near
 C is relatively at rest to one nearer B, and the attraction be
 tween them is greater than either for the bubble.           Hence the
 particle at C tends to move towards E, or, what is the same
 thing, the bubble moves to C. When the bubble is large it is
 still repelled, but it leaves no way for the approach of the
 attracted water.       A great number of small bubbles may be
successively sunk till a large one results at C, showing that
the conditions of the experiment only proscribe the motion of
the large one.       By inverting fig. 5 it may be used to produce
the water-figures; but they can seldom be obtained free from
harmonics by such means.
 On the Attraction due to the     Flow of Liquids from an Expanded
                                  Orifice.
    M. Lacoutre has shown in Les Mondes for May 10, 1866,
that when a liquid flows perpendicularly from a cylindrical
tube upon a flat disk, its motion is arrested till the disk is
brought to within half a diameter of the tube (but varying
with pressure), .when the outflow is greater than if the disk be
entirely removed.       I find that if the tube terminate in a similar
disk, attraction ensues at the position of greatest ontflow.
    A glass filter funnel containing a light cone with a weight
dependent from its apex, or a tube terminating in a hemi
spherical cup with a light ball, have more stability than the
disks, and answer equally well. In all cases the apparatus
may be immersed in liquid and the attraction continued.
The explanation usually accepted of the corresponding pneu

matic experiment of M. Clement Desonnes, is based on the
assumption that the velocity of the fluid gradually decreases
as it approaches the edges of the disks.              To determine how
far this was generally true,             I  took an outer cone A of
4 inches diameter at base with angle of 60° at apex, and an inner
cone B upon same base with angle of 120°.                 For the velocity
of the liquid to diminish between the apex of B and base of A,
the cones must be separated nearly             \ inch. Using water at
varying pressure, in no case did attraction take place at more
than         in., where the velocity must increase towards the out
let.     I find also that the presence of the attracted cone, ball,
&c. diminishes the pressure in the supply-pipe, as shown by a
water-guage attached to the latter.           Hence the presence of the
cone &c. facilitates the      efflux.

 LVII.       On a Simple Method of identifying a submerged Tele
    graph-Cable without cutting it. By W. P. JOHNSTON, Offi
     ciating Electrician, Indian Government Telegraphs* .
                                 having arisen which rendered       it de
 CIRCUMSTANCES
          sirable, and at times    absolutely   necessary, to be in pos
 session of a method for identifying a submerged telegraph-
 cable by applying certain tests to the protecting guards, the
 following experiments were made for the purpose.
     The particular case referred to me was this : —
     " How with two cables
                                  (one good and one faulty) across a
 river, both cables having similar guards, can one be distin
 guished from the other without cutting, when either one of
 them has been raised from the bottom onto the repairing-boat ?
 The boat being a small one, and the river running rapidly, it
 becomes difficult and dangerous to cut the cable in the first
 instance; and to make a joint simply for the purpose of iden
 tification is above all things to be avoided."
     My first idea was to attach a very sensitive instrument to
 the guards where they were raised out of the water, to signal

 from the bank through the guards, and to observe the effects
 on this instrument, first, when the battery and instrument were
joined to the guards of the same cable, and, secondly, when the
 battery was joined to the guards of one and the instrument to
 the guards of the other cable. This, however, did not answer.
    My next idea was to join an instrument to the guards, and
to observe whether it was sufficiently sensitive to show any
sign of the current that would be induced in the guards of the
cable when a strong current was sent through the conductor ;
and on mentioning this to Mr. J. J. Allen, Assistant Superin
tendent of Indian Government Telegraphs, he suggested that
in this case a telephone attached to the guards might be influ
enced.     The value of this suggestion was clear to me ; for                I
have reason to know how exceedingly sensitive an instrument
the telephone        is,
                     having about      year ago made for Mr.

442      On a Method of identifying a submerged Telegraph-cable.
    The distance C D being 12 yards, every signal that was sent
through the conductor was distinctly audible on the telephone
(T); reducing the distance gradually, the signals were still
readable so long as that distance was not less than 6 feet.     At
a less distance the signals became faint ; and at 3 inches only
an exceedingly feeble sound could just be heard, and not suf
ficient for reading.
    On pressing the key a sound was heard from the telephone ;
and on releasing the key a sound was also heard.
    The explanation, of course, is simple : — " For every current
made in the conductor, a current is induced in the iron guards
in the opposite direction to the primary current; and for every
interruption made, a current is induced in the iron guards in
 the same direction as the primary current.         The telephone
 therefore receives a succession of opposite currents ; and being
 such an exceedingly sensitive instrument, notwithstanding
 the very minute fraction of these induced currents which
 passes through the shunt formed by the telephone, still it
 gives out audible sound."
    As stated before, the guards were 12 galvanized iron wires
 each weighing 900 lb. per mile, and
    the resistance per mile of one 900-lb. wire = 7 ohms,
    the resistance per mile of twelve 900-lb. wires =       ohm,
    and the resistance of 6 feet of twelve 900-lb. wires = 0'66
       milliohm.
     In this  case the resistance of 0*66 milliohm offered by the
  6 feet  of the guards was shunted by a telephone offering with
 its connecting wires a resistance of 2'5 ohms.       Therefore, of
 the currents    induced  in  the guards by the primary current
 in the conductor, only           passed through the telephone.
     The method which I suggest for the identification of a sub
  merged telegraph-cable is therefore as follows : — Attach a
 telephone of low resistance to the guards of the raised por
 tion of the cable (which portion may be either in or out of
 the water), as shown in the diagram, and send signals from
 the bank through the conductor of one of the cables ; and
 then, if the telephone is connected to the guards of the cable
 through the conductor of which the signals are being sent,
  those signals will be audible in the telephone.
     There are doubtless many other cases in which this method
 may be found of practical service.
     The telephone in its short history resembles very much the
 development of a boy whose father had brought him up to be a
 priest, but who, contrary to all expectations, turned out to be
 a general ; for the application in practical telegraphy for which
 the telephone was invented has not turned out to be so sue

cessful as the inventor, Prof. Bell, and others anticipated. But
instead of this, the instrument will undoubtedly become of the
greatest assistance to physical research.         In addition to sig
nalling across rivers already referred to, Mr. Schwendler had
already used the telephone for indicating the speed of the in
duction cylinder of a dynamoelectric machine (see pricis of his
Electric Light Report); and Professor Hughes has used it
with great success in his induction-balance. It seems, in fact,
the telephone is too sensitive and too quick working for prac
 tical use.

LVIII.       Complete Theory of the Bifilar Magnetometer and new
     Methods for the Determination of the Absolute Horizontal
     Intensity of the Earth's Magnetism, as well as of the Tempe
     rature and Induction-coefficients of Magnets. By H. Wild *.
            above is the title   of a communication made to the
 THEImperial        Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg on the
 15th (27th) January, 1880 (Bull. Acad. Impdr. Sci. St. Pdters-
 burg ,Mdlanges Phys. et Chim. xi.), as an abstract of a more de
 tailed paper to be shortly laid before the Academy.
     The starting-point of the paper is the observation that the
 indications of the bifilar magnetometer, even when all causes
 of disturbance are excluded, differ from the results of direct
 measures of horizontal intensity to a far greater extent than
 can be accounted for by errors of observation.          The author
 traces the cause of these discrepancies in the twisting of the
 suspending fibres, of which no account is taken in the ordinary
 theory of the bifilar magnetometer, according to which the
 moment of the directive couple of the suspension is ascribed
 simply to the weight of the magnet and its stirrup. The
 effect which this cause is capable of producing may either be
  calculated from the dimensions and coefficient of torsion-elas
 ticity of the fibres, or it may be determined experimentally
 upon the bifilar instrument itself by observing the period of
 vibration before and after a known change has been made in
 the moment of inertia.         Concordant determinations by both
 methods indicated that in the case of a bifilar suspended by
 brass wires 4 metres long, the couple due to torsion amounted
 to 1 per cent, of that due to the suspended weight.          In the
 bifilar magnetometer of the St.-Petevsburg magnetograph,
  which was suspended by steel wires only 0*3 metre long, the
  effect of torsion was as much as about 7 per cent, of the gra-
               * Communicated by the Physical Society
                                  212

444             Mr. H. Wild on a Complete Theory
vitation-couple.    On the other hand, it amounted to only 0'3
per cent, in a bifilar of the Pawlowsk Observatory, this instru
ment having cocoon fibres 1*2 metre long.        From the consi
deration of the conditions which determine the magnitude of
the torsion and gravitation-couples respectively, Prof. Wild
concludes that it is not probable that the proportion between
them can be reduced much below that which exists in the
last-mentioned instrument, namely 0*3 per cent., and hence
that the correction for torsion cannot be of negligible amount
in accurate observations.
   When this correction is applied, as well as that for induc
tion, the author finds that the differences between the results
of calculation and experiment disappear, and that very nearly
identical values of the characteristic magnitude of the bifilar
magnetometer,     namely the so-called
                                          " torsion-angle " z, are
obtained by both methods.      The reader may be reminded that
this angle z is the angle which a vertical plane passing through
the upper ends of the suspending fibres makes with a vertical
plane through their lower ends when the magnet is perpendi
cular to the magnetic meridian. If D be the moment of the
directive couple due to the suspension, H the earth's horizon
tal intensity, and M the moment of the magnet, the angle z
is defined by the equation
                           Dsinz=HM.
Its magnitude may be found by direct experiment ; or it may
be calculated from the periods of vibration of the magnet
observed when its position of equilibrium is in the magnetic
meridian and its north-seeking pole is towards magnetic
north and its south-seeking towards magnetic south respec
tively.   If tx and t2 are the periods in the two cases,
                           sin
   The author observes, in the next place, that the direct de
termination of z, together with the observation of the periods
hi h> h (the last being the period of vibration when the posi
tion of equilibrium of the magnet is perpendicular to the me
ridian), affords an excellent method for determining separately
the two induction-coefficients of the magnet, namely the coef
ficient of increase and that of decrease of the magnetic mo
ment.    The advantages of this method are chiefly that it does
not depend upon the mutual action of two magnets, which
can be only approximately calculated, and that it requires the
use of only one instrument.     He also remarks that these advan
tages apply also to the method indicated by him in a previous

                      of the Bifilar Magnetometer.                445
 publication for the determination of the temperature-coeffi
 cients of magnets, and that he has assured himself by actual trial
 of the precision of this method.
    The remainder of the paper is devoted to the description of
 a process for determining in absolute measure the earth's hori
 zontal magnetic intensity by means of the bifilar magneto
 meter, and to the statement of the formula? required for the
 complete reduction of the results so as to take account of all
 corrections. The principles inyolved in this process may be thus
 indicated : — It is divisible, like Gauss's process, into a method
 for determining (a) the product of the horizontal intensity H
 into the moment M of a particular magnet, and (b) the ratio
 of the same two quantities.         To determine the product, the
 magnet is suspended in the bifilar instrument, and the torsion-
 angle z is observed which is required to set the axis of the
magnet perpendicular to the meridian. This operation gives
the equation
                             Dsins=HM.
    The ratio of H to M is found by suspending another magnet
of moment M' in the bifilar, placing the first magnet with its
axis in the magnetic meridian through the centre of suspen
sion of the instrument, and determining the torsion-angle zx,
needed    to set the suspended magnet perpendicular to the
meridian when the north-seeking pole of the first magnet
(moment M) is towards magnetic north, and also the corre
sponding angle zi} when the north-seeking pole of the first
magnet is towards magnetic south.            These observations give,
subject to the proper corrections, the equations
                      D'sin^=(H+^)M',
                      D'sin.~2=(H-^)M';
from which the ratio in question is easily obtained in terms of
zu zt, and the distance r between the centres of the mag
nets.   The horizontal intensity is then given by an expres
sion which, when the corrections (for which we must refer to
the original paper) are omitted, becomes

LIX.       On the Determination of the Acceleration of Gravity for
                              Tokio, Japan.
    To  the Editors of  the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
        Gentlemen,
MY forattentionApril,
                      has been directed to a paper in your Journal
                      on the " Determination of the Acceleration
of Gravity for Tokio, Japan," which         I am sorry to see con
tains a considerable proportion of questionable teaching. As
the subject is attracting a good deal of attention abroad,      I am
unwilling to allow this to pass muster as a fair representation
of English acquaintance with it. Neither is it pleasant to think
that the youth of Japan are being enlightened in this way
regarding a pursuit in which England was once foremost.
     To any one acquainted with the history and literature of
pendulum experimentation, it is patent that the teachers in
this case are either entirely unacquainted with both, or hold
the opinion that the first canon of " original research
                                                              " is to
 avoid all study of previous work.        As it is more pardonable
to hold a heterodox opinion than to be ignorant,        I  am willing
to attribute the originality in this paper to such a source — the
more so as the concluding sentences seem to point to such a
 a doctrine. The writers say,
                                   " that this investigation
 has resulted from the plan we have followed of teaching the
 laboratory students not, as is customary in colleges, to repeat
 well-known experiments, but to endeavour in their investiga
 tions to advance, in some small degree at any rate, the bounde
 of existing knowledge."
     The doctrine is as erroneous as the design is laudable.      But
 I   must say that the teaching as here in evidence has followed
 the lines laid down only too well ; and if      I could believe that
 the absence of all indication of a knowledge of previous expe
 riments is feigned — if the mistakes are not genuine — if the
 oversights are intentional — then the authors of this account
 have done themselves great injustice in publishing this instance
  of their method of instigating to original research.
      " To
            repeat well-known experiments
                                                " slavishly and un-
  comprehendingly is no doubt undesirable ; but it is far more
 undesirable to neglect the commonest and most essential prin
  ciples of exact experimentation, in favour of abstruse investi
  gation of conditions which, almost obviously, are unimportant.
  I                                              I
     will give a single extract to show that am not making a
  random charge: —
      " The two most obvious corrections to apply to this result
   [the time of vibration of a pendulum in air] are the correc
  tions for infinitely small arcs and for the air-friction — neither

  Determination of     the Acceleration   of Gravity for Tokio.     447
of which were found of any practical consequence, on account
of the very small angle through which the pendulum usually
swung, and that the decrement of the amplitude of the vibra
tions was imperceptible even after many swings. Although,
however, such a pendulum as we were using approaches very
nearly a perfect simple pendulum, there are certain causes of
possible error arising from its flexibility and slight elasticity
which would not affect a rigid compound pendulum."
    Perhaps    I ought to regard this as dust thrown into the
pupils' eyes, to prevent their attending to such well-known
reductions as those for arc, buoyancy, resistance, &c. But is
it possible not to suspect another explanation, when we have
just before heard that long-continued experiments with two
of " Kater's pendulums" (the convertible form is meant)
were at last abandoned as having proved " always unsatisfac
tory"? How could they possibly be otherwise, in the ab
sence of any knowledge of, or care about, the instrumental
 constants ? Also we have been told that these results differed
too much from the value
                               " calculated by a formula developed
 by Clairault, who, from pendulum-experiments made at a
variety of latitudes on the earth's surface, has shown that, ap
proximately, for any latitude X, and any height h centimetres
 above the level of the sea,
             g= 980-6056    - 2-5028 cos   \ - 0-000003 A."
 To say nothing of the misprint (of cos X for cos 2\) and the
 anachronism of assigning to Clairaut a formula metrically
 expressed,    I cannot find words to represent adequately the
 state  of dazed   astonishment created by such an appeal.          Not
 only is the formula wrong, numerically,        but it  no more belongs
 to Clairaut than to Copernicus.         And even admitting that, in
 demonstrating or elucidating some point in connexion with
 the law of increase of gravity, Clairaut may have had recourse
 to numerical exposition analogous to the above, the idea of
 testing a modern experiment thereby is perfectly astounding,
 when regarded as part of academical instruction.
     The force of gravity may be expressed, with all the preci
 sion at present justifiable, in metres, thus : —
                     g = 9-8063-0-02553       cos 2X.
     If Clairaut  is here credited with what he would not claim,
                                                       "
  Colonel Clarke is scarcely more fortunate : — Clairault's for
 mula assumes a circular equator ; Captain Clarke has found
 that the equator is elliptical."       Colonel Clarke will not thank
  the authors for that raw statement. What he has taught is in
  effect this : Assuming an equator more or less elliptical, the

448                Prof. Challis      on the    Hydrodynamical
ellipticity   seems to be such-and-such;
                                       but this is not to be taken
as any    proof of such ellipticity.
                                  The idea was not his, either.
   One remark more, and I have done. Kater is recognized,
and Borda—the one in speaking of “Kater's pendulum,” and
the other in alluding to “Borda's method of coincidences”—
which, by the way, was not any more peculiarly Borda’s than
the formula (as given) was Clairaut’s ; Clairaut's name also
is mentioned, as we have seen ; not a single other author or
experimenter in this field is mentioned from the first line to
the last.  Surely this is carrying “originality in experimental
research' too far—even to the very verge of decency.                                I
would suggest to the students of the Japanese college that
they return to the discarded convertible pendulums, and de
mand to know, as a matter of scientific interest, WHY their
results were so unsatisfactory.    They may rest assured that it
was because they had neglected some of those precautions and
reductions which “well-known experiments” are especially
useful in inculcating.
   No experimental result is worth publishing which does not
carry with it direct or indirect evidence of reliability—or the
means of correcting             its
                          errors.               In
                                       the present case we have
neither the one nor the other. The force         gravity       of
                                                             Tokio          at
in Japan may          be
                   known more     certainly from the above for
mula than from the experiments recorded          the paper under
                                                               in

                  Theory      of   the   Physical Forces.                   449
According to principles and processes therein indicated, it
appeared that the determination, purely by analytical reason
ing, of the rate of propagation in a homogeneous medium the
pressure of which varies proportionally to its density requires
the integration, at least approximately, of the equation
                      Sf+'i&+«*™                                            <B>
To effect this integration, the form of
that we might have
                                                   /   was assumed to be such
                     f=cr~'         cos     (nir + </),
c, m,   and   d being certain constants.                  By substituting this
         /
value of in the equation, a result is obtained
zero by the residual quantity
                                                                differing from
Hence it follows that, whatever be m, the equation is exactly
satisfied by all the special values of r for which /= 0, which
are the special values that cause cos (mr + d) to vanish.    Now
it is evident that  the value of the residual quantity  is cceteris
paribus least when m2=4e, and hence that the approximation
to the solution   of the equation (B) is closest when m=2\/ e.
This, in fact, is the case in the approximate solution which                  I
referred to as having been obtained by Sir W. Hamilton and
Professor Stokes, whence            I
                                 deduced a velocity of sound ex
ceeding by    17'5 feet the experimental   determination. In the
above-mentioned      postscript   made  I
                                       the  supposition that m=ir,
and consequently found a velocity of sound only 3*17 feet less
than the observed value.       But although this difference is less
than the other, that supposition must be rejected, because the
equality m2 = 7r2e does not give so close an approximation to
the solution of the equation (B) as m2=4e.          Hence     have      I
finally come to the conclusion that the principles and processes
of Hydrodynamics which               I
                                  have adopted conduct, by pure
reasoning, to a velocity of sound exceeding by 17'5 feet the
latest determination by experiment and observation.        Possibly
 the excess may be attributable to the fact that the air, instead
 of being homogeneous, as the theory supposes, is composite,
 and in its lower strata charged with vapour.

 along a rectilinear axis.     The assumption     was required for
 satisfying that condition.
    (3) In the statement of the fundamental principles of the
 general theory of the physical forces, one of the adopted hy
 potheses is that atoms are spheres admitting of no change of
 form or magnitude.      At the same time it was asserted that
 this hypothesis is one of those which require to be verified by
 comparisons of deductions from them with experimental facts.
 I did not, however, refer to certain theoretical results had I
 obtained which actually afford such verification. These results
 are given in a dissertation entitled " The Hydrodynamical
 Theory of the action of a Galvanic Coil on an external small
 Magnet," which is divided into three parts, contained respec
tively in the Numbers of the Philosophical Magazine for Sep
tember, November, and December 1874.            The hypotheses on
which the theory rests are stated in art. 1 of the dissertation,
and are identical with the fundamental principles referred to
above.     In a postscript to the article in the November
Number two sets of numerical comparisons of the theory with
observation are exhibited ; and at the end of the dissertation
in the December Number (art. 76) a summary is given of the
grounds on which the whole theory may be regarded as satis
                   I
factory. What am now concerned with is to state that this
theoiy depends essentially on the hypothesis that atoms are
spherical in form and of constant magnitude, and that the
satisfactory conclusions to which it leads are confirmatory of
this hypothesis.
   (4) Since in the above-mentioned dissertation there are
some remarks which might be supposed to imply that the
hydrodynamical theory is not in complete accordance with
the formula obtained experimentally by Ampere for the mu
tual action between a galvanic element and a magnetic ele
ment,   I take occasion to say that    I have since seen reason to
conclude that the accordance is quite satisfactory.         I  have
adverted to this point because in Clerk Maxwell's ' Treatise on
Electricity and Magnetism' (vol. ii. p. 16) that mutual action
is expressed in four different forms, and the formula of Ampere
is considered to be the best.    It is evident that on such a ques
tion there should be no uncertainty, and that a good theory
ought to be capable of deciding whether or not a proposed
formula is true. According to the hydrodynamical theory
which   I have advocated, Ampere's is the true formula.
                              " obtained under Parts II. and III.
   (5)  To  the " few results
of the general hydrodynamical theory, which are cited in the
January Number (p. 31), and considered to be confirmatory
of that theory,     I might have added the explanations it is

                  Theory of   the Physical Forces.              451
capable   of giving of the phenomena of the radiometer, plane
and cup-shaped (Phil. Mag. for May and November 1876 and
April 1877), and also of the actions of the otheoscope and
telephone    (Phil. Mag. for June 1878). I have adverted
to these productions for the purpose of making a remark rela
tive to certain inferences which experimenters have drawn
from this novel class of phenomena, and which they designate
by the terms " the viscosity of residual gas," " the viscosity
of vacuum," " a fourth state of matter           in addition to the
solid, fluid, and gaseous.     The explanations above cited appear
to me to point to the conclusiou that these terms, so far as
they are expressions of real phenomena, are referable to modes
 of operation of the aatherial medium in which light and heat
 are generated and transmitted, and are to be accounted for by
 mathematical deductions from the hydrodynamical theory of
 physical force.
     (6) The Theory of the Microphone       I  am about to propose
 is a corollary from that of the Telephone given in the Philo
 sophical Magazine for June 1878.          The following mode of
 producing    the phenomena     of the microphone,   which was con
 ducted in my presence,    is  convenient  for  describing the theo
 retical explanation. An oblong rectangular plate of charcoal
 of moderate breadth and small thickness was approximately
 balanced about its middle transverse section, and so placed
 that the end of its heavier half rested slightly on another plate
  of charcoal of greater breadth.      An arrangement was made
 by which the electric current pertaining to a telephone could
  be passed through the two pieces of charcoal.        Although my
  hearing is not good, words transmitted from a distant room
  were heard with sufficient loudness and distinctness by em
  ploying the telephone in the ordinary way, and applying a
  receiving-cup to my ear.        But as soon as the current was
  made to traverse the pieces of charcoal, the loudness and di
  stinctness were marvellously increased, and       I  had no longer
  need to apply the cup.         This increment of sound may,       I
  think, be accounted for, on the principles of the hydrodyna
  mical theory of the telephone, in the following manner.        The
  current, in passing out of the narrower into the broader plate,
  enters into a larger channel, and consequently,       according to
  the hydrodynamics of steady currents, its velocity is there
  diminished and its density increased.      The increment of pres
  sure thence resulting might suffice to raise the narrow plate ;
  but if so, a very slight separation would so far intercept the
  current as to cause a diminution of the lifting force, and the
  plate would immediately be brought back by the force of gra
  vity.   Thus a quick succession of partial interruptions would

  452           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
  be   produced, whereby the steady motion might be partially
  converted into vibratory motion.          This effect would be pre
  cisely analogous to the generation by the siren of Cagniard
  de la Tour of musical sounds by means of a succession of in
  terruptions of a steady current of air, the pitch of the sound
  increasing with the velocity of the current. These vibratory
  motions, being an accession to those produced by the speaker
  at the transmitting end of the telephone, and having a con
  stant relation to them, are attended by an accession of cur
  rent, and therefore an accession of effect at the receiving-end.
 This follows from the analytical formula in the second para
 graph of the article in the Phil. Mag. for June 1878, the effects
  under consideration being all referable to pressures depending
 upon the squares of the velocity of a steady current of the
 aetherial medium.
     I   have now completed all that      I am able to say relative to
 the department of physical science the principles of which
 were inaugurated by Newton, and which for distinction may
 be named Theoretical Physics.          I must now leave to younger
 mathematicians the task of correcting and extending, if they
 think good, the efforts     I have made in this direction, and shall
 only urge the important consideration that Theoretical Physics
 are as necessary for constituting a complete system of Physical
 Science as Experimental and Empirical Physics,

   ON THE THEORY OF INDUCTION-CURRENTS.              BY M. MASCART.
                           has shown that, taking as starting-point the
 MHELMHOLTZ
       •   laws of Ohm and Joule,   the induction-phenomena produced
 by the displacement of a magnetic system in the vicinity of a cur
rent might have been foreseen.       It has seemed to me that a natural
generalization of the results obtained in this particular case permits
us to establish the theory of electrodynamic induction-currents       so
 as to connect them simply with a common principle.
    It is known that, according to Ampere's theory, the work neces
sary for displacing a magnetic mass m in the vicinity of a current
is equal to the product of that mass by the intensity      I of the cur
rent and by the increment of the angle under which the circuit is
seen from two points occupied successively       by the magnetic mass.
The energy of the mass m with respect to the cm-rent may there
fore be represented by Imw. It will be useful to enunciate this
property in another form by employing the notion of Faraday's
lines of force.
    If the force exerted by a magnetic system upon the unit of mass
situated in a point be considered, and any surface-element whatever

             Intelligence   and Miscellaneous   Articles.        453
be carried through that point, the name stream of force (or number
of lines of force) passing through that element may designate the
product of its surface by the normal component of the force.       It
is readily seen that the stream of force of a mass m in a cone of
angular opening w is equal to m.
    The energy of a magnetic mass with respect to a current is there
fore equal to the product of the intensity by the stream of force
emanating from that mass and passing through the circuit.         Let
us designate this stream of force by 0, and agree to consider it po
sitive when the forces enter the circuit through the negative surface
of the current — that is, through the negative side of the equivalent
magnetic plate ; the energy of the mass m will have for its expres
sion
                             Ivih)= —I<j>.
   Similarly, the energy with respect to a current of any magnetic
system whatever is equal to the sum of the energies of all the masses
— that is to say, to the product of the intensity of the current by
the total stream of force of the system which passes through the
circuit.   This energy diminishes when the system is left to the ac
tion of the current ; and for a slight displacement the work of the
electromagnetic forces is equal to +Id<j>.
   If the displacement is effected during the time dt and a liquid-
pile is employed, the energy derived from the chemical actions must
heat the circuit and furnish the electrodynamic work ld(j> corre
sponding to the increment d<p of the stream of force, which gives,
calling the electromotive force E and the total resistance E,

The intensity of the current is the same as if there existed in the
circuit a new electromotive force (induction) having the value
                        —ft                                       m
   The electromotive force of induction is therefore equal and of
contrary sign to the derivate with respect to the time from the
stream of force which emanates from the magnetic system and
passes through the circuit.     This expression, here deduced from the
principle of the conservation of energy, is equivalent to that which
Neumann obtained by starting from Lenz's law.
   We shall assume as a general rule that the electromotive force of
induction in a circuit is always expressed by equation (3) as a func
tion of the stream of force which passes through     it, whatever may
be the causes which make the forces vary, such as the displace
ment or modification of magnetic system, change of form, inten
                            a
sity, or position of an exterior current, deformation of the circuit
itself, or variation of the current already passing through it.

     Such a generalization can be justified in each particular case when
 it  is admitted that the effect produced by a change in the magnets
 and currents is equivalent to that which would be obtained by
 bringing from an infinite distance a magnet or current equal to the
 given variation.       The consideration of the streams of force only
 will appear especially legitimate if it be conceived that electric and
 magnetic actions are not really exerted at a distance, but are due
 to a modification of the intervening medium, characterized at every
 point by the direction and magnitude of the force.
    Let us first consider the effect of a current upon itself.        The
 stream of force which traverses the circuit, supposed invariable, is
 proportional to the intensity of the current, and can be represented
 by UX, the factor TJ designating the stream of force corresponding
 to the unit of current.      If the variation of the current be dl, the
 variation of the stream of force is JJdl, and the energy derived
 from the pile
    As long   as the current has not become       constant a part of the
energy of the pile is therefore employed to augment the term
                                                                     UP
called the potential energy of the current.     Suppose that there is in
the vicinity a second current, of intensity I', in a circuit of con
stant form.       The stream of force from the second current which
traverses the circuit of the first is proportional to the intensity ; it
may be represented by VI'.         The factor V denotes the stream of
force that emanates from either of the two circuits and traverses
the other when the two currents have the same intensity equal to
unity.      The product II'V is called the relative potential energy
                                                                        of
the two currents.
    When the product I'V, in consequence of a change of intensity
or a displacement, varies by d(TY), the energy derived from the
pile of the first current is Id(I'V).     Therefore, if the two modifica
tions are simultaneous and are produced during the time dt, we
have for the first circuit
                          -ELdt=VTUlt+d(^^+id(L'Y);                   (4)
and,   in like manner, for   the second,

By addition     we get

    This equation expresses that the energy furnished by the two
piles during the time dt is employed in heating the conductors, in
creasing the potential energy of each of the currents as well as their
relative potential energy, and, lastly, in furnishing the electro-
dynamic work corresponding to the relative displacement.          If the

form of the circuits be altered, the variation of the stream of force
emanating from one of the currents in the direction of the other is
comprised in the terms d(TY) and d(TV) ; and in order to value
the action of a circuit upon itself it suffices to regard the factor IT
as variable.      We thus find again the known equations of electro-
dynamic induction-currents.
     The same mode of reasoning permits us to take account of the
changes which have happened in exterior magnets, and of the mag
netization produced by currents on masses of soft iron. — Comptes

 EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES ON THE DECOMPOSITION OF SOME
     EXPLOSIVES IN A CLOSED VESSEL; COMPOSITION OF THE
     GASES FORMED.         BY MM. SARRAU AND VIEILLE.
     These researches were undertaken for the purpose of determin
 ing the conditions of the employment of gun-cotton in mines.
     Since the important improvements introduced by Mr. Abel into
 the manufacture of gun-cotton, this explosive is prepared in homo
 geneous masses of determined form and density, it is kept without
 danger in the wet state, and its explosive force, comparable with
 that of dynamite, is much greater than that of gun-powder ; con
 sequently its use in mines affords great advantages.          It presents,
 however, an inconvenience        in that its explosion produces mephitic
 gases injurious to the workmen in the galleries. In fact its decom
 position gives rise to the formation of carbonic oxide. This can be
 obviated by adding to the gun-cotton an oxidizer, such as a nitrate.
     In this memoir we make a comparative study of the products
 formed, the heat evolved, and the pressure developed by the ex
 plosion in a closed vessel, — 1st, of pure gun-cotton*; 2ndly, of a
  mixture of equal parts of gun-cotton and nitrate of potass ; 3rdly,
  of a mixture of 40 parts of gun-cotton and 60 of nitrate of am
 monia ; 4thly, of nitroglycerine ; and, 5thly, of ordinary mining-
  powder f- We exhibit today the results of our study of the gases
  formed during the explosion in a closed vessel.
      Some previous experiments having shown that the nature and
  the composition of the gases depend on the conditions of their
  production, and particularly on the pressure under which they are
  formed, we operated upon gases collected in a closed test-tube,
     * The composition, by weight, of gun-cotton, deduced from organic
  analysis, and verified by elementary analysis of the products of decompo
  sition, has led us to regard the products of the manufacture current at the
  Moulin-Blanc works as a mixture of 3 eq. of trinitrated and 1 eq. of bi-
  nitrated cellulose —

  measuring the maximum pressure in the tube. The volumetric
  analysis of the gaseous products was completed by the absolute
  measurement of the volume occupied, at 0° temperature and normal
 pressure, by the gases from a determined weight of explosive.
 These are the principal results obtained : —
     (1) Gun-cotton. — The composition and volume of the gases were
 determined under four conditions, differing by the mean density of
 the products. It follows from the numbers of experiment that,
 when the density augments, the proportion of carbonic oxide pro
 gressively diminishes, that of carbonic acid increasing.
     The following formulae, which very well represent the composi
 tion of the gases produced under the four conditions of our experi
 ments, show what is the law according to which the decomposition
 of the substance is modified by the pressure ; they correspond to
 the decomposition of 1 equivalent of gun-cotton (C^           N„ 084) :

 They indicate that, for increasing values of the density of loading,
 the carbonic oxide and carbonic acid tend to be produced in equal
 volumes, according to the formula
         C49 Ha Nu 084=24 CO+24C02+ 17H+ 11 N+ 12HO;
 and it may be assumed that this formula represents sensibly the
 mode of decomposition realized under ordinary conditions in prac
 tice, in which gun-cotton is generally used in very dense charges.
    (2) Gun-cotton mith Nitrate of Potass.
                                             — The analysis of the gases
 shows that the oxidation of the explosive is incomplete under low
densities of charge, although the proportion of the oxidant may be
considerably higher than that which theoretically corresponds to
complete combustion ; but at 0-3 arid higher densities carbonic oxide
disappears, and the decomposition of the mixture takes place regu
larly according to the formula

                                                   — The combustion ia
complete, even under low densities of charge.        The results of ana
lysis show that the reaction corresponds to the equation

the first member of which represents exactly the composition of the
mixture (deducting the humidity and the saline residue contained
in the gun-cotton) ; while the second member is established on the
supposition that the decomposition of the nitrate generates, in one
of the modes studied by M. Berthelot, oxygen, nitrogen, and water.
    (4) Nitroglycerine.
                          — According to a remark by M. Berthelot, the
composition of the products of an explosion can be foreseen when
the explosive contains sufficient oxygen to transform the elements

        SUMMARY OF THE LAWS WHICH GOVERN MATTER IN THE
                  SPHEROIDAL STATE.                 BY P.-H. BOUTIGNY.
      I. Temperature.     —  The     temperature          of bodies in the spheroidal
  state is always     below    that  of   their   ebullition     : it is +97° for water.
      II. Non-equilibrium of          Temperature.       —  The    substance in the sphe
  roidal   state  never   places    itself    in   equilibrium       of temperature with
  the vessel which contains it ; its temperature is always in a state
  of stable equilibrium, whether it be in a capsule with free access of
  air or in the muffle of a cupel furnace.                     But if the body in the
  spheroidal     state  does   not   place    itself   in  equilibrium      of temperature,
  the vapour emanating from it always does so. These two pheno
  mena are manifested very clearly when the operation is performed
  in a hollow sphere arranged ad hoc.
      III.  Reflection of Radiant
                                           Heat. — Matter in the spheroidal state
  reflects radiant heat.
      IV. Volume and Mass of the Spheroids. — The volumes of matter
  in the spheroidal state are in the inverse ratio of their density ;
  and their masses are equal among themselves.
      V. Repellent Force at a sensible Distance. — This law is the most
  important of all, the richest in deductions ; for we regard it as the
  antagonist of universal attraction.
      On the floor of the Pantheon, in the axis of the cupola, upon a
  good charcoal fire a large platinum capsule is placed, and its tem
  perature raised to the utmost possible.                   This being arranged, water
  is poured    down     from    the    top    of   the     Pantheon      (about 70 metres

water and the hail are sustained in the capsule                        by
                                                        the vapour which
envelops them          Certainly not
                        ?               they  are

ously     bythe repellent force to which the heat in the capsule gives
rise.
    Let us now operate with non-volatile bodies, which cannot be
 distilled, but are decomposed by heat.
    The capsule       heated as before, and small fragments of wax,
                        is
 tallow, stearic or margaric acid are then thrown into it, or else

                                                                  is               :
 As the molecular motions are not transmitted with very great velo
city, the body experimented on remains suspended over the capsule
without vapour and without gas proceeding from its decomposition                       ;
afterwards the gases resulting from its decomposition are liberated,
not from its surface, but from its interior       they take fire, and the

spheroid vanishes.
    The body under experiment not being volatile, giving off no
vapour, and the gases arising from its decomposition not being yet
produced, evidently the body can only be sustained beyond the radius
of the physico-chemical activity of the capsule by the repulsion of
the latter. — Comptes Rendus de I'Academie des Sciences, May         1880,    3,

   Before demonstrating this theorem, remark that           can be ap

ing the potential-levels of the conductors, and equation (1) changes
into the equation of Clausius.
   In order to prove the above equality, we start, as Clausius did,
from Green's well-known equation.       This equation employed for                     is
the space enclosed by the surface          and for the two functions
                                                            C;
occurring therein     take
                         I Y< and  33(, of which the first represents
the potential of all the layers with densities     and the second the        h,
potential  of  the layers  with densities    both                ft,
                                                   potentials taken in
points within C. We then have
     The operation
                             J?-
                                   is    the differentiation with respect to the nor
mal drawn within C. By successive applications of Green's theorem
to the spaces enclosed by all the surfaces, we get, after summation,
   Green's proposition      further applied to the space outside the
                                         is

the centre and radius were taken so that all the surfaces   lay within                      C
the sphere.   The potentials of the layers    and    in points outside h          ft
the surfaces    are represented respectively by Ya and 33„, and these
                     C
functions substituted in Green's equation. "We then find, in the
usual way,    the radius of the sphere be infinite,
                 if
                                   ^<U+25BC>-S^-stag**                                                     (3)
The operation                  is   the differentiation with respect to the normal
drawn outside of the surface C. The functions V,- and V„ in equa
tions (2) and (3) have of course the same value Y for the same
point of one of the surfaces    likewise the functions 93,- and
                                                 C ;               „,                                33

   The densities being h, let the potential of the layer on the sur
face C, in points within C, be represented by P,-, and. the potential
of the other layers by Ha ; then is
                             dV,
                                 =

and according to a known property -^A +              = — 4:reA, where   e
represents a constant.       Hence we find
                             dVi  ,dVa        . ,
                             -d^+dN=-4*£h>
and in precisely the same way
                             -dn-+dW—        ^
Therefore, by the summation of both members of equations (2) and
(3), we get
    Lastly,  I   remark that this general equation is to be regarded as
 an extension of a property given by Gauss. Let V represent the
 potential of a system of masses ml5 m2, &c. situated in the points
pl,p2, &c, and 33 the potential of masses m,, m2, Ac. in the points
 Pi' P2'     '• further, Y„ V2, &c. the values of V in the latter points,
 and 33j, 332, &c. the values of 35 in the points plt p2, &c. ; then,
according to Gauss,
                   Vlm1+Vsma      &c.=%1ml%im1+&c.
    This equation is identical, since both members represent aggre
 gates of the same combinations.        That the theorem still remains
 valid when first the masses m are spread out upon a surface C and
 afterwards the masses m upon the same surface, is not completely
 demonstrated by Gauss *, but " the way in which this extension of
 the theorem can be rigorously justified with respect to its principal
                   "
 moments only pointed out.
    In the foregoing this theorem is demonstrated for an arbitrary
 number of surfaces as a simple deduction from Green's equation. —
